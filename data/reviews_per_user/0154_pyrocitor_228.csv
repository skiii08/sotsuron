The Rock," Solid as its namesake
","When ex-military General Hummel (Ed Harris) takes 80 hostages at Alcatraz prison and threatens to kill the population of San Francisco with nerve gas if their ransom money is not delivered, the US government rushes into action. They deduce that the best way to sneak in undetected is a minimal attack force led by a high profile chemist (Nicholas Cage) and a wily convicted criminal, (Sean Connery) the only man to ever successfully escape from Alcatraz as an inmate.When a movie bears the name Michael Bay, we have now come to instantly associate that movie with ACTION. Fast moving, very thinly stretched plots, pounding rock music, tons of car chases and, of course, lots of explosions are sure to follow. But The Rock is, in my opinion, Bay's best film to this point (we'll see if this summer's The Island will surpass it) because it never attempts to be anything other than one it is - a Michael Bay action film. None of the disgustingly sappy American patriotism of Pearl Harbor, nor the offensive, borderline racism of the Bad Boys films is present here - just a good, solid action movie which never attempts to be anything more profound than entertaining.Sean Connery is perfectly cast as John Patrick Mason, the contemptuous criminal, enlisted to help save San Francisco by the government he despises so, and he fills the screen with his indomitable, natural charisma. Nicholas Cage gives a decent performance as the shy chemist who is finally called on to be a hero. (although he seems to have difficulty determining the difference between loud and dramatic in tense scenes) Contrary to most action movies, Cage's Dr. Stanley Goodspeed and Connery's Mason are actually given some basic character development: Goodspeed fearing throughout the whole movie, not only for his wife's safety, but for the fact that she is worrying about him regardless of if he succeeds or not, and Mason in a subplot involving his long lost daughter. Finally, Ed Harris is also a good casting call as the bitter general, demanding retribution for years of maltreatment during his military career. He is also given some decent character development - almost immediately, we find that despite his bitter attitude the General is a good man, not really intending to fire the nerve gas, and avoiding a body count at all possible occasions. David Morse also stands out as Hummel's intelligent and loyal second in command.So overall, The Rock is just your basic no-brainer action film, made better by the strong performances from the good cast, and Bay's steady directorial hand throughout. It's worth seeing, and doesn't even have a dimwitted enough plot to insult your intelligence! Just keep in mind that even though The Rock requires more conscious thought than the average action movie, it is still a Michael Bay movie... so prepare for explosions.-8/10",8,2,2,9 June 2005
The Lobster," I'm friends with the Lobster that's under my bed/get along with the voices inside of my head
","If there was such a genre as the (un)romantic comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster would be a prime example. Black as pitch, yet crackling with satire and quotable one-liners to spare, it's an unusual viewing experience to take in a film so enjoyable yet deceptively, unrelentingly bleak. The cleverly absurd premise is exceptionally funny, and even if it's somewhat disappointingly played in the subtle side (no major metamorphoses here, but keep your eyes peeled for stray creatures wandering through the background), it still leads to a crackling critique of societal coding singlehood as despicable, the expectations of heteronormativity, ideal pairings and compatibility in the 'tick box' pickiness of the post-online dating world, and, ultimately, how everyone's first true love is their own needs and desires far beyond anyone else's. Residents of this least sexy 'love shack' in cinematic history are forced to publicly declare their love in an eerie awards ceremony style presentation, and children are thrown into the mix as a means of mediating inevitable domestic disputes. Like I said: for a comedy purportedly about romantic union, don't expect redemptive romance at play here. That would ruin the fun. But hey – it's not like residents have no autonomy! If finding 'the one' under threat of being transmogrified into an animal isn't one's jam, there's always the alternative of escaping into the woods to join another grimly restrictive cult of asexual outlaws who are hunted by hotel inhabitants on a daily basis, and punish any hint of budding romance with grisly mutilation. There is no nonconformity - it is simply a matter of which horribly restrictive society and lifestyle is the best fit (there's a metaphor there as well...). No wonder all inhabitants of Lanthimos' world appear depressed and only capable of blunt literalism, but there are troves of chuckles, if not belly laughs, to be found amidst their melancholy perennial deadpan. It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye, though, but hardly a surprise that Lathimos' gloomy fairy tale would only buy into a happy ending kicking and screaming. Nonetheless, it's a bit of a shame that the film – already overlong through liberally leisurely pacing - drags in the second act, losing the satirical sparkle of its introduction as the film pulls the rug out from whatever embers of hope that were fanned. There are some real flinches in store too, as Lanthimos plays the gruesome card at full force (don't be surprised to find yourself avoiding steak knives for the rest of the day after). Thankfully, the mournfully bouncy soundtrack of classical compositions is spot-on, while Thimios Bakatakis' dolefully sterile cinematography perfectly captures the cheekily melancholy feel of the film as a whole. As such, it's left to the cast to find ripples of humanity in a script largely painting them as ideological chess pieces. In a perfect inversion of his pouty histrionics from In Bruges, Colin Farrell is exceptionally funny, his note-perfect deadpan and comedic timing conveying a surprising wealth of character and emotion through his Eeyore-like slump and moustache. Rachel Weisz is equally impressive, carefully avoiding (un)manic pixie dream girl stereotypes and stealing many of the laughs through her impressively crafted fiery personality carefully buttoned down, yet expressed through bursts of emphatically eccentric voice-over journal entries. Finally, the odd but fantastic comedic tag team of Ben Whishaw and John C. Reilly are reliably hilarious throughout, so much so that their absence in the second half of the film is largely what renders it so comparatively sluggish. Like many black comedies that ply for laughs in such awkward or morbid territory, The Lobster won't be to everyone's tastes. However, for those in tune with Lanthimos' unconventionally morose sensibilities, this blackest and bleakest of comedies could well provide a gourmet repast that just hits the spot. (now, what animal do I deserve to be transformed into for that despicable metaphor? Is it too late to cast my vote for swordfish – the only sea creature with its own built-in wea-pun?I'll see myself out) -8/10",8,18,38,10 October 2015
Black Swan," The compromises of art and audience
","Given that ballet is generally associated more with beauty, poise and heroism within the realm of cinema, it might seem an unconventional choice of subject matter for acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky's latest exploration of obsession and inner darkness. Which, naturally, makes it all the more fitting, as pitting the stereotypical associations of the art form against Aronofsky's chosen approach and body of with provides the film an undercurrent of the same sort of contrast and duality that permeates the film throughout, serving to illustrate a hideous underbelly to an art renowned for its flawless aesthetic perfection. Nonetheless, evident familiarities with Aronofsky's prior drama The Wrestler aside, it becomes quickly clear that Black Swan is an entirely different beast, defying such superficial attempts at categorization and emerging as a gruesomely effective synthesis of genre and influence. Ambiguities abound throughout, as even the film's seemingly simple framework (again suggesting a duality between protagonist Nina's early struggles to master the role of the Swan Queen and later losing track of the fabric of her reality) continuously defies expectations of causality and linearity. Even in the earlier, 'normal' scenes, there emerge off- kilter elements that appear so out of place with the film's composed, subtle feel, that the entire picture threatens to be derailed: 'overly obvious' moments of symbolism, eerily over the top secondary characters (particularly the guffawing guests at a prestigious gala event and an overzealously flirtatious restaurant waiter). These and more, coupled with the nauseating dirge of Clint Mansell's score, threaten to leave the audience with the interpretation of a more simplistic, simple psychological thriller. Nonetheless, such a simplistic dismissal would deny the picture its fascinating subtlety and sophistication, as all of its horror 'money shots' (an array of skin peeling and bodily metamorphosis impressive enough to disgust even Cronenberg enthusiasts) and moments of jarring strangeness prove merely trappings to the all the more disturbing psychological reality that easily extrapolates upon and deepens an age old 'art requires destructive sacrifices' message. With a pace that feels simultaneously uncomfortably slow and unnervingly propulsive and cameras continually creeping up from behind, Aronofsky retains a continual sense of uneasy voyeurism, as if every scene is an illicit and ill-advised bout of eavesdropping on a woman whose life is steadily crumbling, clawing forward yet scrabbling to pick up the pieces from behind. The feel of perpetual fraying proves repulsive yet magnetic, so that even when the film delves into the grotesque, the viewer, so entrapped by noxious fatalism, proves riveted. Nonetheless, while the tension between the overt and the subtle provides the film with the same sort of perverse power and grace associated with ballet, it can become a touch excessive at times, with some of the more non-sequitar horrific touches and maudlin moments feeling a little too disconnected even for Aronofsky's fragmentary feel. To boot, the film must threaten to top charts of the highest quantities of least appealing sexual scenes filmed, nor are simple things such as fingernails and stage lights ever liable to be trusted again by audiences after having watched the film. Most poignantly, for all of its grandeur and intimacy, Black Swan leaves the viewer with a continuous sense of mild yearning, as if merely flirting with the psychologically warping masterpiece lurking within even when at its considerable best. Like the Black Swan itself, Aronofsky's film feels ever so slightly contained, be it by the expectations of genre, audiences or award parameters (despite its precise tailoring inevitably wooing all of the above), never fully spreading its murky wings to attain the sort of uninhibited, heated artistic passion that Nina doggedly strives for. Nonetheless, to say Natalie Portman gives a career defining performance as Nina would be perfectly appropriate, as Portman appears to allow herself to blossom and wither within the role. With consummate control, Portman strings Nina along a continuous razor's edge of tension and focus, eerie enough to begin with, making her subsequent transition all the more horrifying yet gruesomely liberating. Her performance is in itself a masterpiece, and, like Nina, proves worthy of any critical attention extended in her direction. The casting of Mila Kunis feels entirely out of place, yet, consciously, all the more brilliantly appropriate, as her louder than life, flamboyantly unrestrained performance provides a perfect counterpoint to the brittle Nina, and in many ways Kunis' sly, calculating eyes deliver a performance nearly as impressive. Vincent Cassel feels somewhat overly obvious as the ballet director not above using sexuality to extract proper emotion, but, despite being plagued with many of the script's weaker moments of thematic exposition, Cassel delivers an entirely satisfactory, lived-in sensual confidence. Barbara Hershey packs a grimly horrific punch as Nina's disturbingly controlling mother, and Hershey is wise enough to play up her part while refraining from becoming over the top, her perpetually shadowed furrowed brow yet broad smile serving as both a chilling retread of the 'evil, repressive mother' stereotype and perpetual question of Nina's mental state throughout. Equally, Winona Ryder's uncomfortable scene chewing as the company's former star, pouting to a near adolescent extent, further provides a streak of stylized excess which further serves to question the veracity of the realism of each character's depictions throughout. Disturbing, lingering, and assembled with the utmost precision and care, Aronosky's Black Swan proves a fascinating exploration into the grotesqueness of art and its fixation with perfection. That said, ironically, as if serving to illustrate the difficulties of melding an art- film approach with a mainstream oriented film, there does remain a faint but unshakable sense of lacking, as if Aronofsky could have pushed his film slightly further to the impeccable honing of 'perfection'. Whether this shortcoming was ultimately intended to emerge as the film's most self-reflexive thematic message about the compromises of art is up for debate, but if nothing else, Aronofsky's film provides the perfect fodder for nightmares, where the truly uncompromisingly horrifying Black Swan might freely take flight.-8.5/10",9,3,6,26 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Stranger tides? Nay – still waters.
","There is a beautiful irony in the newest installment in Disney's ongoing plundering of the seas of box offices worldwide being titled On Stranger Tides, as there is virtually nothing in any way strange about it. Indeed, it is worth noting that the working title was Pirates of the Caribbean: The Fountain of Youth, as the entire film carries such a sense of borderline- irritating straightforwardness and linearity. Hawked as an antidote to the labyrinthine narratives of the second and third installments by providing a stripped down narrative with more focus on story and characters, the only promise that On Stranger Tides makes good on is that of being stripped down. Despite having jettisoned many of the franchise's ever growing cast of familiar faces and subplots and clearing room to start anew, the latest Pirates escapade unfortunately comes across as lukewarm and benignly pleasant rather than any sort of infectiously fun adventure on the high seas like its predecessors. As if mortified at the prospect of confusing audiences once again, the film proves frustratingly content to play it safe throughout. There are certainly no 'rocks into crabs afterlife hallucination' sequences to be found here, but nor is there a surplus of jaw-dropping set pieces or scenes of visual majesty designed to deliver the sort of escapist spectacle the genre was designed for, lending credence to the purported budgetary restraints. In fact, only a chillingly tense mermaid attack midway through the film stands out amidst a slew of half- baked chases, brief swordfights and other such near successes (the living ship rigging of Blackbeard's vessel, while a decently interesting conceit, still pales in comparison with the sight of Bill Nighy's face covered in wriggling, independently moving tentacles as Davy Jones), all coupled with the spirited droning of what is surely Hans Zimmer's most uninspired musical score to date. New director Rob Marshall, more renowned for overseeing musical dance numbers than swashbuckling, continually scrabbles for predecessor Gore Verbinski's joyful fusion of dark- tinged but overall lighthearted adventure, yet his film feels perpetually neutered. There is a continuous sense of the plot being driven by familiar tropes (double-cross leads to skirmish leads to witty banter leads to Sparrow buffoonery and repeat) more than any overriding notions of character or narrative development, while the film functions to namecheck an appropriate medley of iconic components without doing any of them justice (it is hard to imagine a more boring take on the high concept of zombie pirates). One could speculate that loosely adapting the story from Tim Powers' fantasy novel proved a hindrance to innovative plotting in the film, yet the sense remains that the film would have felt equally stilted and forced no matter what central story. That said, there are dashes of amusement to be found even for more skeptical viewers. The film's daringly cartoonish portrayal of the sparring political powers of the time (both Richard Griffith's nearly drooling, uncomfortably scene-chomping English King George and the comically robotic Spanish) can't help but suggest some sort of ambiguous contemporary political satire of childishly warring over desirable goods. Nonetheless, any such hinted subversion is easily overridden by the mawkishness of a forced missionary/mermaid romantic subplot that comes across as nauseatingly traditionalist and a final act riddled with unrealistic character motivations and actions. It's enough that by the climax, rather than pining for a plot that made sense, the viewer is left pining for a plot with any spark of enthusiasm or intrigue intact. It feels almost redundant to say that Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow saves the day, but there is no question that his eccentric yet uncanny blundering remains simply a joy to watch, even if the woeful writing leaves his character awkwardly poised between driving the plot along with unconventional lucidity and haphazardly tossing off one-liners more often than not. Fellow franchise veteran Geoffrey Rush equally struggles against the script but manages to infuse Captain Barbossa with his standard roguish twinkle, extracting welcome comedic mileage out of a recently acquired peg leg. Penélope Cruz is less fortunate in attempting to combat the shoddy writing of her femme fatale character (even her murky past with Sparrow feels irritatingly inconsistent), and Cruz is given little more to do than sulk, rather than offer her characteristic sultry charisma. Similarly, Ian McShane's take on legendary pirate Blackbeard feels entirely mishandled, consistently contradicting the character's peerlessly evil reputation by coming across as oddly vulnerable, sympathetic or simply bland, with McShane given no chance to let loose any trademark snarls or villainous scene-chewing whatsoever. In the same vein, Keith Richards' reprised cameo, apart from one priceless wisecrack ('Does this face look like it's been to the fountain of youth?'), feels particularly pointless, though an unexpected Judi Dench cameo is far more fun, and definitely worth keeping eyes peeled for.While it would be false to say there is no pleasure to be extracted from the old Pirates formula being dusted off and rehashed, but the film carries such a sense of willful mediocrity to it throughout that it is hard to ever properly buy into the fun. Indeed, On Stranger Tides does function as a pleasant enough temporary distraction, but any further longevity to the franchise would require a substantial return to the energy and inventiveness of the earlier films, and soon. Forget stripped down, this pirate ship needs fleshing out something fierce. -5/10",5,1,2,25 May 2011
Scarface," The World is Yours
","In Scarface, director Brian De Palma's explosive portrait of a Cuban immigrant turned drug lord, 1983 audiences were treated to an unexpected change of viewpoints. The focus of this near 3 hour film was detailing the rise and fall of a drug dealer - who wasn't portrayed in a strictly negative fashion. Although common in films today to have an antagonistic figure as the protagonist, it must have been truly shocking for it's time - that we as an audience are expected to, at parts sympathize with or even feel sorry for a man of said profession. And although certain aspects of the movie have admittably dated (the early hip hop soundtrack in particular screams of the 80s, but as a whole this doesn't detract from the mood of the film as much as is often complained) the simple storyline of uncontrollable greed and ambition and their consequences is still as easily recognizable and identifiable as it was when first released. But Scarface isn't one of those controversial movies which only become famous due to their controversial nature - it is a truly compelling portrait of a man who went from having nothing to having virtually everything he ever desired, fueled only by his relentless ambition. And though the film does toe the line of running too long to the point of getting tedious, it remains entertaining enough despite its predictable and not terribly original storyline. This is mainly due to the casting of Al Pacino in this iconic, career defining role. Pacino brings Tony Montana to life in a way no other actor ever could have, and easily elevates the film to its classic status. He is present in almost every scene, and his fiery intensity keeps the film captivating for every second he is on screen.And although this really is Pacino's movie, he is ably backed by a strong supporting cast. Steven Bauer is charming and easily likable as Manny, Montana's only true friend during his rise to power. Michelle Pfeiffer is stunningly beautiful and tremendously effective as Montana's trophy wife with no real life of her own. Her performance has been criticized as being dull, but she is ultimately playing a dull character, and is therefore only playing the part. (she also comes very much alive near the end, during frustrated fights with Montana) Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also turns out a strong performance as Montana's rebellious younger sister. Robert Loggia plays the character of the now ridiculously stereotypical drug lord well, if not in a particularly original fashion. And F. Murray Abraham comes off as wonderfully dislikable as Montana's distrusting rival during his rise to power. Scarface may not come across as quite as intense and controversial as it did back in 1983, but the power of its storyline still holds true today. It's true that De Palma certainly didn't skimp on the blood or swearing, and the subject matter of Montana's profession is never held back from the audience, but it is ultimately Pacino who brings the film to life, and makes it so incredibly watchable, even today. It is really his movie, and his fiery intensity guarantees that even when pushing three hours, Scarface never fails to be interesting. -9/10",9,0,1,5 February 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Straightforward Hulk finally smashes
","When acclaimed director Ang Lee's cerebral take on comic book antihero the Hulk hit screens in 2003, the reaction was hardly a positive one. Fans of the comic books fumed over the script straying from its source material, whereas critics and audiences alike mused over the effectiveness of the philosophical ruminations in lieu of crowd pleasing action sequences. All of the above criticisms appear to have been taken by Marvel Studios (now producing their own franchises) in stride, revamping and continuing the green behemoth's tale with a more enjoyable, action packed focus and a quality cast. And while The Incredible Hulk may not quite live up to the no holds barred action epic its premise promised, it proves a satisfyingly bombastic smackdown to appease both fans of the comics and audiences alike. The inherent imbalance in the script lends credulity to rumours of creative disputes between Edward Norton's influence and that of the studio. While opening sequences detailing Banner's fugitive life in Brazil prove breathless, tense and tremendously gripping, taking more than a few notes from the Bourne series, upon returning to the United States, the promising start lags, as continual run ins with the military become increasingly repetitive and unoriginal, with the raucous fun of the periodic Hulk battles now saddled with a flimsy romantic subplot, entirely failing to compliment the intrigue. Here the script begins to falter, tripping over itself during certain crucial emotional moments with contrived lines and confusingly stilted character motivations, while the sidelining of certain characters initially presented as major players (most noticeably Ty Burell's Doc Sampson) reeks of hasty last minute cuts. By the film's obligatory big loud climax, it becomes clear that the creative reigns have shifted - all the prior gritty realism has vanished, replaced with a more conventional and less enjoyable action finish. As the occasional throwaway comic moments (some more effective than others) prevent the film from descending in the realm of melodramatic self importance, the film's primary redeeming factor emerges - despite the steady descent into excess stupidity, it is never afraid to have some fun, the quality Ang Lee's incarnation sorely lacked. Of course, the primary draw for superhero blockbusters is seldom the screen writing, and Transporter director Louis Leterrier's unapologetic 'smash first talk later' approach does generate some exhilarating action sequences, but the increasingly unimaginative fight choreography and relative sparsity of action setpieces for an action focused film detracts from the glorious destruction that could have been, the attempted juxtaposition of emotional intensity only slowing the gleeful mayhem. Thankfully, after the paltry CGI in Ang Lee's effort, special effects have been amped up to make this new, grittier Hulk about as close to feasibly photo real as one could hope for, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Norton himself, though certain fluctuating details (the Hulk appears smaller or less muscular at various points) give the impression of patchy continuity, and the movement of both Hulk and monstrous adversary The Abomination appears too mechanically humanoid to properly capture the otherworldly feel of gargantuan muscular mutations - nonetheless, an impressive and exhilarating effort overall. Despite the laudable use of quality actors over conventional blockbuster stars, even the astutely talented performers prove they can only do so much with such a steadily flimsy script. Edward Norton of course proves the exception, his passion for the project and standard blistering intensity making tortured protagonist Bruce Banner a truly fleshed out and tragic character. Burning with nobility and pathos, his plight genuinely moving and his battle with the monster raging inside of him truly gripping, Norton truly convinces in the crucial role. In contrast, Liv Tyler is saddled with an embarrassing nothing of a role, exemplifying the worst aspects of comic book love interests, with nothing to do but scream the hero's name and stand around statuesquely looking worried - it is a shame to see such a normally talented actress descend to such banality. Tim Roth similarly suffers, infusing tragically two-dimensional antagonist Emil Blonsky with all the steely menace and petty arrogance and ambition he can muster, but his quality is still diminished by the overwhelming predictability of his role. William Hurt is appropriately grim as obsessive general 'Thunderbolt' Ross, thankfully eschewing the scene chomping which could have resulted all too easily, and Tim Blake Nelson delivers a bout of much needed irreverent goofiness as overeager scientist Samuel Sterns, his brief but enjoyable role hinting at a larger character progression in any ensuing films. Finally, the film's slew of enjoyable cameos do not disappoint, from comical Stan Lee and Lou Ferringo appearances to the highly anticipated Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man lead Tony Stark, a fitting and classy way of bridging the gap between superhero franchises as well as planting further seeds for the upcoming Avengers film. While the film may disappointingly fall short of its true potential, comic book fans can breathe a hearty sigh of relief that the green behemoth has been firmly returned to his less philosophical and more action filled roots. If nothing else, Leterrier's more singular vision is laudable, never losing track of its true intent: even during the fumbling between dramatic clout and exhilarating action, the film never fails to entertain. While the superb cast may flounder with underwritten characters, Norton's incendiary lead performance and the enthusiastic action sequences make The Incredible Hulk a solid edition into the realm of guilt-free summer entertainment - despite the criticisms, Hulk finally smashes. -7/10",7,5,9,17 June 2008
Antz," The 'Ant' is for 'Anti-authoritarian,' but the 'Z' is for 'Zippy'
","History will regard it as the film that famously butted mandibles with Disney's A Bug's Life for monopoly over the anthropomorphized bug market in 1998. And yes, Antz is fundamentally a product of its time - if not for its hip, 90s misspelling, then for the reason that no one would ever let Woody Allen within a hundred miles of a kids film again. Still, he's able to meld his neurotic, intellectual schlub persona well into this clever little tale. Antz may not be as heartwarming or beautiful as many of the decade's classics, but, appropriate for a film championing the snarky underdog, it's still easily fun and provocative enough to entertain and stand out, even against its insectoid competition. Fittingly for a film sparring with Disney, Antz sneaks in subversive themes of individualism and Marxist anti-authoritarian revolt into a children's animation. But this script is far too snappy to ever get bogged down in misguided dogmatism, pumping out sly gag after gag to keep parents and kids alike engaged (if 'the war on termites' isn't enough to win you over, try Dan Aykroyd's wasp's drolly pontificating on 'Eurotrash'). Directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson churn out a hugely fun adventure romp, which bustles along at a perfectly bouncy pace, pulling thunderous momentum from Harry Gregson-Williams' tremendous score. The deceptively detailed animation still holds up (check out how much Colonel Cutter's gaunt facial curvature looks like Christopher Walken), especially when playing with size perspective in the world above ground, turning a ride on the underside of a human's shoe into the most blood- curdling roller-coaster imaginable.Still, if the high percentage of Woody Allen jokes wasn't already enough to tip the scales in favour of a slightly older audience ('I have something against drinking from the anus of another creature'), the intense content is sure to set off all but the hardiest young viewers. Not only do we watch Sylvester Stallone's cocky worker ant get beaten in an interrogation sequence - there's also the nightmarish termite massacre will. A flurry of stabbing and decapitation against the acid-spewing, behemoth enemies, it's a magnificent sci-fi battle for adults, but easily one of the most horrifying sequences ever to make its way into a kids movie.Antz also marks one of the first animated features to play off celebrity voice casting, which unquestionably works in its favour. Apart from quality comedic work from Allen and Stallone playing off their established personas with gleeful aplomb, having a supporting cast chock full of actors like Jennifer Lopez, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Dan Aykroyd and Christopher Walken helps lend texture to otherwise largely thankless secondary roles. Gene Hackman's ferocious growl makes for a perfect adversary as disturbingly militaristic Mandible, and Sharon Stone's effete drawl butts heads perfectly with Allen's neurotic bluster, keeping their road trip pseudo-romance entertaining throughout. Even if only regarded as A Bug's Life's sparky, snarky cousin, Antz is uniquely daring enough children's fare to stand the test of time. The humour still bristles, the adventure whips along, and there are enough sentimental grace notes amongst the film's self-assured, intellectual snark to ensure that adults and (slightly older) kids are enjoyably engaged throughout. And hey - how long have you been yearning for your average flick to contain the phrase 'Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor?' Yeah, I thought so.-8/10",8,1,1,21 April 2016
Mission: Impossible III," All an action movie should be
","Mission Impossible 3With each movie in a series attempting to up the bar of the first two, it wouldn't have been easy to get the idea of Mission: Impossible 3 being a disappointment. After all, it would be hard to top either the intrigue and suspense of the first film, or the heart-pounding, back to basics action sequences of the second, especially with a first time director at the helm. However, J.J. Abrams, creator of such TV shows 'Alias' and 'Lost' turns out to know what he's doing a lot more than one might give him credit for, creating in the end a very solid and wonderfully enjoyable action flick. In terms of action sequences, M:I3 definitely ups the ante over the first two, even the second's motorcycle chase and martial arts fight to the finish at the end. Safe to say if you go into the movie expecting to see things blown up, you will get more than your money's worth. But M:I3 also returns more to the twisty, breathlessly suspenseful of Brian De Palma's original, with a fair amount of plot twists ahoy. They may not ever be totally unexpected, but safe to say even moviegoers more experienced with this sort of 'twist a minute' genre may find a couple of genuine surprises in store. There is definitely a sufficient plot to justify all of the very satisfying action sequences, and the filmmakers are blessed with a substantially better script this time round, providing us with actual character development and finally a bit of genuine motivation for Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, who even seems less like a paper thin carbon copy of James Bond this time around, though the similarities are still inescapable, and rest assured that no matter how much the quality of the M:I films increases, Hunt will still never reach 007 status. There is also the plus of the focus of the film being less the Tom Cruise action hour, and giving more space for a wonderful supporting cast, reviving the team feel of the beginning of the first movie... more the intent of the IMF organization rather than solo missions all the time. A high point is Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames) and Hunt having a rapid-fire discussion about marriage and relationships during a furious raid of the vatican, with occasional comic input from fellow team member Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers).Cruise does what he does best again here, but at this point despite how all other aspects of the franchise have increased, Cruise himself doesn't really seem to be quite as at ease as in past films, and we start to lose interest in his character, despite the very appreciated character development. It's more in the wonderful supporting cast that the true performance joy emerges. M:I3 seems to have served the function of, if nothing else, showcasing a new generation of very talented and capable, and, to this point, mostly unrecognizable actors and actresses, who, if there is any justice, should make it big in the industry any day now. Keep your eye on Jonathan Rhys Meyers, (who also impressed in this year's Match Point) Keri Russel, and personal favorite, Michelle Monaghan, as Cruise's fiancée, who also gave a hilarious turn in this year's excellent, but very overlooked film 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', who all gave wonderful and very enjoyable performances. Billy Crudup and Lawrence Fishburne also give great performances as Hunt's superiors, and British actor Simon Pegg just about walks away with the movie, showing his effortless comedic talents as Hunt's tech savvy associate. It is of course great to see Ving Rhames return once again as Hunt's close friend and co-agent Luther Stickel. And then there's Philip Seymour Hoffman, who, as would be anticipated, effortless steals the film away without question from all his fellow actors. Hoffman shows how very talented an actor he is by following up his Oscar winning turn in Capote as a truly chilling and evil to the bone villain. Here is an antagonistic figure who we genuinely love to hate, and Hoffman works his far too short screen time to full effect - one of the most powerful screen villains in recent history. All in all, M:I3 should be considered worth watching: very frequent, and incredibly satisfying action setpieces masked by an actually decent storyline, and some genuine quality acting. It may not be anything too memorable, there is definitely a sense of fishing for the original (Hunt attacks yet another corporation building from above and such...) and you're not likely to take anything too profound out of it , but for a highly enjoyable night out at the movies, you need look no further.-8/10",8,1,2,20 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Snatch meets the Usual Suspects - and what a great result!
","Don't be thrown off by the terrible title and tagline - Lucky Number Slevin is much less gratuitous action movie and much more of a clever thinking than it wants to let on. The latest installment in the 'Usual Suspects syndrome' of thrillers, Slevin subscribes to the 'plot twist every thirty seconds' theory in order to keep its audience guessing. As such, we spend most of the film continually left in the dark, but rest assured that it (mostly)all comes together and makes sense in the end. The script, penned by screenwriter Jason Smilovic, makes it very clear that it is trying hard to be incessantly clever - and it actually succeeds for the most part, blending a dark humour (having warring mob bosses have their headquarters across the street from one another) with the suspense, action and continual audience confusion, as Slevin has to make his way out of more and more perplexing situations and constant cases of mistaken identity. Director Paul McGuigan indeed seems to have taken quite a bit of influence from such films as Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, early Tarantino movies and of course, Brian Singer's classic thriller The Usual Suspects, but it comes together as a savory, well made and very clever film. The wonderful cast are what take the given material, and take it from very good to excellent. Josh Hartnett gives a satisfying performance in the lead as the constantly hassled Slevin. But it's the supporting cast which really bring the film to life, with wonderful and often hilarious performances. Bruce Willis is a strong and mysterious presence as infamous assassin Goodkat, and although it may seem that each of his appearances seems to make less sense than the last time his purpose finally is revealed. Lucy Liu is adorable, bubbly and very funny, finally a love interest who actually captures our interests and never comes across as clichéd or pointless. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley supply class aplenty to the film, and of course both give excellent performances as would be expected. Stanley Tucci is also a wonderful addition to the film as determined detective Brikowski. Overall, Slevin is actually one of the most interesting and entertaining films of this year so far - suspenseful, cryptic, often very funny, and oh so clever. Be warned that director Paul McGuigan certainly doesn't skimp on the blood and violence, especially right at the film's opening, as if to catch our attention with a bang. But the script and concept are very intelligently done, even if they do occasionally stumble on drawing the line between clever and just plain confusing. Despite this, Slevin is a wonderful and very entertaining movie, one definitely worth seeing!-8/10",8,17,39,7 May 2006
Your Name.," Hold onto that feeling
","Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Just a city boy... No, wait. Hear me out. Granted, it's initially hard to sell Your Name - a meet cute anime twist on Freaky Friday - as a worthwhile recipient of its considerable, well-deserved hype, rather than a big screen, big budget rendition of Fruits Basket. But the hype is real. Inauspicious or not, writer/director Makoto Shinkai's film is somewhat of a genre-bending game changer - a film so special that the struggle to properly do justice to it leaves me resorting to inelegantly cherrypicking from a slew of contemporary allusions (the elegant loneliness of Murakami; the mischievous whimsy of Wong-Kar Wai; an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interwoven with The Breakfast Club with the most imperceptible pinch of your average buddy cop comedy comedy for spice), while it is still far more than the sum of their parts. In short, it's one of the most unexpected, simple but profound, entrancing, and poetically beautiful films to cross screens in years. It's as fun as it is melancholy, as unforgettable as it is sweetly unassuming. Even better - it's that rare anime where comparisons to Studio Ghibli aren't simply lip service, but actually warranted in terms of exquisite, painstaking heart and attention to detail. Yes, really. But such lofty praise is actually far from the spirit of a film that goes about its remarkable business with a cheeky subtlety. Shinkai wisely plays off the initial silliness of his concept, with the early body swap sequences staying rooted in lighter, bawdier humour, playfully portrayed with a springy, sassy wit keeping even the broadest moments no less human and adorable for their broadness. The conceit itself is kept indifferently vague, apart from the haziest of nods to traditional spirituality - it's not the 'how' that matters here anywhere near as much as the 'what.' Similarly, there's a clearly delineated dichotomy between the two protagonists' 'tradition vs. modernity' milieus (with larger, extrapolating themes of supplanting history and cultural longing spanning generations to be teased out by those keen enough), but Shinkai is content to let the contrast sit, rather than milking it for shoehorned theme, or garish social commentary. More than anything, the film captures that ethereal but omnipresent sense of vague dissatisfaction, longing, and persistent but directionless striving that is bound to feel almost achingly familiar to any given audience member, regardless of age, nationality, or standing in life. Shinkai takes a distressingly familiar sense of ennui, and infuses it with a melancholy grace, a feeling accentuated hugely by the film's simply gorgeous, sweeping artwork, infusing panoramas of mountain-dwarfed Japanese countrysides and bustling Tokyo skyscrapers with an unbelievable level of composition and care. When the film glissandos into a third-act twist that is as devastating as it is unpredictable for all but the most eagle-eyed of viewers, it transcends into a piece of larger-than-life folklore, conjuring an almost feverishly heightened viewership that redefines magnetic, before culminating with a quiet grace note that ties up the emotional knot in ways both elegiac and unforgettably uplifting. It may sound like a perennial squall of emotional peaks and valleys, but Shinkai surfs it with nonchalant poise, with his rock-steady pacing lending the film an almost uncanny gestalt. Upon the arrival of the closing credits, don't be surprised to hear a wet gasp, equal parts tearful and jubilant, erupting from your throat, unsolicited. You won't be alone in doing so. If there are any imperceptible faults to be found, it's that Shinkai's perhaps inevitable leaning on anime tropes do, at times, dip the film into conventions it would normally nimbly leap over. The occasional conflict-expanding plot device or bombastic musical interlude, particularly in gearing up for the film's climax, strain convention in ways that are only startling in their inconsistency with the film's customary elegance, while lead actors Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryûnosuke Kamiki, while both lending credibly commanding voices, are as hyperbolic as they come in their grunts, gasps, and other verbalizations reacting to their bizarre circumstances. Still, these are the faintest blemishes on the face of a truly beautiful, touching film, that truly demonstrates that the affective potential of traditional animation still has many wrinkles of uncanny power yet to unfurl. So do yourself a favour: believe the hype. Invest in Your Name. If you have any space amidst the ensuing deluge of feelings, you may just thank yourself you did. -9.5/10",9,12,17,29 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'I have a bad feeling about this'
","One of the most hysterically apt moments in Edgar Wright's brilliant Spaced goes as such: Simon's Pegg's character grimly utters 'I've been working through some stuff.' Cut to Pegg, silhouetted by a flickering fire, into which he's just thrown all of his Star Wars memorabilia, with mournful John Williams playing in the background. 'The Phantom Menace was a year ago!' exclaims Pegg's roommate. 'Eighteen months!' he croaks. 'And it still hurts.' This, ladies and gentlemen, Sith and Padawan, is how most people remember George Lucas' ill-advised return to a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and his succumbing to the careless indulgences of the Dark Side. Okay - but, to be fair, Lucas has been unapologetic about gearing his new trilogy firmly towards a new audience of younglings, rather than those old enough who crossed the galaxy with Luke, Han, and Leia in their own starry-eyed youth. Fine. Okay. Which, naturally, explains why Episode I charts the rise of the fearsome Empire we've already seen ravage the galaxy through federation disputes about trade embargoes and senatorial hearings. Not that you can fault Lucas for supplanting his sci-fi with sociopolitical subtext, but his writing - wooden, but endearingly so in '77 - has only eroded through the years, and simply isn't up to the challenge. So, the ongoing scenes of half-baked political murmurings too boring for kids and adults alike are counterbalanced with an inexcusable deluge of unbearable slapstick and excruciating racist alien stereotypes (mesa not sawwy, Jar Jar) that would have felt agonizingly antiquated during the first round of Star Wars. Yikes. The upside? The Phantom Menace is still Star Wars, and even lazy, undercooked Star Wars, sometimes infuriatingly so, is still shamefully watchable, caveats and all. Lucas' pacing and story may be shoddy, stumbling from thinly strung together plot points with none of the breathlessly efficient urgency of A New Hope, but he's cunning about knowing how to poke the nostalgia buttons when needed. There's an insuppressible glee that comes from getting to say hello again to the most familiar of faces - Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt, or hearing the phrase 'Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet Anakin Skywalker' - no matter how forced their inclusions. Episode I also benefits from Lucas' attention to world-building, with many visual panoramas dazzling here before his love affair with CGI led to the cluttered visual noise of Episodes II and III. It's also fun as a creature feature caper, and the underwater world of the Gungans and subsequent aquatic behemoth chase are still stellar entertainment, as is the infamous pod racing sequence (even though, yes, it's stupidly motivated, and too drawn out, caveat caveat). And yes, neutering the mystical, open-to-interpretation spirituality of the Force with the buzzkill of midi-chlorians is, in the words of (sigh) Jar Jar Binks, 'How wude!' - but even this isn't as theologically lugubrious (a word I had to seek out to properly do justice to this odious instance) as Anakin's 'immaculate Force conception'. Yeah. Forgot about that garbage, didn't ya.But let's face it: you'd sit through hours of childhood-bastardizing muck if the reward was lightsabers. And they. Are still. SO COOL. In fact, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan effortlessly deflecting blaster shots back to the shooters is so awesome that even Lucas can't get enough of it, pitting the Jedi against swathes of useless, irritating droids, and incepting the consequence-and-largely-thrill-free 'CGI blob' fights that would grow to increasingly infect the next decade of blockbuster cinema like a sickness. But come on - Dual of the Fates? Indisputably one of the best sword fights of any kind in movie history, right down to the interlude of Qui-Gon meditating behind a force field wall midway through. But if there's one single 'Chosen One' to rescue Episode I from purgatory, it's John Williams. Unscathed by the creative compromises surrounding him, and abetted by the phenomenal whirrs and bleeps of Ben Burtt's unmatched sound design, Williams delivers 300%, crafting some of his best musical movie magic here. If the film feels at all like Star Wars, you have Williams to thank, not Lucas. That said, we are given two of the franchise's most abiding characters here in Qui- Gon Jin (Liam Neeson's twinkly-eyed gravitas is a perfect fit for the franchise) and Darth Maul (the stunningly agile, sinister Ray Park). So, naturally, Lucas kills them both off, to make more room for Jake Lloyd, one of the most detestably monotone, whiny child actors of all time who is supplanted by one of the most detestably monotone, whiny adult actors of all time in II and III. Thankfully, Ewan McGregor gives his most charismatic Alec Guinness impression, battling gamely with Lucas' atrocious dialogue and tendency to bench Obi-Wan for long stretches of film, and Natalie Portman's Amidala is delightfully plucky here (and don't forget to play 'spot the Keira Knightley when they're in makeup!), before being wasted in an embarrassing, mopey Twilight subplot in the following two. Ian McDiarmid lurks and sleazes delightfully as the least secret Sith lord ever, and Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu and Frank Oz's Yoda are both classy fun, despite having little to do but curmudgeonly fret over all the paths to the Dark Side (hint: there's many, and they contradict).Yes, even decades away from fans wanting to toss Lucas into a Sarlacc pit, The Phantom Menace is still largely a clumsy, offensive misfire, with just enough glimmers of Star Wars magic to help it squeak by as passable. But there's always a bigger fish. And facing up to the surly, grotesquely melodramatic, CGI-drenched II and III? Well, what was that bit about fear, anger, hate, and suffering again? -5.5/10",6,0,2,7 April 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," Best twist yet? That a sneaky franchise-grab should be so concussively good (man)
","There's been a lot already said about 10 Cloverfield Lane, most to the effect of 'It came out of nowhere!' and 'Whatever you do, don't spoil this movie!' Yes, it did, and okay, fine - I won't. In the age of rampant spoilers, moviegoers could use more mystery in their lives (though the 'Cloverfield' tag is enough of a hint already). And 'mystery' is an appropriate word in more ways than one for the 'blood relative' of the 2008 found footage smash-up (thankfully, all the shaky-cam has bled out since). But, spoilers aside (I promised!), the real twist: the franchise-hungry title retrofit of the film formerly known as 'The Cellar' and 'Valencia' will lure in audiences coming for giant monster pyrotechnics, only to subject them to a lean, agonizingly tense, old-fashioned psychological thriller. It's unexpected, stripped-down, and rests firmly on the strength of its performers and writing. And it's far more satisfying and memorable than any monster mayhem it may or may not contain (teehee).Cloverfield The First was an entirely sensorial experience, groundbreaking for immersing its audience into the fray of a monsterpocalypse. 10 Cloverfield Lane is even more claustrophobic, both due to its apocalyptic bunker setting, but also how much debut director Dan Trachtenberg can wring out of it. We're trapped, not in a sci-fi horror flick, but in a vintage mystery thriller - more 'whatdunnit' than 'whodunnit', or perhaps 'whatdidhedo', as the film rations out tidbits without any superfluous exposition or action to distract from the meaty interpersonal drama at play. Trachtenberg is coy with his Hitchcock influences, as the opening wordless sequence, with Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Michelle on the run, and Bear McCreary's thunderously melodramatic score, a spectacular hat tip to the great Bernard Herrmann, set the tone perfectly, situating us in Psycho territory. Scrupulously policed by the terrifyingly confusing Howard (John Goodman), we, alongside Michelle, and fellow refugee Emmett, scrabble for the tiniest clues as Trachtenberg steadily cranks up the tension like a vice. Is Howard telling the truth about their quarantine, and, if so, how much (and, regardless, is he more dangerous than the world outside)? As survival, fastidious social politics, and aspirations of escape consume Michelle, our MacGuffin, 'what's really out there?' looms overhead (literally) like a sickening spectre, with only fleeting blips (recalling, but far more cathartic than the similarly minimalist Paranormal Activity) reinforcing how serious Howard could be about their predicament.But Trachtenberg is mindful of preventing the popcorn crowds from yawning amidst the tightly wound confinement drama. The labyrinthine script kneads out every inch of potential subterfuge with a bold showiness slyly conveying the flamboyant urgency of a monster mash, keeping the proceedings dynamic, as audiences gasp for hints like fish out of water. Despite the stagnant setting, McCreary's domineering, bass drum locomotive of a score works tirelessly to keep the film stampeding along at a grimly resolute pace, while the frenzied sound editing exacerbates each screech of a door hinge and thumping on the floor (both internal and external) to jaw-clenching extremes, as Howard's volcanic mood swings guarantee no certainty or security at any point. And when we finally do snowball into 'That Ending'... well, I promised I wouldn't tell, didn't I? Suffice to say it's buckets of fun, but the real takeaway is the hour and a half potboiler proceeding it.Winstead is excellent and surprisingly nuanced as the perennially put-upon Michelle, with her tenacious, indefatigable innovation and tenderly expressive eyes making her infinitely more engaging than the average 'final girl'. But if the film has one takeaway moral, it's that the incomparable John Goodman has been criminally underused as a villain throughout his impressive career, and does some of his strongest work yet here. Goodman is ferociously captivating, his massive frame and booming voice filling the bunker with more dread than any giant monster. But it's how ingeniously ambiguous Goodman builds Howard that makes him truly terrifying, allowing notes of warmth, humour, and the deepest sorrow to dance across his permanent scowl, and leaving us constantly guessing: is Howard as sinister and predatorial as we're inclined to believe, or is he actually just a seismically particular conspiracy nut and control freak, who actually has everyone's best interests in mind? It takes a truly seasoned performer to inhabit a character with such engrossing certainty. Finally, John Gallagher Jr. confidently rounds out the bunker with necessary levity and a distinctly Chris Pratt brand of laid back comedy charisma.10 Cloverfield Lane doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does give it a hefty coat of polish, thrusting a delightfully old-fashioned slab of psychological tension into the heightened urgency of a contemporary B-movie popcorn romp. A key example of a simple, solid idea done hugely justice to, thanks to rock solid work by all involved, particularly the titanic, terrifying Goodman. It's also tons of fun, and distinctly worth seeing. Just don't overhype it for yourself. Or spoil that ending. John Goodman will be watching you.-8.5/10",8,1,4,18 March 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Breathtaking and consistently quality modern western
","The Western, a genre often associated with dusty studio sets in the 1950s, had more often than not been considered retired in today's film industry, the last noteworthy effort being Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven back in 1992. With that in mind, it is nothing less than exhilarating to see a modern take on the genre seem so fresh and bursting with life and vitality, making 3:10 to Yuma not only the strongest western in decades, but also one of the most consistently quality films in recent memory.Director James Mangold of Walk the Line fame should be given tremendous credit for extracting a great premise from a mostly unknown film (the original was hardly recognized as a timeless classic, making its remake status a bit suspect...) and translating it into a superb adaptation, nearly unanimously considered superior to the original. Mangold's firm directorial touch, working off the film's near flawless script is a sight to behold indeed. Crafting a nearly airtight blend between introspective musing, slowly festering psychological tension, and good old hardworn Western action tradition, all with enough of a modern spin and injection of energy, the film is made accessible to a contemporary audience, without forgetting its traditional western roots. With pitch perfect cinematography and editing exquisitely drinking in the dusty trails, rickety saloons and lone prairies among other western visual trademarks, complimented by the traditional yet never clichéd score, the audience feels fully immersed in the Old West setting. We feel the bullets tearing past (in some of the most exhilarating shootout sequences in years), feel the sand blowing into our faces and shake from the clamour of approaching horses. The already stellar film is fuelled by its dynamic cast, each giving performances which would normally qualify as 'show stealing', were it not from the unanimously strong work from all the others. Russell Crowe once again demonstrates his astonishing prowess as an actor, making Ben Wade one of the most compelling villains in years - suave, silver tongued, with a clear sense of honour, yet still unapologetically self serving and malevolent. His antagonist is perfectly complimented by the ever reliable Christian Bale, on top form with yet another brutally affecting performance as beaten down yet proud rancher Dan Evans. Working with a character who could all too easily fall into the mould of the stereotypical 'doing right for the sake of doing right' hero figure, Bale instead embraces the emotional foibles of Evans, providing a downtrodden charisma complete with a malevolent glint in the eye, making him a consistently intriguing protagonist. The depth the two stars instill their characters with is flooring, and countless accolades should justifiably be bestowed on both.Adding to the immense prowess of the two leads, Ben Foster is a cinematic powder keg as Wade's fiercely loyal and sadistically homicidal right hand man, both genuinely terrifying and incessantly watchable - one would be hard pressed to find a more menacing villainous sidekick. It's also wonderful to see Peter Fonda in the genre made famous by his father, giving his most impressive performance in years as a grizzled, aging bounty hunter, and the always wonderful Alan Tudyk gives a strong and fittingly comedic contribution as an unconventional doctor. Relative newcomer Logan Lerman is impressively powerful as Bale's impressionable yet fiercely rebellious son, easily outshining the usual lack of emotion produced by most young stars. In fact, the only weak link in the cast is Gretchen Mol as Bale's wife, who, while not terrible by any means, comes across as disappointingly flat in a cast full of such immensely capable performers.All things considered, 3:10 to Yuma is not only one of the strongest westerns in the past few decades, but arguably among the most beautifully crafted additions to the genre. With a steady and capable directorial hand throughout, and fuelled by mesmerizing performances from an immensely powerful cast, in particular the dynamic Crowe and Bale,the film excels in showcasing all the traits which made its trademark classics successes, while still accessible and appealing for a contemporary audience. One begins to wish that the title train would never arrive, that the film might continue on immersing its audience in its consistently classy splendour long after the credits roll.-10/10",10,2,5,12 September 2007
Skyfall," 'Resurrection' is the new mid-life crisis
","No one would ever expect James Bond to age gracefully - or even age at all. Nearly 20 years after Judi Dench's M first hissed his 'sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War' epitaph, and ten since his 40th anniversary proved so gaudily juvenile it prompted a franchise reboot, 007 is still endeavouring to validate his own continued existence. Enter Sam Mendes, one of the industry's most venerated working filmmakers, to help lend Bond's 50th some dignity and he kills Bond off before the opening credits. Goldfinger would be so proud. That Bond returns, reinvigorated by the soulful strains of Adele's outstanding theme, is no surprise. But how he returns, brushing aside phoenix metaphors with Craig's trademark disdainful grimace, is truly extraordinary. Peerlessly mature, emotional, thrilling, Skyfall sets a new precedent for the consummate Bond film, excelling on every possible front, and exceeding the sum of its component parts, thanks to Mendes' careful mediation of a cat's cradle of seething emotional turmoil. Pulse-pounding chases, blistering fist fights and shootouts, casual sex and pithy wit aside, Skyfall is a film about legacy, reconciling the open wounds of the past, and challenging the myth of the valourized super-agent amidst bureaucratic accountability - a long, hard look at what 007 the 21st century needs, or if we even need him at all. Spoiler alert: we do, and Mendes' astounding work here is enough to leave even the most stubborn holdouts leaving with the Bond riff blaring in their heads.The plot of Bond hunting for a cyberterrorist gunning for MI6 might appear initially safe territory, but we swiftly learn that nothing is as it seems. In the hands of Mendes, all of the normal 'safe' Bond archetypes are destabilized: M is this episode's 'Bond girl', familiar names and titles are masked by unfamiliar faces, and arch-fiend Silva is too sympathetic to be reduced to the usual cartoon stereotype. In short: nothing and no one is safe, and it makes for far more fresh, vibrant viewing than the usual 007 routine. It's also easily the most aesthetically gorgeous 007 ever, as Roger Deakins makes the panoramas of Shanghai, Macao, and the Scottish highlands burst into life with breathtaking light shows and sumptuous splashes of colour (the 'jellyfish' framed silhouette fight is pure, undiluted cinematic pleasure). Similarly, Thomas Newman's score blends everyone's favourite thematic 007 leitmotifs with a dazzlingly rich array of background textures, driving the film with furious momentum while also colouring it with a reflectively melancholy undercurrent. And if all that isn't groundbreaking enough for you: Bond even hints at a gay experience. This truly is the 21st century. That said, the dramatic purist Mendes also proves to have a wicked sense of fun, and pairs the rich emotional storytelling (yes really) with some of the most inventively batty 007 thrills yet. While some of the earlier moments of subterfuge tow the line of being a touch too leisurely, we're still spoiled with the creatively bombastic thrills of Bond driving a backhoe through a train, leaping off a komodo dragon, blowing up the better half of the London underground, and even getting to bomb around in his old Aston Martin DB5 in the film's sole, and utterly gleeful, piece of fan service. It's not absolutely flawless: Silva's master plan leans somewhat too heavily on The Dark Knight - slightly too convoluted not to strain credibility, even for 007 - while the climactic pyrotechnics-fest, though electrifyingly breathless, is somewhat harder to take seriously once the words 'Home Alone' are uttered (oops). Still - this is utterly top-notch entertainment, and, paired with the far higher emotional stakes than the average Bond, it's unsurprising to find yourself relaxing from the edge of your seat far more often than expected. Still, Mendes is very much an actor's director, and it's in the film's performances he contributes his most invaluable work. Already firmly established, Craig effortlessly wears Bond like a tailor-cut tuxedo here, his tawny listlessness and debonair muscularity the subtle tells for his carefully buried inner fraying. Physically and emotionally battered, with 'why not stay dead' forebodingly echoing, Craig manifests vulnerability through a disarming 'don't give a sh*t' jocularity, perfectly making Bond's wit his own without resorting to the arched eyebrow of Moore and Brosnan. Squaring off against him, Javier Bardem's Silva is a unexpected pleasure of a threat. Cheeky, playful, sickening, raw, and dangerous, Bardem's massive charisma is ferociously commanding, as he blends the best bits of GoldenEye's warped agent trope and the megalomaniacs of the 60s with a performance as dazzlingly flamboyant as his hair, and an unforgettably chilling walk-on opening monologue. If there's a more compelling 007 arch-nemesis out there, we've yet to encounter them. The wonderful Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, and Ralph Fiennes all lend endearingly lovable support as the new MI6 family, each triumphantly owning their beats of sardonic humour. Bérénice Marlohe exemplifies the 'Bond girl' blend of silkily seductive, dazzlingly gorgeous, but with a winning dash of fervent, haunted pathos, in a too-short appearance, while Albert Finney is hilariously gruff in a cameo one can't help but speculate was originally intended for another crusty Scot with 007 ties. Still, the real star is the show is Judi Dench - fittingly, in her 007th time reprising her character. Dench has always been class incarnate, but this time, beneath the icy repartee we get a sense at the truly human resolve fuelling her unflinching dedication to country and getting the bloody job done. It's a genuine pleasure to spend so much time with such an incomparable performer here. Stylish, confident, emotional, and phenomenally fun, Skyfall proudly rears its head as a toss-up for the best Bond film yet. Better yet: in Mendes' masterful grip, the populist blockbuster of the 007 mythology is elevated and perfected with immaculate, artful precision. Here's to another 50, Mr. Bond. Many happy returns.-9.5/10",10,2,8,20 March 2016
Catch Me If You Can," When real life becomes fantasy...
","Director Steven Spielberg returns to what he does best with this take on the true story of Frank Abegnale Jr, (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was convicted for dozens of cases of check fraud and assuming false identities before the age of 25. And a true story it may be, but all of Abegnale's daring deeds and frantic escapes are oversimplified in this telling - everything he does seems too easy and natural for him. Showing the difficulty the real Abegnale would have had to endure would add some realism and make the tale less of a fantasy escape, which is what it ultimately ends up as. But for a fantasy escape, there is some real drama infused into the story, especially with the strange yet fascinating relationship between Abegnale Jr. and Sr, and Frank Jr. realizing that he can't just settle down to marry his girlfriend Brenda (Amy Adams) who knows him under a different identity, since he is being constantly hunted by the authorities. And near the end, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) gradually warms to his query Abegnale, despite all the trials and frustrations he has been put through - an unexpected and much appreciated reversal of character.DiCaprio does a good portrayal of Abegnale Jr. as he starts out confident and full of energy, while slowly descending into virtual paranoia, always looking over his shoulder and devising new ways to once again prevent capture. Tom Hanks also gives a strong performance as Carl Hanratty, the driven officer determined to catch Abegnale Jr. and bring him to justice. Yet they are both in danger of being overshadowed by notorious scene stealer Christopher Walken, in an Academy Award nominated performance, playing Abegnale Sr. the idol of his criminal son. Walken is truly affecting as he slowly comes to terms that he isn't as invincible as he thought, as his wife leaves him and everything he possesses is steadily taken by the government as he continually neglects to pay taxes. But his frequent self-confidence boosting sayings ('Two mice fell into a bucket of cream. One gave up and quickly drowned, but the second kept struggling and churned the cream into butter. Right now, I am that second mouse') give his son (and perhaps himself as well) the impression that he's on top of his situation.It's an excellent package, with John Williams' excellent 50's style score beautifully complementing Spielberg's work. It may be lighter and less realistic than it could have been, but Catch me if you Can is without a doubt, a lot of fun to watch, which is all it really needed to be.-9/10",9,2,3,31 December 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'It's not the years, honey - it's the mileage.'
","Da da DA DA Da da duhhhThere are countless instantly recognizable movie themes - many of them written by John Williams. But there are none quite as instantly transformative as those two sets of ascending four notes on the horn that instantly spell 'Indiana Jones.' Four notes, and we're skidding under a closing temple door, a juggernaut boulder crashing behind us, dodging blow darts, pausing only to retrieve our hat. Four notes, and we unconsciously stop to absently brush the spiders and cobwebs off us, so entranced are we by the thrill of our archaeological treasure hunt. Four notes, and we're off to the movies - Raiders of the Lost Ark alongside Doctor Jones. And there's nowhere we'd rather be.You could rattle off Raiders' iconic moments for the duration of its run time ('throw me the whip!'/'Throw me the idol!'; 'Gun to a sword fight'; 'Why'd it have to be snakes?!'), and still fall short of its iconic magic. But why Indy? Granted, the former Indiana Smith, the man all but christened James Bond's father (see part III for a cheeky wink at that) by his own 'parents,' the indomitable Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, is a fun character. He's a perfect foil to subject to all the action, intrigue, globetrotting, and treasure hunting joys that proliferated the matinée adventure serials of his pappy's boyhoods. And we have him (and them) for forever cementing archaeology as THE COOLEST profession shy of a firefighting superhero astronaut in the eyes of generations of youth.Spielberg clearly knew they were onto something here, and reciprocates by being on the top of his game, delivering the quintessence of a robust, brawny, populist cinematic adventure as only he can. His opening act - again, a 007 homage - is immediately unforgettable, introducing the titular hero as a dramatic silhouette, easily outmaneuvering his cowering guide (the exquisitely weaselly Alfred Molina) as he's beset by a franchise's worth of booby traps. It's a slow build from there, toeing the line of leisurely, despite an explosive bar brawl in the Himalayas (including another unforgettable introduction for Karen Allen's tough-as-nails, exceptionally charismatic Marion Ravenwood) to tide us by. But soon enough, we're thrust into the thick of snake-filled antiquity ruins, besieged by Nazis (who else?), and from then on, the film is unstoppable. Crisp editing, flawlessly dusty cinematography, and the magnificently grandiose archaeological sets ignite the film with a rambunctious, sand-etched enthusiasm, while the action sequences bristle with breathtaking intensity (remember to return from the edge of your seat after watching Jones sucked under a moving truck, or ducking under a plane propeller mid-fistfight) coupled with disarming matinée silliness. And that climax - probably the most literal 'Deus Ex Machina' in cinema history? 'Exhilarating' is the understatement of a thousand lifetimes. But the real joy, the real 'je ne sais quoi' of Raiders of the Lost Ark lives in its tiny, throwaway moments - many buoyed by Spielberg's savagely cheeky sense of humour, or flair for unexpectedly iconic character beats. 'Love You' on a student's eyelids flustering Jones mid-lesson. Indiana interrupting Marcus Brody (the delightful Denholm Elliot)'s line - clearly unscripted - because he's so excited about archaeology. John Rhys-Davies' bombastically lovable Sallah bursting into Gilbert and Sullivan because he's 'so pleased you're not dead!' Arch-rival Belloq (perfectly preening yet oddly dignified Paul Freeman) bursting into laughter when drunkenly threatened by a knife. Insidious, scar-handed Nazi stooge Toht (unforgettably grotesque Ronald Lacey) giggling nervously when the Ark of the Covenant is revealed to be full of dust. Indiana falling asleep amidst what should be a passionate love scene. And, of course, the unforgettable 'brought a gun to a sword fight' standoff. These are what elevate the movie from good, spirited fun to the level of unforgettable movie magic. These are what make it truly special.Still, there are two indisputable MVPs for Raiders' rampant success: John Williams, and Harrison Ford. Never before have music and actor fused into such an unforgettable driving force of a character - a hero who really sweats, bleeds, grunts, cusses, undercuts his triumphant introduction by whining about snakes, and cements his place at the forefront of thirty-five years worth of audiences' hearts. It's easy to overlook Ford's razor-sharp comedic timing amidst his brimming, crusty charisma, but watch for his exasperated, exhausted grimaces when confronted by a superfluously sword-swinging adversary, fumbling aboard a descending Nazi submarine, or challenged to bareknuckle boxing mid-plane hijack, and the film reaches a level of sublime, almost peerless character comedy. It's this crystalline grounding of impossible feats within the characterization of a man who risks his life for museum artifacts that sells the inherent ridiculousness of Indiana Jones, taking him from self-parody to genre-defining, and spawning innumerable, inherently inferior knock-offs. Freeman's Belloq's villainous jeers prove prophetic: Jones is now an unshakable, invaluable part of modern cultural history. And he doesn't even have to be quarantined to a museum. There's an argument to be made that The Last Crusade peps up the already nearly airtight formula with more comedy and action for your buck, and Temple of Doom, while clumsy and flawed, delves into some intriguingly grim terrain (what's a Crystal Skull? You must've been dreaming). Still, the word classic isn't used lightly, and Raiders of the Lost Ark remains just that: a game-changing, fundamental force in escapist cinematic perfection. So forget about your pesky real world problems! Because you are at the MOVIES, with Spielberg, Johnny Williams, and the perennially grimacing Indiana Jones. And here, everything is going to be okay. You're in good hands. Whose good hands? Top. Men.Duh duh DA da duh DA da Duh DA DA da dahhhh-10/10",10,0,0,13 November 2016
It," Stranger Kings
","In The Lego Batman Movie, the titular caped crusader, tasked with naming his greatest fear, rasps 'Snakes! Clowns! SNAKE-CLOWNS!!!' And while Indiana Jones may have echoed one phobia, the rest of the literate world certainly quivered at the latter after Steven King's 1986 masterwork - both the longest horror novel ever written and most successful book named after a pronoun - was uncorked upon fearful readers. Clowns. It {HA!} had to be clowns. And, if the only thing scarier than Pennywise was the prospect of him being done a disservice by a hackneyed contemporary remake, fear not (at least, not in that way): 2017's It is as respectful to King (arguably overly so at times) as it is gruesomely fun and nimble. And scary. Oh yes. Say goodbye, Snake-Clowns - you've just been ousted. It {heh!} is hard to conceive of a more frightfully fun film this year. To nip the (circus?) elephant in the room in the bud: yes, It inevitably owes a symbiotic debt to the nostalgia-chic fanned from the rampant popularity of Netflix's Stranger Things (which, in turn, paid homage to King, in a Möbius strip of intertextuality ). Still, the neo-nostalgia works just as well on the big screen, lending the film a grandiose, larger-than-life nature, as it treads (almost overly) familiar horror beats with the confidence of a rock star playing the greatest hits. Mama director Andy Muschietti ardently defies tacky, contemporary 'jump-scare' horror trends in favour of more classical tension building. He plays conventional set-ups to the hilt - shrieking Bernard Herrmann strings, memorably grotesque Kubrick-esq imagery, and tantalizingly obscured shadows creeping down long, ominous hallways and all, trusting that a committed robust, old-school fright is sufficient without deafening, migraine-inducing conceits. It {ho!} is. The film's transposed 80s setting perfectly accentuates the story's Stand By Me coming-of-age schtick, as sweet and sincere as it is rough-and-tumble. King's novel has stood the test of time for its patient commitment to character development amidst the spine-tingling frights, and Muschietti is similarly unhurried, playing up the individual pre-teen neuroses and tribulations of each ragtag member of the 'Losers' as more terrifying than the clown demon systematically popping in and out to torment them like an elusive, dementedly cackling Jaws shark. Granted, Muschietti buys into the cult of King so wholeheartedly that he pushes the limits of 'would you really follow a mysterious noise into that dark, deserted house' well past acceptable standards of suspending disbelief at times, threatening chortles of incredulity from a media-savvy audience that should be emitting squeaks of fright. To be fair, it's hard to chart which of the film's spate of horror clichés King pioneered, but Muschietti integrating them with such doe-eyed sincerity ultimately hurts his film almost as much as it helps it. And let's be honest - even the 80s didn't have bullies so '80s-movie,' so decked out with mullets, switchblades, and grotesquely overkill acts of violence It {hoo}'s almost distracting. Still, character development of our pre-pubescent leads is all well and good, but digging further into our spectral clown's raison-d'être is the film's real fascination. For those squirming in their seats from cliché or fright, there's a whole level of alternative viewing to be had unpacking the rationale behind Pennywise's teasing tormenting. Most horror monsters frighten unintentionally simply by existing. Pennywise feeds on fear, making his every appearance and act an intriguingly calculated reflexive performance. Poignantly, this also provides a rather nifty screen writing 'get out of jail free card,' as incongruous narrative reversals prolonging the plot can be explained away as, rather than screen writing convenience, Pennywise retreating due to failing at scaring his target demographic. It {errgh}'s actually deceptively clever, and plays into the film's tongue-in-cheek nostalgia with amiable ease. Of course, any good horror movie should spook beyond academic subtext, and It {really?} is appropriately terrifying in Its {ugh} own right. This is thanks largely to Bill Skarsgård, cleverly sprinkling whiffs of Tim Curry and strains of Heath Ledger's Joker into a scene-stealing masterwork as riveting as It {ahhh} is f*cking terrifying. He's used sparsely and effectively, and, granted, the makeup does a fair amount of heavy lifting, but It {stop}'s Skarsgård's subtle touches that Pennywise 2.0 come to gut-wrenching life, with his whimsical eye contact, absentminded drool, and segueing between gurgling giddiness and rabid snarls that make him a truly unforgettable foe for the ages. On the youth frontier, the sheer number of King's Losers mean that many suffer from being one-note archetypes, making our prolonged time with them feel superfluous (Jeremy Ray Taylor's exposition-doling, requisite fat nerd and Chosen Jacob's nearly silent token black kid are particularly ill-served in this regard). Regardless, all the young actors give excellent performances, finding notes of humour and humanity in their moments to shine, no matter how rote. Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer spice up the film with acerbic humour and sass, while Jaeden Lieberher shoulders the thankless burden of stoic lead with raw, emotive vulnerability and vinegar. Sophia Lillis may be hit hard with King's patriarchal preoccupations (ANOTHER pre-teen girl bathed in a not-so-subtle torrent of blood and hair?!), but she's sparky enough to sell it with aplomb. At least the novel's disturbingly tone-deaf child-orgy is, mercifully, left out. Nice one, Steve. It {please }'s not often in contemporary Hollywood audiences leave a would-be franchise clamouring for a sequel, but there were ever an exception to the rule, this is It {please stop}. Sold by an airtight cast, unnervingly effective Skarsgård, and Muschietti's robust, affectionate gruesomeness, the film may not reinvent the wheel, but certainly gives It {sigh} a hearty, affectionate spin. So - is It {arrgh} worth the hype? Don't take my word for It {noooo} - check It {fuuuuuu} out for yourself. -7.5/10",7,1,2,7 October 2017
Casablanca," Play it again, Sam
","One would be hard pressed to find a list of 'Best films ever made' without Casablanca included on it - indeed, if any movie was to be singled out as the most laudable and classic picture of all time, there is no doubt that Casablanca would be right up there in the running, if not bestowed the title itself. But don't be scared off by thinking Casablanca has coasted by all these years on its hefty reputation - even now, more than 60 years down the road, this film stands the test of time as one of the most influential, inspiring, quotable and just plain well made creations Hollywood has ever come up with. But one could go on all day listing different adjectives detailing Casablanca's classic status, so I'll try to bite them back and give a bit more of an analysis of the film. Director Michael Curtiz brings the film together with a touch which is daring, yet steady as a rock, presenting a powerful yet entertaining portrait of the days of Nazi occupied France, a message of hope shining through and the tumultuous love affair which grew in the midst of them - in short, the perfect period piece. The cinematography is excellent for the time, sporting a simply beautiful, film noire sheen. The movie's high point (if one could be selected) is its wonderful screenplay, which is without a doubt, one of the single best of all time - both witty, bitingly political, classy, and filled with too many endlessly quoted lines to count. ('Here's looking at you kid' 'I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship' and 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she had to walk into mine' only being the tip of the iceberg) The endlessly referenced ending actually comes as surprising, but fits the tone of unrequited love perfectly, and shows how daring and unique this wonderful movie must have been in its time. Humphrey Bogart is at his stoically iconic best here, creating a touching portrait of an infinitely complex and flawed man with layer upon layer of exquisitely written characterisation ('what's your nationality?' 'I'm a drunkard') to peel away. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman also gives a timeless performance as Bogart's mysterious past lover, and Paul Henreid makes a wonderful addition to the most classic love triangle of all time. The movie also manages to include several incredibly entertaining character roles, including the superb Claude Rains as a sympathetic police officer, Sydney Greenstreet as a corrupt club owner, and the deliciously creepy Peter Lorre in a far too brief supporting role. Suffice to say, Casablanca is one of those films one can shamelessly say they have enjoyed time and time and time again - there are far too many subtle nuances to be caught and enjoyed in a single viewing, and the movie has a replay value next to none, making them easy to catch. Casablanca is billed as the most classic love story of all time, yes, but there is ultimately so much more to it than that. Safe to say, the term 'must see' applies here if you have yet to do so, and if you are among those who have already experienced the classic, there's not the least bit of shame of wanting to play it again, and live the magic one more time. -10/10",10,2,4,8 November 2006
Minority Report," The future is bright
","Spoilers hereinWhen Steven Spielberg, arguably the most influential director in film history tries his hand at sci-fi with Tom Cruise at the helm, you know something good is underway. This is indeed the case with Minority Report, with Steven Spielberg returning back to the future after 2001's A.I. The story takes place in the year 2054, with a new police department called 'pre-crime' which harnesses the powers of three psychics known as 'pre-cogs' to predict and stop future crimes before they occur. The system is supposed to be flawless, until officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is accused of murdering a man he has never met or heard of in less than 36 hours. To prove his innocence, Anderton kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton) the most gifted of the pre-cogs to delve into her mind to see whether he will actually commit the murder, or whether he's been set up, presumably by FBI agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) who openly wants Anderton's job.Although primarily a science fiction tale, (based on a short story by author Philip K. Dick, who also penned 'Paycheck' and 'Blade Runner') Minority Report ends up as more of a film noire, with hidden clues being hinted at, but concealed from the audience until the last second, as Anderton races to prove his innocence, and discover his presumed saboteur. The noire element blends wonderfully with the science fiction portion of the story, ending up with a genuinely compelling and original tale of futuristic intrigue.Similarly to A.I., in the year 2054 in Minority Report the future is bright, with everything from cars to buildings appearing silver, streamlined and very visually slick. The colour use is worth mentioning, with all colours dulled to virtually shades of white and black, perhaps to give a retro feel to a futuristic movie? Whatever the intention, the colours work quite well, and always add to and never interfere with the rest of the film. But it's Spielberg's envisioning of what future advertising and marketing will be like that makes the film so compelling all stores in malls have eye scanners, so models representing the store can talk to each person individually. Giving the general inconsideration for the public's privacy that modern advertising displays, in the future, this is an entirely possible outcome, heaven forbid.Spielberg also brings his own quirky sense of humour into play here, as demonstrated with scenes such as Anderton falling through a window, and landing next to a circle of contortionists doing their warm up exercises, and the Swedish eye doctor making duck noises periodically. There's not really any reason for including these bits, but they do add to the bizarre intrigue of the film rather well, surprisingly enough.The cast perform exceptionally, whether together or individually. Tom Cruise is spellbinding and surprisingly passionate as John Anderton, police officer on the run. This could have been transformed into a standard M:I2 style action performance, but Cruise is far too vulnerable and sensitive for this to be the case, emitting shocking emotion when reflecting on the kidnapping of his son. (the reason he became a police officer - pre-crime could have prevented his son's abduction)Max Von Sydow is spectacular as Anderton's compassionate yet mysterious boss Lamar Burgess, underplaying the part to perfect effect, to create genuine audience confusion. We never know exactly where the guy is coming from, and he keeps us guessing until the end, where he is eventually revealed to be a desperate man, willing to resort to murder to maintain his enterprise.Colin Farrell's Danny Witwer is also a cryptic character whose position is essentially the opposite of Burgess - originally you perceive him as the villain, framing Anderton for a murder in order to incapacitate him and seize his job, but in the end he is a good man with respectable morals, who just happened to take a dislike to Anderton. But just when we realize that he is in fact trying to clear Anderton from his premature accusation, Witwer is shot by Burgess for uncovering too much evidence. Farrell has great chemistry with the other cast members, and covers up his Irish accent beautifully.But perhaps the real star of the show is Samantha Morton as Agatha, the pre cog abducted by Anderton. She is so convincing as a being who is not quite human, yet feels many human emotions which she can't quite come to terms with that you begin to feel really creeped out with the knowledge that she is, in fact, a real person, merely playing a role. A perfect definition of an actor totally inhabiting a role, Morton never fails to astonish us with her stunning characterization.Of course, John William's exceptional scores never fail to complement Spielberg's work, and Minority Report is no exception - William's beautifully moving score perfectly adds to the mysterious tone of the movie. And with Spielberg at the helm, with an exceptional cast and the creative urge to do something refreshingly different, Minority Report could never really be anything but a huge success. Which, of course, it is.-10/10",10,1,2,22 November 2004
Finding Neverland," True Magic
","Who would have thought the life of playwrite J.M. Barrie could be as exciting as his most famous story about a troupe of lost boys? It seems to be pretty close here, as Finding Neverland details the life of Barrie (Depp) as he writes his most famous play, Peter Pan. Barrie is inspired by watching a family of boys playing in the park, accompanied by their mother Syliva (Winslet). Barrie begins playing with the boys more and more often, as their youthful imaginations help him to remember his own, and inspire him to write a play of true magic.Director Marc Forster couldn't possibly have made a more different film than his last, the extremely dramatically heavy Monster's Ball - in fact, just about all they have in common is that both are quality works. And Finding Neverland is indeed a quality work, with Forster throwing in little magic touches here and there (the door to Barrie's bedroom shows a vast, sweeping landscape, representing the fantastic dreams he will have) and some superb cinematography to give the audience a sort of portal into Barrie's incredible imagination. (the camera flies, fairy like, over the audience watching Peter Pan for the first time, set to a soundtrack of children's laughter)Johnny Depp, while using a great Scottish accent, is a joy to watch as Barrie, the man who was never afraid to be a child again. He proves yet again that few actors of his generation are capable of so totally immersing themselves into a character, and playing them to the fullness of their ability. Kate Winslet is also terrific, if not quite matching Depp's level, as the harried mother of the children Barrie befriends. Surprisingly, even Sylvia's children turn out to be excellent actors, in particular newcomer Freddie Highmore, playing Peter, an overly serious who tries to grow up too quickly after the death of his father. Julie Christie is a strong presence as the snotty 'you love to hate her' mother of Sylvia, who tries to prevent Barrie from spending time with their family, because it lowers the family's social standing. But she isn't just the stereotypical evil grandmother - her character has much more depth than that, and we are actually allowed an explanation for her snide ways. Dustin Hoffman also has a brief but essential appearance as Charles Frohman, the producer of Barrie's plays who is skeptical of the magical content in his benefactor's latest. Hoffman proves his standing as an iconic actor, raising many a chuckle in a few all too brief scenes.It's an astonishingly flawless piece of work - pitch perfect performances all around propelling a wonderful script, all handled by a terrific and capable director with a wonderful sense of story and magic. With little touches of imagination sprinkled throughout, Finding Neverland perfectly captures the tone of magic and wonder that Barrie's play was supposed to instill in the first place. It's a shame there are so few films which turn out so uniformly beautiful as this.-10/10",10,2,3,23 May 2005
To Be or Not to Be," 'Tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous comedy, while paying respectful homage to a sea of troubles
","If you're one of the many who sneer that contemporary comedies play too much on offensive shock value, try this on for size: an American comedy, released only months after the country had shipped troops over to join the war, with the image of Adolf Hitler casually strolling down the street, only moments after his moustached grimace would have graced the screen in the newsreels. Indeed, between the film's brazenly audacious topicality and the horribly tragic pre-release death of its leading lady, it almost boggles the mind to imagine any audiences chancing a viewing of Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not To Be, let alone laughing at it. Thankfully, the benefit of hindsight reveals a true classic waiting in the wings. Taking its place alongside Chaplin's The Great Dictator as one of the bravest (and, by proxy, funniest) films of the era, To Be or Not To Be is a savage satire and comedy of errors, wordplay, and mistaken identities worthy of Shakespeare himself, in addition to being a palpably tense and engrossing war film in its own right. If the notion of making an irreverent wartime satire while at once being sincerely deferential to the fears and hardships of the war might seem contradictory, it's a paradox that Lubitsch embraces full steam ahead. The genius of To Be or Not To Be is its being equal parts comedy and war film, vindicating the struggles of overseas troops while employing laughs as cathartic levity from the fear and uncertainty surrounding them. Appropriately, Lubitsch plays the claustrophobic, paralyzing outrage of the encroaching invasion of Poland and the nailbiting suspense of spying within the Nazi ranks to the hilt, while simultaneously lampoons the blustering bureaucratic ineptitude of a Nazi force fumbling to uphold their own doctrines, often side-by-side within the same scene. The film's screenplay is deftly intricate, with enjoyable meta-Shakespearian plays on disguises and mistaken identities seamlessly blending the strains of espionage and comedy. Still, Lubitsch is the master of the 'verbal repetition as punchline' gag, with several slow-burning bits (ranging from initially innocuous lines of dialogue to Benny's hysterically cringeworthy rendition of the titular soliloquy) building from chuckle-worthy to uproariously hilarious in tandem with the film's steadily mounting tension. And, amidst the beats of irreverence and reverence (and moments of shocking, jarring darkness), Lubitsch leaves room for heart. Although the film's 'secret love' subplot between Lombard and Robert Stack's heartthrob pilot plays as a tad histrionic, the clarion sentiment Lubitsch invests into the film's overall agenda is far more resonant. Above all else, the film serves as a galvanizing wartime call to action: a bold parable to the propensity of every citizen to combat oppression, regardless of profession (or even competence). Here, the goofy dysfunctional troupe of actors are held as equally worth of heroic valourization as Stack's matinee idol pilot by being willing to lay down their lives to combat the Nazi uprising. It's an empowering testament to the human spirit that rings true without the artifice of propaganda, and, while lacking the infectiously rousing power of Casablanca's 'La Marseillaise,' Lubitsch's film is equally uplifting, albeit in a quiet and fundamentally sillier way. Carol Lombard's tragically untimely swan song performance is truly one for the ages. Commanding the screen with effortlessly affable ease, she infuses the film's tenser sequences with palpable stakes and tension, while weaving in the reprieve of a mischievous twinkle in her eye to break the ice and invite laughter back into the frame. Jack Benny is similarly magnificent as 'that great, great actor, Joseph Tura,' being as reliable a repository of laughs in his subtly scathing facial expressions as his perfectly rapid-fire banter and quipping. Stanley Ridges is perfectly smooth riddled with menace as a suave Nazi spy, while the wonderful Sig Ruman blusters and sputters to jubilant perfection as a perennially outwitted Nazi officer. Minor quibbles of pace and tonal balance aside, To Be or Not To Be is a remarkable juggling act, and as enjoyable as it is a triumphant feat of irreverent wartime defiance. Ticking dual boxes of being one of the most resonant and memorable comedies or war films of the Classical era, Lubitsch's film is an eminently revisable time capsule of the best gallows humour of the WWII era. Ah, what the hell - let's do one for the road: 'SCHUUUULLLTZ!!!'  -9/10",9,3,9,30 May 2018
The Big Lebowski," Sometimes there's a film sometimes there's a film.
","Now it was sometime in the year 1997, after the powers that be at the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science had decided to give a whole lot of recognition and awards to a film called Fargo, that a couple of boys named Joel and Ethan (though the most common nomenclature simply called them the Coen brothers) were thinking of making their next film. Now Joel and Ethan knew they had done well with their last film, that aforementioned Fargo, and they thought that their next film should be big. A big film. A film so big that it might as well have the word big in the title. And they - and we're talking about the Coen brothers here – well they just so happened to come up with such a motion picture, a picture which managed to be big as well as managing to be well outside of any range of conventional expectations. And that very motion picture happened to be one now known as The Big Lebowski.Or something like that. In fact, the Coens have, true to form, resisted discussing the inspiration for or meaning of what can still be considered one of their wildest, strangest and most inspired works of cinematic genius in as adamant and heated terms as the debates speculating on the film's 'true meaning' or 'purpose'. But part of the genius of the film is that whether regarded as a caustic political allegory (it is worth paying attention to the brief snippets of early 1990s American political news shown and referred to regardless), a loving and witty send up of all the conventions of a pulp, Raymond Chandler style film noir detective story (with a knowingly incomprehensible, convoluted plot) or simply a remarkably strange comedy, the film works. For whatever reason, the precise cocktail (a cinematic White Russian perchance) of absurdly quotable dialogue, inspired and memorable character bits, bizarre dream sequences, slow motion musical interludes and occasional dashes of self-reflexive profundity, all fused together by the impeccable technical double act of Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematography and Carter Burwell's obtrusively resonant music makes for a work of strange, clunky madness and perfection which never quite manages to do what is expected of it or hit a wrong note, no matter what inferences or expectations the viewer brings to the table.But the film's true genius lies in the fact that, despite its guided bizarreness baiting analysis, the most gleefully likely 'point' is that the film, like the ongoing in-joke of its nihilist antagonists, is ultimately not about 'anything'. The entire enterprise can be seen as an extensive exercise in 'talking a lot but ultimately saying nothing', much like Sam Elliott's mysterious Stranger's priceless rambling of a narration. One almost dares to believe that the Coens' true joke is all of the speculation, controversy, debates over the film and religions derived from it being ultimately unwarranted, as the film was crafted with no such motivations, or ultimately any motivations at all. And ultimately, perhaps the most poignant point that can be extracted from the film is that it doesn't need a point, as entertaining as it can be to try to impose meaning on the strange and hilarious string of events passed off as a narrative. The film functions beautifully simply as a chance to hang out with some lovable, hilarious and very memorable characters, to experience the thrill of a mystery haphazardly investigated (with the viewer continually left as befuddled as the characters), to listen to some great music and to ultimately learn, much like The Dude, to simply accept the absurdity of it all and simply exist and try to get through. And again, whether such an absence of point is truly the most satisfying explanation of the film remains a moot point – no matter what lens the film is examined through, it has never been so enjoyable to enter the gleefully odd, remarkably stylized world of the Coen brothers and simply exist.But the film's true joy lies in its collection of eccentric characters and equally off-the-wall performances. Jeff Bridges has never been better, inhabiting the laid back, drugged up and haphazardly heroic role of The Dude with an uncanny ease and magnificent comedic timing – a perpetually watchable triumph of characterization. Consistent scene-stealer John Goodman is equally priceless as faux-Jewish, rage-filled Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak, a bellowing, stubbornly illogical yet strangely lovable satire of the crass yet well intentioned Western stereotype. Julianne Moore similarly generates a performance which is outlandish, flat out hilarious and hits perhaps a little too close to home as an absurdist feminist visual artist. David Huddleston rants, raves, screeches and bellows to sublime comedic effect as the titular industrialist The Big Lebowski, and Steve Buscemi transforms clueless yet lovable into a work of art as the continually 'out of his element' Donny. But sheer magic can be found just as much in the supporting cast, with Philip Seymour Hoffman as obsessively prissy personal assistant Brandt, John Turturro as grotesque, purple spandex-clad, gyrating, former pedophile bowler Jesus Quintana, Peter Stormare as a deadpan nihilist porn star and Tara Reid as the compulsively greedy and promiscuous Bunny Lebowski along with the innumerable supporting bit parts each demonstrating exquisitely inventive and staggeringly funny characterizations, all excelling during their respective moments to shine.Without question the film will not prove fitting for all tastes, and complaints have been raised of its being self-indulgently alienating and strange, overlong and aimlessly rambling. Yet for those generally attuned to the Coens' incomparably oddball frequency, The Big Lebowski proves about as inventive, fresh, compelling and insanely comical (as well as potentially thematically provocative) as a film can get, and even the articulated complaints against it somehow manage to work more in its favour than detrimentally. One of the few films which visibly improves from an already high standard upon each viewing, The Big Lebowski remains a cinematic comedy masterpiece. And yes, the Dude abides.-10/10",10,1,3,14 January 2010
Unbreakable," What is a hero?
","After the enormous success of iconic thriller The Sixth Sense, one would hardly be surprised to see director M. Night Shyamalan attempting to recapture the elements which made his call to fame such a success, delivering yet another chilling psychological thriller with a requisite twist ending in the mould of its predecessor. With that in mind, one has to give Shyamalan all the more credit for resisting such a temptation and making Unbreakable, which one could hardly call a conventional follow-up. While the film could similarly be described as a psychological thriller, it is less about its twist (though there is one), and more about journeying alongside the intricately crafted characters, watching the immaculate plot unfold, and reveling in the director's convoluted cunning. Allaying any potential fears of his former mastery waning, Shyamalan has lost one of his trademark storytelling skill. The film's pacing is excellent - slow and thoughtful, yet consistently tense and engaging enough to prevent lagging. Shyamalan's script proves deceptively simple, but with enough underlying layers of meaning that it may take until the film's culmination for all the immaculately crafted intricacies to sink in. The only real complaints which emerge involve an ending which comes across as slightly jarring and abrupt, and certain lapses in credulity and logic, despite the film's lucrative content. Similarly, with such a quality film, one wishes Shyamalan could have pushed the envelope more and further explored his fascinating themes and characters in more depth, but such complaints pale in the face of such an astutely quality overall work. With a superb use of colours and innovative cinematography, Shyamalan perfectly captures his subject matter with an exceptional, moody comic book style look, sealing the film's firm overall sense of quality. Resisting the temptation to turn his subject matter into a run of the mill thriller, Shyamalan instead crafts a reflective meditation on the nature and origins of heroism, and its essential importance in society. Demonstrating clear knowledge and reverence for the field of comic books, Shyamalan draws out unprecedented layers of meaning from an art form generally associated with banal childhood stories by the general public. Using the archetypal comic book structure as allegorical for humanity, and its romanticized desire for exceptional powers and abilities, Shyamalan makes a reverence for comics seem mature, inspirational, and commendable - no easy feat indeed. Shyamalan's cast easily lives up to the staunch quality of the rest of his film, delivering understated yet powerful performances. A subdued Bruce Willis proves tremendously effective as David Dunn, the sole survivor of a terrible accident increasingly drawn into a world of uncertainty and bewilderment, and Willis' easy charisma makes for an engaging but still poignant performance. Samuel L. Jackson is an eerie and haunting presence as a bone- diseased comic book obsessee, bringing effortless class and credibility to a part which would have been hard to sell with a lesser actor. Robin Wright Penn delivers quality support, bringing to life the human component of the film as Dunn's struggling wife. Similarly, Spencer Treat Clarke defies the conventions of his age group, resulting in a surprisingly powerful and heartfelt performance as Dunn's idealistic son.While the film may have been somewhat misrepresented as a 'thriller' as opposed to a more thoughtful introspective examination of deeper underlying themes, Shyamalan's second effort proves an unconventional but tremendously powerful follow-up to The Sixth Sense. With a careful, deliberately paced script and a sturdy cast to back the material up, Unbreakable is quality storytelling at its finest, while still providing the viewer with a new appreciation for comic books and copious amounts of food for thought. Shyamalan has crafted his film with the utmost of care, and the dark beauty of Unbreakable will stick with the viewer for quite some time, intriguing and entertaining hand in hand. -8/10",8,0,0,22 February 2008
The Birth of a Nation," The ultimate exercise in form versus content
","The most expensive, and profitable film of its time. A film ensconced in such controversy that its director was forced to essentially 'redeem' himself to the cinema community with his next film. A film so powerful and influential that decades after its time, it was allegedly still used as a recruitment tool. The stories circling around D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation have become fodder for cinematic legend, crafting the film such an infamous reputation that it is commonly regarded as 'the most important film that no one wants to see'. Nonetheless, despite the stories, legends and controversy, it is impossible to deny the dangerously persuasive power and sheer cinematic mastery showcased by Griffith's defining cinematic product, easily giving the film endless merits to convey when viewed in a contemporary context.Few films have ever proved so troublesome or difficult to reconcile, or have presented such a paradox in terms of cinematic quality. One one hand, The Birth of a Nation is a technically stunning cinematic masterpiece, with production values and sheer scope and ambition which would be tremendously laudable in a current day context, let alone in 1915, when it was rare to have a film of an hour and a half of length, let alone three hours. In attempting to literally make good on its title and explore what Griffith saw as the birth of his country, such an audacious odyssey of a film does give the viewer the sense of being present for the foundation of an age, each minute detail from the reading of a tender wartime letter to the sweeping historical battle sequences lending credence to the film's promotional statement of being 'history written with lightning'. Griffith pioneered countless techniques of cinematography and editing to mine the maximum potential of emotional resonance and stirring, rousing reaction in viewers, making for a visually luscious and impressively powerful technical triumph. To say the industry simply 'does not make films like this anymore' is a cliché bandied about far too often to retain its full relevance, but in the case of The Birth of a Nation, the expression rings fervently true, as film-making to such an extent of ambition, scope and sheer passion has seldom been glimpsed on a cinema screen since. But at the same time, no matter how many countless technical and cinematic plaudits, The Birth of a Nation is still an inescapably, fundamentally flawed film. The amount of inexhaustible self-confidence and ambition Griffith must have tirelessly retained to convince both himself and his studio that the film was still worthy of being made (allegedly pouring $112, 000 in 1915 dollars into the production) permeate the film with a constant sense of cloying pretension and sense of stuffy self-importance throughout, plastering his name and initials over the scene setting title cards and soaking the film in a haughty sense of intense importance which lessens the stunning resonance of its technical mastery. And of course, the source of the vast majority of the film's controversy, the unavoidable extreme racism which effectively forms the centerpiece of the film (from depicting African Americans as essentially savage detriments to American life to turning the Klu Klux Klan into valiant crusaders and national heroes) makes it almost impossible to properly the film even keeping in mind its dated politics and social conditions. While the film's focalising on a different aspect of the Klan than is usually explored does help understand those who empathized with its politics and the seductive persuasion so powerfully employed by the group, such an ever recurring issue still makes it almost impossible to fully endorse the film, countless plaudits or not. As a side note, it is interesting to decode Griffith's portrayal of war (through a lengthy and undeniably thrilling Civil War battle sequence), especially considering America's looming role in the World War One conflict. At first glimpse, the film might be read as an anti-war film, with its talk of settling lasting conflicts and refusing to shy away from the horrors of war (even the Klu Klux Klan sequences, as portrayed by Griffith, were idealistic people attempting to eradicate what they saw as a societal problem, working towards unification of American society... albeit an all white one). At the same time, it is impossible to deny Griffith's extraordinary proficiency as a storyteller, and the war sequences crackle with a vivid excitement and tension that most modern war films, despite countless advances in technology and narrative construction, still fail to match. And herein lies the film's seeming conflict of interest: despite lamenting the horrors of war and need for resolution and peace, it becomes quickly clear just how crucially exciting the battle sequences are, as if simultaneously romanticising the conflict and drawing every fiber of exhilarating emotional nuance from it. In Griffith's film, war is both harrowing and fun - a stance even more questionable when applying it to the First World War context increasingly creeping up on the country. In the end, The Birth of a Nation proves the definitive exercise in exploring form versus content: a cinematic triumph and superb example of the persuasive power of film in terms of promoting national identity or enforcing ideological constructs (the fact that it reignited the Klu Klux Klan in the 1920s and allegedly as late as in the 1970s proves testament to its lasting power, despite the inexcusably questionable moral stance) yet one so long, pompous and inexcusably single minded in its racism that very few viewers will truthfully enjoy watching. While there is no denying the film's importance to the history of its industry or even the valid merits of viewing in a contemporary context, it remains a film to be watched with more of a bucket full rather than a grain of salt - a film more to be appreciated rather than fully satisfy.-8/10",8,1,2,9 January 2009
Inglourious Basterds," 'This may be my masterpiece'
","When asked about his reaction to looming viewer expectations regarding his new film in an interview with Empire movie magazine, director Quentin Tarantino was typically frank: 'I want high ideals, I want gigantic expectations, I want people to expect a masterpiece!' And, while such monstrously high self-confidence might be considered an inevitable stumbling ground for any artist, Tarantino remains one of the perilously few contemporary filmmakers who can make good on his boasts. And his new film, Inglourious Basterds is no exception. Cocky, outlandish, self-indulgent and with ambitions the size of a small country, Tarantino's twisted sense of humour pervades the film even to the point of his gleeful misspelling of its title. And while the debate over which film is Tarantino's best remains an eternal one, it is difficult to dispute that his latest is, as the last line in the film itself cheekily suggests, somewhat of a 'masterpiece'. Suffice to say, viewer enjoyment of Tarantino's latest will depend largely on their prior opinion of the director, as Inglourious Basterds only exemplifies the cinematic qualities which made him so infamous in the first place. Unashamedly in love with his characters' voices, Tarantino's script is a typically convoluted affair, devoting scene after scene to trickily worded verbal exchanges monologues in French and German as well as English, which, along with the overlapping strands of parallel narratives and multiple characters, makes the film somewhat cumbersome for viewers expecting two and a half hours of nonstop Nazi-scalping action. But, with an inversion of expectations also typical of its director, the real action lies in the dialogue, as Tarantino ramps up the claustrophobic tension to unbearable levels, loading each speech with layer upon layer of misleading meaning and thinly disguised threat. In the world of Inglourious Basterds, a simple conversation about milk becomes more painfully suspenseful than a holdup at gunpoint, making the film's two and a half hour running time fly by while remaining utterly engrossing. Of course, it would be foolish to expect a credibly historic piece, and Tarantino, despite his keen attention to stylized period costuming, props and sets, is gleefully content to butcher any semblance to WW2 reality, re-writing the history books as glibly as he plunders influences from past films. While the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone are clearly on Tarantino's mind (complete with Ennio Morricone musical cues), he similarly borrows the aggressive, frontward propelling sense of purpose from military films such as The Dirty Dozen, giving his film a feeling of being simultaneously free-form and whimsical yet brutally pointed and focused. And, of course, it is impossible to ignore how sadistically funny the film is, all violence, mayhem and incomparable tension aside, as, in typical Tarantino fashion, the viewer is made to laugh both from sheer nerves and in reaction to the sheer audacious breadth of the spectacle on display, including a finale which twists expectations to the extent of truly needing to be seen to be believed. Also commendable is Tarantino's use of film itself, setting his climax in a movie theatre, and demonstrating the power of cinema to inspire, corrupt and destroy, both figuratively and literally, lending nuance upon nuance of self-reflexive themes to be unearthed. For all its sadistic relishing in Nazi-killing and gleeful dodging conventions, Tarantino's film is as hard thinking as it is hard hitting, enjoyable on so many levels simultaneously.Of course, characterization in a Tarantino film is also approached from a direction unlike any other, as characters are introduced, given detailed backstories, then flippantly discarded, giving a larger than life, almost cartoonish feel to most of the acting (Hitler and Goebbels certainly emerge as more pantomime than anything else). Such an approach seems to be one relished by Brad Pitt, flat out hilarious as Ltd. Aldo Raine, the leader of the 'Basterds', skewering his star charisma with malicious delight and savouring every last accent-mutilated syllable of his dialogue. Yet, as public opinion has suggested, the true show stealer lies in its antagonist, Christoph Waltz's Nazi Col. Hanz Landa. Deviously charming and delightfully malicious, Waltz commands the screen with an eerie precision, making sense of every contradictory character trait and morphing them into a character so larger than life, so devastatingly memorable, impossible not to hate yet equally impossible not to secretly like, that Landa is unlikely to be forgotten for years to come. In contrast is similar breakout star Mélanie Laurent, continuing Tarantino's tradition of strong female protagonists, as vengeful Jewish cinema proprietor Shoshanna, bottling a quiet dignity and furious indignant rage into a character almost as memorable and impactful as Landa. And no Tarantino film would be complete without an equally colourful supporting cast, as Eli Roth chomps scenes with brutal delight as the 'Basterd' known as 'The Bear Jew'. Michael Fassbender delivers the most realistic and ultimately sympathetic character as an undercover British officer, showing the charisma, charm and magnetic presence of a true star. Diane Kruger is similarly superb as a defecting German movie star, contrasting her character's flamboyant public persona with her gritty desperation and remaining consistently watchable throughout. Daniel Brühl does a careful job of rendering likable a spoiled Nazi propaganda hero without making him excessively sympathetic, delivering an equally masterful performance, and August Diehl is chillingly memorable as a suspicious Nazi in the fabled 'tavern scene'. Finally, watch for Mike Meyers as a British general, whose inclusion appears just one more gleefully irreverent poke at convention, and the tendency for the historical film genre to take itself too seriously. Inglourious Basterds could be described in an exhausting abundance of ways: strange, daring, audacious, inventive, hilarious, terrifying, thought provoking, exhilarating, gleefully amoral and chock full of unexpected dodging or inversion of cliché. Yet, in the end, the most fitting way of describing the film is yet another of its director's staggeringly arrogant yet justifiable boasts: 'a big f*cking night at the movies'. And there is little more audiences could ask for. -9.5/10",10,2,9,6 September 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," War – here's what it's good for
","Forget 'I am your father' - Rogue One features the greatest surprise in the entire Star Wars franchise, one that had our entire cinema gasping aloud in shock and disgruntlement. This long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away begins without a title crawl. Yes. For this is a 'Star Wars Story,' not a Star Wars Film, and director Gareth Edwards takes advantage of the distinction. It's unmistakably part of the same intergalactic umbrella, with familiar names, faces, sound effects, and all manner of exhilarating adventure mayhem that is the quintessence of Star Wars. But this prequel soars - a grim, gritty tale, without a scrap of kid- friendly pandering, and the stakes have never been higher. It's also, functionally, the only film in the series that could feasibly stand on its own, and is all the more eminently compelling entertainment for it.Intriguingly, what helps Rogue One stand out is how transparently it puts the War back into Star Wars. With the main plot line anchored on a Dirty Dozen, WWII-style espionage caper, and side setpieces very much geared on the casualties of war – try explaining how the bit with the former Jedi temple occupied by the Imperial militia is an overt intertext to the U.S. army's incursion into Afghanistan to your kids – Edwards accomplishes what Lucas never quite could, and extracts genuine tension and threat from the brewing space fascists and their looming superweapon. The Star Wars franchise has always flirted with political subtext, but never at the behest of adventure or fun (until under the claws of Episodes I-III and Lucas' hours of Senate debates). Here, politics are at the forefront, as the Rebel Alliance is crippled from the inside by bureaucratic infighting, and sects of extremist offshoots (Forrest Whitaker shines in a too brief role as a guerrilla fanatic whose motives are almost as questionable as the Empire's). It's a surprisingly nuanced parable of political dissonance, and characters visibly struggle with questionable actions in the name of a righteous cause. Nonetheless, this is still Star Wars, not the latest Oliver Stone manifesto, and Edwards remembers to find moments of flinty humour throughout to keep proceedings from becoming too bleak (the always wonderful Alan Tudyk's sour comic relief droid goes a long way). Look for the usual glut of fan-friendly cameos, integrated more tastefully than The Force Awakens, including some de-aged (heLLO Carrie Fisher!), or even reanimated (welcome back, Peter Cushing...? Eep...) through CGI which would be seamlessly convincing were it not so eerily unsettling. The return of Lord Vader, of course, is staggeringly awesome, though thankfully Edwards doesn't milk it, and he's around long enough for audiences to gasp and cheer, without overstaying his welcome. The absence of John Williams is, of course, sorely felt, but Michael Giacchino fills the void with chirpy aplomb, teasingly dancing around the core Star Wars themes while concocting thrilling new leitmotifs of his own. Still, Rogue One is a War film, and Edwards (perhaps still reeling from the lambasting over his Godzilla's lack of cathartic action payoffs) orchestrates some of the franchise's most stunning mass battles. The first act blowout at the Jedi temple is breathlessly thrilling (where Donnie Yen's dazzlingly choreographed, charmingly cheerful blind swordsman, and Wen Jiang's wryly sardonic human armoury steal the show). But it's the final jaw-dropping blitzkrieg of a beach-storming battle that throws out all the stops: x-wing and tie-fighter dogfights, blasters on the beach, and (squee!) Imperial Walkers unleashed in all their glory. Disney's Marvel superhero films have drawn considerable (and justified) flack for their CGI-bloated finale battles of late, but here Edwards reclaims the trope with one of the most genuinely stunning action set pieces in recent memory. There's also the welcome infusion of something sorely lacking from far too many action blockbusters: consequence. By slotting Rogue One within pre-existing Star Wars canon, we're tacitly aware that all of these characters have dubious chances of survival - why else wouldn't they pop up in A New Hope? So, when they plunge into action, the threat is real that they could be unceremoniously dispatched at any moment, making the action sequences bristle with very rare, tangible tension. Naturally, Edwards pulls out all the stops to get us as invested as possible in this scraggly Star Wars Suicide Squad before dashing our Hopes (ha) as they're eradicated one by one. This is war, after all, and casualties are inevitable.If there's a fleeting criticism, it's that the glut of supporting characters are often given too short shrift to be properly memorable, but they still make for a formidable ensemble. Felicity Jones does a capable job as the battle-hardened Imperial refugee who gradually learns to hope, but she's a bit too bland and placidly stoic to make a proper splash as lead. Diego Luna, conversely, is superbly convincing, practically simmering with charismatic passion and bitterness. Ben Mendelsohn sneers, spits and preens with perfect sinister campiness as the Death Star's overlord, while Riz Ahmed's defecting Imperial pilot flirts with the quirky charisma of a Poe Dameron, but is too underutilized to fully excel. Sadly, the normally excellent Mads Mikkelsen is on sleepy autopilot mode as Jones' 'exposition repository' estranged father, too emotionally absent to sell his Robert Oppenheimer 'reluctant weapon of mass destruction creator' archetype. Between his and Jones' fizzling flatness, the film's emotional core suffers for it.Rogue One may not be quite as euphorically fun or jauntily memorable as its canonical predecessors, but its taut, robust, rich storytelling and grimly spellbinding action make it an eminently compelling watch, as Star Wars flick or standalone action romp. If nothing else, the takeaway is this: Disney's announcement of a new Star Wars film roughly every year left many audiences reeling with worry of blatant cash grabs, and creative stagnation through supersaturation. But, if the care and thought invested into Rogue One are any indication, we may yet still have... Hope.-8.5/10",8,2,6,21 December 2016
Iron Man 2," 'Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I'm doing'
","Particularly effective introductions can manage to encapsulate the essence of a character within a single brief scene. Iron Man 2 manages to do one better by introducing its protagonist in a fashion capturing him to a tee, but also representative of the majority of his film's faults and successes. Seen from behind, Iron Man leaps out of an airplane, soaring through the air (pausing only to be inelegantly hit by a firework) to land before a cascade of screaming fans, backed by bikini clad dancing women, his armour removed to reveal grinning, gregarious millionaire industrialist Tony Stark. It should be exhilarating and sure to raise an immediate vast grin, and yet something feels... off. Perhaps the aerial descent or Stark's smirking on a revolving platform feel slightly too long, the pace seemingly compromised for the sake of matching AC/DC's 'Shoot to Thrill' (an inclusion which, given their 'Greatest Hits' release titled after the film, feels gratuitous). Perhaps the sequence feels too forced to fully enjoy its excitement and offbeat humour. Upon the film's culmination, such exact sentiments of enjoyment yet vague distance remain intact, making Iron Man 2 an indisputably fun watch, but one which feels unmistakably (for lack of a better word) assembled. The first Iron Man was that true rarity: as close as Hollywood will come to a big budget grass roots blockbuster. Financed by the up and coming Marvel studios (for the first time in charge of their own superhero characters) and helmed by a director with only bland kid films as credentials who championed improvisation over a cemented script, with a formerly 'uninsurable' actor as the relatively obscure hero, the lack of expectations led to the remarkable combination of those involved both striving to prove themselves and taking the liberty to play around. Such ambition, innovation and earnest soul are what Iron Man 2 seems to lack, replaced by a fusion of by-the-numbers rekindling of successful components of the first. One can almost smell the checklist: 'inner demons leading to progressive change, unrequited sexual tension, scene of Stark building an invention, a final showdown with big armoured foe' (a woefully brief and brainless anticlimax for a film continually gearing up to a final showdown), while new, interesting thematic links (Stark's boast of 'privatizing world peace') remain tragically underexplored. Furthermore, while returning director Jon Favreau mercifully manages to balance his plethora of new characters enough to avoid the 'villain overload' syndrome plaguing many such comic book blockbusters (Spider-Man 3 and Batman and Robin most grotesquely), all feel like quick sketches rather than truly realized characters, despite the formidable array of star talent. Similarly, all characters being stuck in different subplots, none of them particularly enthralling, makes for jumbled focus and awkward pacing (Stark's 'evolution' in particular transpires far too early) draining any sense of scope or threat from the film. In many ways, the film feels like a bridging gap towards future superhero smash The Avengers more than self-sustained narrative, with surprisingly little happening despite the flashy trappings.The fault, it would seem, lies with new screenwriter Justin Theroux, who seems determined to take the genuinely fresh array of characters and situations and shoehorn them into tiresomely contrived narrative arcs (the 'father drama' of both Stark and antagonist Ivan Vanko is particularly dreary), none of which feel genuine or compelling. John Debney's musical score serves to further sink in the cliché, his collection of optimistic, soaring strings a severe drop in quality from the former film's spunkier rock score. That said, only the most jaded would entirely dismiss such an unashamedly enjoyable action smash on account of a clumsy script, and Iron Man 2's redemption lies in its fun factor. In spite of his film's seemingly heavy thematic core (revenge, betrayal of friends, looming mortality), Favreau is wise enough to keep the tone brisk, breezy and often hilarious, and, while still keeping action sequences sparse in favour of character development, sustaining a commendably scrappy energy when things start to go boom (with the exceptions of an embarrassingly ill- advised armour-clad drunken throwdown and the aforementioned dud of a climax). As frustratingly entangled as the film may become, boring is a word which never comes to mind. In spite of less screen time, looming death and a more ambiguously unlikeable characterization, the peerlessly quirky charisma and cocky sparkle of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark remains immutable, while his armour-clad alter-ego is as slick and captivating as ever. Enormously more watchable than any other contemporary protagonist, Downey Jr. (while incrementally flatter than his first crack at the role) remains easily worth the admission price singlehandedly. Despite moments recalling her former exasperated charm, Gwyneth Paltrow struggles to make alienated love interest Pepper Potts much of a compelling counterpart to Stark, and Don Cheadle (apart from a superb comic denouement) offers stern composure and wounded frowns to the best of his considerable talent as Stark's military liaison buddy James Rhodes but is given few moments to truly shine, even when clad in the formidable War Machine armour. Mickey Rourke's imbalanced Whiplash feels a definitive case of a brilliant characterization improperly handled by the script, yet Rourke bleeds enough vindictive menace and abrasive weirdness to make his otherwise stock villain tremendously effective nonetheless. Sam Rockwell's rival industrialist Justin Hammer is an exquisitely irritating shadow of Stark, his simpering arrogance threatening to steal a show otherwise cemented by Downey Jr. However, the unfeasibly gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, despite her best attempts at contributing steely dignity to the fray, feels blatantly reduced to spandex-clad, vicious action-unleashing eye candy. Still, when she kicks ass so transcendentally it's hard to argue. While still lively and fun, Iron Man 2 feels too scattershot to come close to the emotional resonance or high-flying exhilaration of its predecessor. With any luck, the sinister shroud of inferred studio string-pulling can be shaken off by round three, that the Golden Avenger might reach his soaring potential once again.-7/10",6,1,3,8 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," All of the heart of typical Apatow fare at the expense of memorable laughs
","While the melding of genuine human interplay, romantic comedy tropes and obnoxious male directed humour has seldom proved an easy course to navigate, with many such efforts leaning too strongly on one aspect at the risk of compromising the others, recent comedy superstar Judd Apatow proved particularly deft at manoeuvring the balance between them. Striking a particular chord of vulgar, bawdy humour and sweet sentiment, the unusual balance has recently become almost a subgenre in itself, permeating the recent comedy mainstream. As such, Forgetting Sarah Marshall (which Apatow produced) aims to keep a good thing going, striving for the same unique hybrid which past hits such as Knocked Up and Superbad championed. However, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, try as it might, cannot help but pale in the shadow of its predecessors, offering all of the heart of typical Apatow fare at the expense of exceptional laughs. Which is not to say the film has nothing to offer comedically, but rather than the memorable factor of it is essentially reduced to two bookending setpieces: the much hyped naked break-up which proves the catalyst setting the plot in motion, and an inspired climax far too good to give away but which proves the indisputable high point of the film. It is the content in the middle which lags, with well intentioned gags such as mopey protagonist Peter (Segel) attempting to overcome his sorrows post break-up through a series of one night stands (though an exceptionally funny montage sequence proves a standout), and eventually fleeing to Hawaii only to find his celebrity ex-girlfriend (Bell) also vacationing there with her new beau (Brand). While the premise offers a tantalising wealth of comedic potential, the execution is less satisfying, with many gags being overly drawn out or overdone to the point of the comedy waning, despite the occasional standout laugh. It hardly helps when the film becomes drenched in sentiment and a groan-worthy moral of striving for one's dreams being battered over the audiences' collective heads and falls prey to the typical Apatow pitfall of feeling 10-20 minutes overlong. Similarly, director Nicholas Stoller never appears to have an entirely firm grasp of how to treat his protagonist, both at times milking pathos and viewer sympathies from Peter's predicament while otherwise portraying him as weak and pathetic and extracting cruel laughs from his moping, making it more difficult to empathise with the protagonist. Granted, such a dualistic approach does accurately convey the mix of of sympathy and annoyance towards those struggling after a break-up, but a more balanced and cohesive portrayal would have made empathy with the protagonist all the more possible and appealing. However, such a double-edged complaint also mirrors one of the film's foremost strength: the authenticity and credibility of its human interactions. Scripted by star Jason Segel, the characters and their interaction with one another ring laudably true, making the film easily a sufficiently charming and amusing way to spend the time, if not as riotously funny as it feels it should be. One of the later performers to join the pantheon of 'flawed, schlubbish yet earnestly lovable' Apatow heroes, Jason Segel easily exudes easily enough charm to carry the occasionally shaky film, delivering a performance which feels both honest and irreverently silly enough to easily justify his upgrading to leading man. Mila Kunis similarly boasts a unique charm which manages to encompass being both abrasive and tender, making the romantic tension between her and Segel all the more fresh and enticing. Kristen Bell, despite struggling with an underwritten character as Peter's actress ex-girlfriend manages to bring a refreshing honesty to her performance, thankfully defying an easy stereotype to fall into. Similarly, Russell Brant raises several laughs as her spacey, pretentious new age rocker boyfriend, an essential spark of vibrant comedic life which always serves to benefit the picture. The same goes for Apatow stalwarts Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd, both making hilarious use of minuscule supporting parts as an obsessive waiter and brain-dead surfing instructor respectively. Occasionally clunky and overly syrupy, Forgetting Sarah Marshall remains sweet and likable enough throughout to make it worth its while, though it suffers by comparison to its superior Apatow production predecessors. Nonetheless, what it lacks in belly laughs, the film makes up for in heart, making it an enjoyable if slightly forgetful film worth seeing for any fans of the genre.-6.5/10",7,2,4,16 March 2009
Zootopia," The opposite of unpleasant... Pleasant.
","In 1992, cartoonist Art Spiegelman won the Pulitzer Prize for Maus, which appropriated cuddly, anthropomorphic animals (not at all unlike Disney creatures) for a parable about racism, discrimination, and survival, circa WWII. Flash-forward 24 years, and we finally have Disney's rebuttal. And those years have been good to the House of Mouse, now enough of a franchise super-giant to fire off quirky B-tier flicks like Zootopia, confident enough to surpass Disney's usual standard of impeccable visuals and emotional storytelling to also really be About Something. Zootopia is razor-sharp, outrageously clever, bustling with urgent thematic subtext, and heartfelt enough to reach the realm of Disney classics sure to be heralded as essential canonical viewing for generations of children and adults henceforth.Following (the vastly inferior) The Good Dinosaur as the second consecutive Disney release championing a thriving societal infrastructure where humans don't exist (hmm...), Zootopia is a dazzlingly dense and textured realm almost too detailed to take in at first glance, forcing cinema viewers to acclimatize to the consistent unrequited urge to pause and contemplate. When our protagonist, earnest Officer Hopps (magnificently emotive, infectiously giddy Ginnifer Goodwin), arrives at Zootopia, the film is content to momentarily become a travelogue, drinking in, in a sweeping pan shot, the regions, and size/species/climate sub-communities of the city. Don't worry, though - we'll get to revisit them all later). Before you can think of a better pun than 'face the yaks', Zootopia has transformed into a buddy (or should I say BUNNY - I thought of one!) cop mystery adventure. As Hopps pairs with irrepressible con-fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman at his most laconic, smugly hilarious), they dive into a romp full of hilarity, exhilarating sequences (including a slew of chases/tussles highlighting the unique physicality of each animal present), and thematic mediation on xenophobia, ideology, and societal power hierarchies. Y'know - kid stuff.Zootopia isn't subtle about being just as issue-driven as story-driven, but nor should it be. Here, the parable of civilized mammals 'going savage' (an interesting contribution to the nature/nurture debate in itself) serves as the perfect catalyst to ignite age-old discriminatory tensions between tenuously co-habitating predator and prey (including some genuinely upsetting sequences), in a fashion perfectly suited to contextualize privilege, racism, and wage and influence-gaps to children - heck, even for adults. But in case that gets too heavy (and Zootopia, while jaunty and fast-paced, has its fair share of vintage Disney darkness), it's tempered with some on-point one- liners to snarkily soften the blow ('a bunny can call another bunny cute, but you can't'/'you can't just touch a sheep's wool!!'), with only the occasional clunky line reeking of kid-friendly rewrites to distract from the revelry. For the kids, there are more Frozen and other Disney nods than you can count (including a genius Alan Tudyk cameo I'll weasel out of spoiling here). For the adults: inspired nudist colony gags, and riffs on the Godfather and Breaking Bad. And yes: that sloth DMV scene is just as funny in theatres as in the umpteen trailers you've seen it in. Trust me.Still, amidst all the ideas, heart, and cutting dialogue, the voice cast are what really hit home. Apart from the superb Goodwin and Bateman, who share delightfully sparky, and sometimes surprisingly emotional banter, the distinctive boom of Idris Elba and bark of J.K. Simmons lend welcome support, while Jenny Slate mumbles so many (yup, I'm going there) sheepish witticisms in the background she's almost worth a second viewing singlehandedly.Zootopia doesn't quite hit the soaring, transcendent emotional heights associated with classic Lion King/Beauty and the Beast era Disney (though many of its smaller moments are just as poignant and well-orchestrated in their own way), as it's really its own (guffaw) animal. But, as a snappier, more expansive, socially conscious cousin, it's still an essential addition to the Disney family, and one that almost insists upon revisiting, if only to properly do justice to. Rich, vibrant, and clever enough to make audiences young and old (night)howl with laughter, Zootopia is the confident work of a peerless studio operating at the top of their game, and necessary viewing as cinema, far surpassing mere animated entertainment.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be off trying to beat that stupidly catchy Shakira chorus out of my head. I moose be rid of it; I can bearly stand it!(...I really otter stop now. But rhino want to. I'd say it's an ox-ident, but you're a shrew-d reader, and I know you wouldn't take that lion down.)-9.5/10",9,9,20,11 March 2016
The Impossible," The real disaster proceeds the wave
","We've had our share of 'torture porn.' Now, we've evidently entered the age of 'disaster/survival porn.' And, although the latter is far more hopeful, less sadistic, and infinitely better Oscar bait (you're welcome, Leo), they have more in common than you'd think. And J.A. Bayona's The Impossible is all we need by way of explanation: a humbling, powerful story of tragedy and resilience transmuted into such tastelessly exploitative Hollywood schlock that the real feeling of survival comes from making it all the way through to the end credits. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was particularly horrific insofar as it was so unexpected, but it's a quality rarely evident in Bayona's account of it. Things start promising, as the initial scenes of inane banter of our posh family on Christmas vacation in Thailand are inoffensively credible, pleasant with just the right whiff of foreboding. Just when we start to let our guard down, we're blindsided by a tsunami that's as terrifyingly stunning a cinematic set piece as we could imagine. In terms of disaster spectacle, The Impossible excels, blending flawless CGI and practical effects to capture the horror of the wall of water and devastation it unleashed in a gruesomely engrossing fashion, shot so abruptly and breathlessly that it's wholly immersive, and bereft of distracting Hollywood affectations. The terror of the tsunami contrasting with the beauty of the panoramic Thailand scenery is poignant in itself, as the serenity of the beachside landscapes are strewn with fastidiously recreated apocalyptic wreckage and debris. Taken as a short film chronicling the experience of the tsunami itself, The Impossible is excellent. But this isn't enough. At the risk of clumsy non-sequitur, the only thing dancing through my head as The Impossible unfolded was Michael Caine in The Prestige musing 'It isn't enough to make something vanish; you have to bring it back,' and how inappropriate such a Hollywood anthem can feel superimposed onto real tragedy. Granted, the real life story of the Álvarez/Belón family surviving and reuniting throughout the disaster is astonishing and inspiring, but it's done a disservice here, warped by dubious Hollywood social politics and gruesome emotional manhandling. Focusing on a single privileged white family over all the Thai locals (let alone the asinine recasting of the original Spanish source family) who were largely more ravaged and destroyed by the tsunami sits uncomfortably, and makes the film's increasingly broad scrabbling for a 'feel-good ending' distressingly tone-deaf. 'Based on a true story' nullifies spoilers, so we know all five members of the central family are going to survive, and Bayona contriving cumbersome sequences of 'how will they find each other?!?' dramatic irony amidst a backdrop of all the broken families, Thai and tourist alike, who haven't been so lucky, grates increasingly. Fernando Velázquez's cloying musical score only makes it worse. There is some solace in some of the hopeful beats amidst the refugee medical evacuation procedure which breathe more genuinely (it's nigh impossible - ha - to repress a deluge of smiles witnessing Tom Holland reuniting separated survivor families in the hospital). Still, Bayona climaxing with a sequence of Naomi Watts' protagonist reliving a flashback fetishizing each individual debris wound while caught in the tsunami before clawing her way up to the surface in agonizing slow-mo, is so idiotically offensive and grossly manipulative that we have to continually remind ourselves that it's through no fault of Watts' work or her real-life equivalent that we'd almost rather she just stay under the water here. The cast, to their credit, are superbly committed to conveying the agony of their nightmarish scenario, even if most of their dialogue is calling out each other's names. Watts conveys the weight of her torment remarkably convincingly, while wisely weaving in subtle notes of irritable humour throughout, which helps stave off us getting tired of her howling and whimpering in pain for an hour and a half straight (she could have given a useful note or two to Leo in The Revenant in this regard). Ewan McGregor is as charismatic as ever, but he shoulders the worst of the film's melodramatic suffering and operatic screaming, and grows tiresome very quickly, particularly when his character makes the jaw-dropping decision to abandon two of his young sons to look for his wife and son #3. As such, it's 'soon- to-be-Spider-Man' Tom Holland who walks away with the show here. Embodying battered, weary resilience stupendously in his slight, springy frame, whether he's belligerently yelling at his mother to stop vomiting blood or breaking into an irrepressible grin at seeing other families reunited, there's never a moment he's not viscerally believable. He's the spark of life and hope that keeps the film afloat, and we miss him desperately when he's not on screen. While The Impossible has its moments, thanks largely to the power of its big- budget tsunami recreation and strong work from Watts and Holland, it's mostly useful as an illustration of Hollywood's general inability to appropriately do justice to events of large scale tragedy and suffering beyond the sensory onslaught of the spectacle itself. 2009's Tsunami: Caught On Camera tells the same story through compiled found footage and interviews with survivors, and captures the devastation and inspiration of the disaster and those who survived it in a far more honest fashion. Unless you're a CGI buff, or keen fan of the cast (or just scoping out a pre-Civil War Spider-Man), see that instead. -6/10",6,0,3,1 June 2016
12 Angry Men," 'I don't know what the truth is. I don't suppose anybody will ever really know'
","Generally the premise of twelve middle aged men locked into a room arguing would hardly be considered the basis for particularly riveting or dramatic cinema, with theatrical potential at best, but hardly dynamic or visual enough to appeal to a mass audience. It can only be considered merciful that such an attitude was not one shared by television director Sidney Lumet, who instead seized advantage of a myriad of factors which could have resulted in a catastrophic film (a solitary location, a hasty shoot, budget constraints) and somehow extracted from them an effort to which the billing of 'one of the greatest motion pictures of all time' would be a title hardly disputed by the general public. Lumet's persistence in the face of adversity suggests he may have scented something great in the making, and the raw energy and crackling intensity 12 Angry Men generates is a testament that such dedication was entirely justified. While the legal thriller is always a precarious genre, walking an uncertain line between being plausible in a real life context while avoiding being too slow and talky to appeal to an audience, Lumet centers in upon the inherent drama in the court setting, while consciously shying away from the tendency to approach such cases in black and white terms. What makes Fonda's Juror #8's solitary quest to sway his fellow jurors all the more compelling is the moral ambiguity of the situation. Fonda is not a white knight crusader unflappably convinced of the righteousness of his actions or the accused party's innocence - in fact, he openly admits that his actions may be resulting in the release of a guilty murderer. Instead, Fonda becomes a crusader for the ideal of truth and plausible evidence, notions that Lumet's film toys with throughout as its Rashomon-style construction of past events through various uncertain accounts becomes a more philosophical meditation on society's constant yearning for information and knowledge. Taking similar notes from Hitchcock's Rear Window, the film addresses the voyeuristic insatiable desire to be a privileged spectator, but crucially, just like the jurors, the audience is continually kept in the dark despite similar desperation to piece together a definitive account of the crime committed. Eventually the conclusion can be drawn that it scarcely matters in the end, as the facts of the case have become so twisted and warped by human preconceptions that only gut instinct and an earnest lust for honesty and justice can hope to prop up a system so reliant on fallible misconstructions. And although Lumet draws out the tension surrounding the eventual verdict to uncomfortably taut levels, by the end, the crux of the film appears to scarcely center around the court case itself anymore, the focus subtly shifting instead towards the men deliberating it. The jury's cross section of middle aged men serves as a microcosm for 1950s variations on masculine identity, slowly but surely sweating away their polished exteriors to reveal the flaws, prejudices and hatreds concealed underneath. Masterfully tackling sensitive thematic issues such as class and age discrimination (while the teenaged suspect is initially dismissed as being a dangerous youth, the elderly woman witness' testimony is similarly scrutinized due to her age) the film dares to expose the dark secrets lurking beyond the wholesome exteriors of 1950s society without ever coming across as excessively heavy handed or moralistic. Indeed, the film could hardly be farther from it, as Lumet's remarkable deftness of touch makes the picture riveting as much through its subtlety as its heated emotional grandstanding, using slyly inconspicuous zooms and tensely circling camera-work to unobtrusively underscore the white knuckled drama of the scene without unnecessarily wrenching emotion out of the scene or performers. Perhaps the film may be a few shades away from perfection, carrying a whiff of being overly coincidental and slightly unrealistic through having the jurors swayed one by one, but the unexpected moment of quiet humanity culminating the picture is a textbook example of the rare sort of uplifting ending which can ring true, and it is near impossible to dispute the raw power and honest intensity building up to that point, making the potentially dubious logic of the narrative easy to ignore and exceedingly difficult to resist. Such a dialogue heavy story relies upon hefty acting clout to achieve full effect, and Lumet's uniformly exceptional cast does not disappoint, with not a single performer in the delightfully colourful and versatile collection of characters delivering an unsatisfactory or unbelievable performance. No one could have been better cast as the stoic protagonist Juror #8 than the time etched monolith of American honesty and decency that is Henry Fonda, and Fonda radiates the ideal quiet confidence to draw in the support of the audience as much as his fellow jurors. Fonda's unassuming lack of pretension makes him far more than the traditional populist hero, and his eshewal of soapbox moralizing in favour of calculated appeals to reason make his message all the more plausible, and his character all the more timeless. Lee J. Cobb similarly shines as the abrasive Juror #3, with Cobb's fleeting moments of tortured humanity barely discernible under an appalling mask of unsavoury characterization making his role far deeper than a simply stubborn oppositional force, and far more resonant. Martin Balsam is also a noteworthy presence as the level headed Juror #1, with a quirky edginess underscoring his appeals for reason, bringing a potentially simply expositional character to highly watchable life. What could have made for a plodding, overly literary waste of time is instead transformed into crackling movie magic, bursting with barely stifled raw emotion and pulsing with social significance. 12 Angry Men is just about as sublime a legal thriller as one could hope to find, its reputation as one of the strongest American films of all time holding up, and the half a century since its release failing to dilute its power and abject fascination in the slightest.-10/10",10,2,3,18 February 2009
Public Enemies," Sturdy, yet over-familiar and under-explored; a tragic fumbling of Mann's playing to strengths
","A Michael Mann film delving into the criminal psyche, paralleling the obsessive pursuits of cop and criminal, peppered with breathless shootouts and challenging new visual aesthetics. Sound familiar? Indeed, as Mann has been exploring similar subject matter throughout his film-making career, there would seem no more fitting director for Public Enemies, profiling infamous depression era bank robber John Dillinger and his relationships with a culture alternatively abhorring or hero-worshipping him and a law enforcement bureau tenaciously hunting him and branding him public enemy number one. But, as sad a realisation as it is, Mann's being the obvious choice to direct sadly detracts from his film's quality, as, with so many prerequisites for the subject matter, it increasingly feels that Public Enemies, for all its accolades, has preciously little new to say in regards to the gangster genre or in general, making it feel like an impressively realised, but inescapably overdone story.While pinning down why Public Enemies feels like an unsatisfying watch in the midst of so many promising attributes proves elusive, the prevailing complaint is the familiarity factor. If anyone were to find more to say in the gangster or cop genres it would be Mann, but one of the most authoritative voices in both appears tongue-tied, unable to generate content which has not been ground into the mires of predictability. Rather than being an immersive experience, the film feels sketched in point form, hitting all the familiar notes (heists, a romance on the side, betrayal, desperation) without finding anything new to say. And while Mann's copious adherence to factual period detail is particularly impressive, guaranteeing that his film at least credibly looks and feels like the 1930s, there is more to the story of Dillinger than he chooses to explore, making his film's familiarity unattributable to his sticking to the facts. There is an intriguing self-reflexivity element in making a film about a figure obsessed with movies and who styled himself after them, only to in turn inspire generations of movie villains after his public persona, yet this is merely one of many potential approaches Mann ignores in lieu of the conventional. Similarly, the character of Dillinger may be a paradoxical enigma, but the film seems to simply take it for granted rather than giving the audience the opportunity to see what defines or motivates Dillinger - his legendary charisma, focus, ethics, showiness, etc. While glimpses emerge (a memorable sequence showing crowds of people cheering as he passes, arrested, in a police car and there are hints of his living for the moment and not envisioning a future), one still gets the feeling than a more conclusive and contemporarily relevant take on the story existed within the project, which somehow became obscured and lost along the way. Apart from the occasional high point and a memorably resonant ending, Mann's film seems to simply drift along, never quite ensnaring the viewer's focus as it should. The familiarity of the story also impacts one's enjoyment of Mann's telling, his typical attention to detail and nuance make the film feel overlong and dragging rather than engaging. Nonetheless, overdone story or not, there are few who can convey a crime film in as thrilling a fashion as Mann, and his usual flair for amplifying nail-biting tension and delivering expansive, inventive and jaw dropping shootout sequences does not disappoint (although it is frustrating to see the dazzling cinematography of many of the gunfights marred by unnecessary shakycam, making it difficult to see anything happening). Unfortunately, Mann's initially bold experiment of high resolution digital filming, aiming for a gritty, realistic look backfires, resulting in a grainy, out of focus look which literally hurts the eyes, making the 140 minute running time hardly a pleasant watch. But, even more frustratingly, the visuals are confusingly inconstant, with some scenes nearly indecipherable and others pristinely clear with glossy Hollywood lighting and composition. Mann's usual flair for appropriately stylised music feels similarly on hiatus, with a musical score which generally feels overbearing or downright out of place, apart from certain moments (the recurring heist theme) which click with his usual precision. More commendable is the valiant attempt of Johnny Depp to redeem his under-explored character, offering an excellent blend of icy precision, quiet smirking confidence and a winking sense of fun - indeed, had his character been explored more thoroughly, his Dillinger could easily have been a character for the ages. Christian Bale impressively delivers steely reserve to his tenacious fed Melvin Purvis, but his character is tragically deprived of a backstory or context of any sort, leaving Bale struggling to redeem a painfully bland character (when an ending title announces his character's suicide the year after the film culminates, the viewer is left cold, with no real emotional attachment or sense of enough character to fully empathise). Despite mastering delightful arrays of charm and wounded concern, Marion Cotillard similarly flounders to rise above a tragic lack of character, dimming her and Dillinger's love story, the film's emotional centrepiece. Stephen Graham and David Wenham contribute much needed energy to the film as fellow lawbreakers Baby Face Nelson and Pete Pierrepont respectively, even if they too could benefit from further character exploration, but Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover feels irritating and unnecessary, forgettably chomping scenery to no viable effect. While Mann's film is far from a failure (and in a cultural vacuum would likely be quite brilliant), it becomes increasingly unsatisfactory through the knowledge that everything good about it has been done better, often by the same parties involved. Therefore, while Public Enemies may offer a mature, impeccably researched and often thrilling profile of an infamous criminal, more often than not it sadly feels unnecessary, leaving one instead yearning for the more engaging films it took influence from. -6/10",6,2,4,8 July 2009
Spider-Man 2," Is it any wonder he's stilled billed as 'amazing'?
","When I heard a sequel was being made to the original Spider-Man movie, I admit that I had my doubts as to whether it could be pulled off. Sure, Raimi and co. did a great job with the first movie, creating not only a faithful comic book adaptation, but a great movie in its own right, but the usual 'sequel issue' looms into view: a well done and successful movie is made, but then the sequel is rushed out a year or two later which turns out to be less than successful, and the entire series is remembered on a bad note. I liked the idea of a Spider-Man 2, but I didn't want it to ruin the memory of the original. Turns out I had nothing to worry about at all.Raimi bestows upon us a masterpiece, easily equaling if not surpassing the first in quality and enjoyability. Unlike most sequels, which turn out with a very shabby plot, attempted to be covered up by stuffing in as much action as they possibly can, we actually spend more time with Peter Parker out of costume than behind the mask of Spider-Man. These long sequences spent with Peter Parker's friends and family as he struggles to solve his various personal problems risk losing our attention, but fortunately, Spider-Man will rush out to beat on some criminals at just the right moment to keep us interested.Raimi himself uses the directorial freedom granted by a sequel to allow his quirky sense of humour to permeate the film much more visibly than in the first movie. He uses techniques such as having the scene go entirely black except for the eye of Spider-Man's costume as a scene transition, or having the camera perform a dissolve effect, representing Doc Ock's progressing insanity. Such liberties you can't usually get away with in a movie, but Raimi finds a way to make them work. However, the main problem I had with Spider-Man 2 is that the 'slow scenes' drag on far too long. Far too much time is devoted to nothing but Peter Parker walking along the street, or running with a determined look on his face, without even any dialogue. I think these parts should have been edited down to about a quarter of their length, to decrease the likelihood of them appearing boring, unnecessary and out of place.The visual effects are much improved - Spidey looks and moves better than ever! And the addition of Dr Octopus and his four metal tentacles to the script gives the FX people plenty to play around with. The tentacles were apparently part puppetry and part CGI, but however they did it, the tentacles looked and acted excellent. This also opened up an opportunity for much more intense fight scenes than in the first movie, with Doc Ock and Spidey crawling up and down the walls, bashing at each other all the while.Unlike the Batman series, which threw in new actors every time, destroying any sense of continuity, all the principal actors from the first film return to play their characters once more. As the man behind the mask (for part of the time anyway) Tobey Maguire gives another solid performance. (in spite of what British Tabloids have to say about him out of character) He offers a lot more insight into the character of Peter Parker, and the motives that drive him. Kirsten Dunst gives a decent performance as Mary-Jane Watson, but she seems bored in her role, as if she would rather be just about anywhere else at the time, which doesn't help us realize what it is about her that makes Peter love her so. J.K. Simmons, however, gives another enthusiastic performance as the wonderfully horrible J. Jonah Jameson, number one tormentor in Peter Parker's dual life. Noticeable improvements can be seen in the performances of James Franco and Rosemary Harris. Harris as Peter's kindly Aunt May breathes a lot more life into her character this time round as the sole parental figure in Parker's life, ultimately becoming his inspiration for continuing to be Spider-Man.Franco has a real mess of a character to handle in Harry Osborn. Consumed by a lust for vengeance upon Spider-Man, who he believes murdered his father, and trying to take up his father's mantle at the family company, Oscorp, Harry is, whether he realizes it or not, becoming an exact copy of his father. This becomes more clear by the end of the movie. (you'll have to see it for yourself to figure out how) Franco conveys all these emotions convincingly, contrary to the shallow job he did on the first movie. It's good to see him improving as an actor. However, the show stealing performance has to go to Alfred Molina as multi-armed super villain Dr. Octopus. Molina does a spectacular job, perfectly inhabiting the complex character of Otto Octavius. What could have been a campy performance by someone else is a heartfelt and charismatic one in the hands of Molina. By spending some time with Otto and his wife and sensing the love that resonates between them, we know that he isn't really evil - just driven and determined that his 'dream for mankind' will succeed. It's just a darned shame that it seems like his character was stuffed into the script at the last moment just so Spider-Man has somebody to bash about, but fortunately, Molina's performance helps us forget this. Visually, he fits the part perfectly, looking like he just stepped out of the pages of a comic book, and his evil little smile was truly chilling! Molina put everything he had into the part to great effect: indeed, he lived, breathed and died Doc Ock. All in all, the Spidey folks throw us a well thought out and very successful sequel. All I can say is 'Bring on round three!'-9.5/10",10,3,3,13 August 2004
127 Hours," 'Oops.'
","A film involving its protagonist being stuck in a stationary, claustrophobic environment for the majority of its running time would hardly seem a likely candidate for one of the most kinetic and vibrant films of the year, yet the fact that 127 Hours masters such a contradiction proves testament to the nearly peerless abilities of director Danny Boyle. Working with yet another unorthodox premise, Boyle adapts the episode of Aron Ralston's unforgettable canyoning accident and captivity, and somehow, skirting potential obstacles with subject matter (how to work such a visually stagnant premise cinematically) and audience controversy (early reports of hospitalizations in reaction to the unflinchingly graphic climax) to emerge with yet another unexpectedly triumphant and inspiring cinematic triumph.What is truly impressive is the sense of Boyle contemplating and discarding every potential attempt to work shortcuts with his subject matter, allowing himself to cut away from Ralston's rock-bound captivity with flashbacks and hallucinogenic interludes, but only to a tasteful extent, mirroring Ralston's stream of consciousness while never shying away from the sheer numbing and eroding devastation of being trapped in a solitary, claustrophobic environment for such a duration (the film's title, rather than catchy and gratuitous, feels painfully well chosen upon retrospect). Similarly, Boyle adamantly refuses to bank on the film's two main 'set pieces' - Ralston's being trapped by the rock, and eventually freeing himself - structurally or cinematically (despite a gleeful poke at expectations as Ralston scrabbles for, but neglects to bring, his swiss army knife on his expedition). Rather than Ralston's being trapped being subjected to the expected, clichéd, slow motion, horrified hush, Boyle delivers it as an offhand, abrupt surprise, Ralston himself seemingly taking minutes to make sense of his predicament. In this vein, there remains an emphasis on immediacy and authenticity of experience throughout, before, during and after Ralston's entrapment, with minuscule, throwaway details such as Ralston's methodical laying the contents of his backpack in front of him to best strategize an escape proving just as poignant as anticipated scenes of screaming and sobbing. However, the true shock is, for a picture with such an ominous reputation, just how ultimately rewarding and frequently enjoyable a watch Boyle's film is, capturing moments of humour (sometimes uncomfortable, sometimes side-splitting) throughout and, in spite of itself, gearing up for an enormously inspiring and uplifting finale. While any other director would likely have succumbed to the temptation of drinking in the gruesomeness of Ralston's escape like a horror movie, Boyle instead frames it within a context of such engrossing introspection, contemplation and decisive stoicism that the graphic footage itself feels, rather than a disturbing money shot, almost besides the point, a mere means to an end in a buildup of overpowering affirmation and propulsion. As wrenching, gruesome and entirely consuming as the film is, the viewer is far more likely to leave the cinema feeling destroyed but cathartically cleansed as traumatized. Similarly, for a film involving extreme claustrophobia, Boyle's film dances with freedom and levity technically, as DP Anthony Dod Mantle's cameras careen around with wild abandon, exploding out of Ralston's tight space to exquisite, expansive extreme wide-angles of the surrounding canyon before plunging back in, and composer A.R. Rahman's musical score bubbles and flits with verve and more solemn reflection. If there is any fault to be found in the film, it lies in Boyle's arguable overstatement of the film's key message, that Ralston finds his predicament ultimately attributable only to his own cockiness and carelessness (the film's explosive beginning captures Ralston in a hyperactive split-screen, juxtaposing him against footage of crowds as if taking excessive pains to stress the alienation soon to come), but even this proves largely excusable if only for the sake of quieting potential banal complaints reducing the film to gratuitous violence. To say that James Franco's performance is career defining would be an understatement, as he wrestles the difficulties of carrying an entire picture while also in a stationary environment with staggering, understated ease. Franco musters such incredible energy in the early sequences of his bustling about like an over-caffeinated surfer that to watch his slow transition into hysterics, self-reevaluation and stubborn resourcefulness proves all the more crushing yet endearingly powerful as result (a sequence of Ralston grilling himself in the style of a talk show interview as to the culpability of his accident epitomizes Franco's incredible gift for charisma, comedy and understated drama simultaneously). While far too naturalistic and un-showy to warrant many (very deserving) award chances, suffice to say that Franco's performance deserves any quantity of accolades and praise.Fuelled by incredible energy, power, and sheer wrenching emotional impact, Boyle's 127 Hours proves a work of staggering innovation and genius whether taken as character study or circumstantial thematic meditation. Horrifying yet deeply uplifting in a single breath and bursting with consummate technical and dramatic skill, Boyle's latest proves yet another unforgettable masterpiece of realism and cinematic dazzle, worth undertaking for all capable of sidestepping squeamishness - the triumphant result is well worth it.-9.5/10",10,0,2,31 January 2011
"I Love You, Man"," Surprisingly easy to love, easier still to laugh at
","A comedy about romance, friendship and social awkwardness - on the surface, I Love You, Man would appear to be just another inane entry into the annals of modern comedy, without a spark of originality, right down to its poster mirroring previous teen smash Superbad's shot of both friends staring cluelessly out at its audience. If anything, such a tendency for immediate dismissal proves testament to the 'don't judge a book by its cover' cliché, as I Love You, Man manages to consistently remain several steps ahead of the sort of film one would be inclined to ignore it as. Despite it seemingly unimaginative premise, the film manages to be both surprisingly insightful (while many such bawdy, Judd Apatow style comedies address issues of masculinity, few tap into the unwritten 'rules' and inherent difficult in going out to find male friends) and far more outrageously funny than it had any right to be. Part of the film's appeal is its ingenious melding of the realistic and comically fantastic. Actors are given the chance to improvise and riff one liners off each other without descending into levels of out of control hysteria (a-la Will Ferrell) while simultaneously retaining a welcome credibility and honesty to their approach. The situation of a soon to be groom finding himself without prospects for a best man going out to meet male friends is highly plausible and ripe with comedic potential, and director John Hamburg toes a careful line of exploiting the humour of the situation without reducing his protagonist to a melancholic sad sack, as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. And the film proves refreshingly sensitive to countless problematic factors in most mainstream comedies, complete with supporting characters given just enough moments to shine hilariously while avoiding caricature (the 'desperate single girl', 'bickering married couple' and 'gay comic relief' figures are seldom so down to earth and believable) and never overshadowing the story itself. In fact, there is only one main common pitfall the film succumbs to - an unfortunate trend in many such buddy bonding comedies (Wedding Crashers, Superbad, etc.) is the unfortunate third act lull, where, seemingly in an attempt to insert pathos and dramatic weight to the otherwise silly story, conflict ensues and the friends have a falling out. However, for almost every such instance, rather than creating the intended more balanced feel to the story, such interludes often forcibly jerk the viewer out of the mood, removing them from the engrossing, flat out silliness, and resulting in them critiquing the inevitably inferior dramatic content and lessening their overall enjoyment of the film. I Love You, Man's interplay with this narrative trend proves to be both a blessing and a curse, as the inevitable parting of ways of the buddy protagonists seems much more forced and unnecessary to the story than in other such films, but, mercifully, it also lasts nowhere near as long, as if Hamburg is wise enough to play to his strengths and keep the tone light and frivolous throughout. Of course in such character driven comedies the cast always serves to either make or break the film, and thankfully the enormously talented collection of players do not disappoint. Perpetual supporting player Paul Rudd is finally promoted to the sort of leading man role he previously sorely lacked, and proves all the better for it as predominantly female friendly soon to be married lead. Apart from being one of the most inherently likable actors working in the film industry, Rudd's sublime comedic timing, moments of awkward goofiness (expect to be quoting many of his fumbled attempts at hip nicknames for months to come) and quiet, measured moments of pathos manage to create one of the most balanced, credible and enormously charismatic lead performers in modern comedy. Paired with Rudd, Jason Segel also demonstrates his strongest work to date, consistently hilarious as a straight talking, brash, eccentric would be womaniser with a heart of gold, and the down to earth chemistry shared by the two makes the film shine. In a predominantly male dominated genre, Rashida Jones also proves refreshingly credible and charming as Rudd's fiancé rather than the usual shrill feminine cartoon such films would offer. The film's supporting cast is also a triumph, with scene stealing Iron Man director Jon Favreau and Jaime Pressly flat out hysterical as a constantly fighting married couple, J.K. Simmons hilariously understated as Rudd's father, Andy Samberg making strong use of limited screen time as Rudd's seduction expert gay brother, and former Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferringo hilariously riffing on his own strong man image as himself. While its unfortunate pre-climax lull prevents I Love You, Man from being the flat out comedic triumph it could have been, the film's masterful blending of romantic comedy tropes, buddy comedy enthusiasm and refreshing, down to earth honesty make it one to remember, easily outshining the vast majority of similar predecessors. Any fans of the stars or similar quirky yet bawdy comedies should consider the film near essential viewing - despite initial skepticism, the result is almost certain to entertain. -8/10",8,2,5,5 May 2009
Batman Returns," The Bat is back, and better than ever
","After 1989 boasted the legendary Dark Knight's triumphant explosion onto movie screens worldwide, a sequel to the smash hit seemed destined to occur. Thus, 1992 heralded the return of both quirky director Tim Burton and actor Michael Keaton stepping into the batsuit once again. However, unlike most sequels which generally at best equal the quality of their predecessor, usually falling terribly short of the mark, Burton's 'Returns' vastly surpasses the original in almost every possible shape and form. While an entertaining film, the first Batman was deeply flawed, a large portion of which was the film was mainly diverted towards showcasing Jack Nicholson's inspired, show stealing performance as homicidal clown prince of crime The Joker. Nicholson's performance was a triumph, but the downside being that because he was shown so often, viewers got almost no time to get to know Keaton's oddball millionaire and edgy crimefighter title character. Burton rectifies this mistake by diverting much more of the focus of his sequel towards Batman himself, while still churning up a fascinating new cauldron of villains and action setpieces. Once again, Burton's wonderfully creative Gothic design comes to play, but 'Returns' shows perhaps his most beautiful scenery yet. The idea for the story to take place at Christmastime was novel, as Burton has several beautifully affecting shots of characters seen through slowly floating snowflakes. The single most affecting shot is the title sequence shot of the baby Penguin's carriage slowly drifting down the snowy river into the sewers, accompanied by Danny Elfman's simply wonderful score, arguably his best to date, save perhaps the Spider-Man films. Batman Returns, as well as being supremely entertaining is also a surprisingly beautiful and moodily shot movie. But Burton also improves on his prior film in other aspects - namely the action sequences have been amped up considerably, and Batman actually does some fighting, unlike the first where it looked like poor Keaton could barely move in the suit. The absence of Prince songs on the soundtrack is... liberating to say the least, namely because it makes more room for Elfman's majestic score, and... honestly, Prince and Batman do not, and should never have mixed. The script also has more memorable and well crafted lines this time round, save those given to Nicholson's Joker, even if the storyline does seem a bit uneven at times (The Penguin seems to be radically altering his master plan about every five minutes, which gets a bit disjointing). The primary cast is nothing less than spectacular, with Keaton giving a much stronger rendition of both his oddball quirky recluse Bruce Wayne, and much more stylish and classy while under the cape and cowl. It's quite a mercy he is given more screen time this time round, as we feel we finally get to know the man behind the mask a bit this time. Danny DeVito makes a terrifying, disturbing and pitiful Penguin, as well as the character and all his foils likely could have been played. Michelle Pfeiffer easily steals the show and creates an iconic femme fatale character as the mysteriously seductive Catwoman. Pfeiffer is nothing less than flat out gorgeous, and her oozing charisma and sexuality is enough to make any man 'me-ow'. Christopher Walken also has a wonderful appearance as corrupt businessman Max Shreck, as always, getting some of the most memorable lines in the film ('Bruce Wayne?! Why are you dressed up like Batman?!'). Michael Gough as usual IS Alfred, and there's nothing else to be said. Altogether, Burton has rounded together a picturesque, (apart from Pfeiffer as well...) beautiful and very entertaining follow up to his first Batman adventure, with a superb rogues gallery and some much needed time to get to know the said man behind the mask. The story may be somewhat disjointed, and not terribly realistic, but it's a comic book movie - realism is seldom an element present. Any fans of the Dark Knight or Burton's eccentric creativity, 'Batman Returns' should be considered a must view. -9/10",9,0,1,2 September 2006
Blade," True to form, Blade doesn't suck
","He kicks enough slow-mo ass in a long black coat to make Neo go 'Whoa.' He rocks a vampire franchise slick and edgy enough to make RPatz whimper. And he brings enough spurting blood to the superhero blockbuster to make Kevin Feige faint. He's Blade - breakout star of the era when the term 'superhero film' was largely tantamount to 'campy garbage'. And he's a welcome shot of adrenaline to the current day multiplexes bursting at the seams with his more bloodless (ha) brethren. Respect.Director Stephen Norrington knows exactly how to stay on the fun side of campy, and goes right for the jugular in doing so, offering a slick, taut, and hugely entertaining bloodbath. Eschewing both a redundant origin story and some of the decade's more frantic action editing, Blade is marvellously paced, ticking along, shark-like, from exposition to action interlude and back with the hypnotic steadiness of blood pulsing through veins. It's hardly an ambitious plot (stop the pending vampocalypse, natch), but lent welcome life from Norrington and writer David S. Goyer's more inventively gruesome touches. Check out the sprinklers at the underground vampire nightclub dousing the raving crowd in blood in a gleefully macabre Carrie homage, amidst the film's inspired opening sequence, and it's impossible to deny you're in for a garishly amusing treat. Granted, some of the film's stylistic choices (Mark Isham's industrial-influenced soundtrack) age better than others (DP Theo van de Sande shooting the film like a streaky, jump-cutting '90s hip hop video is fairly jarring). But Norrington's flair for the grotesque helps punch up the monster horror fun. His prosthetic deformities and bubbling corpses playfully pilfer the best of Total Recall and Raiders of the Lost Ark, just as the classist in-fighting in the vampire ranks (born vampires sneering condescension at 'turned' bloodsuckers) lends odd nuance to the villainous MacGuffin, while a sterling climactic setpiece amidst a (practical set!) marble vampire temple is as sleekly Gothic as you could ask for. Blade may not reinvent the action wheel, but it certainly gives it a good, vigorous spin in the right direction. As the titular vampire hunter (no, not Abraham Lincoln), Wesley Snipes firmly establishes himself as one of the more reliable '90s badasses. His icy charisma is easily enough to carry the film, even if his attempts at infusing Blade's monolithic masculinity with humour through bursts of twitchy sassiness may take some adjusting to. Still, anyone who can sell a punchline as corny as 'Some motherf*ckers are always trying to ice-skate uphill' with dignity intact is worth of accolades in my books. Supporting Snipes, N'Bushe Wright astutely refuses any damsel in distress clichés with a welcome, hardened charisma, at the cost of occasionally neglected to react appropriately to some of the film's more fearsome scenarios. Similarly, as the film's central antagonist, Stephen Dorff is perfectly oily, but his refusal to chew scenery in favour of a more subtle creepiness backfires somewhat, making him a suitable, but fairly forgettable foe. Finally, Kris Kristofferson lends his 'gruff mentor' archetype an appealingly indignant crustiness, bagging many of the film's better lines in the process. As the bodies hit the floor amidst the flurries of impressively executed, cathartically bloody action choreography, a realization sinks in: Blade, for all its leather-clad macho posturing, is a remarkably unpretentious film. It's fun, no- nonsense, and down and dirty, in the ways that only a moderately-budgeted franchise film with low expectations but high potential can be. You can practically see the seeds for 2016's Deadpool's rampant success being lain, albeit with only the tiniest winks of its fourth-wall-toppling zaniness. Still, nearly 20 years on, Blade remains an adeptly unapologetic slice of entertainment.

Superbad," Surprisingly, the title doesn't reflect the film's quality
","There are many films which need to be seen in a certain context, with certain expectations, and with the realization that certain qualities which would normally add quality to a film will most likely be absent, without making the film any less enjoyable. Superbad is a prime example of all of these afformentioned traits - astonishingly foul mouthed, remarkably stupid yet surprisingly likable and endearing for all of its seemingly negative foibles. What might have been reduced to a generic and exploitive teen sex comedy ended up as... well, not too far from it, but one with surprising heart and enough caustic one liners to take its simple premise, and end up with an unreasonably solid film.It's hard to describe what makes Superbad so enjoyable, considering it appears and feels like yet another trite teen comedy one can only shamefully admit to having viewed, but for whatever reason, the delicate balance between raucous and sentimental clicks, making up for any lapses in logic the plot may demonstrate. The story is perhaps the most familiar in all semi-romanticized teen pop culture: a duo of socially inept friends attempt to procure alcohol for a wild party in order to win one night stands from the objects of their affections, and in the process, an unspoken separation anxiety for the following year at separate colleges comes out. But despite the rank familiarity of the tale, somehow screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg manage to present a surprisingly touching as well as vile and hilarious (if not always realistic) portrait of the decline of teenage years and the nostalgic bittersweet twinge left behind. While it is true that the film may have little to say on the subject of high school that hasn't already been explored by countless films before, the voice in which the tale is related is a genuine one (one is left to wonder how much of the story is based on the screenwriters' actual lives...) and one which near anyone can relate to in some degree, or at least share a bawdy laugh with. Another boost to the film's quality was the casting of mostly relative unknowns, who may be familiar faces from other similar comedies, but not well known enough to achieve 'name' status - much like the high school personas they inhabit here. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera's oddball chemistry makes for a surprisingly likable and highly relatable lead duo - these are guys everyone has gone to school with, sat in class with, bumped into in the halls and seen skulking off in the corner at a party. Providing great comedic support to an already highly comedic pair is newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who takes the oh so stereotypical nerdy sidekick role and somehow manages to squeeze fresh comedic potential out of it. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader, playing a pair of somewhat out of place party animal cops also manage to raise laughs unreasonably beyond the potential of their premise. Unfortunately, the performance lows are the already minimal female parts, who, unlike the believably crafted male characters, generally come across as contrived and often simply reduced to simply eye candy, though Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone as the lust objects of the lead duo manage to give charismatic enough performances despite their disappointingly poorly written roles. It would seem keeping with the autobiographical note of the film that like their male protagonists, the screenwriters still aren't familiar enough with women to write plausible parts for them. Yes the film is fraught with repetitive, stupid comedy and profane one-liners whizzing by, and yes it does reduce the essence of high school to drinking, sex, and drinking for the purpose of procuring sex, but the emotional heart and soul of the picture resonate strongly enough to make the film surprisingly endearing, providing an oddly charming inner core to the profane exterior. Superbad could be described as a sort of feel good film for recent high school graduates, or those reflecting back with a nostalgic tear on the crazy carefree days of their youth, or it could be described as a raucous, profane and gut bustingly hilarious take on the teenage dream, or at least a romanticized version of it - the reality being, the film somehow manages to seamlessly blend the two, distributing heartfelt sentiment with a cheery smile and an unapologetic innuendo, making the end result far more enjoyable than it had any right to be. -7.5/10",7,3,8,19 August 2007
Creed," Forget Johnny Storm - this is Jordan REALLY on fire
","Everyone loves to root for the underdog - it's the pillar of the sports movie genre. But what about when the 'underdog' has all kinds of privileges, resources, connections, lineage, and is only in the situation he's in out of pride and having a chip on his shoulder? It might sound obnoxious and repellant, but this subtle tweaking of the formula is actually what makes Creed interesting, and stand apart from the glut of recent boxing movies (which fall into roughly two categories: those that do and don't have Sylvester Stallone). But director Ryan Coogler is savvy about how to play a sports flick in the shadow of precedents, boldly aligning with and distinguishing from the Rocky franchise, and crafting both a powerful exploration of obsession and legacy and an infectiously rousing and fun punch-up in its own right. Masculine melodrama is so mired in the sports genre that the prospect of another dose might feel akin to getting walloped in the face by Rocky, but Jordan's Adonis ('Donnie') Creed sparks interest by being, in many ways, the fundamental outsider for a genre normally inhabited by the downtrodden working class. After an opening teaser of Donnie scrapping in an orphanage as a fiery-eyed child, he's adopted and taken in by the wife of the deceased Apollo Creed, who enshrouds him with his legacy. This Creed is brought up in an imposingly cavernous mansion, his battle garb being an immaculately fitting shirt and tie, ensconced with praise for his work ethic and recent promotion (see? there's thematic resonance to that name). Yet, the hollowness in Jordan's eyes practically rings with the tinny reverb of an arena bell, indicating voluminous depths of dissatisfaction and unresolved personal demons, foreshadowing his inevitable jaunt to Philadelphia, and reluctant following of the footsteps of his father. Donnie often remarks that he's been fighting his whole life, but Coogler's work is deft enough to show that he's not just referring to covert amateur scraps and orphanage brawls. He fights because it's the only way for him to reconcile his own deep-rooted issues of anger, abandonment, resentment and fighting to differentiate from Creed Senior. In short: he doesn't fight because he HAS to, but he does fight because he must. As a sports movie, Creed hits all the soaring, inspirational euphoric emotional beats, but its character study is just as fun and fascinating. It's a classicist at heart plot-wise, with thereby few surprises and its fair share of clichés to prop itself up with, but Coogler aces them all with breezy, steely confidence. That said, a one-two punch of emotional heft and immaculate technical work certainly helps elevate it against the competition. Ludwig Göransson, filtering Bill Conti through Ennio Morricone, finds the perfect pump-up leitmotif for Adonis, while Maryse Alberti's excellently empathetic camera-work actively mirrors the mood of each scene: starkly desolate in the Creed mansion, jittery with nerves in Donnie's first fight, and soaring in the requisite Rocky 360 degree hero shot, bellowing, circled by triumphant bikers, in a scene so indulgently awesome you'll cheer through the buckets of fromage. And then there are the fights themselves: blindingly paced, bloody and scrappy, all building to the final 'boss battle' against 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan (real life heavyweight champ Tony Bellew, who chirps so well you forget he's not an actor), so electrifying it'll get the juices and tears flowing for even the staunchest sports skeptics. And, in the blue corner: Michael B. Jordan is a firebrand, ferociously commanding attention and further substantiating his reputation as one of the most promising actors of his generation. If comparisons to Raging Bull feel more natural than Rocky, it's largely thanks to the volcanic power of Jordan's performance, and his ferociously raw, vulnerable, ballsy work making Creed Jr. a living, breathing, doubting, character rather than heroic composite. In spite of his deliberate, nuanced contradictions, he's impossible not to root for. Sylvester Stallone, transitioning seamlessly for star to mentor in reprising his most beloved role, mines new emotional depth amidst the mumbling as Rocky Balboa, including moments of disarming humour, and his own subplot of vulnerability where he is courageous enough to take Rocky's macho posturing to task. Tessa Thompson is flat-out delightful, skillfully imbuing her Bianca with so much effervescent energy and self- respecting firmness that she never enters the domain of stock romantic prop; instead, her courting scenes with Jordan bubble with a surprisingly endearing lightness and tenderness. Finally, the Hobbit (but we won't hold that against him)'s Graham McTavish is good and snarly as Conlan's trainer, excellently trading death stares with Sly Stallone.Like its titular lead, Creed is unapologetically a product of its populist circumstances and lineage. It's also a classic case of perilously familiar territory being infused with such adept technical precision and emotional fortitude that it's impossible not to be sucked in and raucously engaged. Thanks largely to superb, confident work by Coogler and Jordan, Creed hits fast and hard, and is tons of earnest (albeit heavy on the cheese) fun, even for those utterly alienated by boxing. Just wait for the steps, and try to tell me it's not worth the trudge. -8.5/10",8,1,3,29 February 2016
The Great Dictator," 'Any resemblance between Hynkel the dictator and the Jewish barber is purely coincidental'
","'Desperate times calls for desperate measures' goes the saying, so it is fitting that the second world war and its concentration of some of the most inhumane atrocities in human history yielded one of cinema's most overt and audacious political satires as response. The roots of legendary comic mastermind Charlie Chaplin's decision to lampoon looming Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler allegedly stemmed from his outraged discovery that Hitler had imitated Chaplin's own 'Little Tramp' moustache for the sake of acquiring an iconic image, provoking Chaplin to ridicule Hitler's own image in the same way he felt his own had been defiled - a fascinating case of art imitating life imitating art. And one cannot overstate the role of Chaplin's The Great Dictator, raising awareness of the atrocities of Nazi Germany to largely unaware overseas audiences as courageously as it sends up the man figure-heading the conflict. Nonetheless, there remains an interesting process of collective cultural memory in which the quality of the actual piece is considered synonymous with its historical impact or relevance, and Chaplin's wartime satire is no exception. As such, while unquestionably still a very strong film in its own right, on contemporary examination, while The Great Dictator is unquestionably one of the most important films of all time, sadly it cannot also claim the title as one of the best.While Chaplin is notorious for obsessive perfectionism, one gets the sense that with The Great Dictator his mind was more occupied with its socio-political relevance than its construction as a film. Predicated on parallelling the lives of fanatical Hitler surrogate Adenoid Hynkel and the stand-in Tramp figure, a shell-shocked Jewish barber (both played by Chaplin), the intercutting between narrative strands feels awkward and uncomfortable, both requiring too much exposition to blend seamlessly together. Equally, the film on the whole feels unnecessarily drawn out, its two hour running time consistently lagging through overextended gags (as unforgettable as the two main comedic set pieces - Hynkel impishly playing with an inflated globe and the farcical battles for dominance between Hykel and Mussolini surrogate Nappolini - are, both run past the point of remaining truly funny) and frequent patches of 'dead time' which are neither comedic nor serve to further the plot (the extended WW1 opening sequence feels largely unnecessary). Similarly, banking the narrative on a highly contrived climax (the barber being mistaken for Hynkel) makes the entire film feel somewhat forced, also detracting from the enjoyment. However, the main concern is that the film, for lack of a better term, simply isn't that funny, with the general tone pitched uncertainly between pantomime silliness and sympathetic reverence and thus functioning as neither as enjoyable or proactively poignant as it could have been.Despite the film's essential function of raising audience awareness of the devastating cruelty inflicted by the Nazis, there remains the feel of Chaplin soft-pedalling the inhumanities depicted, whether for the sake of not overly upsetting audiences or due to legal concerns, but either way lessening the film's potential impact. Equally, Chaplin's infamous ending monologue remains a source of eternal contention, yet no matter how ham-handed a disruption of the narrative or excessively saccharine, there remains a tremendous power and resonance in his earnest words, serving as a fitting message for hope in the midst of a time sorely lacking in it. Finally, the film's hefty production values (despite the discordant presence of some obviously fake sets) ably elucidates the absurd opulence of the Nazi propaganda displays in a more tastefully subtle (and thereby more effective) fashion.As with the majority of Chaplin's films, the true joy is to be found in the performance(s) of the man himself. In fact, the real shame is that Chaplin resisted the temptation to drink in his own antics more, as his Hitler impersonation is a comedic triumph, each bout of mangled German profanities, enraged flared nostrils and over-important strutting a wonder to behold, and his Jewish barber nostalgically recalls the best of the Tramp (though both characters sharing Chaplin's never before heard reedy voice feels another piece of poor planning). It comes as somewhat of a shame that Chaplin generally pitches for the obvious humour, rather than allowing for more unorthodox moments to breathe life into the picture: one of the most hilarious points in the film is a throwaway moment when Hynkel, hurrying between appointments, stumbles and staggers across a sumptuously decorated hallway - an exquisite moment of slapstick belying the humanity beneath, and ultimately a more effective method of undermining Hitler's steely persona. Apart from the star's dual roles, the majority of the cast feel too sombre and straight faced to infuse much of interest into the film, though Paulette Goddard rekindles the feisty warmth and spunkiness she displayed in Modern Times and Jack Oakie appealingly tramples the scenery with a deliciously campy Mussolini impression.While more problematic as a film than its reputation suggests, Chaplin's The Great Dictator remains a timeless testament to the power and importance of satire and film's potential to function as a vehicle for urgent social commentary and information. Despite being one of the lesser Chaplin efforts as a film, its vibrant daring is one of a variety simply not attempted by contemporary cinema, making the film worth experiencing by itself.-8.5/10",8,1,2,10 April 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," 'I'm the best there is at what I do' could hardly be further from the truth
","Like fellow 2009 superhero release Watchmen, Wolverine is that rare comic book film which almost appears inevitably more likely to please audiences that are not fans of the source material. However, unlike Watchmen, which adhered so closely to its source material that a falling short by comparison proved inescapable, Wolverine's inevitable backlash of fan outrage stems from its flagrant disregard for its source material. The film casually mutilates and re-writes the comic book context of its source material with the cold disdain of its protagonist, hacking one of the most genuinely compelling, subversive and horrifying superhero back-stories into the worst kind of safe, familiar, PG rated commercial dross. All of Wolverine's compelling comic book edginess is distilled into a flaccid script which forgoes exhilaration for only occasionally impressive fight/chase/explosion scenes, complexity for eye-rolling cheese and broad humour, and story cohesion for an attempt to cram in far too much subject matter and avoid the true dramatic meat of the story. While further focus on the Wolverine/Sabertooth dichotomy could have yielded a narrative volumes stronger, the film continually broadens its scope, seemingly attempting to bank on the in-jokey winks to fans of the comics by hinting at broadening the Marvel universe in further sequels demonstrated in 2008's Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But while their fan nods were tasteful and enjoyable, Wolverine's attempts at matching them appear to be building up to an almost sinister bid for Fox's superhero franchises to compete. Recognizable X-Men characters are continually shoehorned into minuscule parts (fans of Deadpool, Blob, Gambit or, *groan*, Cyclops don't go in expecting much but disappointment) for seemingly the sole purpose of leapfrogging off Wolverine's story into their own spin-offs. However, such an overflowing mass of secondary characters only serves the dual purpose of both derailing Wolverine's story and not even serving to satisfy comic fans clamouring to see their favourite characters on screen, as the fleeting, shallow depictions hardly prove satisfying character development by any stretch of the imagination. If the filmmakers choose to tackle established characters to appease fan expectations, doing nothing with the characters (let alone doing them far from 'properly') hardly seems a suitable way to satisfy a demanding audience. Director Gavin Hood (known for excellent African drama Tsotsi of all things) has been vocal about his clashes with the studio over the film, and one can only assume, given his excellent credentials, that most of his proposed changes would have been for the better. As it is, Hood demonstrates a shaky directorial presence at best, masking his action scenes in whirling cameras making it near impossible to see, and complimenting most tense or dramatic scenes with a cascade of Harry Gregson-Williams' tiresomely banal and clichéd musical score. That is not to say the film is entirely devoid of quality, but it is reduced to occasional fleeting moments (sporatic bursts of creativity during fight scenes, a promising African raid plot point, and an undeniably gripping if under-explored sequence of Wolverine going through the Weapon X program). But, like the irritatingly freeze-frame beset but otherwise clever opening montage (showcasing Wolverine's progression through numerous world wars) such quality is often overshadowed by cringe-worthy prevailing flaws making it all the more difficult to appreciate. Ironically for the film situating him most justifiably in the lead role, Hugh Jackman gives his weakest performance in his foundational role as Wolverine. While Jackman's natural charisma and steely credibility still make him a far more sturdy enough lead than his film deserved, his under-exploring of Wolverine's feral ferocity and darkness still leaves an ultimately unsatisfying taste in the mouth. Despite initial skepticism of miscasting, Liev Schreiber proves far more resonant as Wolverine's animalistic adversary Sabretooth, providing a savagely threatening yet controlled performance, which, despite falling short of the true animalistic frenzy Sabretooth should have been, proves one of the more successful attributes of the film. Similarly, Danny Huston provides a welcome dash of class as Machiavellian military official William Stryker, managing to overcome the shortcomings of an underwritten character with an impressively realized, wonderful presence. Ryan Reynolds also proves perfectly cast as twisted mercenary Deadpool, thankfully managing to suppress star showiness in favour of suitably manic humour - nonetheless, Reynolds is criminally wasted in a far too brief and insultingly warped butchering of his comics incarnation. Taylor Kitsch, conversely, gives a bland, dopily flat take on fan favourite Gambit, the character's legendary suave charisma as nonexistent as Kitsch's Cajun accent, doing little to justify his character's near pointless addition. While it may function suitably as mindless summer entertainment, the inherent complexity in Wolverine's backstory makes its reduction to such a near outright insult to fans of the comic source material. If left as a standalone film, Wolverine might have been dismissible as a mostly harmless disappointment, but with such blatant spin off begging, it evolves into something far more objectionable. While the film has its moments, as a cohesive unit it can be considered nothing less than a tragic waste of potential, floundering any inherent quality in gaping plot holes and unnecessary obvious comedy or 'tearjerking' scenes. Wolverine's adage of him being 'the best I am at what I do' could hardly be farther than the truth when applied to his film. -4/10",4,389,695,1 May 2009
Alexander," Alexander the atrocious
","When director Oliver Stone announced that he would be making a huge budget film on the life of Alexander the Great, audiences, understandably, had high hopes. When the casting of Colin Farrell as Alexander was announced, these hopes were further stoked, by the fact that no huge name actor, such as Brad Pitt had been cast. Could it possibly be that Alexander might focus on talent, rather than the kind of big-budget mess that both Troy and King Arthur had turned out to be?Sadly, the answer is a resounding no. The project turns out to be nothing less than a massive letdown in the end, with surprisingly huge failures in almost every section possible. There are so many places to pick apart at Alexander, it's hard to know where to start. So it may seem easiest to start with the man in charge of it all: Oliver Stone. Stone has clearly stepped out of his element here - while used to dealing with political dramas based on the lives of past U.S. Presidents, he seems tied up with trying to make reference as much as possible to Greek mythology and tradition. As a result, Alexander comes off almost documentary style, with every character spewing pretentious , cheesy and mostly incomprehensible lines that seem straight out of a badly translated history textbook. How in god's name has Stone suddenly become such a terrible writer? Not to mention that any directorial influence seems totally absent, as the plot sways sickeningly between present and flashbacks in a confusing manner for no real purpose at all, except seemingly to confuse and disorient the viewer. The movie starts out far too slow, and with far too much talking, mostly just pointless glorifying of Alexander, and it doesn't improve much as it progresses through its painfully long runtime. Accents are all over the place here. While the same was true for Ridley Scott's Gladiator, it comes off as a much more glaring flaw here. Indeed, the characters seem to be from around the world, from Farrell's Irish, to Val Kilmer's blatantly American, to Anthony Hopkins' educated Englishman, to Angelina Jolie... who seems to have decided to make her character Transylvanian for some incomprehensible reason... Stone seems to have lost all control of his production, and given up on it, letting it spiral into disarray and confusion.Stone also seems to have left his actors entirely free to ham it up as they wish, as many of them give what could have been promising performances, had they bothered to tone it down a few notches. Farrell is the best example: he actually isn't bad in the lead, and indeed seems to surpass the overall quality of the movie, but he still fails ultimately to capture our sympathies and enthusiasm. In the end, we end up not really caring about Alexander, and his 'great' exploits, so, despite a valiant effort, he still fails to do the character justice. Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer are similarly wasted as Alexander's insane and deranged parents, both overacting to the point of hysteria. Another bit of advice Stone forgot to provide for most of the film's actors: YELLING DOES NOT EQUAL DRAMA! Not to mention inconsistencies, such as the whole accent issue, and the rather disturbing fact that Jolie, playing Farrell's mother, is in fact a year younger than her 'son'. These are miniscule and unimportant, considering the more glaring flaws the film has to deal with.Other cast members, seemingly given full reign to do whatever they want, turn out equally unsatisfying performances: Anthony Hopkins comes off as a ranting old fool with no purpose in the story save to serve as a sort of narrator, bestowing endless praises on the film's 'glorious hero'. Jared Leto is given next to nothing to do as Hephaistion, Alexander's childhood friend who turns out to be 'more than a friend'. Rosiaro Dawson is similarly wasted, playing essentially a foreign sex object. Despite the fact that her character is pretty much that shallow, Dawson still manages to turn out one of the film's most impressive performances - which still isn't saying much. However, not all aspects of the film are as terrible as I make them out to be. The costumes and set design are magnificent, and, unlike the film, actually seem truthful to the time and age. Unfortunately, the music by Greek composer Vangelis (at least one influence on the film is actually Greek!) which accompanies it is one of the worst scores we have been forced to behold in recent history - painfully cheesy and overdone at every point. Rather than adding to the quality of the film, Vangelis' score only serves to remind us of how terrible it is.As you can tell, I'm not exactly providing a glowing review for the movie here. But it's not often that a film manages to insult my intelligence and provide so many additions to my list of things that annoy me as Alexander. Those only with a bit of excitement or historical inquisitiveness might tentatively want to check out Alexander, but for everyone else, I'd have to strongly discourage it. The film doesn't hold together in any sense, and the result is embarrassing. In fact, the one bit of insight in the entire movie is provided by Anthony Hopkins' Ptolemy - the fact that the character of Alexander is overly glorified through tales of his legendary deeds, and is, in fact, nowhere as great as it is said. So very true. And it can also be said that Alexander's film is not nearly as 'great' as it set out to be. Quite the opposite, in fact. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.-3/10",3,13,19,14 November 2005
Hot Fuzz," 'Ever fired your gun in the air and yelled, 'Aaaaaaah?' '
","How to top Shaun of the Dead? Such a question had been endlessly circling between moviegoers worldwide since the release of the impeccable satire yet tribute to zombie films mixed with romance and a healthy side of British comedy in 2004. The combination (cleverly billed as 'rom-zom-com') clicked, but with expectations raised so high, the possibility of a follow up which could match or exceed Shaun in terms of creativity, cleverness and sheer enjoyment factor seemed a daunting prospect indeed. Fortunately, director Edgar Wright and his co-writer and star Simon Pegg proved ahead of themselves, as they embraced their sudden fame rather than falling prey to its trappings, following up their previous hit with an exuberant and masterful send up of the oh so stereotypical buddy cop movie. The result? Hot Fuzz. Director Wright's body of work is an interesting one indeed, as he seems constantly torn between showing immense knowledge of whatever genre he is satirizing, while delivering a superb entry in said genre all the while - a trait he continues with Hot Fuzz. Chock full of enough references of classic (and some classically bad) action films to keep even the most experienced action buffs busy, Hot Fuzz is itself a testament to the sheer quantity of knowledge and enthusiasm Wright and Pegg had for the genre. But all the same, while Hot Fuzz is clever enough to never take itself too seriously, and remain for the most part a wonderfully tongue in cheek satire, the filmmakers don't shy away from the task of creating what is simply one of the most adrenaline fuelled, blood pumping action sequences ever seen on a movie screen. Wright also keeps things interesting throughout with a rapid fire editing style (seen in smaller doses in Shaun), showing blindingly fast montages with exaggerated sound effects, a wonderfully unique technique which really succeeds in retaining the audience's attention without seeming pretentious or mind-numbing. It is this final combat scene and the few preceding it which really make Hot Fuzz the wonderful piece of work it is - while the build up throughout the film, establishing the characters, the setting and the pseudo murder-mystery feel to the plot, and throwing in a few chuckle-worthy one liners all the while is for the most part comical and entertaining, it proves a bit too slow and uneventful, with the clever comedic touches too sparse to really make as much of an impact as one might hope. Fortunately, the climatic showdown is enough to make up for any of the film's prior shortcomings - gut-wrenchingly hilarious, yet endlessly energetic and exciting all the same. It is in these last few scenes Hot Fuzz really excels, and raises the limit from simply chuckle-worthy to flat out hysterical and supremely entertaining. It helps of course that Wright seems to have rallied up nearly every British character actor on the planet to make an appearance, though it goes without saying that the real attraction of the show is the simply wonderful dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost reuniting once again after TV's Spaced and Shaun; this time as a hard edged, obsessive London cop and his witless country bumpkin partner (with Pegg playing the straight man for a change, allowing Frost's dimwitted character to pick up most of the punchlines). But there is also wonderful comedic support from the supporting cast, including Jim Broadbent as the bumbling but warm hearted police chief of the backwards British town Pegg's character is sent off to, a scene stealing Timothy Dalton, a far cry from his Bond days as a hilarious and very suspicious seeming grocery store baron and Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as verbally abusive detectives with highly questionable facial hair. The film's tongue in cheek cameos are also highlights, with the likes of Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Steve Coogan raising many a laugh in their minute scenes as Pegg's jealous fellow London policemen, and unrecognizable, blink-you-miss-'em appearances from Cate Blanchett as Pegg's ex-girlfriend and Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as a murderous Santa Clause. What's not to love? All in all, Hot Fuzz proves itself as one of the most gutsy and energetic satires in recent history, side-splitting action cliché parodies mixed with adrenaline pumped tributes to the genre, fuelled by a wonderfully witty script and Wright's trademark rapid-fire editing and brilliant cinematography. It's just a shame it takes so long for the film to really get going, but once the plot picks up and the action starts, Hot Fuzz makes its place as one of the most entertaining comedies or action films in recent history... see it for 'the greater good'. -9.5/10",10,2,4,23 May 2007
Constantine," A decent premise let down by Reeves' typically wooden acting
","Adapted from the DC/Vertigo comic book 'Hellblazer', Constantine details the life of John Constantine, (Keanu Reeves) a detective of the paranormal who spends his life saving people from supernatural occurrences in an attempt to commit enough good deeds to buy his way into heaven after trying to commit suicide at a young age. Sounds interesting enough - but Constantine really lets itself down by taking a decent premise and trying to pass it off as just another Sci-Fi Keanu Reeves vehicle. Because of this, the script underwrites and confuses all the more interesting parts focusing on the supernatural and the dirty dealings done by those from and/or associated with Hell, and puts more of the focus on Reeves' cynical detective. Unfortunately, Reeves doesn't seem up to carrying the picture, playing the same wooden action character as always. (I believe he changed his facial expression once throughout the entire film, and it was during his 'death' scene) It's obvious that there was an attempt to break the mold - John Constantine is a thoroughly despicable man, being the chain smoking, reclusive, sarcastic cynic that he is, but in the less than capable hands of Keanu, who seems to think he is still playing Neo, it doesn't come across truthfully. When we, the audience, try to ignore the film's star and concentrate more on the dark, moody visuals and excellent supernatural CGI effects, we get Keanu Reeves' (never changing) face plastered on-screen again, and we are barely allowed to get a glimpse of the more appealing aspects of the story.As one would come to expect, most of the actual acting talent comes from the far more interesting array of supporting characters. Rachel Weisz struggles hard to actually bring some emotion into the story, as a homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of her twin sister, and she succeeds for the most part, but it couldn't have been easy given her co-star. Djimon Hounsou is great as Midnite, a mysterious fellow demon hunter who refuses to take the side of either light or dark, but remains neutral between them, sharing his talents with the highest bidder. He proves a far more interesting, if equally undeveloped character as Constantine, but his lack of character development actually works to an extent, adding to the mysterious mood of his character. Underrated Swedish character actor Peter Stormare plays a wonderfully sinister Satan, practically dripping malice while still only flirting with hamminess. And then we have the necessary 'annoying sidekick who acts as comedic relief and serves only to further introduce the main character' character, played by Shia LaBeouf. If there was ever one of these such characters who you would gladly watch suffer a gruesome death, there has never been one more so than here. Constantine's 'intern' Chas is one of the most irritating and patronizing characters ever to grace film, and it's a sound pity that he fails to suffer the 'death by killer bees' schtick that one of Constantine's other associates is dealt. With a different lead, the dark imagery and supernatural conspiracies might have proved to produce a decent film. As is, the gritty visuals and sweeping, moody CGI supernatural effects set the mood correctly. But every time Keanu Reeves walks on screen, with his single facial expression, we start to find looking down at our watches is much more interesting than staring at another grimace which was undoubtedly meant to convey emotion. When we can, we take refuge in the much more appealing performances of the supporting characters, especially Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou, but they aren't given nearly enough development to retain our interest. Picture Constantine with a different star, and you can imagine yourself having an enjoyable, if still, not all too profound time. As it is... you may want to pass up Constantine for something more interesting.<ul><li>4/10</li></ul>",4,48,95,13 June 2005
Dead Poets Society," Sucking the marrow out of life
","Every once in a while, a film comes along which stands the test of time. A film which, ten years later or more can still hold the same emotional resonance and merit as it did when it was first released, and still be renowned as a genuinely quality piece. Dead Poets Society is one of those films which has withstood the ages, becoming somewhat iconic as a charming, but never cheesy sentimental tearjerker and uplifting tale of passion and hope all the same. When one watches it, it's really no wonder why the movie has lasted - there is simply so much to appreciate here, and never once does the film seem fake, as if the ideals are being beaten over our heads - they are simply presented in an optimistic light, attempting to sweep us up in their sense of enthusiasm and passion as well. It's movies like this which really bring the education system to light, and make us wonder if perhaps inspirationally different teachers such as the simply wonderful Robin Williams' John Keating were more commonplace, inspiring their students with a sheer passion for language and verse. Teachers who rather than beating the students down by throwing meaningless figures and statistics in their faces, actually encouraged their students to think for themselves, draw their own conclusions, and actually striving to 'seize the day' and get all that they can out of life, instead of coasting aimlessly through it. It's in this aspect than any viewer with a soft spot for English literature and poetry especially is sure to melt shamelessly towards the sheer passion and emotion associated with them. Rather than poems being sappy and tedious, Keating brings the idea to life with fiery enthusiasm, making the author's sentiments leap off the page and into the heart. What raises Dead Poets Society from the ranks of other wannabes in its genre of 'education can be good' films is how genuine and real it all seems, which makes the uplifting message seem all the more affecting, as it never seems contrived or sappy. The characters never once seem contrived, though they may be archetypes, these are real, breathing human beings we are watching, and we connect with them and care for them at a level which is almost unseen in modern movies. It's a genuinely heartwarming and affecting story, sold excellently by screenwriter Tom Schulman and driven home by the superb cast and seamless direction by the wonderful Peter Weir. Weir has a knack for filling his films with single unforgettable images, and Dead Poets Society is perhaps the most potent in this aspect - there are too many unforgettable scenes and shots to be counted, from Knox Overstreet riding his bike down the hill, scattering a flock of geese which fly up into the amber sunset, the soccer game where the students carry Mr. Keating on their shoulders, and of course the classic standing on desks scene. Without giving away the film's plot, safe to say this is a movie which sticks in your head for weeks to come. The film does on occasion show the slightest stumble in terms of plot or pacing, and not all audiences may buy into the sentimentality of the plot, but these are pittances for a film as genuine, affecting and simply spectacular as this. The simply wonderful cast, full mostly of previously unknown actors is what really brings the film to life, presenting us with a wide variety of realistic, relatable and for the most part, infectiously likable characters. Standouts include a pre-stardom Ethan Hawke as the shy and withdrawn Todd, TV actor Robert Sean Leonard as aspiring actor Neil, Gale Hansen, arguably stealing the show from all but Robin Williams as the wonderfully rebellious Charlie 'Nuwanda' Dalton, and Josh Charles as the bashfully confident Knox Overstreet. 'That 70s show' actor Kurtwood Smith proves that no one is better at playing the disproving old fashioned father than he is and Norman Lloyd makes a fiendishly evil villain as the repressive school headmaster. Still, there is no argument that the film without exception belongs to Robin Williams as perhaps the most wonderful teacher figure ever essayed on film. Williams sparks the film ablaze with his fiery passion and enthusiasm, never once going over the top but instead biting back his trademark energy to turn out a serious, superbly fine tuned and tremendously affecting performance, arguably still the best his career has shown. All in all, Dead Poets Society is one of those movies which actually fit the far too often used category of 'must see'. For all struggling through months and years of tedious, repressive schooling, this movie should prove the perfect antidote, re-affirming the sense of enthusiasm and passion which would make the education system so much easier to bear, and actually inspire students to succeed in life, rather than coasting through with no enjoyment or enthusiasm. Robin Williams gives a superb performance, and director Peter Weir has accomplished a wonderful film which is sweet but not syrupy, passion and sentimentality devoid of sap. For a heartwarming, inspiring and moving movie experience, one need look no further than here.-9/10",9,0,0,5 January 2007
Spotlight," 'They'll print anything these days'
","The classic investigative journalism story isn't an easy sell. By necessity, they're talky, dense as molasses, and too subdued to make for any splashy awards-bait performances - even your average courtroom drama allows for some passionate Oscar-clip shoutiness. And yet, there are cases where the story itself is the headliner, too important to exploit or trivialize for any gains other than its own integrity. Naturally, it's a message that Tom McCarthy's Spotlight takes to heart, and the film's performance in the awards circuit shows that - more often than not - trimmings or not, hard to watch or not, people can handle the truth. This is all not to say that Spotlight is a dull, thanklessly dour watch. Of course, the horrifically grim subject matter colours the timbre of the story, and McCarthy treads carefully in neither drifting into tacky, unwarranted tangential church-bashing or fetishizing the suffering of the victims (no tasteless, feverish rape flashbacks here, a- la The Lovely Bones, thank goodness). Instead, he is wise enough to take a page out of his reporter protagonists' notebooks, and stick to the immediate, pressing facts. The result is a lean, taut potboiler, which clips along at a brisk pace without a lick of fat on it. Tangents? Expansive character backstories? Cinematic flourishes, or passionate monologuing? All ruthlessly trimmed with the same dismissive grunt of 'adjectives' Liev Schreiber's editor mutters while reviewing the final story. It's a bold and entirely appropriate tactic to functionally ride along with the Boston Globe Spotlight team step by painstaking step of the investigation, keeping even the most mundane activities pulsing with urgency (never before have interludes of archival library research been so gripping). Crucially, McCarthy understands that his piece, like the Spotlight team's, is an educational exposé first and foremost, and the script is immaculately laid out and crisply comprehensible, spelling out the facts, fears, and controversies of the case as indisputable rhetorical whammy. Comparisons to All the President's Men are inevitable, and far from unwarranted. What is a shame, upon reflection, are the occasional downsides to being confined by McCarthy's 'we know what they know' mantra. Spotlight consciously avoids the bloat of cinematic diatribes like Oliver Stone's JFK by ruthlessly paring down, but the cutting room trimmings are fascinating and rich enough cobble together an entire other film out of. The psychological dimension of the social epidemic of pedophiliac priests is hit the hardest. Root causes are alluded to through phone interviews with a 'Deep Throat' style clergy psychologist, but ultimately dropped, just as our glimpses of survivor stories are included only insofar as they provide quantifiable testimonies for the feature. Particularly uncanny is McAdams' reporter unexpectedly ending up face-to-face with an abusive priest, who nonchalantly admits his misdemeanours, and begins to explain his paradoxical rational before he is shooed offscreen, his plot thread never to be rekindled. McCarthy's firm artistic mandate validates these exclusions by concentrating on starting, rather than completing, a conversation on such crucial social issues, but clipping exhibitions of trauma for more clinical evidence occasionally threatens to sideline the human resonance of the story. It's telling that Spotlight's high point is when Stanley Tucci's bulldog of a human rights lawyer actually, for the first time in the film, interacts with children, his energy radically transforming from grim to jubilant and charismatic. It's a beautifully tragic moment, and is crucial in reinforcing the hard realities of why the story is so abominable in the first place. The ensemble cast work as an impressively cohesive, subdued unit. All are utterly spectacular, with nary a wobbly or excessively showboating link among them. Of course, each bring their own flavour - the scientifically impossible-to-dislike Mark Ruffalo's twitchy peppiness turned passionate dogmatism contributes the affable emotional heart, the endlessly nuanced Michael Keaton's contemplatively stoic editor brings the calm centre, while Rachel McAdams' persistently meticulous fact-checker inwardly aches without a single crack forming. Impressively, no named characters outside of the clergy are superficially coloured as 'bad' - Schreiber - magnetic as always - propels the plot through quiet, resolute persistence as John Slattery cathartically fusses and curses around him, while the perennially wonderful Tucci sneakily, grumpily toils in the background and threatens to walk away with the picture. Even Billy Crudup's oily lawyer furtively admits surprising, sympathetic depth. You know you're in comparatively objective territory whenSpotlight is vital viewing not only for its thorough coverage of its subject matter, but for how respectfully it avoids emotionally fetishizing or obfuscating the integrity of its story. If the only major complaint pertains to the questions McCarthy leaves unanswered, the film should be considered equally commendable for lighting the fire under viewers to undertake their own side investigations appropriately, and thereby preventing the still distressingly common abuse in the church from again drifting into uncomfortable, shameful silence. If nothing else, in an era where cinema and news media alike constantly run the threat of being swamped by sensationalism, the triumphant revitalization of such meticulously gripping, no-nonsense storytelling, let alone such an enjoyably old-fashioned-y newspaper drama, should be championed and cherished. Never before has a room full of haggard people frenziedly answering their phones served as such a triumphant parable to dogged persistence, or quality, meticulous reporting. -9/10",9,0,0,27 January 2016
Insomnia," Nolan's entrancing detective thriller
","Crime thrillers are becoming increasingly popular in today's movie industry, to the point where each new entry seems almost redundant - we've seen this story before. So it's nice to see an addition to the pantheon of detective murder mysteries with an inventive addition to its loose formula - the lead character, sent from Las Angeles to Alaska to investigate the murder of a young girl is unable to sleep for many days in a row, and begins to doubt his own judgment, and eventually sanity. This slight tweaking of the formula is what makes Christopher Nolan's Insomnia all the more compelling - a particularly captivating and thought provoking take on the genre. If there is a single current director who has been able to generate a steady quantity of relentlessly impressive work with no sign of a decrease in quality, it's Christopher Nolan, whose credentials include the fantastic Memento, Batman Begins and The Prestige. While Insomnia is by no means Nolan's strongest work, that's not to say that it isn't still a compelling and captivating film, and Nolan demonstrates his usual flair for pouring genuine cinematic heart and soul into his film, rising it above the ranks of would be imitations. Nolan shows an uncanny eye for selecting effective settings and locations for his story, and the vast, barren template of Alaska is a perfect choice for the quiet yet turbulent investigation. The use of the insomnia effect for Pacino's character proves particularly effective, as the audience shares in the character's extreme disorientation through blurry camera work and lightening quick editing, capturing a surprisingly accurate cinematic portrayal of the character's dangerous sleep deprivation. While the screenplay, adapted from the original Norwegian film and composed by newcomer screenwriter Hillary Seitz, does allow for the occasional very powerful and emotional moment, for the most part, the film's script is what ultimately prevents the film from becoming a true classic - the dialogue coming across as a touch too contrived and clunky to make for a fully satisfying work. It's a small complaint though, and the film does boast a genuinely unpredictable ending, and enough satisfying moments to overcompensate for the occasional clunky bit. The film also boasts some very succinct and to the point cinematography, shot mainly in close ups of the leading characters talking, and surprisingly rapid fire editing cuts, creating a feeling which does succeed in being deliberately disorienting, adding to the feeling of unease created throughout, though the editing does toe the line of becoming distracting at times. Altogether, the atmosphere created in the film is superb, perfectly complimenting the ominous murder mystery storyline. The always reliable Al Pacino is in familiar territory as beaten down yet determined detective Will Dormer, yet he is allowed to flex his dramatic muscles more here than in a more standard variation of the role. In particular, Pacino demonstrates particular skill in portraying a man suffering from chronic insomnia, culminating in a powerful and affecting leading performance. Robin Williams gives an intriguing and very strong performance, playing strongly against type and arguably stealing the show as the ominous lead suspect for the murder case. The only real casting misfire is Hillary Swank, whose character comes across as simply unnecessary for the most part of the film, and Swank's performance doesn't help - her earnest upcoming cop generally comes across simply as irritating rather than idealistic and passionate. Character actor Martin Donovan also gives a potent performance as Dormer's partner, who is also sent down to investigate the murder. All things considered, Insomnia comes across as a mostly fresh and innovative entry into the near exhausted genre of police murder mystery. Fueled by strong performances from Pacino and Williams, and the relentlessly classy directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, it's easy to overlook the occasional script stumbles, making for an entertaining, tense, and thought provoking film easily worth a look. -8/10",8,0,0,22 June 2007
500 Days of Summer," 'The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental. Especially you'
","How to reinvent the romantic comedy? Filmmakers either bold or foolish enough to attempt such a seemingly impossible challenge have struggled throughout the ages, floundering over the delicate balance between credibly depicting the trials and tribulations of romance while simultaneously satisfying the cathartic desire for a romanticized, happy Hollywood ending. The key, it would seem, as with prior success Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, lies in the filmmaker's daring to strive beyond obvious emotional satisfaction, even to the point of the protagonists' interactions not ending in a happy ever after. And in this regard, (500) Days of Summer proves a similarly rich and rewarding experience, all the more funny, entertaining and profoundly true through its toying with or outright disregard for the worn to death formula, demonstrating the definitive way to deliver a comedy or drama about romance. Rather than using the eventual breakup as a surprise tragic twist, director Mark Webb instead eschews formula by simply presenting the relationship between Tom Hansen and Summer Finn, from start to finish, early, awkward flirtations to subsequent, devastating parting, capturing moments which are happy, sad and just plain strange. Which, of course, proves the ideal cocktail, as Webb's film sparkles with life and the sort of inventive genius in editing and cinematography which only a background in music videos could yield. Webb allows his film to mirror the emotional state of the protagonists both visually and tonally, bubbling with spontaneous dance numbers and animated Disney birds to convey Tom's early euphoria, later fuming with moody artistic scribbles, parallelling the trauma and existential grief of a break up, and eventually the quiet, reflective calm which comes with moving on. It is a remarkable feat to travel such an emotional roller-coaster without feeling swept away in maudlin, excessive sentiment, but Webb's film, despite its inevitable forays into magic realism and storytelling coincidence, feels all the more crushing credible and honest because of its overtly cinematic touches rather than in spite of them. Even more helpful is the wry, irreverent sense of humour peppering the film throughout, with sly touches such as the sardonic narrator and fleeting, winking breaches of the fourth wall seeming to assure viewers throughout, preventing the emotional extremes from ever becoming excessively dour, or descending into mawkish indie cuteness. Completing the delightful package is Webb's sublime collection of soundtrack choices, serving to effortlessly fill in the emotional gaps when words or actions simply cannot capture the sheer essence of the situation. Of course, despite the cinematic mastery on display, proper casting is essential for a successful relationship film, and in this respect, Webb achieves another triumph. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is flat out remarkable as unabashed romantic and optimist Tom, perfectly carrying the film with unshowy charisma, and an achingly credible emotional resonance, whether thrilled or crushed. However, Tom is not a romanticized hero, and Gordon-Levitt is just as game demonstrating his self-destructive wallowing, creating a more balanced and believable piece of characterization. Equally impressive is Zooey Deschanel as the titular Summer. Just as careful to humanize a potential spite-worthy caricature, Deschanel instead harnesses her trademark luminous quirkiness into something far more real, harder to outright love but impossible not to empathize with. Providing welcome support to the lead couple's flawless chemistry, Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler deliver welcome laughs as Tom's hapless best friends, and character actor Clark Gregg steals many a scene as an overly sentimental greeting card company editor. Delightful, charming, traumatic and eventually hopeful, (500) Days of Summer proves the rare 'romantic comedy' (to use the term extremely loosely) or drama which is just as likely to appeal to unhappy singles as happy couples. Offering a slice of rare realism, all the more credible through its fantastic and cinematic trappings, Webb's film is a rare marvel which should not be missed, if only for the sake of redeeming a genre bogged down in painful cliché and falsities. -9/10",9,1,3,31 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 'Take what you can - give nothing back'
","If a sequel is a dangerous thing in terms of deteriorating storytelling quality, then a third installment is even more perilous, with an even greater risk of destroying characterization and tainting the memory of previously strong installments. Thankfully, such a potential conflict was tastefully avoided for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. In a year fraught with third parts, At World's End, the culminating part of the pirates trilogy makes its mark as one of the few final installments to live up to the vivacity and spirit of its predecessors while still distinctly different enough to for the most part not feel overly familiar or formulaic.As consequence of attempting to do something different enough with the series to keep things interesting but still stay true to the hard won Pirates spirit, At World's End comes across as a hodgepodge of lofty faux-mythology and a slightly darker but still spirited adventure romp. As such, the film's convoluted plot is admittably difficult to follow, but one has to give director Gore Verbinski credit for not dumbing down or rushing his film. Instead, Verbinski takes his time, producing a sprawling epic of an adventure film, with a distinctly different feel than the other two Pirates films, while retaining their charming sense of fun throughout enough to make it easy to forget the occasionally over complicated and lofty plot. Similarly, the film benefits enormously from its astonishing presentation: the stunning costumes, sets and props, as well as some of the most spectacular and elaborate visual effects ever boasted on film (the final showdown sequence is a jaw-dropper) as well as Hans Zimmer's rousing, dramatic score make for such an enormously powerful exterior it is easy to overlook the occasionally confusing storyline and sit immersed in one of the most flooring adventure epics in recent memory. The film is reminiscent of the days of classic Hollywood epics, when a film could drift and dabble about for a bit without being chastised by audiences with shortened attention spans, (Peter Jackson's King Kong remake also fell prey to similar complaints) and no scene is distinctly without purpose. Sure the Singapore sequence and surreal, Kafka-esq hallucination sequence in Davy Jones' locker (one of the most bizarre and memorable depictions of the afterlife, and its inclusion into a mainstream blockbuster is a daring and laudable choice) may not be entirely necessary in terms of furthering the plot, but they sure are tremendously fun, enough so to justify their presence. What does slow the film down are the often overkill and unnecessary inside jokes and references to the first two films - comic double-act Ragetti and Pintel are given far too much screen time to crack the same, increasingly unfunny jokes over and over, and did those two bumbling soldiers from the first film really need to be brought back? The exclusion of such moments could easily trim a good 10 minutes off the lengthy running time, a blessing indeed. However, to the film's credit, such complaints are few, and the extensive story is tied up neatly with surprisingly few plot holes and lapses in continuity for a trilogy which ambitiously covered so much storytelling ground. Despite the film being the third outing for the stellar cast, instead of simply coasting along, they all attack their roles with the same charisma and conviction as the prior two outings. Johnny Depp is just as eccentric, endearing and endlessly charismatic as the now iconic Captain Jack Sparrow, breathing genuine life into the character instead of lapsing into a parody of himself. Orlando Bloom is given more of a chance to expand his undeniably unlimited dramatic range, as his charming Will Turner drifts more into deception and betrayal. Keira Knightley retains her trademark spunky energy yet classical poise as the now seafaring Elizabeth, carrying one of the sole female roles with charisma aplenty. The scene stealing Geoffrey Rush, as a reincarnated Captain Barbossa shows just as much relish in energetically chomping the scenery as ever, as does the enormously talented Bill Nighy, once again outshining the astonishing CGI covering him in tentacles and breathing genuine menace and haunting sadness into his tremendously memorable Davy Jones. Chow Yun-Fat is entertainingly menacing, if sometimes incomprehensible as feared Singapore pirate Sao Feng, and the suitably icy Tom Hollander, Stellan Skarsgård as Will's undead father and the tremendously watchable Naomi Harris as the mysterious Tia Dalma (whose character resolution leaves something to be desired) all reprise their roles to tremendous effect. Instead of simply cutting out the characters of Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's harried father and Jack Davenport as the flawed but noble James Norrington, they are each given one last moment to shine - a classy storytelling touch. And the much hyped Keith Richards (Depp's inspiration for the Jack Sparrow character) cameo is carried out in a far more straightforward and effective fashion than one would anticipate, without the comedic glee of the moment being tampered with. While the film may not quite match up to the uniform excellence of the first, it drifts so tantalizingly close that one is inclined to wish that Verbinski and his creative crew could have ironed out the very few unnecessary bits or lapses in credibility and emerge with a more streamlined adventure escapade. As it is, At World's End still makes its mark as astonishingly strong for a third installment. The film whips along at such a breakneck pace that the lengthy running time elapses in seemingly no time, so immersed are the audience within the unparalleled spectacle of one of the most ambitious and enormously entertaining adventure epics in years - a fitting close to a trilogy which initially boasted the same effect. -8.5/10",9,1,2,31 December 2007
X-Men," Predecessor to a whole generation of successful superhero movies
","When you look at in, X-Men really was a risk when it was first released in 2000. Big budget superhero movies hadn't been successful in ages, the last attempt being the abominable flop 'Batman and Robin'. As well, X-Men incorporated a huge cast, most of which were big name actors, almost all of whom needed roughly equal screen time to make the story work. All in all, it seemed a lot to juggle to make work.Lucky it seems then that a director was attached to the project who actually knew what he was doing. Brian Singer, whose credentials included 'The Usual Suspects', a heist thriller known as one of the most brilliantly executed of all time and 'Apt Pupil', detailing the life of an ex-Nazi trying to incorporate himself into an ordinary lifestyle; seemed like the kind of director who would pass off a comic book film as 'too lowbrow'. But Singer instead embraced the deeper themes of the story, such as societal prejudice and exclusion, and played them for maximum effect. And it worked; X-Men seems surprisingly grounded in reality considering it features characters able to blast laser beams from their eyes and control the weather. The viewer can almost picture themselves inhabiting a world where parents are afraid of their children going to school with the mutant kids.Singer also comprehensively explores the comic backstory of the characters, and brings this into effect. And yet, for all the comic book trivia incorporated into the movie, the plot never sags, or seems overcrowded. Such traits as Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart)'s paternal instinct towards Cyclops (James Marsden), his first student are expressed in only a couple of lines, and yet become definitive and clear to the audience. We also see such characters as Pyro, Shadowcat and Colossus (who made larger appearances in the second movie) take cameos, as if to see which comic fans are paying attention. Truly a classy directorial move. There's also several knowing winks to the characters backstories (the 'what would you prefer - yellow spandex?' line being the most obvious) as well as several cheeky and intelligent touches, such as Wolverine's middle claw, and 'keep your eye open' comment to Cyclops.It also helps that Singer has managed to assemble a stellar cast to bring the much loved characters to life. The movie built solid careers for relative newcomers Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn, and certainly brought Halle Berry more into the commercial spotlight. But the movie not only features many well known actors, but also manages to perfectly capture the essence of the age old characters. Hugh Jackman seems born to play Wolverine; every gesture, every move he makes is purely in character. This also seems to be the case for Patrick Stewart, who makes a pitch perfect Professor Xavier, trainer and mentor to the X-Men. Famke Janssen is a superb Jean Grey giving more depth to what could have been a character written with very little to do. James Marsden also brings the overly strict Cyclops truly to life; his back and forth exchanges with the defiant Wolverine are comic genius, and straight out of the comics. Halle Berry may not have been the most economic choice for Storm (as her behaviour regarding the 2 sequels proves) but she does bring a certain credibility and truth to her character. Ray Park also proves that despite being constantly cast for his stunt skills, he most certainly act, playing a truly edgy and gross Toad, who in the comics was a simpering moron. Rebecca Romijn gives a dangerous edge to the shape shifting Mystique, despite almost certainly being cast for her stunning looks, displayed in full glory, as she is never clothed, with only a few tastefully placed scales, leaving tantalisingly little to the imagination. Wrestler Tyler Mane also makes a menacing and genuinely frightening Sabertooth. But in this cast full of standouts, if one had to pick the single most affecting performance, the only contender is Sir Ian McKellan as the 'humanitarian' villain Magneto. Again, it only goes to show that good casting counts for so very much: what could have been reduced to a campy, ranting performance by another actor is instead morphed into a dignified, cultured and genuinely angry villain. McKellan seems to build layers of repression and injustice into his very soul, with the truthfulness he projects his hatred for humankind, and their intolerance for anything different from themselves. In fact, if it wasn't for Hugh Jackman's brilliant performance, McKellan would easily walk away with the film unchallenged. As is, the picture still belongs to him, but it's an extremely close thing. The exchanges between Magneto and Wolverine are dynamic; you could swear you feel the very air crackling with intensity. So in the end, there's really nothing not to love about X-Men - an incredibly truthful, intelligent and relevant script is brought to life in a remarkably tasteful and affecting manner by a truly skilled director. The tremendously capable cast bring their characters to life in a truly satisfying way, and it's all tied together by a truly enjoyable and powerful score by the late Michael Kamen. All in all, the tremendous success of X-Men served to birth other successful superhero films, such as the Spider-Man series and the recent Batman Begins. But even if viewed as a stand alone, X-Men proves a superbly enjoyable and very solidly made film.-9/10",9,0,0,29 October 2005
Thor: Ragnarok," 'This joke I like it! ANOTHER!'
","Those of us with the unmitigated gall to still love Marvel Studios movies bear a perennial cross: everyone else bemoaning their superhero ennui. How they've had enough of self-important, solemn, formulaic superhero films, with their aimless CGI- drenched climaxes, paint-by-numbers villains, and clumsy scaffolding to sell tickets to future movies. 'All fair,' I respond, as we wait to pre-order our Black Panther tickets. Still, you know what they say about squeaky wheels - Disney execs listen to them, apparently. And lo, there was balance in the Force er Thor-ce? And Ragnarok is its puzzling Skywalker. On one hand, its unfettered comedic whimsy and synth-soaked Flash Gordon pastiche feel like a profound victory for the forces of fun. And yet, there's something perennially off - an indulgence in its kookiness that goes beyond cheeky and strays perilously close to contemptuous at times. Granted, it's perversely appropriate that a blockbuster titled after the apocalyptic eradication of Asgard and the Gods work to dismantle the established tone and mythos of Thor so gleefully. Still, as giddily enjoyable as this apocalypse is, there's still an inescapable sense of the baby being thrown out with the Asgardian bathwater. Thor - a literal 'super-god' - has always been tough to sell. Even Kenneth Branagh, hired for his Shakespearian credentials, subjected ol' Goldilocks to slapstick and punchlines galore (and a meowing Kat Dennings) in his first cinematic outing to keep him accessible. In this regard, the quirky, charming Taika Waititi is an unorthodox but inspired directorial choice, and he musters up more colour, zippiness, and breezy humour that Thor's previous four appearances combined. No gag, be it witty or scatological, is too small for Waititi, and it's rare for his leads to go more than a few minutes without being subjected to some kind of amusing physical comedy indignation (Hiddleston's Loki, of all people, steals the film's biggest laugh and pratfall in one fell swoop). And, varying degrees of silliness or not, the film is uproariously funny from opening to closing shot. What doesn't work as well is the film's comparative lack of consequence otherwise. Well-deserved zany tonal shift or not, Ragnarok is, literally, about the end of the world. And, although proceedings need not be as dark as, er, The Dark World, it is fairly disconcerting-nigh-disrespectful to have a film involving genocide, slavery, the inglorious death of the entirety of Thor's family(!!!), subplots unpacking Asgardian war-crimes and refugees (intriguing but under-explored), and, y'know, the whole end of days thing, be treated with such glib indifference by Waititi's customary impassive deadpan. Characters factually state that they are upset about their tribulations, but it seldom resonates, as Waititi, uncharacteristically, deprives them of the gently emotional character check-ins that elevate his more strictly comedic fare - Viago the vampire pining like a puppy at the window of his aging crush; Ricky Baker's crude, pyromaniac haiku betraying a lifetime of loneliness. Similarly, the film's editing is almost teasingly clumsy, careening between locations and disparate plot points (including a Benedict Cumberbatch cameo as riotously enjoyable as it is transparently superfluous) with a smirking nonchalance. If Waititi's intent was to have his cake and eat it too - taking the p*ss out of Thor while still delivering a straightforward Thor romp - he heartily delivers on the former, but too often at the behest of the latter. Still, as the Grandmaster might chortle, you can debate academic semantics all day, but we all know why we're really here. And, in terms of exhilarating spectacle, Waititi kicks it out of the gladiatorial arena. From fire demons and subterranean dragons, to the impressively nuanced emotions of a certain jolly green giant, Ragnarok boasts some of the most exceptionally realized visual effects in a Marvel film, and Waititi draws a clever contrast between the pristine, techno- mythology panoramas of Asgard (which we finally see, beyond throne room and rainbow bridge!), and the junky, Jack Kirby cubism of Sakaar. Similarly, the film's combat, both in and out of the arena, is fast, furious, and engrossing, with operatically surreal touches - including a showdown between Hela's rippling waves of knives, spaceship lasers, a giant wolf, and two machine guns - keeping proceedings fun and fresh.Chris Hemsworth has proved himself more than reliably adept at flexing comedic muscles in tandem with biceps. Nonetheless, this Thor is a few too many 'Bros' and mugging punchlines away from his past self to fully invest in to the extent we know we can and should. Tom Hiddleston, conversely, continues to find new, compelling wrinkles in Loki - both comedic, as a begrudging whipping boy, and in quiet, crestfallen, recognition of his perennial self-sabotaging his secret aspirations of heroism. Mark Ruffalo is pristinely deadpan without overstaying his welcome, while playing his warring Hulk/Banner character beats of indignant, cavernous loneliness for all their worth. Cate Blanchett preens with masterful predatory menace, but feels almost criminally wasted as yet another frustratingly underdeveloped Marvel foe. Thankfully, Tessa Thompson is coolness personified as the grimly alcoholic Valkyrie, even if Karl Urban's Skurge feels a touch too goofy and hangdog, given his ferocious comic referent. That said, if Ragnarok unleashes one abiding gift unto the world, it's the most unapologetically unhinged Jeff Goldblum since he first growled like a dinosaur back in '93. Every microsecond of Grandmaster weirdness is a rainbow rose of enigmatic wisdom. Thor: Ragnarok stands as a curious, slight overcompensation from a company fighting to appease a virtually built-in audience. Still, as a comedy first, superhero film second, it's an uproariously entertaining ride, albeit one that may leave comic purists wishing Waititi could have dialled down the silly or dialled up the emotion 20% for optimum Odinson. Still, as ThorFour may never grace cinemas, it's sufficient to crank the Led Zeppelin, and ride into the intergalactic sunset with him getting to enjoy himself for once. Excessively nitpicking a swan song so well-deserved would be 'just ugh the worst.' -7.5/10",7,9,15,7 November 2017
Match Point," Relentlessly gripping from start to finish
","After a slew of less than successful films, it seemed that Woody Allen, who it seemed at one point could never fail, had lost his touch, become too dated and formulaic to appeal to modern day audiences. Wisely enough, Allen seems to have realized the best way to stay fresh and interesting is an abrupt change of pace, of base of operations, of genre and of style. The most noticeable difference in Allen's latest, 'Match Point' is the fact that he forgoes his usual NYC setting, replacing it instead with upper crust English society. Also, gone is the light comedic tone and neurotic lead characters who seem only a shallow echo of Allen himself - here we have very different personas spouting significantly different lines than those we are used to hearing in an Allen film. Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a fallen from grace ex tennis pro who marries into wealth to raise his social standing. With a beautiful and enthusiastic wife (Emily Mortimer), her very British brother who Chris instructed in tennis and introduced him to the family (Matthew Goode) and more importantly, their very rich and generous father (Brian Cox) who lands Chris a high ranking position in his business firm, it seemed that Chris had gone from virtually nothing to everything he could ever want in a nauseatingly short time. But Chris' stable and very successful life is rapidly brought to a staggering halt when he is introduced to American actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) who he instantly falls for, despite her being engaged to his future brother-in-law. Complications ensue as Chris and Nola try to decide whether their affections for each other would be worth compromising their very secure lives for each other. Although the main feel of the story may be different territory for Allen, the underlying profundity of the narrative is still there. All throughout the story, we as an audience find ourselves forced to confront the issue 'is passion more desirable than stability?' and likely applying it to our own lives as well. Allen's script is excellent, making so much more out of what could have been a very cheesy and unoriginal story, with numerous great lines only touching on being pretentious at times, but this is largely masked by the two excellent leads and great supporting cast. Performances are excellent across the board, especially from the two leads, who are the main focus of the show, and are easy capable enough of maintaining our interest. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is excellent in the lead as Chris, the ex-tennis pro who grows bored and unhappy with his unnervingly stable life - he really brings Chris' conflicting emotions to play in a truly compelling fashion. Scarlett Johansson is also great as Nola Rice, the unsuccessful actress who also finds herself tempted to choose passion over stability in her life. Despite common sentiments that she was only cast due to her looks, Johansson gives a very strong performance, though it's true that her absolutely stunning beauty is a highlight of the show. There is also excellent support from Emily Mortimer as Chris' wife, who is very nice though not terribly interesting with her constant desire to get pregnant, the very British Matthew Goode as Nola's fiancée, and Brian Cox as Chris' very rich father in law, who essentially secures him a position in life. Cox avoids stereotyping by underplaying the feigned kindness with a streak of intimidation, and his performance is superb - as are everyone else's. In fact, the only real downside of casting is the horrendously stereotypical British police officer, who comes across as hilarious at one of the most crucial and not intended to be funny parts of the movie. Allen has created a truly excellent piece of work here, as Match Point is relentlessly gripping from start to finish. Despite its seemingly simple storyline, we as an audience still manage to be taken aback by each twist of the story, and the ending is nothing less than genuinely surprising, as well as very satisfactory for having not taken the easy way out in storytelling terms. Intrigued? You'll just have to see Match Point for yourself... chances are you won't be disappointed. -8/10",8,1,3,8 April 2006
Zodiac," Anatomy of an investigation
","Given the fact that the story of the Zodiac killer, who left taunting notes in codes and cyphers bragging about his recent kills to the local papers, seemed already like a movie plot brought to life, (several existing films, most famously 1971's Dirty Harry already took inspiration from the real life events) a film adaptation of the tale seemed inevitable. Audiences can be thankful then, that the story was snapped up by the more than capable director David Fincher, himself no stranger to serial killer films after 1995's brilliant Se7en, who blissfully resists the temptation to morph the story into an uninspired, turgid teen slasher film, and instead present the tale as it actually transpired - as an engrossing crime drama. Zodiac looks and feels like a throwback to such 70s political detective stories as All the President's Men, and it is unquestionably refreshing to see a movie detailing a serial killer which is not afraid to allow its audience to think for a change. There is no question that director Fincher has done an abundance of research on his chosen topic, it's Fincher's reverence to his subject matter is both what makes the film a triumph, and yet proves its downfall all at the same time. While the details of the case are admittably fascinating, (though the supposedly objective portrayal of the case does feel rather biased at times, and it's clear who Graysmith, the author of the novel the film adapts, fingered as the real killer) and the film kicks off at a brisk pace, ensnaring the audience's attention right off the bat, it appears Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt have worked perhaps too hard to incorporate every last trace of information regarding the case. While for the first half of the film, it becomes increasingly difficult to pry one's eyes from the screen, once the case moves to the point when the killing spree was long finished, the question is posed as to whether it was essential to the storyline to show every last potential lead to the case. From this point on, the film starts to drag, losing both its momentum and the audience's interest. In the end, for however much energy and factual interest Fincher can squeeze out of his film, it is still a 158 minute movie which the audience knows is going to end in an anti-climax, (anyone following the case in the news knows that the killer's real identity was never discovered) which after a while makes the audience wonder if every ominous piece of foreshadowing is really necessary. A bit of judicious editing, whittling down the talky bits, would make the film feel more streamlined, tense and far more effective. The fact that Fincher's project feels a touch fact bloated at times, especially in the middle section is a shame indeed, for when the film is good, it is a rousing success. The dramatic confrontation scenes crackle with sheer intensity, and the criminal investigation for the most part (especially during the film's beginning and end) is tense and engaging. Fincher also perfectly captures the feel for the period; the 1970s clothing, bustling newspaper offices complete with typewriters and liberal facial hair on most of the male cast members seem to throw the viewer back thirty years flawlessly. The film's score by David Shire also proves highly effective, both at amplifying the tension and dramatic punch of the confrontations with the killer, and helping bring the slower scenes to life more. Overall, the film's strong points still stand out fiercely over the slower bits, and it just feels like a shame whenever the film drags and starts to become uninteresting, since the stronger sections were so intensely engaging it feels almost unjust to begin to lose interest. The film's cast also helps the material rise from a more standard 'based on a true story' serial killer drama to a more realistic and captivating take. Jake Gyllenhaal certainly fits the profile of the earnest young cartoonist who finds himself drawn in by the elusive killer's case, and overall he gives a strong performance though at times his character comes across as a poorly written device to advance the plot, which is irritating to say the least. Mark Ruffalo solidly inhabits the role of the weary inspector Toschi; his laid back charisma perfectly complimenting the character while avoiding the stereotype of the burnt out cop. The perfectly cast Robert Downey Jr. walks away with the show with an energetic and poignant performance as Paul Avery, the charismatic journalist whose life is slowly consumed by the unsolved case. Character actor Brian Cox also makes a welcome appearance as specialist Melvin Belli, and he shines in his brief scenes. Overall, Zodiac succeeds to such a great degree in so many aspects, it is unfortunate to see the more engaging elements of the plot weighed down by so many plot points which feel repetitive and unnecessary. The period feel is immaculate, and Fincher proves his mastery at creating tension more successfully than almost any other director still making films, but overall Zodiac feels like a far greater film struggling to emerge from a padded out simply acceptable film. The film still merits watching for its many successes, but be prepared to invest enough time, thought and interest to fully appreciate the film as a whole.-7/10",7,7,13,4 June 2007
The Prestige," Are you watching closely?
","2006 has certainly been the year for very similar movies being released in pairs. First both Hollywoodland and The Black Dahlia slunk onto mainstream screens, both having almost identical plots set in the same time frame. Then came Infamous, another take on the Truman Capote story, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman the best actor academy award last year. And now, the theme of deception and magic seems to have infiltrated the screens, with the emergence of The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, and... Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, detailing the story of two rival magicians constantly competing to upstage the other, their deadly game reaching increasingly higher stakes. Although comparisons between The Illusionist and Prestige may seem inevitable, safe to say that both are very strong films with admittably incredibly similar plot lines, but in terms of a superior, in areas where Illusionist stumbles, The Prestige seems only to soar, seeming to surpass all audience expectations. Just when the audience feels like they have figured out every last trick The Prestige has to offer, Nolan pitches them a new handful to wrack their brains over. Rather than getting caught up and getting lost in this convoluted structure, the film seems to revel in it, each twist seeming to only improve the quality and intrigue of the film. It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's incredible skill as a director and writer that he has shown such a run of success in film-making, having had arguably nothing less than a hit thus far, starting with his barely financed but incredibly successful thriller Momento, all the way to last year's incredibly well made Batman Begins, one of the strongest superhero films to date. Nolan seems to really thrive on unusual plot structures, showing a tendency to start the film right before the end of the story, then flashback throughout the course of the film, with occasional jumps back and forth in the storyline to keep the viewers watching closely. (Batman Begins also used this exact structure) It also goes without saying that Nolan retains his usual eye for costumes and set design, and the Victorian age has never looked so sumptuous as under the eyes of Nolan. He is without a doubt one of the most innovating and interesting directors around these days, and we can only hope a Batman sequel is indeed in the cards for him.Another major aspect in which The Prestige surpasses all potential peers is in the phenomenal cast. If such a cast has been assembled anytime of late, it is unlikely it was to such powerful effect, as each cast member contributes a simply wonderful performance to an already astonishing film. The casting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale alongside each other is already enough to provoke mouth watering in about 98% of the population, whether admiring them for talent, looks, or the prospect of Wolverine and Batman sparring off. Either way, they are easily the acting standouts, and both deliver Oscar nomination worthy performances endowed with incredible charisma and skill. (Jackman comes across as the stronger, seeming a bit more emotionally genuine, but it's debatable as to which is the more acclaim worthy as they both deliver such sublime performances) Michael Caine is a classy and brilliant touch as the engineer Cutter, and a rare appearance from David Bowie as electrical inventor Nikola Tesla is a perfect piece of casting, as Bowie's appearance in the film seems to rival that of his character: elusive, exciting and and mysterious. Scarlett Johansson delivers a fine performance as Jackman's character's stage hand, despite several cringe-worthy slips of her Cockney accent, and Rebecca Hall has a somewhat repetitive role to deal with as Bale's character's wife, but still gives a great performance in the end. And of course, it's always great to see the vastly underrated Andy Serkis give yet another top notch performance as Tesla's assistant. All in all, The Prestige is an incredibly classy and powerful film event - packed with more twists and turns than any viewer, no matter how clever would be able to predict, and fueled with an astonishing cast giving wonderful performances, headed all the while by careful yet powerful writing and directing, on the part of Nolan, who can seem to do no wrong. We can only hope that more movies of this caliber come to theaters soon, as The Prestige is one of the most interesting, genuinely gripping and entertaining thrillers in recent film history. -9.5/10",10,5,9,21 October 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Keep your head on
","The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the Headless Horseman is a timeless one; everyone knows it. So how better to re-tell this story in an interesting and innovative fashion which will appeal to today's audiences than to hire quirky filmmaker Tim Burton, whose eccentric sets and expertise at mood building are a fair guarantee that the film will be interesting, if nothing else. Burton lives up to his reputation here; Sleepy Hollow may prove to be his most atmospheric film yet. The sets of the town Sleepy Hollow are marvelously strange, (and very Burton-esq for any fans) perfectly capturing the feel of this shady, timewarped town. There's also a constant feel that something isn't right, as if dark forces could strike out at any moment. (aided by Danny Elfman's triumphant score, which I enjoyed, but found too intrusive at times: when the tension should have been built slowly and sickeningly to draw the viewer in further, Elfman sometimes brings it to a crashing climax far too quickly) It helps of course, that the village residents have the grizzled look of having stepped out of a child's fairy tale book, especially Burton favorite Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDarmid and Jeffrey Jones as some of the town elders. Burton even manages to sneak in a brief role from another favorite of his, Christopher Lee, who manages to be typically imposing and commanding, standing out even though he was in only a single short scene.Of course, Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch, and he manages to make the role of Ichabod Crane his own, filled with twitchy mannerisms and girlish squeaks. Crane may not be the typical action hero, but he is delightfully personified, and just quirky enough to work. Christina Ricci also gives a strong performance as Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of Baltus (Michael Gambon) and Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) unofficial leaders of the town. Katrina appears to be the only innocent and pure character, yet with some undisclosed dark secrets of her own. Ricci pulls off the character believably, though she struggles with her accent at times. However it is great to see such classy actors as Gambon and Richardson as the mysterious unofficial magistrates. Both turn out excellent and dignified performances, though both graze the line of going over the top during some of the more dramatic scenes. Even Casper Van Dien gives a satisfying performance as a highly suspicious village resident. And of course, it's great to see Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman during a flashback sequence with his head on - Walken proves that he is truly one of the greatest actors still around as he manages to make his role utterly terrifying without speaking a single word. (although to be fair, his makeup does help add to the effect, but it's easy to believe he could have been equally frightening without it) The strong performances from the cast help the film hold strong during some of the weaker sequences, and really help make the film a success. Although, another major draw will be Burton's unique and creative set design and trait for really giving the sense of immersing the audience into a complete other world. If you are willing to forgive the occasional weak plot point, Sleepy Hollow is an excellent way to spend an evening, immersing yourself into Burton's dark world and profound imagination. This truly does seem to be the movie he was born to make.-8/10",8,1,2,24 August 2005
Ready Player One," We're not gonna need a bigger film
","For Ernest Cline, the prospect of The Steven Spielberg even acknowledging Ready Player One, let alone directing its cinematic adaptation, must have felt as head-explodingly awesome but utterly impossible as a high-five from Indiana Jones. And yet, in the words of a certain Doctor Malcolm: life found a way. And, to those (not unfairly) worrying that the iconic Spielberg would lack the ironic distance to do justice to Cline's hyperactive, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink mashup of 80s/90s pop culture nerd nostalgia: hold onto your butts.* It's been seven long years since Tintin, after which Fun Spielberg buried his head into the muted realm of historical biopics. But, like the Terminator, boy is he back, baby, and making up for lost time like nobody's business. In the thick of an entertainment industry currently ruled by the iron first of nerd chic, Spielberg's Ready Player One feels like a Donkey Kong-sized warm hug (with accompanying a-Ha soundtrack, natch) - an unironic love letter to loving things, told with consummate affection and plenty of gusto by a master storyteller. It's a visually dazzling, uninhibitedly indulgent kaleidoscope of nostalgia, old-fashioned in the best possible sense (mostly), and rambunctiously fun from Van Halen to Hall & Oates. But, for those poor audiences who have never picked up a video game controller, fear not: there is more to Ready Player One than a 'Where's Waldo' of pop culture cameos (though it's hard to imagine a film that will ever benefit more from revisitation with freeze-frame capacity). It's a jubilantly jaunty grand ol' adventure romp - an action remix of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? meets Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory if you will, and easily as fun, albeit less groundbreaking, than both. The plot is a furious pinball of episodic adventures, which, necessarily, boils down and speeds up Cline's more expansive odyssey without losing its zippiness or stakes. Spielberg, to his credit, plays it straight with adorable old-school earnestness, even if some of the script's more overly convenient contrivances and antiquated gender roles that come along for the ride don't play nearly as well now as they would've in their heyday (Cline's novel unpacks toxic gamer masculinity a bit more deftly than Wade's more rudimentary heroism here). Still, it's hard to nit-pick a transparently superfluous plot in the face of such a thrillingly dense virtual world. The film's visual effects are jaw-dropping, bringing each digital planet and avatar in engrossing game-world 'the Oasis' to life with such painstaking attention that we bypass the claustrophobic artifice exhaustion that would customarily come with such CGI overload. Even more laudable: anchoring the film with two plasticine-y Final Fantasy-esq avatars without them grating. Spielberg cleverly starts with a splashy racetrack blowout (far more exhilarating than the stale trailer footage would suggest), then ramps up the spectacle slowly, before letting it rip with a bonkers kitchen sink climax, almost deliriously fun in its crowd-pleasing excesses (The Iron Giant vs. Mechagodzilla? YES PLEASE). Alan Silvestri's joyfully thundering musical score (and a bevy of perfectly timed '80s tunes) triumphantly rounds out the fun, replete with its own collection of musical cameos. Great Scott, but there is fun to be had.  It helps immensely to see Spielberg reigniting his Minority Report flair for deliciously weird comedy beats. He finds such perverse glee in a room full of corporate stooges running menacingly on treadmills with VR headsets, like a call centre of gaming hamsters, or in tormenting audiences expecting a nonstop bubblegum fun-fest with a transparently indulgent second act foray into Kubrick's The Shining - a tonal shift so jarringly terrifying you can practically hear Spielberg cackling in the background. Still, even scarier is Spielberg turning his pop culture icon eye inwards, ever so lightly rapping the knuckles of those who deep dive a little too much into fantasy worlds, and gently reminding them to live in, and appreciate, the real world as well. It's a commentary that might rankle some of the film's key demographic, but essential to Ready Player One being more than blatant fan service: love what you love uninhibitedly, Spielberg and Cline urge us, but remember that pop culture is meant to accentuate the real world, not run away entirely from it. It's as profound as the film ever gets, but it resonates. No one wants to turn into a suited hamster-ball drone... right? Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, and Lena Waithe are all perfectly pleasant as the lead gamers-turned-world saviours, appropriately fun and charismatic without ever rocking the boat of their cardboard cutout archetypes. Ben Mendelsohn adds an endearingly safe-effacing comedic undercurrent to what is otherwise a complete retread of his Rogue One sinister bureaucrat schtick, while T.J. Miller provides reliable comic relief as his caustically cantankerous muscle. Still, it's Mark Rylance who easily steals the show as Wonka-esq gaming maverick James Haliday. Adorably convincing as a ferociously antisocial tech geek, while conveying volumes of mischievous playfulness or voluminous regret with the slightly movement of his eyes or mouth, Rylance is as larger-than-life as he is profoundly human, and he elevates Spielberg's material immensely. Finally, though tragically restricted to an underserved cameo, Simon Pegg still blusters adorably like the best of them in his fleeting screentime. Ready Player One is a distinctly niche film - enormously fun, but not always more than the sum of its parts, and those who can't tell their Space Invaders from their Galaga are, admittably ,likely to lose out on the full effect. But, if Lara Croft, Beetlejuice, Marvin the Martian, some Halo Spartans and World of Warcraft orcs racing down a freeway in a Delorean, 1960s Batmobile, A-Team battle van, Akira bike and more, dodging King Kong and a t-rex gets your blood pumping as much as mine is from writing that sentence, chances are you'll devour the film with a befitting bombastic, escapist gluttony. And that's a guilty pleasure worth dropping a quarter or two into.  -8.5/10 *Yep - two Jurassic Park nods in two sentences. Deal with it, n00bz.",9,0,2,14 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," Bear Trap
","For a man who's awfully fond of four letter words, 'hate' may be Quentin Tarantino's most appropriate in encapsulating his eighth (ha) feature film. Saddled with a production narrative of script leakage and bitterness that eerily mirrored its parable of backstabbing and deceit, Tarantino's second western (or third, if you count Kill Bill Vol. 2) stubbornly slogged through all foreseeable obstacles like its antiheroes trudging through the deepening snow, just in time to wink at its Christmas Day release by opening on a crucified Jesus buried by a blizzard. And, after all that, critic-baiting as its title may seem, the final experience of The Hateful Eight is begrudgingly hard to hate. Dear God does he make you wait for it, but that sonofagun Tarantino has done it again, doggonnit.This is not immediately apparent. As if extracting his own revenge for the burn of initial script theft, Tarantino stretches his fondness for listening to his characters eloquently prattle on about repetitive, subtext-riddled inanities to the breaking point, introducing his band of miscreants in so playfully lackadaisical a fashion it's excruciating. But then, right when the viewer would be thrown into a rage by one more pregnant pause as Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell wax poetic about Lincoln, in comes another basterd (Hater?), and the field of carefully played out character dynamics and social politics has the rug yanked out from under it again. It's a dangerous waiting game Tarantino plays, and those watching in the privacy of their own home will be sorely tempted to scornfully give up. Trust me: stick it out. It's worth it.But don't be hasty. One we hole up in Minnie's haberdashery to wait out the punishing blizzard (and Tarantino has great fun building this rich, almost theatrical set, including a recurring gag necessitating nailing the front door shut every time it's kicked down), there's more waiting to be done, albeit with almost palpably thick storm clouds of tension preparing to burst. Here, we're reminded of what the 'hateful' in the title is really about, as Tarantino digs deep into the political fallout of the Civil War and the storied racism it fostered (which, as Tarantino himself would cheerily remind you, remains poignantly topical today), with far less problematically bungled racial politics than Django Unchained, though nearly as uncomfortably racially slurry (historically accurate? Sure. Necessary? Hmm). This infuses the Agatha Christie/The Thing-in- the-old-west's potboiler tension with prescient motive: any number of the fiends stewing in the haberdashery could by lying or have it out for one another for any number of reasons. So we wait. For the entire. Length. Of. An. Average. Feature. Film. And then, the bear trap narrative snaps viciously into play, and we're reminded why we keep giving this preening basterd our money in the first place.Insanely over-the-top bloodbaths, fourth-wall poking flashbacks narrated by none other than a smirking QT himself (including a dastardly cheeky wink about the benefits of patience, that rotter), and a razor-sharp context finally, cathartically, making itself known, The Hateful Eight's second half payoff IS why you came. It's vintage Tarantino, savagely funny and operatically violent, and all the sillier by being bottled by the pristinely precise cinematography (between this and The Revenant, most of 2015's most beautiful images involve blizzards) and sound work, and punched up by the visceral power of Ennio Morricone's sparse, soulful dirge of an original(!) score. Naturally, it's hard to decide who to root for - everyone is pretty irredeemable for their own reasons - but Tarantino's whip-pan power plays gleefully force you to decide, then hate yourself for it, in a sadistically playful puppeteering act that plays out in really the only way it ever could. Remember that whole first act chat about legal justice vs. frontier justice you discounted as more killing time? Yeah. You will.Samuel L. Jackson has been waiting twenty years for a meaty Tarantino lead role (again: delayed gratification), but his first one here does not disappoint. Eschewing his normal shoutiness, Jackson finds the power in calmness as he methodically pokes each character around him into going to pieces and showing their hand, his magnetic, force-of-nature charisma put to magnanimous use. Kurt Russell is equally riveting, his sour resolve as mighty as his moustache as he attempts to beat meaning out of the standoff and his prisoner alike. As said bounty, Jennifer Jason Leigh is a firebrand, gargling pathos, blood, and gallows humour with venomous ambivalence, as she is subjected to almost every possible indignity imaginable in this surly boys club. Walton Goggins is similarly disgustingly likable as the purported sheriff of the upcoming town, as impossible to get a beat on as it is impossible to assess whether his sheriff story is utter bunk or not. The rest of the miscreants, all Tarantino vets, patiently (see?) await their moments to shine -though Tim Roth's effetely weaselly gentleman- hangman and Bruce Dern's indignantly racist Confederate general are highlights - while even newbie Channing Tatum spits Tarantino verbiage like the best of them in a cameo that suggests Tarantino must be a Gambit fan.But, as the rogues simmer on about something being rotten in the state of Wyoming, is it worth the wait (in more ways than one)? Ultimately yes, though even Tarantino deserves a knuckle-rap for indulging himself almost to the breaking point here, when the same effect could have been fostered with up to an hour lopped off. Unapologetically bloated as it is, The Hateful Eight gives you all of the Tarantino mayhem you want to those patient enough to ride out the calm before the storm. Hell, it's probably the only virtue he's ever advocated for, so maybe it should be commended. Still: pairing Quentin with an editor who forces him to keep his running time under 90 minutes? Ultimate frontier justice.{And, of course, how could this be rated anything but:}-8/10",8,5,14,18 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," 'There's no such thing as truth. It's bullsh*t. Everyone has their own truth, and life just... does whatever the f*ck it wants.'
","Ahh, the biopic - the film genre with arguably the greatest margin for error minefield of them all. How to tell the story of a real-life subject, not in documentary form, passing on all pertinent information while dodging a delivery drowning in cliché and inorganic exposition? Well, self-directed rhetorical question, I'm glad you asked that - because here is our latest answer. Behold: I, Tonya, a film that captures the quintessential zippy delirium of the wild, almost unbelievable ride of Olympic skater Tonya Harding's rise to fame and subsequently infamy without selling short the human story underneath the media histrionics. It's playful, clever, at once sobering and maliciously fun, and, without question, one of the most original, evocative, and punchy takes on 'based on a true story' seen in ages. Pundits of Hollywood biopics often sneer 'why not just watch the documentary?' - so, appropriately, director Craig Gillespie sneers right back with an apropos Tonya Harding belligerence, telling his film as a simulated talking heads 'faux-documentary.' It's an inspired way of sidestepping clichéd biopic trappings, as well as amusingly toying with their ostentatious pretentious of authenticity, complete with the ambiguity of multiple narrators who aren't as much unreliable as overtly contradictory - of each other, and even themselves. Riotously entertaining a Rashômon riff as it is, Gillespie spoon-feeds nothing to his audience, forcing us to draw our own assumptions and conclusions on Harding and her entourage, assessing each of their own complicity in the train wreck their story would become. It can be emotionally disconcerting having to sift through the uncorroborated scenes comprising the narrative - were Tonya's husband and mother really as horrifically abusive as depicted here, or are their depictions exaggerated by Tonya's traumatic memories, or hyperbolic embellishments? And how responsible WAS Tonya for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan? Gillespie remains playfully coy, with a jet-black sense of humour underpinning proceedings no matter how violent or terrible they get, forcing the viewer to themselves decide how emotionally resonant they find Harding's story without the guiding influence of Hollywood conventions. In many ways, I, Tonya is as much a p*ss-take on Hollywood conventions as it is a fleshed-out telling of Harding's story. Like Tonya, it's noticeably rough and disheveled on the exterior, with hazy lighting and (presumably purposefully) endearingly clumsy editing capturing the faded lycra aesthetic of a daytime true crime special aired at the height of Harding's heyday - appropriately tongue-in-cheek for a film that so actively confronts class discrepancies and the superficial nature of public performance and award ceremonies (resulting Oscar wins notwithstanding, naturally). Conversely, as with the real Tonya Harding, the film finds its truest elegance and energy through skating, as Harding's performance sequences are invigoratingly entertaining, conjuring the breathless thrill of watching a triple axel (as CGI seamlessly simulates Robbie performing the seldom-repeated stunt). Still, it's unquestionably the cast who land the film's proverbial jump, perfectly committing to a tone so emotionally sincere it verges on histrionic, in keeping with the bizarre escalation of Harding's story. Margot Robbie is at her best as the titular Tonya, employing her vivacious charisma and rough-and-tumble belligerence as a feeble shell for a woman desperately seeking validation in all the wrong places. Allison Janney has a ball crafting one of cinema history's most awful mothers, her endless tirade of sarcasm and abuse as darkly funny as it is chilling (and getting surprising mileage out of bantering with a bird, to boot). Still, Janney is too deft a performer not to play the character's notes of regret and perverse caring, and they register like the faintest flecks falling off a monolithically colourful and resonant performance. Sebastian Stan bravely undercuts his roguish, dopey charm with a streak of jarringly disturbing violence as Tonya's caustically unshakeable boyfriend/husband, while walking cartoon Paul Walter Hauser embodies Stan's doofus partner-in-crime with such hilarious conviction, watching him side-by-side the real Shawn over the film's credits is almost unnerving. A breath of sardonic fresh air amidst 2017's Oscar contenders, I, Tonya is a deceptively clever slow-burner, with surprisingly resonant critical commentaries on emotionally handholding Hollywood storytelling, domestic violence, celebrity culture, and how the judicial system is swayed by the popular media narrative. It's also the most memorable film about skating since 2005's simpering Ice Princess, and beats the sh*t out of it in terms of watchability, and even good skating. And if anything about I, Tonya would be likely to appeal to the real Tonya Harding, it's that. -8.5/10",8,0,0,24 March 2018
Moana," Never trust a big crustacean's impatience
","If Frozen was Disney's (anti-traditional)wedding film - anchoring a snarky, tongue-in-cheek ill-advised pairing with family drama, dubiously scheming relations, anxiety, and outbursts of repressed ice powers (what - what was your wedding like?) - Moana is the perfect Honeymoon, and ideal palate cleanser for a generation of preschoolers who just won't Let It Go. Fittingly, amidst the tropical paradise trappings, it's also a film with classicism on the brain, recruiting veteran The Little Mermaid directors Ron Clements and Don Hall for such a grand, old-fashioned seafaring 'hero's journey' Disney film you practically expect Moana to wave to Timon and Pumba along the way. It's telling that Moana is narratively rooted in the tension between respecting tradition and individualism, as the film plays like a tapestry of the greatest hits of where Disney has gone, while leaning towards frontiers it hopes to continue to push. And if Moana, one of the most lushly emotive, visually jaw-dropping, and inventively fun releases, not just for 'Modern Disney' but 'All-Time Disney,' the House of Mouse is in no danger of losing its mojo for untold years to come. There's a comforting simplicity in Moana's three-act structure, but it's a familiar enough setup to momentarily risk getting too caught up tracking allusions to past Disney hits (Pocahontas' restless individualism in the face of tradition and environmental subtext; Hercules' moving artwork as surrogate Jiminy Cricket 'conscious', and so on) to follow the unfurling plot. Still, Clements and Hall attack it with gusto, and an almost primal resonance and depth of feeling that's a welcome callback to Ye Olde Disney Classics. If Disney has one overarching theme throughout its oeuvre, it's dissatisfaction with the status quo, and Moana (newcomer Auli'i Cravalho; luminously charismatic, and an almost eerily emotive singer)'s quarantine on her seemingly idyllic island paradise, taunted by the inaccessible sea she yearns to explore, each refrain of expositional tune Where You Are quickly becomes almost noxiously claustrophobic. Thankfully, the anthropomorphic sea and Moana's wacky- but-wise grandmother (Rachel House's creaky affectations, perfectly creased with heart) have other ideas - there's destiny afoot, and no time to waste. As such, there's an almost tangible feeling of cathartic release when she finally Lets It G-ahem-bursts out to the sea, joining up with rambunctiously boastful demigod Maui (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, whose oaken tones impart an exquisitely larger-than-life playfulness) for a buddy-cop road trip steeped in carefully reverent Polynesian mythology. Their adventures are fun, but fairly rote and episodic, but we're still in 'Love Is An Open Door' meta-Disney mode here, and Clements and Hall are careful to pivot whenever cliché threatens to encroach. Here, the plucky, confident yet quirkily neurotic titular 'don't-call-her-a-princess' realizes the best way to honour her ancestral traditions is to seemingly rebel against them, the blowhard Maui is lent a deceptively downbeat backstory, and there's not a whiff of a romantic subplot to stifle the fun. Instead, we plunge full steam ahead into a sublimely bonkers Mad Max homage chase with a murderous band of coconut pirates, a (sadly rushed) foray into an under- underwater Land of the Monsters, headlined by treasure-encrusted-crustacean Tamatoa (the effervescently witty Jemaine Clement, having a ball camping up his David Bowie-spoofing glam rock crab - geddit?). Eventually, the plot cascades into a showdown with a gigantic lava monster, which subverts expectations by poignantly furthering Disney's recent trend in unorthodox, nonviolent climax resolution (see also: Marvel's Doctor Strange). Moana's power ballad is 'How Far I'll Go,' and Clements and Hall certainly take her at her word. Still, Moana truly reaches the realm of the greats as an almost flawlessly dazzling sensory experience. Showcasing arguable some of the most gorgeous animation ever to cross the silver screen, Moana dazzles in details grand and small, from the flecks of flame dribbling off the immense lava monster sizzling into the sea, from the breeze rustling through the coconut trees on Moana's home island, to Moana's grandmother's spirit gliding through the ocean like a spectral manta ray, only to soar into the sky, crashing into the constellations. The sentient ocean alone allows for a treasure trove of outstanding visuals - the money shot is its introduction, parting itself (take that, Moses) to create an ensconcing aquarium wall around toddler Moana, though if you've ever wondered what a wave cocking its head incredulously would look like, now you know. Matching the sumptuous visuals head on is the gorgeous music, including the movingly earthy melodies of Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i, and the breathlessly nimble wordplay of Hamilton scribe Lin-Manuel Miranda, make Moana's soundtrack immediately rank among the most infectiously earwormy Disney tunes of all time. Tamatoa's setpiece alone is an unforgettable masterclass of sight and sound, as the humongous bejewelled crab turns into a bioluminescent disco ball, battering Maui while simultaneously poking at the film's 'love yourself' theme. Did I mention he rhymes 'demigod' with 'decapod' (look it up)? You don't see that in The Secret Life of Pets. It may toe the line of over-familiar for some more jaded viewers, and it's less character-driven than recent compatriots Frozen and Zootopia, but Moana is still practically bursting with abiding excellence. Visually sumptuous, musically magnificent, neatly sidestepping pitfalls of convention, and lent a uniquely wacky charisma by the superb cast, Disney continues to push the envelope for considerate and mature storytelling - kid-appropriate, but also surprisingly resonant for the parents discreetly wiping aside tears beside them. All this, and Alan Tudyk cameos through the clucks of an impossibly stupid comic relief rooster. Is it any wonder the film's catchiest tune is simply titled 'You're Welcome'? -9.5/10",9,5,17,12 December 2016
Snatch," Brutally funny, a stylish masterpiece
","The tightly knit formula for the average 'heist movie', is constantly in danger of becoming predictable to the point of redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry, so to see a film quietly whisk in and reinvigorate the genre was a refreshing feat indeed. And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch. Director Ritchie has somewhat fallen out of favour with both critics and audiences of late with both his ill-advised cinematic tribute to his wife Madonna, Swept Away, and his nonsensical gambling drama Revolver, so it is easy to forget how masterful a filmmaker he can truly be when given the chance. Ritchie's convoluted tale, which ties together three parallel stories involving a diamond theft and the world of unlicensed bare knuckle boxing in the British underground may prove to be too full of twists and turns to be followed entirely on the first viewing. This, along with the stylistic similarities to its predecessor may prove to be the film's only major criticism; however, it is highly unlikely the majority of audiences will feel alienated by the fact that the adrenaline fuelled plot may prove hard to follow, and instead relish the chance to revisit the film multiple times to pick up on things they may have missed in previous viewings. In a film with as much to appreciate as this, it comes as no surprise that multiple viewings never seem to detract from the experience, but that the film seems only to increase in quality upon each viewing. Stylistically, the film is in a class of its own, employing hyper-kinetic cinematography and editing, which proves to be some of the most vivid and inventive work demonstrated in recent cinematic history. The film's score and musical selection is consistently pitch perfect, and endlessly catchy, never failing to amplify the seedy yet comical mood. Ritchie's sense of pacing is impeccable, and how a film which opens with a group of Jewish rabbis entering a bank, (which in itself sounds like the beginning to a particularly brilliant joke) only to steal its valuable contents, launching the film into an adrenaline fuelled title sequence could ever be considered not funny or at the very least oozing with style is beyond conventional logic. Ritchie also proves to have a real eye for location, and in each scene the viewer feels fully immersed in the grunge and filth of the underground, making the film that much more effective. The ensemble cast rise to the challenge of bringing Ritchie's brilliant screenplay to life, and turn out universally superb performances, each creating a unique and memorable character, complete with catchy names. Jason Statham is consistently strong as boxing promoter Turkish; his deadpan delivery and excellent narration carry the film wonderfully. Steven Graham similarly raises many a laugh as his consistently dumbfounded sidekick, Tommy. Benicio Del Toro makes wonderful use of his far too brief screen time as gambling addicted diamond thief Franky Four Fingers - his Las Vegas gambling flashbacks are nothing less than flat out hilarious. Ritchie favourite Vinnie Jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary Bullet Tooth Tony (a role it would seem is only a step away from his real life persona) and Russian actor Rade Serbedzija creates a simply classic character as arms dealer 'Boris the Blade'. Character actor Alan Ford makes for an exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark 'Brick Top', and Robbie Gee and Lennie James are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves. But surprisingly enough, the film's unlikely standout proves without a question to be its biggest star: Brad Pitt, waltzing in to steal the show as incomprehensible 'Pikey' boxer Mickey - an egoless and thoroughly hilarious performance. Though this may be familiar ground for those who have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is no less enjoyable as a result - brutally violent, caustic and hilarious, with Ritchie's trademark sense of incomparable style. Snatch excels in every possible aspect, and the truly talented cast bring their vibrant characters to life with unquestionable flair, each one flat out hilarious when given their moment to shine. Though all of the film's intricacies may not be entirely clear on the first viewing, this only makes each following viewing all the more intriguing and entertaining. For those who have yet to appreciate the cinematic genius that is Snatch... don't wait for protection from 'Zee Germans', simply see it!-10/10",10,10,15,23 July 2007
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Welcome home, web-head
","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes? Rest easy, true believers: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. Right from the playful strains of a certain familiar theme over the opening logos, it's immediately apparent that Marvel Studios have not treated the reacquisition of their most beloved character lightly. Director Jon Watts' film practically leaps off the screen with a bouncy, mischievous energy, snappy humour, and such a sheer outpouring of joy at its own existence (no tired teen angst here!) that it's nigh impossible to resist grinning from start to finish. In contrast to the increasingly cosmic Marvel Cinematic Universe growing around it, Homecoming is winningly small and intimate: not only does Watts paint a love letter to the rough and tumble charm of Queens and its inhabitants, but the film's stakes are not the fate of the world or universe, but, appropriately, the neighbourhood becoming less friendly. It's a hugely welcome tonic to blockbuster bloat, and the rare summer romp with space for characters to breathe. Watts channels Parker's bustling eagerness for a higher calling into one of the most organic, truthful depictions of a modern high school, with a John Hughes ear for its stresses, infantilization, and small joys. One sequence, where Peter wrestles with the ethics of crashing a party as Spider-Man to raise his social standing to help bag a date to the titular dance, is so adorably true to the character it's hard not to shed a tear in gratitude. It's telling that we know and care more about Parker's high school classmates than many of the B-tier, celebrity-cast superheroes in the MCU, and Laura Harrier, Zendaya, Tony Revolori (whose Flash, while no longer a jock, hits terribly credible cringeworthy notes of modern bullying), and especially Jacob Batalon (who sells many of the film's comedic and emotional beats with surprisingly hilarious aplomb) flesh them out superbly. Paradoxically, the film's grounded aesthetic also helps blend it into the MCU much more seamlessly than many of its cohort, reframing the MCU's macro conflicts through a nonplussed ground level (upon an exquisitely tongue-in-cheek Chris Evans cameo, Parker's teacher deadpans 'or maybe he's a war criminal now. I dunno'), while the House of Mouse cheerfully works in Star Wars swag at every turn. But, in the midst of this uncharacteristically unassuming 'world-building,' for Marvel, the fun and thrills have not been left crammed into a locker. Watts' action interludes are fizzy, raucous, clumsy (one car chase has Peter destroying - and chatting with - most of Queens in his inexperienced tenacity), and just as exhilarating as any of the bigger, brawnier Marvel counterparts. If anything, Watts infuses his blowouts with such worry Peter is in way over his head (his heroic intervention to the crumbling Washington Monument is interrupted by a panic attack from the altitude), that emotions are unprecedentedly ratcheted up for superhero combat. Even initial concerns of Spider-Man being too governed by Stark tech melt away in the face of Parker's unquenchable enthusiasm in the face of his costume's wacky potential, as his stacked super-suit cues many of the film's biggest laughs (two words: 'Intimidation Mode'), while Michael Giacchino's twinkling score soars and lilts with the quintessence of Spider-Man. Michael Keaton's Vulture is unexpectedly terrifying, adding a uniquely aerodynamic to keep their tussles fresh and thrilling. Keaton's idiosyncratic, bristling, and grimly heartfelt performance (a righteously indignant 'working class hero' antithesis to Tony Stark) takes what could have been another bland, disposable villain and makes him one of the most deceptively memorable and compelling of the MCU. There are the slightest wobbles in the web - the Shocker is fun but a touch underwhelming for such a cult classic Spider-foe, while Donald Glover's cameo is amusing but superfluous. But in the face of the film's relentless outpouring of fun and heart, including a third act twist as astonishingly unexpected as it is retroactively self- evident, they are less than inconsequential. And there is one sequence, ripped from the comic pages of the Lee/Ditko days, that is almost overwhelmingly emotional, anchoring the core 'tireless underdog' ethos of Spider-Man in tearfully perfect fashion. And Tom Holland. Dear Tom Holland. To call his impish, earnest charisma perfect for Peter Parker would be an understatement - he's almost achingly affable and human in and out of homespun or high tech costume, with a flair for pitch-perfect Spider-quips, raw vulnerability, and self-reproachful asides that are almost too lovable for words. In short, he is Spider-Man through-and-through. Supporting him, Robert Downey Jr. continues to find unexplored wrinkles in his eighth time embodying Tony Stark, and his clumsy 'Uncle Tony' mentoring ('my dad was never there for me, so, uh, breaking the cycle of shame') is hugely amusing without overstaying his welcome. Marisa Tomei is too effervescently delightedly not to larb as Aunt May (now with more charm and less life lessons! Yay!), while Jon Favreau is reliably hilarious as the crusty Happy Hogan. Homecoming doesn't just do whatever a spider can - it redefines Spider-Man while showing unprecedented care and affection for what makes the character tick, all while teeming with humour, heart, humanity, and infectious fun. Soak it in, Spider-Friends. He's home. -9.5/10",10,117,204,15 July 2017
The Expendables," Pumped up testosterone fest flayed of excitement and fun - a mirthless, surprisingly boring, noisy exercise in self-congratulation
","ex·pend·a·ble/ikˈspendabel/Adjective 1. (of an object) Designed to be used only once and then abandoned or destroyed. 2. Of little significance when compared to an overall purpose, and therefore able to be abandoned.Remember the '80s? Those glory days where masculinity was epitomized (at least in the eyes of Hollywood) by men so enormous and muscular that even their eyes seem to flex, mowing through hordes of enemies using weapons larger than themselves with reckless abandon? Well Sylvester Stallone certainly doesn't have enough faith that you do, attempting to epitomize all the flagrant excesses of a decade in action films into a single bombastic one. So promised the movie's pre-release press at any rate. What such press failed to report was the crushing reality that Stallone may not understand the genre in which he himself proved such a pivotal figure very much at all. Or that his 'opus', The Expendables, proves just as bloated, flimsy, drab and soulless a gratuitous action film as any that have crossed multiplexes in many a year. Granted, any seeking out a film with such a bevy of behemoth-bicep performers for acting, story or emotional resonance would be laughably misguided in the first place. However, the particular joy of the '80s romps Stallone is attempting to steal from is a certain degree of self-effacing acknowledgement of their own ridiculous excesses, whereas The Expendables is played largely straight faced, as if fully buying into its own ludicrous 'epic mythology', despite being founded entirely on a plot so outrageously useless (some mumbled mercenary mission turned 'the woman I just met is cute so I will risk all of our lives to rescue her' escapade) it seems Stallone hacked out his portion of the script after one too many combat rehearsals. Furthermore, the film's pathetic attempts at surgically grafting humour or romance into the hackneyed mess only deepens the grave – hearing Statham and Stallone mope about their respective lady troubles in a helicopter marks one of the lowest points of Hollywood storytelling in ages. While there exist rare smudges of interesting musings on the rather obvious concern of 'being too old for this sh*t', largely products of a bygone era (naturally no thought is devoted to the seeming necessity of padding the cast with more recent hard hitters such as Statham or Li), Stallone's film appears to have devoted more time ticking off boxes of 'what other action badasses can we cast and subsequently not utilize?' than devoting any real thought to the film beyond the realm of concept. But surely the action more than compensates for a script that is atrocious even by genre standards? Sadly no. It For a film filled with such an array of explosions, clouds of bullets and flying knives, The Expendables comes across as shockingly boring, with fights largely wrecked by atrocious visual effects (almost every character running or jumping during combat moves excessively quickly and jerkily as if replicated by cheap CGI, and Stallone's film seems sure to take the prize for 'least convincing explosions since the 1980s') too distracting to raucously enjoy. Whenever a fight sequence becomes the least bit engaging, threatening to impress with gruesome, bone crunching gleeful gratuity, it is punctually ruined by some heinous creative misfire (ie: Steve Austin attempting to deliver dialogue), which promptly derails the excitement and brings the audience back to thinking of more synonyms for 'terrible'. Of course the acting is predictably execrable, with Stallone's decision to largely focus on his own hard-bitten hero as the lead being one of his most woeful creative decisions, harnessing one of his most pathetically nonexistent performances in a career chock full of them, seemingly nearly unable to move his body or face into more than a sour grimace. Sympathizing with such a granite lump of a protagonist proves nigh impossible let alone desirable. Jason Statham is more enjoyable, injecting some cheeky charisma and dazzlingly fluid fighting movements into a film desperate for any high points. However, Jet Li , Randy Couture and Terry Crews feel utterly unnecessary inclusions, their characters reduced to disastrous one note jokes, and Dolph Lundgren is a particularly embarrassing grunting mess as a junkie merc losing his edge. Eric Roberts does his best to make his paper-thin antagonist somewhat entertaining, but Steve Austin proves more hilarious than intimidating as a gruesome enforcer, all the more when he opens his mouth. Giselle Itié and Charisma Carpenter have little to do but yell and be sultry as the film's ignored female presence, and even the much vaunted icon cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are too brief and gratuitous to derive any enjoyment from. As such it is up to Mickey Rourke to flagrantly walk away with the film as a cheerfully world-weary tattoo artist. Rising head and shoulders above the general quality on display with an infectious charm and delivering an unexpectedly harrowing monologue, Rourke's performance proves testament to the potential for talent to peek its head out even amidst torrents of inescapable dross. As incongruous as it might sound to quote Shakespeare in a context where most characters would rather do their speaking through blazing bullets, seldom before has the phrase 'full of sound and fury signifying nothing' been so applicable to a major motion picture. There lies a finite line between 'so bad it's good' guilty pleasure and 'too bad to extract any base line enjoyment from', yet The Expendables proves an expert only at epitomizing the latter, managing to deftly dance around any shred of fun, excitement, irony or bombastic enjoyment whatsoever. Paradoxically, rather than lovably reigniting the '80s (as the year's earlier hit The A-Team achieved), The Expendables articulates everything about why cinematic trends moved away from the boneheaded aesthetics of the decade's action films in the first place. -4/10",4,4,9,19 September 2010
Knocked Up," Unexpectedly tender yet still satisfyingly rambunctious comedy
","With a title such as that, an audience is immediately given a sense of what to expect from such a film - a bawdy, vulgar examination of realistic events for the sake of comedy. Which, one must concede, is essentially what Knocked Up is... but director Judd Apatow, best known for his work on The 40 Year Old Virgin and television show Freaks and Geeks, is too cunning to coast by on such a premise. Instead, like in Virgin, surprising focus is bestowed on the touching, sentimental aspects of the story without shirking on the side-splittingly vulgar one liners, crafting an intricate balance between the tender and the raucous - the result being surprisingly credible, however quirky or profane. Compared to most of Apatow's other efforts, Knocked Up boasts a far more mature tone and subject matter - while this summer's Superbad dealt with the transition from teenagehood, and 40 Year Old Virgin a juvenile man finally growing up, Knocked Up is concerned with the front of accidental adulthood and responsibility, and despite having a younger male lead, the film is all the more 'grown up' as a result. The concept of a couple getting to know each other after having already drunkenly conceived a child is an intriguing (and frighteningly possible) one, and Apatow's script may not shy away from any of the more physical aspects of the pregnancy process (guffawing teenage viewers better get ready for lots of morning sickness vomiting, a substantial amount of gynaecologist talk, and a no punches pulled birth scene) but the film is all the more human as a result. Of course, the majority of the success of a film centering in on an unexpected pregnancy would depend on the strength of its leads, and Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl prove more than up to the challenge, with tremendous chemistry, charm and wit. Rogen, a master at playing both gruffly charming and haplessly bewildered, easily merits his newfound leading man status - throughout the film, as Rogen's Ben Stone arcs from juvenile slacker to accidental future parent, he remains consistently endearing and sympathetic, as well as incredibly funny. Heigl also proves surprisingly charismatic and credible as the soon to be mother in question. Though her performance may come across as stunted at the film's beginning, we as the audience gradually realize that the character herself is fairly emotionally stunted, and not entirely clear who she is - right off the bat she is presented as an ambitious careerwoman still living in the guest room of her sister and brother-in-law's house. As the film (and the pregnancy) advances, Heigl is given more of a chance to flex her dramatic muscles, culminating in a highly satisfactory performance. But despite the charm of the central couple, Apatow once again puts substantial focus on the supporting cast, extracting many a laugh from what could have been senseless archetype figures. Scene stealing Paul Rudd, and Leslie Mann (Apatow's real life wife) bicker excruciatingly as newlywed parents, and are a constant source of either laughter or justifiable disgust. Rogen's stoner buddies, including Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel are consistently hilarious; a wonderful melange of sexual humour, pop culture banter and brilliant one liners perfectly benefiting such talented players. Character actor Alan Tudyk is also a scream as Heigl's fitness obsessed boss, and Apatow's tongue in cheek celebrity buddy cameos (including James Franco, Steve Carell and Jessica Alba) raise many a chuckle. While at two hours and ten minutes, the film does feel about 10-20 minutes too long, the plot begins to repeat itself before the end and certainly doesn't shirk from unabashedly clichÃ©ed moments and an unrealistically upbeat ending, it's near impossible to imagine or even want such a film to end on a different note. But such criticisms pale in the face of such an undeniably impressive work - for the first time, Apatow has made his brand of humour accessible to a far wider demographic, contrary to whatever reacting might be evoked by the film's title. Providing both the (no pun intended) belly laughs one would expect from such a film, and brilliant human introspection, all filtered through the rambunctious and filthy comedic lens of today, Knocked Up hits all the right notes -a surprisingly touching, undeniably realistic and thoroughly entertaining take on 'growing up' and accepting responsibility. -9/10",9,8,16,22 September 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Macabre and gruesomely entertaining revisionist musical
","'Bright, cheerful and fun' are three of the words one would most commonly hear when describing the latest movie musical. Not coincidentally, none of the aforementioned words in any way describe Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, eccentric director Tim Burton's adaptation of Steven Sondheim's macabre stage musical. In many ways, Burton's latest serves to either deconstruct or blatantly oppose the conventions of most glitzy cinematic musicals, resulting in a uniformly pitch black, macabre, gruesome and undeniably entertaining film, the likes of which have seldom been exposed to mass audiences.In many ways, Burton's Sweeney Todd functions as the 'anti-musical' - the notion of passing off Sondheim's gruesome but clever story of a nihilistic, vengeance seeking barber and his similarly deranged landlady under the guise of a mainstream musical is a subversive idea indeed, and Burton contrasts the typical musical flashy cinematography and stunning choreography with static camera movement and musical numbers sung with little to no movement - all the more unsettling but eerily captivating and fascinating. Burton is also given the opportunity to unleash his twisted visual genius upon the setting, and his atmospheric vision of turn of the century London is a gritty visual masterpiece, a world of deep greys, consistent shadows and even shadier denizens. With its slew of throat slitting, the film also stands out as one of the most visceral and outright bloody films in recent memory, proving equally effective as a Gothic horror thriller than as a movie musical. And while the film may occasionally feel unbalanced, rushed and underdeveloped in the same way which plagues many such grandiose stage adaptations, Sweeney Todd unfolds with an operatic flourish unseen in most of its contemporaries, and it is near impossible to avoid being swept up by the gruesomely enjoyable rush of it all. The film's eccentric and endlessly talented cast prove equally proficient singers as they are superbly capable of crafting a memorably deranged myriad of characters. Johnny Depp embraces the titular Sweeney Todd with a malicious relish just as laudable as his superb previously unheard singing voice. Depp's brooding presence drives the film, just as quirky, captivating and compelling a lead performance as ever. Helena Bonham Carter similarly brings her offbeat charm to perfect use as Mrs. Lovett, Todd's cheerfully sinister landlady. Alan Rickman is superbly classy as corrupt Judge Turpin, crafting yet another delightfully despicable antagonistic figure to add to his roster of them. His duet 'Pretty Women' with Depp is truly an unmissable spectacle. Timothy Spall is perfectly cast as the grimy Beadle Bamford, Turpin's swaggering second in command, and Sacha Baron Cohen is tremendously entertaining in a far too brief role as faux-Italian rival hairdresser 'Signor Pirelli'. Jamie Cambell Bower feels out of place in the gritty surroundings as a more typical mainstream romantic male lead lusting after Todd's daughter, but his presence adds to the 'anti-musical' aspect by being pushed to the side in favour of the darker, more compelling leads. Brash, bloody and gleefully disturbed, Burton's antidote to the mainstream musical proves brilliantly subversive of the conventions of its genre, while boasting a stunning spectacle of a variety unto its own. The chillingly brooding Depp and the rest of the cast are enough to bring Burton's dark vision to gritty life, and the excellent song numbers prove among the most memorable of a year fraught with many movie musical efforts. For all willing to stomach the admittably copious quantities of blood and thoroughly morbid content, Sweeney Todd may prove to be just the thing to counterbalance the syrupy glitz plaguing its musical contemporaries of late - unsettling, stylized and undeniably entertaining... in other words, exactly what one would hope for from a new Tim Burton film.-8/10",8,6,11,23 December 2007
Black Mass," 'Strictly criminal'
","The gangster film is a notoriously hard nut to crack these days, as there's the constant threat of being in somebody's shadow. In reconciling the juggling act of the inherent fun of criminal transgressions and the necessary solemn Hollywood moralizing hangover from the James Cagney days, do you opt for operatic and lyrical (Coppola), showy, stylized and irreverent (Scorsese), or flinty realism (Michael Mann or The Wire)? Even worse – are you audacious enough, in the face of the omnipresent elephant in the room (what is there left to say, apart from the time-worn moral of 'Crime pays until it doesn't'?), to try something new in the pressure to avoid standing on the shoulders of giants, all without cracking under the pressure? Fuggeddaboutit! Thankfully, director Scott Cooper isn't fussy about trying to turn the genre on its head, focusing less on innovation and more on doing it really well. As such, Black Mass, despite being a tale as old as time, is a steady, solid, immaculately stylistic, and impressively emotive gangster film. Changing the setting to Bahstan (what's The Depahted? This is a fah*kin' TRUE story!) lends fierce energy to the familiar ideologies of family and betrayal in the mob, while structuring the story around retroactive testimonies of Whitey Bulger's former associates lends the film a fresher framework (just don't say it rips off Citizen Kane, if you don't want to be buried under the dahcks). Cooper is an expert at pacing, injecting bursts of furious violence into innocuous scenes to give a sense of the palpable tension inherent in being in the presence of the temperamentally psychotic Bulger, with everything from offhand comments to bad table manners being grounds for a bullet through the head. Cleverly, however, to counterbalance Bulger's inherent trashiness, Masanobu Takayanagi's crisp cinematography and the engagingly somber musical score by Tom Holkenborg (building off his more bombastic work in this year's Mad Max: Fury Road) lend the film a distinctly classical feel not dissimilar with the title's theological allusions. While the screenplay occasionally dips too liberally into 'trailer sting expositionary one-liners' territory, for the most part, things crackle with enough impressive verisimilitude that, apart from a brief third-act lull, command attention throughout. Why Cooper decided to shroud Johnny Depp in such distractingly flamboyant makeup and electric blue contact lenses is beyond me (the real Whitey Bulger didn't look that corpse- like), but thankfully Depp is a skilled enough performer to own his sallow lizard look, rather than being out-acted by his makeup. Conversely, this is the liveliest and most riveting we've seen Depp in years of drowning in Disney sequels and spinoffs – charming (the film's most poignant scene is an unassuming Bulger allowing his mother to win against him at gin, or pressing pause on a heist to help an elderly lady carry her groceries up the stairs), haunted, and savage, sometimes all simultaneously, Depp's Whitey Bulger is an incendiary performance, and it would be a genuine shock to see him go unrecognized at this year's Academy Awards. Keen to not be overshadowed, the stellar ensemble cast all sell their character vignettes with aplomb. Joel Edgerton offers a deliciously jeer-worthy cocktail of simpering and swagger as the FBI agent who enlists Bulger as an informant out of a misplaced sense of childhood reverence, only to be exploited as Bulger bloats his criminal empire under the FBI's nose (the always excellent Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott add gravitas to the grimacing in these FBI interludes). Slightly hammy Bahstan accent aside, Benedict Cumberbatch is thoroughly charismatic with only a whiff of sleaze as Bulger's senatorial brother, while Dakota Johnson is 50 Shades of assertive here, fuming with increasingly fearful contempt, as Edgerton's wife. Rory Cochrane and Jesse Plemons carry an air of sadness as Bulger's second-in-command confidants, ashamed of what they've been sucked into yet aware that failure to commit would mean death, while even Juno Temple is a heartbreaking (single) scene stealer as Cochrane's underage prostitute girlfriend. Finally, in the overacting department, Peter Sarsgaard quivers with barely grounded manic paranoia as a dimwitted Californian witness testifying against Bulger, while Corey Stoll, still exuding Ant-Man levels of nuance (sarcasm), does more yelling than acting as the DA determined to bring down Bulger. Don't start throwing out comparisons to more revered gangster pics, or Black Mass will only, inevitably, suffer by comparison. Sometimes, it's enough to take a familiar recipe and marinate it in basic ingredients with consummate skill. Just don't disclose the recipe to Whitey Bulger, or that could get you buried real quick. Just sayin'. -7.5/10",7,1,2,4 October 2015
Nacho Libre," Jack Black as a Mexican priest/wrestler - what more need be said?
","It would seem these days that Jack Black can do no wrong. His winning combo started with his star making turn in 2003's The School of Rock, and his popularity was barely swayed with relative misfires in Envy and Shark Tale. 2005 saw Black starring in Peter Jackson's adventure epic remake of King Kong, and proving him able to harness his trademark manic energy and channel it into a more dramatic performance than his usual goofball comedy roles. But here, Black returns to what he does best - ridiculous, forgettable and extremely funny comedy. Ignacio (Black), a cook and friar at a local orphanage has never felt like he fully fit in. In an attempt to find some sense of self, as well as to win money to provide better food for the children... and perhaps also finally win some personal glory and potentially impress fellow orphanage worker, the beautiful Sister Encarnación, Ignacio creates a larger than life wrestling persona, the dynamic Nacho, and enters the ring as a Luchador. It's safe to say that the movie revolves around Black and his genius comedic talents, but it is also quite the quality mix of modern comedic talents - Jared Hess, director of last year's cult hit Napoleon Dynamite, brings a similar sense of quirky, offbeat and understated humour to play here, as does scriptwriter Mike White, who also penned School of Rock and Orange County, both starring Jack Black. The odd mix between the three different styles of humour seems to work surprisingly well, and Nacho comes to play as an oddball, quirky yet very funny comedy. It's just a bit disappointing Hess and White found it necessary to include some very childish fart jokes, which seem very out of place. Nacho also comes across as surprisingly unmemorable, with few lines as endlessly quotable as Napoleon Dynamite, but what Napoleon lacked was the power of Jack Black, who seems able to evoke roars of laughter from his audience just from a facial expression or jerk of his head. Black also receives able support from the quirky and very funny 'sidekick' role of his fellow wrestler, 'Elsqueleto', an odd looking fellow with a grotesque smile and memorable scream, and Nacho's 'love' interest, Sister Encarnación, who has a very limited role in the story but makes good use of her screen time and shallow character. Also look for a cameo from Swedish character actor Peter Stormare as a sage gypsy who helps Nacho on his quest to become the world's greatest fighter. All in all, Nacho Libre seems the perfect prescription for a night of summer movie entertainment. It may not be terribly memorable and don't search for any profound deeper meanings, but Nacho is a return to form for Jack Black in the field of offbeat comedy, which makes it a must see for fans of his in itself. Be warned: expect to use the term 'stretchy pants' for quite some time afterwards.-7/10",7,3,5,17 June 2006
Suicide Squad," Caught in a landslide; no escape from banality
","First: 2015's abominable Fantastic Four. Then, 2016's laughable Batman v. Superman. Now, we have Suicide Squad: the latest in a slew of big-budget train wrecks, resulting in an acrid cocktail of the wrong directors being given too much agency coupled with boneheaded, contradictory studio hand-holding. Still, it's hard to strictly call studio interference party foul here, as the film is so inherently muddy it's hard to imagine any iteration successfully coughing itself to life. It's hard to resist a spectral Queen chorus of 'Is this the real life?' running through your head watching the shambolic mess unspool – Suicide Squad wants desperately to strut, but stumbles on every step, before toppling into the void of being utterly forgettable.We can excuse the embarrassingly gratuitous Justice League tie-ins (hey – at least Ben Affleck's Batman acts somewhat more like Batman, saving villains from certain death rather than branding them in the face). We can **sort of** excuse the flagrant piggybacking plagiarism of Guardians of the Galaxy, from the hyperactive prison montage antihero character bios to the soundtrack, nonsensically cobbled together like a caffeine-high teen with a gift card to the iTunes store (and no, you're not mistaken - that Norman Greenbaum song is yanked straight out of the Guardians trailer. The theft is that blatant). We can even try to excuse director David Ayer's uncomfortable balance between dopey, wannabe slick humour and self-important wannabe 'darkness', even if it mostly manifests in the film's indiscernible, murky lighting (grossly counterbalanced by splotches of colour, like a toddler vomiting play-doh). Still - a film full of villains-turned-antiheroes must bring SOMETHING original to the table. Right?And this is what we can't excuse: Suicide Squad is not only a bird's nest of content and tone, but also a fundamentally trashy, soulless, redundantly small-minded film. It loudly parades some of the worst nonlinear editing and pacing seen in a recent Hollywood film, to the point where its gossamer-thin plot (literally a lazy, boiled down version of The Raid - the entire conflict can be reduced to 'climb the building') becomes almost incomprehensible at times when really nothing is happening. There's so much daft flashiness (yes, including Ezra Miller), sense is thrown to the wind. But, lest we get confused, Ayer is sure to slop in massive exposition dumps every 10-15 minutes, which rudely bring the film to a screeching halt every time it starts to pick up steam. The tiny blips of action are so bland, they fade from consciousness and memory before they've even finished feebly sputtering on. Finally, the glut of action figures-sorry-characters is so unreasonably vast, several Squad members are given no introduction, and literally dispatched within minutes with no send-off. Several are so extraneous they could be trimmed without anyone even noticing (Katana, anyone?). Initially, there's hope for the effectively creepy uber-villains, but, after memorable introductions, they spend the majority of the film sulking in puffs of CGI, waiting for Ayer to remember they exist. Even worse: even some of the most iconic secondary players - Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's iconic Killer Croc, for one - are so underused, they're effectively there to snarl on command, and burp out unfunny 'B.E.T.' punchlines. Ouch. It's even more of a shame, as Ayer does scatter nuggets of genuinely compelling material to grapple with. Peel aware its slathering of smarm and gloom, and Suicide Squad is a film about characters struggling with bad relationships. Smith's Deadshot regrets his daughter being overly permissive of his career as an assassin. Jay Hernandez's Diablo spends the rest of his life owning up to his superpowered tantrum gruesomely murdering his girlfriend and children (the sole flashback which actually works, infusing the film with tragedy, scope, and as sombre a cinematic allegory for domestic abuse as we've seen lately, and Hernandez is unexpectedly moving). And let's not even start on whatever warped, emotionally abusive relationship the Joker and Harley Quinn share. These interludes may not propel the story, but when Ayer allows himself to linger in the darkness, he digs up the film's only real illumination. The film may have been transparently retrofitted to accommodate Will Smith, but he's worth it. Arguably the film's greatest asset, Smith warps his boundless, sassy charisma and badassery into the film's uneasy moral compass, supplying (the film's only) surprisingly compelling emotional arc. Margot Robbie, conversely, hits her marks, and is admittably hampered by an infuriatingly anti-feminist subplot, but there's still an unshakable sense of her performing Harley Quinn rather than getting under her skin. She's oodles of fun, but her crazy is as wobbly and vaguely forced as her accent. Thankfully, Viola Davis is steely perfection as the Machiavellian Amanda Waller, and Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang is funnier and more unpredictable than he has any right to be as such a boorish bogan stereotype. Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flagg is one of the most infuriating military grunts in recent cinematic memory (and this is a generation that survived Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Godzilla). And then there's Jared Leto. Hoo boy. If 'forced' was already a shroud ensconcing the film, his blingy Joker is its bleating fog machine of artifice. He's loud and irritating, but embarrassingly far-removed from appropriate levels of sinister or unhinged, no matter how many rings of knives he lies in or pools of toxic waste he dives into. There's a bit near the end of Suicide Squad where Kinnaman's Flagg, suffering a change of heart, offers the Squad the chance to escape, and live their lives. Cliché dictates they will instead seek redemption, and stay to fight (yawn). Instead, Courtney's Boomerang prances up, and, without a word, jackrabbits out of the room. It's the film's biggest laugh, partially for its unexpectedness, but partially for being the single most sensible move in the entire production. Suicide Squad is a sinking ship, and the fact that all involved didn't follow Boomerang's example (and even he idiotically crawls back – boo), makes the title exquisitely apt. -4/10",4,1,2,22 August 2016
Elf," Reflexive Christmas cheer without the jeer
","At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks (check out the distinctly Rudolf-esq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes, some of the film's most delightful additions), but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare, Elf delivers a story of a fish-out-of-water outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in, but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity, and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture, rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it, there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film, but, bouncing along like a pointy hat-sporting George Bailey, Buddy the Elf(/human? Elf-man? Humelf...?) remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him, as the film's other characters echo.Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty (the 'you're not Santa!' toy store brawl is already iconic, but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun), Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story, weaving in touching beats throughout, as Buddy connects with his estranged 'naughty listed' father and thug life brother, and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker (one of the film's few objectionable bits - while cute, it's a bit underdeveloped, not to mention eyebrow raise-worthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who, for all intents and purposes, has the mental facilities of a 12-year old...). Pacing-wise, the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate, and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically, with popping, vibrant candy colours and soft-focus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax, finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park, beset by Nazgûl-like park rangers, would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink, and, strained as it might feel, he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks - who could begrudge to a finale that dives whole-hog into sentiment - a Christmas spirit-inducing sing-a-long, no less! - so confidently and unironically, that, unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings,' it actually works really well. Hell - if James Caan's humbug can sing along, you sure can too. It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau, Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The ever-adorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife, while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos - hey there, Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter! - while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eye-rolling, Elf is a true delight, and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics, it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup, though. That's a step too far. -8.5/10",8,12,13,14 December 2015
Taxi Driver," God's lonely man
","Since its release in 1976, Taxi Driver has started to become somewhat misrepresented over the years. Being considered an indisputable classic, Taxi Driver has spawned considerable talk and speculation among audiences, mainly in regards to its violence, fabricating the film a reputation similar to that of an intense action thriller. But any viewer who sees Taxi Driver and dismisses it as a thriller has completely missed the point of the film. Taxi Driver is by no means an action movie fraught with gratuitous violence, nor is the violence the centerpoint of the story. It is the study of a very lonely man, isolated in a world of filth and corruption, and his struggle to overcome it. It's very difficult to capture the appeal of Taxi Driver in mere words, as the film transcends them. The script, masterful as it is, is used incredibly sparingly, as director Martin Scorsese chooses instead to paint his masterpiece more in pictures than in words. As it is, the film produces an utterly unique atmosphere, so thick and powerful it seems to soak into the skin, drawing the viewer in, and holding them, intoxicated, from the film's iconic opening shot of a taxi driving through a cloud of steam to the film's craftily ambivalent ending (is Travis merely hallucinating, or is the film making a point about unlikely heroism?) to the end of the beautifully shot closing credits. As such, there have been complaints that the film is slow moving and dull for the most part - again, such comments merely bring to light that the viewer has missed the point. This is not a film about non-stop, heart pounding action. It is an atmosphere piece and a character study, using the careful, steady pacing to slowly draw the viewer further and further into Travis Bickle's world of loneliness and contempt, the monotony of his life developing a steadily sinister edge. Again, words fail to fully describe the sheer force and slow hitting impact the film generates, short of telling the reader to see it for themselves, to experience Scorsese's harsh but calm, unflinching view of city life in all of its grimy decadence.Scorsese's simply masterful camera work is what really sells the effect, and Taxi Driver is arguably one of the finest shot films in cinema history. The camera seems to drink in the heart and jet black soul of New York city, from Travis' moody late night processions of the city, eerily beautiful in their quiet despair to the slow, famished sweep as he views his gun for the first time, perfectly backed by Bernard Hermann's exquisite minimalist score. It also goes without saying that screenwriter Paul Schrader's script is one of the most bleakly powerful pieces of writing ever transferred to celluloid, almost seeming to speak more in its silence than in it's brief but poignant bits of dialogue. From start to finish, the film is deliberately paced in a truly stunning fashion, allowing the mass of emotions to slowly wash over the viewer - it is rare to see a film so subtle yet painstakingly crafted. It goes without saying that as breathtaking and essential the film's atmosphere is, it would be nothing without the iconic performance of Robert De Niro sinking it home. If De Niro was to be singled out for a single role in a career filled from top to bottom with flooringly powerful work, his sensitive yet brooding Travis Bickle would without a doubt always come out on top. Once again, De Niro seems to have more of an impact with what isn't said than with his straightforward and bleak nighttime voiceovers and journal entries; while his speeches about cleaning up the scum of the city put the viewer's hair on end, it's his eyes that really sell the role, displaying a haunting inner passion despite the blank apathy of his exterior; the most memorable shot in the film is Bickle, having just completely his cleansing bloodbath at the film's finale, raising a single blood- dripping finger to his mohawked head, and miming shooting himself - the sheer power of this brief moment is beyond description. De Niro's stunning performance is backed up by several brief but incredibly memorable characters portrayed by the supporting cast, including Cybil Shepherd as Betsy, a seeming shining beacon of hope in Travis' dark and despairing world, Harvey Keitel's entertaining yet gut-churningly devious pimp, Jodie Foster giving an astonishingly capable and powerful performance as the child prostitute Travis strives to rescue, Albert Brooks in a subtly comic role as Shepherd's co-worker, and Peter Boyle as a down to earth, savvy fellow taxi driver of Travis. Director Scorsese also has a cameo as a homicidal passenger in Bickle's cab, proving to be one of the more memorable parts of the film, Scorsese's charismatic brief performance driving home a message of violence in the common man in a rather poignant and disturbing fashion.Taxi Driver is one of the few films which defies comparison - exquisitely crafted by the genius of Martin Scorsese, it is a superbly moody atmospheric reflection on the mindset of one man, tortured by the crime and corruption around him. What makes the film perhaps the most interesting however, is however much Bickle may be billed as a violent psychopath, it's doubtful that a single viewer failed to identify with his views and personality at least once throughout the film. Travis' incredibly perceptive and sensitive persona seems to speak volumes on the inherent loneliness in us all, and the desperate, violent need to be accepted in a society thriving on distance, corruption and alienation. Do not be fooled into thinking the film is simply the tale of a psychopath, fraught with gratuitous violence - Taxi Driver is far too soulful and intelligent for such a predicament, and as such is worth seeing by any and every audience willing to stomach a harshly retentive tale of despair and redemption. -10/10",10,0,1,4 March 2007
Shutter Island," Captivatingly tense and flooringly atmospheric in spite of eventual narrative concerns
","It is always fascinating to see directors whose success is generally associated with a specific genre work outside of their usual subject matter, and celebrated filmmaker Martin Scorsese's work on Shutter Island is no exception. Despite the seemingly familiar use of police figures as protagonists, Scorsese instead contents himself from drawing instead from the realm of psychological horror thrillers rather than his usual milieu of police or gangster genres, without sacrificing his usual uncanny grasp on complex, nuanced characterisation or sophistication of narrative. As such, rather than a 'gimmicky' conscious departure from his realm of expertise, Scorsese's film instead feels like a fitting entry into his celebrated pantheon of work, only serving to further demonstrate his versatility as a director.In fact, for a director generally uninitiated into the field of anything resembling horror, psychological or otherwise (unless one considers the urban mental horror of his works such as Taxi Driver), Scorsese demonstrates an exemplary flair for working within the tropes of the genre. Taking clear influence from classic, 1950s B-horrors (in particular, the recognizably jerky editing and stilted expositional dialogue of the film's ship-set opening sequence feels directly lynched from Invasion of the Body Snatchers or another film of its ilk), the film makes its mark as a laudably daring experiment in temporal genre bending, all the moreso through its devious subtlety, rather than overtly hamming it up or overdoing nods to its influences. As the film progresses and the tension rises, it is almost a shame to see Scorsese abandon his previous hat tipping and segway into more conventional standards of quality and narrative development.That being said, as the overlap between reality and fiction becomes increasingly ambiguous and the psychological state of his protagonists becomes more and more frayed, Scorsese demonstrates a dazzling grasp on generating a captivating and horrifying atmosphere (most tonally akin to Lars von Trier's recent Antichrist of all things, albeit with less animal disfigurement) with its noxiously gritty 'real life' narrative and breathtaking, exquisitely stylized and horrific flashback or dream sequences equally adept at evoking piercing tension and overwhelming terror in the viewer. Thema Schumacher's masterfully neurotic editing and the boldly (yet fittingly) overbearing musical score all combine to create a stunningly Gothic ambiance, excelling in its rank filth and horror.As such, it is a desperate shame when the film finally lurches along to its culmination, as, despite generating an atmosphere so overwhelmingly powerful and a narrative fiendishly complex enough to genuinely leave the viewer guessing, it can't help but all feel somewhat wasted upon the revelation of an ending twist which comes across as somewhat insultingly over-obvious and unsatisfying - a twist so obvious throughout that the viewer finds themselves continually inclined not to believe that a film so sophisticated and stunningly stylized would succumb to it, thus being almost (but not quite) taken by surprise, but in entirely the wrong way. To his credit, Scorsese remains a directorial stalwart to the end and does his utmost to sell his ending, and as such its inclusion is not quite enough to derail the entire film, but it cannot help but feel like a glaring mistake in a film previously so impeccably poised to avoid every semblance of the word.Nonetheless, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another flooringly powerful and nuanced performance as haunted and psychologically threatened federal Marshal Teddy Daniels. Working with the film's pivotal role, DiCaprio's firebrand, nervy energy is a perfect compliment to Scorsese's heavy handed style, and his work in Shutter Island stands as further testament to his being one of the most trustworthy and downright powerful performers in the modern industry. Mark Ruffalo keeps himself on an impressive, appropriate slow-boil of clenched energy as Daniel's partner, and his uniquely understated charisma not only proves a perfect compliment to DiCaprio's frenzied performance, but also admirably sells an otherwise uninteresting 'straight man' role. Ben Kingsley hits the 'mysterious and aloof scientist with secrets' button hard, but manages to make it work, with his perpetually gleaming eyes retaining the viewer's interest and curiosity throughout. Max Von Sydow, while seemingly having little purpose in the film apart from adding to the general sense of unease (and unearthing an interesting piece of characterisation for DiCaprio) nonetheless contributes a suitably peculiar and foreboding performance. Michelle Williams excels in brief flashback appearances with fierce passion and desperation as Daniels' dead wife, and Emily Mortimer is captivatingly frightening yet sympathetic as missing psychopath Rachel Solonzo. Finally, Jackie Earl Haley is spellbinding in a single crucial scene as a schizophrenic murderer, managing to work enough frantic edginess, and strange, perverse sympathy into his performance to make his fleeting presence one of the film's highlights.As such, Scorsese's Shutter Island remains an overall masterfully assembled piece of film-making, if perhaps one destined to leave viewers somewhat unsatisfied and let down after such a stunning build up. Nonetheless, if the bulk of the film could be examined in isolation, the film would cement itself as one of Scorsese's most impactful and sublime films in a collection of many. As it stands, the film proves several cuts above most contemporary masquerades at psychological horror, but falls short of the eerie masterpiece it might otherwise have been.-8/10",8,2,6,23 February 2010
Capote," An astonishing lead performance, yes... but Capote boasts so much more...
","Speaking as a viewer who was unfamiliar with Truman Capote's work, or the man himself, I have to say that I was still floored by Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of the caustic-tongued, immensely talented though also seriously troubled author. The always talented Hoffman brings a particular energy and commitment into his portrayal of Truman Capote that shows why he easily stood above the crowd when picking up awards, most recently the best actor Oscar.Yet don't go into Capote thinking that Hoffman's performance is the only reason to see it - while it's true that he is easily the best thing in the film, director Bennett Miller seems to most certainly know what he's doing, despite his lack of previous credentials. There is a surprising atmosphere created in Capote, an almost tangible sense of underlying threat and danger, despite the mostly passive exterior. The stark, nearly black and white photography also helps add to the mood, as well as better establishing the time period. Between costumes, sets and surroundings, the film lives and breathes the 1950s and 60s in a most impressive manner - never once does it seem replicated or staged, the movie seems to be ripped right out of the time. Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman also show the sense to focus on a certain period of Capote's life, his time writing a nonfictional novel depicting the murder of a Kansas family, titled 'In Cold Blood'. While researching the killing and interviewing the killers, Capote begins to develop a peculiar relationship with Perry Smith, (Clifton Collins Jr.) one of the killers. Futterman proves himself to also be an excellent writer, as Capote boasts a particularly solid script as well as a superb lead performance and capable directing. Hoffman's incredible lead performance is also backed by very strong performances from the film's stellar supporting cast, the standout being Clifton Collins Jr. as the killer Capote develops a strange interest in. Collins is similarly astonishing, almost paralleling Hoffman in strength and believability of performance, and it is quite a shock and shame he was not nominated for an Academy award himself. Catherine Keener also gives a great performance as Nelle Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend and fellow author, who shares in his exploits while researching and writing his novel. Chris Cooper also makes the most of his relatively small role as the town sheriff who arrested the two killers, who genuinely believes in the morality of his job. I had never been a fan of Cooper's in the past, but having seen a few of his movies lately, it becomes clear to me that his talent is indisputable, and I now quite enjoy his performances. (ironically enough, I used to say the same thing about Philip Seymour Hoffman once upon a time...) Bruce Greenwood is also a strong though quiet presence as Jack Dunphy, Capote's partner, companion and fellow novelist, who often feels ignored and overshadowed by Capote's devotion to both his work and Perry Smith. In fact, performances are quite impressive right across the page, Hoffman of course being the highlight, though very capably backed. So all in all, Capote is quite the quality piece, and is worth seeing, although the main draw being to see Philip Seymour Hoffman's Academy Award winning performance, which, rest assured, lives up to the hype. Yet don't go off thinking Hoffman's lead performance is the only reason to see this movie - rather to see an excellent example of a strong film from all angles - excellent screen writing, strong, capable directing, wonderful cinematography and powerhouse acting from the entire cast throughout. All in all, it's hard to find a weak link in Capote really - quite worth the watch!-9/10",9,1,1,15 March 2006
Doctor Strange," Exit through the gift shop
","Doctor Strange's tagline is as much plea as catchphrase: 'Forget what you think you know.' It's appropriate, given Marvel's fourteenth film subjects a smarmy, goateed playboy not at all unlike Tony Stark to a Batman Begins style Tibetan training montage, wherein he conjures landscape-folding magic(??) suspiciously reminiscent of Inception. Hmm. Still, by now it should come as no surprise that the studio who has made mega-blockbusters out of Norse gods, propaganda figureheads, and an anthropomorphic alien tree and sass-talking raccoon are used to being one step ahead of audience skepticism. And by the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth, they've done it again: Doctor Strange is exactly the wacky, winking dose of pixie dust needed to breathe vibrancy and psychedelia into keeping the Marvel formula if not quite Strange, at least not yet stale. Which, for round fourteen, should be considered nothing shy of magic. Granted, Strange's story is anything but. There's no doubt that its central trope of arrogant, unlikely hero called upon to save the world treads perilously over-familiar ground, and the maddening speed and convenience by which Strange is accepted into his mysterious Sanctum and masters the mystic arts doesn't help. Still, director Scott Derrickson handles proceedings with consummate zest and bounce, navigating the potential disjuncture between cliché narrative and ludicrous occult conceit with such nimble humour (for every 'Eye of Agomotto' and 'Wand of Wattomb' there's a surprisingly witty Beyoncé gag. Yes, that's not a sentence you hear every day), including some pristine, tongue-in-cheek jabs at shallow Western appropriation of Eastern theology, that it all, astonishingly, feels breezy and effortless. It's a deliberately simple cinematic apéritif bridging the Big Important Movie Events of Civil War and the upcoming Infinity War (including the most slyly unceremonious Infinity Stone drop yet). And it's all the more enjoyable in its inauspiciousness. This is not to say that Derrickson's conjurations are purely frivolity. He may rush Strange's inevitable rise to mysticism and heroism, but dwells extensively on the car accident (don't text and drive, kids!) that costs him his hands and superstar surgery career, and his agonizingly fruitless recovery process, crafting a disability allegory as poignant and heartfelt as Iron Man's. Even more notably, Derrickson doesn't squander his unprecedented opportunity to deliver the first genuinely weird multi-million dollar superhero blockbuster, and practically salivates through the requisite exposition sequences waiting to flood the screen with Steve Ditko surrealism. Without mincing words, Doctor Strange is a visual masterpiece, and the first superhero blockbuster to really showcase every scrap of its budget on screen. Strange's first plunge into the infinitely refracting multiverse is a no-holds-barred plunge into surrealism porn, like perusing a bismuth crystal from the inside of an astrophysical kaleidoscope on a roller coaster. It's a shock of genuinely mind-bending big budget wizardry - think Salvador Dalí directing an Audi commercial - and it's spectacular. Although the film never really matches this first trip (probably wise, lest audiences start sinking through their seats into a pinwheel of endlessly undulating Thanos pupils), Derrickson weaves each action set-piece with similar insanity, making for some of the most visually inventive cinematic combat in recent memory. Landscapes bend, contort, and fold inwards like interlocking M.C. Escher gears, as Strange and his arcane compatriots unleash the powers of gravity, space, and time against each other amidst magic beat downs like laser-light tai chi, or projecting their 'Astral selves' into intangible brawls, while Strange's sentient 'cloak of levitation' borrows copious surreal slapstick from Aladdin's magic carpet, and is just as riotous. Michael Giacchino's musical score accentuates this familiar oddness, folding familiar hero leitmotifs into a sumptuous sonic burrito of harpsichord, sitar, and electric guitar plucking, like a Pink Floyd b-side (and don't worry - they show up too). And just when it looks like it might all be lost amidst another generic Marvel 'CGI blob blowout' climax, Derrickson deftly sidesteps the cliché, replacing the Doctor's boss battle with arch foe Dormammu (here a gigantic, spectral Thanos clone instead of his traditional flame-head self, disappointingly) with a weaponized Groundhog Day. And there you have it. Inception-Schminception. No one sensible would've doubted the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the Sorcerer Supreme - who else could be magnetically weird enough to twist such otherworldly, spiritual gravitas and mouthfuls of nonsense words into something feasibly accessible? He's inevitably stupendous, but still a genuine revelation in how funny he is, his sardonic charisma spilling over the expanses of the screen. Yet, he's also acutely human - arrogant, sorrowful, regretful, Cumberbatch paints Strange's emotional arc so strikingly that it's surprisingly easy to buy his slide into devoting his life to protecting a mystical dimension his medical mind can scarcely accept the existence of. Tilda Swinton's Ancient One is appropriately bonkers, exhibiting perfectly cavalier comedic timing, and somehow more imposing and disquieting by adopting a perennial glazed, chipper smile, which pierces right to the soul. The rest of the supporting cast are given somewhat short shrift in terms of moments to shine - Chiwetel Ejiofor's (not yet Baron) Mordo is promisingly brooding with just a dash of unhinged, but bereft of sufficient characterization to hype his pending villainy, while Rachel McAdams outperforms her token love interest plot device, exhibiting unexpectedly credible emotions without overstaying her welcome. Mads Mikkelsen suffers the most, stranded with one of the blander MCU fanatic-du-jour. Still, the delightfully deadpan Benedict Wong steals scenes and laughs aplenty as bone-dry librarian-turned-confidant Wong. Neatly inverting reservations with a sparkling wit, dazzling action, and hallucinatory gorgeousness, Doctor Strange may not reinvent the Marvel wheel, but it certainly transfigures it into a neo-cubist, inverted flying carpet for a spell (ha). Anchored by Cumberbatch's spectacular charisma, and some pleasant tweaks to the formula, Marvel's fourteenth may not be particularly unexpected, but it's undeniably one of their most spirited, and, certainly, Strange. Now exit through the gift shop of contorted, Escher/Dalí action figures. And softly rap a bar of Eminem. For Wong. -8.5/10",8,2,4,7 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The Twit and the Pendulum
","Between Bruges and Missouri, if being a writer/director weren't enough, Martin McDonagh could seemingly easily find an alternate calling as an unorthodox travel agent. Of course, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is as much a straight- faced travelogue of the Midwestern United States as McDonagh's In Bruges is a gentle comedy of tourism - namely, not at all. McDonagh's films defy easy categorization with as much flamboyance and vitriolic wit as they subvert narrative expectation, with twists and inversions as wacky as they are devastatingly human. And Three Billboards may be his sharpest, most tenderly sadistic cross-section of human behaviour yet, exemplifying his customary deftness for unpacking the weird, terrible, and unexpectedly graceful decisions people make under intolerably extreme circumstances. Even more impressively: he fans the flames with a seasoning of searing sociopolitical urgency amidst the salty banter and unexpected bursts of extreme violence, before pulling the rug out from under us once again for something altogether more moving and raw. Taking its place with The Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Square as 2017's (unintentional but perfectly pairing) tryptic of sordidly funny meditations on karma and retribution,* Three Billboards adopts an a grandiose, almost Biblical sensibility in its darkly comedic morality play. Characters gradually, painstakingly, learn to try turning the other cheek when running perilously low on vision due to all the 'eye for an eye's, as McDonagh's razor-sharp screenplay adopts a pendulum structure of 'action/reaction/escalation' that becomes increasingly poignant as things careen increasingly out of control. Initially, this ping-ponging of aggression lends the film an affably clumsy, episodic feel, but it's only retroactively clear how carefully-knit McDonagh's writing is, neatly baiting and subverting expectations with coy foreshadowing and red herrings aplenty, with the jaw-dropping spurts of extreme, unexpected violence upstaged only by the seismic power of quiet but instrumental character revelations that McDonagh airdrops in with equally gleeful whimsy. McDonagh is unmistakably a playwright, and his founding sensibilities root the film in an impressively tense, pressure-cooker claustrophobia. Granted, the snappiness of his viciously eloquent, don't-call-it-Tarantinoesque, dialogue is undercut ever so slightly by the proliferation of transitional establishing shots, buoyed by Carter Burwell's sumptuously sonorous musical score, that privilege elegiac pause over the film's otherwise breakneck, almost screwball comedy pacing. Still, these micro-pauses of deliberation are crucial for not having the audience fanned into a similar fury of indignation as the characters, allowing us a more dispassionate, if not unemotional, take on an increasingly incendiary allegory. Because here's the rub: amidst all of the bluster, banter, and hyperbolic escalation, Three Billboards is, at its core, a cutting rumination on the current combustible climate of police brutality being taken to task. McDonagh weighs in, appropriately scathingly, on the infuriating, seething impotence in the face of systemic corruption and toxic, discriminatory violence running so deep. At the same time, he vehemently insists on painting every wrinkle of every side with human error shades of grey, and resists the temptation to fully dive down the rabbit hole of larger-than-life fantasy escape into righteously indignant cathartic retribution, a-la Inglourious Basterds, with Frances McDormand's furiously grieving mother its surrogate Aldo Raine. Justice, McDonagh insists, is more than balance, and flecks of unexpected condemnation and redemption colour all sides and individuals, no matter what preconceived roles they slot into. In short, McDonagh's characters are all far too human not to err, but far too human not to understand and forgive in the midst of their doing so. And that, if anything, lends for a well-balanced, contemporary pseudo-Biblical morality parable, even if McDonagh customarily finds his scripture in swearing here.Frances McDormand is truly extraordinary, imbuing everything from a monologue to a fleeting glance with captivating magnetism and furious emotional weight. Inhabiting a woman carved down by fury and grief into an almost primal human flame of rage, McDormand's flinty composure only occasionally flickers to betray the cavernous guilt and sadness beneath. In spite of this, she's also savagely funny, and her diatribes shutting down a kindly priest and vacuous reporter as accountable for feeding into a broken system couldn't be more a more riotously cathartic mouthpiece for a year full of such infuriating real-life sociopolitical strife. Sam Rockwell similarly delivers some of the most dazzlingly funny and compellingly nuanced of his career, in a performance fuelled by as much misguided rage as by puppy-dog pathos. As Dixon, a small-town Midwestern cop reviled as racist and abusive, Rockwell takes a character we're hardwired to hate and dismiss, and works tirelessly to make us understand and confront the man within the stereotype, while being careful not problematically stray into the territory of misguided folk hero - he's far too brutally honest and sweepingly human for that. Woody Harrelson is equally exceptional, drawing up undercurrents of unexpected elegance and wry humour into a role that equally defies expectation, intriguingly sashaying from antagonist to protagonist scene-by-scene. Lucas Hedges, Abbie Cornish, John Hawks, and Caleb Landry Jones all find their beats of sardonic hilarity and gut-punching humanism with remarkable ease, while Samara Weaving is almost unspeakably funny in her few, fleeting moments, and Peter Dinklage is almost overpoweringly lovable as seemingly the film's only wholly redeemable character. Just like its titular signage, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri functions as a cultural object dropped in amongst an unsuspecting public, to fan flames, incite conversation and controversy, confront prejudices, and, hopefully, lead to life-changing revelations in perspective. It's an astonishingly intricate and fundamentally human think-piece, and the occasional wobbles in pacing and politics do little to mar its standing as one of the year's most unforgettable films. Still, I'll take Bruges over Missouri - in more ways than one. -9/10 *There's an amusing poignancy in three of the year's most inevitable Oscar contenders involving extreme karmic consequences for loss. Academy members better bar their second floor windows before considering voting unfavourably for McDonagh's film",9,4,12,27 November 2017
Pacific Rim," Small pleasures in big things
","Pacific Rim is an extremely small movie about extremely big things hitting each other extremely loudly. Yes, small. Small in terms of scope, ideas, characterization, script rewrites, concise editing, cliché- avoidance you name it. Those moved to tears by maverick director Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth – the polar opposite on all aforementioned fronts – may find this perplexing at best, and infuriating at worst. How could a writer-director capable of such depth make a film so (contrary to its title, to use up the supply of droll turns-of-phrase) shallow? The trick is to treat Pacific Rim as the world's most expensive B-movie, and all its shortcomings as intentional camp. This almost works. Indeed, there comes a gleeful sense of triumph at one of the most acclaimed working directors finally gifted with the kind of budget that has always eluded him and using it to expensively homage the tacky, under-budgeted monster movies that wowed him as a youth. However, as is common with big-budget pastiche, the tension between low-budget sensibility and big-budget expectations is never fully resolved, and the film losing its nerve in owning up to and overplaying its purposeful stupidity makes for an often-unsettling watch. Sequences of lengthy, drawn-out, predictable clichés treated as gasp-worthy plot twists occupy the dreaded purgatory between 'good' and 'so-bad-its-good', satisfying neither.The film opens with a smirking, concise and electric guitar-fuelled montage, which establishes not only the mythology and cursory science behind 'alien attackers vs. giant robot suit defenders', but the consequences behind it – the sociocultural ramifications behind Earth being invaded, logistics of humans relocating, jaeger pilots becoming 'rock stars', even toys and other merchandise created in tandem with the conflict. Here, with a World War Z (the book, not the film) approach to the monster genre, spectacle and smarts are effortlessly blended – Godzilla circa Jurassic Park – and hopes are immediately set high, with no reason to expect the film to falter from this point on. But, inevitably, it does, and such momentary intelligence is quickly jettisoned for a succession of Hollywood clichés hammered loudly by stale acting. Again, it is hard not to see this approach as intentional, and the film is loud and often unexpectedly funny enough to make the ride worthwhile. It is simply no longer as fun. But, as with many del Toro projects, the beauty lies in the images. Or, in this case, the violence. On these fronts, Pacific Rim does not disappoint. The special effects, wedding del Toro's rubbery, stone-hewn aesthetics with CGI, are flawless. The alien kaiju are the most visually innovative monstrosities to rampage across screens in years – staggeringly large, covered in sharp edges, and throbbing with an intriguing blue light. The defenders – giant robotic exoskeleton jaegers (though subtext of German 'attackers' versus Japanese 'monsters' is best avoided), are equally fun, equally winking at clunky, diving-bell robots of vintage Japanese science-fiction. The film's best (and, effectively, only) plot twists lie in finding steadily more imaginative ways for the two titanic combatants to fight. The destruction is appealingly vast (it is no coincidence that I heard no fewer than three separate audience members leaving the theatre griping 'But where were the Avengers already?!'). However, unlike many of the plethora of other apocalyptic releases this year, del Toro keeps the focus immediately on the seismic fisticuffs of the monster fights, rather than extending his focus out to fetishize the wanton destruction. This lends Pacific Rim a curious intimacy, and one which, in a strange way, is far more effective than any of the script's fumbling attempts at humanizing its carbon-copy humans. Indeed, it is no surprise that, in the fiendish mind of del Toro, the most imaginative aspect of any character is their names. It isn't every movie in which characters named Stacker Pentecost, Hercules Hansen, Hannibal Chau, Newton Geizler, and Raleigh Becket exchange dialogue, and this in itself almost excuses the largely flat (but not flat enough) or cartoonish (but not uniformly cartoonish enough) performances. In many cases, del Toro simply supplants eccentric costuming as a shorthand to interesting character development (poor Clifton Collins Jr., being out-acted by an unfortunate bow-tie/suspenders/sideburns ensemble). And, inevitably, critiquing acting here is almost as redundant as stopping to reflect on the script's scientific liberties and purposeful misdirections (dinosaurs have how many brains?). Nonetheless, Charlie Hunnam is earnest, but snooze-worthy and instantly forgettable as the latest entry in 'generic white American male sci-fi leads 101'. Idris Elba stealing the show as Marshall Stacker Pentecost (a name worth repeating twice) is a given, as Elba mines unexpected reserves of gravitas, pathos, heart, and often humour out of his steely military stereotype. His 'Do not mistake my calm exterior!' reprimand is just as likely to be belted out triumphantly in quoting wars as his already clumsily iconic 'Tonight we are CANCELING THE APOCALYPSE!' pump-up speech. Rinko Kikuchi, while a pleasantly unexpected piece of casting, is still too underwritten to have much to do, and the script's frequent infantilization of her reads as too tiredly patriarchal to even be played for laughs or genre convention. On the cartoonish side, Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman have oodles of fun, though Burn Gorman, who sounds like a del Toro name himself, as the requisite twitchy German(?) scientist is less welcomely so. A curiosity in its ambiguous simplicity, del Toro's Pacific Rim, while always trashily fun, could easily have been 40 minutes shorter (and at least 40% better), had it bothered less with plot and characterization, which it only does begrudgingly anyway. A true triumph would be to see an alternate cut which wilfully embraces its campy stupidity and cheerful pastiche, milking the true enjoyment of its sublime creature effects. Still, for all your 'monsters vs. robots' needs (and, let's face it, who doesn't have them?), del Toro proves a cheerfully triumphant dealer. And this is enough. -6/10",6,0,4,13 July 2013
Lion," The opposite of Hakuna Matata
","It's important to remember there are orphans in mainstream cinema who aren't whiny superheroes. Indeed, as Lion's sobering closing title card reminds us, over 80,000(!) children go missing in India alone every year - a staggering figure that makes the story of one who found his way home to his family all the more incredible. Saroo Brierly's story is too irresistibly moving to ever dismiss; however, it's unfortunate that its cinematic telling stumbles in properly doing it justice. Despite many promising attributes, Lion falls prey to a glut of unwarranted Oscar bait clichés, making the 'so-incredible-it-feels-like-a-movie' tale feel disappointingly artificial when told in feature film form.Lion will invariably suffer from a spate of Slumdog Millionaire comparisons, which aren't as reductionist as you'd expect. Nonetheless, debut director Garth Davis could have taken notes in how to convey heavy content with the pizazz and massive heart of his film's begrudging predecessor, as his film plays as too overlong, stagey, and glum to properly stand out by comparison. Still, Luke Davies' otherwise clumsy screenplay makes one bold choice that pays off: unfolding Saroo's 'there and back again' linearly, rather than disrupted by traditional, hackneyed Hollywood flashbacks. This two-act structure forces us to empathize with the sheer enormity - emotional and geographic - of his journey, building up to a climactic emotional payoff that feels exhaustively earned. The first half, a near-silent parable of a young Saroo, disoriented, wandering across India, and besieged by countless unscrupulous, predatory individuals, grimly sketches the film's social consciousness and horrific climate of missing/abducted children. Poignantly severe as it is, the segment's length, aimless editing, and wordless lugubriousness still toe the line of being an episodic downer parade. Thankfully, Davis cleverly takes the Life is Beautiful route, filtering the looming evils through the cheerful shambling of its child protagonist. It works, as luminous newcomer Sunny Pawar, bursting with a quirky, Charlie Chaplin charisma, carries the first act masterfully, captivating with his wary but unquenchably chipper perseverance every step of the way. The film's second half, housing the bulk of the narrative, is more of a slog. Initially, Davis ably conveys the brittle social dynamics of Saroo's adoption process, including the unforeseen pain of an adopted brother struggling to integrate and prone to fits of self-harm. Similarly, Saroo's subsequent disinterested 'third culture kid' identity ('you still like cricket?' 'Yeah, but I cheer for the Aussies, mate') feels commendably real. Disappointingly, the script's set up for Saroo's central conflict is far from as finely honed. The tricky thing about PTSD is that, distressingly real as it is, it's hard to depict cinematically without it reading as wholly disingenuous, and Davis flounders somewhat to dredge up the urgency and emotional resonance in Saroo's triggered fixation with his past. Instead, we get pockets of cumbersome, frustratingly Oscar-baiting dialogue that brandish the film's themes with the subtlety of a cricket bat upside the head, including multiple superfluous exposition-fights with Saroo's girlfriend (Rooney Mara; capable but somewhat glassy-eyed in an underwritten support/indignation sounding board archetype). Increasingly, this second act involves watching an increasingly sulky and hairy Dev Patel loom over a laptop (and the fawning introduction of Google Earth - 'have you heard about this fantastic new program?' is about as instantly dated as Chef's love letter to Twitter in 2014) - or worse: one of those splashy CSI-style map-pin-boards that seem to only exist in Hollywood detective fantasies. Davis does his best to counteract the stagnation with Google Earth footage turning into sweeping, gorgeous panoramic shots of beautifully lush Tasmania, and the arid, frustratingly elusive Indian countryside. Where Lion really excels beyond its central performances is in its ability to astutely capture a location's sensory details, with snippets of birdsong, local music, background banter, and cameras prowling as relentlessly as the titular predator lapping up the sights, sounds, and even smells of its two locales. This attention to detail is appropriate - after all, it's a sugary dessert that triggers Saroo's first childhood PTSD flashback - but it lends a welcome degree of authenticity and immediacy to a film otherwise scrambling to conjure such qualities. None of this is not to disparage Patel's excellent performance, as his furious, manic compulsion to reconcile the two halves of his life is commanding and fiercely believable, and the perfect counterbalance to the jauntier Pawar as his younger self. It's more a shame that the film's script and direction can't meet him at his level of intensity, as he's hauntingly human enough that we want to ache for Saroo's hardship, only to snapped out of Patel's magnetism by the frequent contrivance of the words that tumble out of his mouth. This is a fate that Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, as Saroo's adoptive parents, also struggle valiantly to combat through their honest and warm performances. Davies is mostly careful to position them gracefully and carefully, eschewing white saviour overtones by concentrating on their tentative but teeming love for their new family, and leaving Kidman only a single teary Oscar-flirting monologue. Their scenes are still a touch rosy-tinted, but the cabal of talent between them help make their thoroughly scripted exchanges play as raw and natural. Slow, disordered, and frustratingly cliché-peppered as it may be, Lion still serves as an emotional venus flytrap, pouncing with a (somewhat rushed) finale sure to leave even the most scornful skeptics misty-eyed - even its title drop is an rousing slam dunk. Nonetheless, the film's most moving moment is its closing credits' documentary footage of its real life personages interacting - tearful, gauche, but devastatingly authentic. Often, fictional filmmaking is championed for evoking a true story's inherent emotions more vividly than talking head anecdotal recreations. Lion, despite its promising attributes and visceral leading performances, is a strong testament to the contrary: sometimes such remarkable stories are better avoided by major studios, and told by those involved.-7/10",7,0,1,26 February 2017
Romeo + Juliet," Beach boys speaking Shakespeare... how weird is that?
","William Shakespeare's classic play is updated to a modern context, but still using the original, Old English text. It's a bold move on the part of director Baz Luhrmann, who brings a hyperkinetic, choppy editing style to the film, as if to never let the viewers catch their breaths. And for the most part, using the modern day context works, helping to clarify what some of the more tricky lines actually mean by showing it in familiar circumstances which audiences can identify with.Despite the fact that the relationship of the two lovers, who were doomed not to last together is the focus of the movie, neither lover gives a very strong or charismatic performance. DiCaprio makes a good enough Romeo, although he seems to be content to coast along on his looks and fame, and doesn't invest much energy into creating a well developed character. Claire Danes is miscast, and out of place. She makes a dull, uninteresting Juliet, putting next to no energy into the role, as if she would rather not be there at all. She seems to struggle delivering her Shakespearian lines, not to mention giving little sense that she has any idea what she's saying at all. It's sad that the lovers, the center of the film, couldn't find a way to act more enthusiastic and involving. Because so much of the movie focuses on their drab relationship, the film drags in many parts. (although Luhrmann seems determined to throw in a gunfight after every intimate scene just to stop audiences from nodding off in their seats)The supporting characters are where performances improve, letting the scenes with characters other than the two lovers present much more interesting. John Leguizamo makes a wonderfully vicious Tybalt, yet has the insight to occasionally give an uncertain look in the midst of cheap fighting and evil deeds, as if he is unsure what he is doing is morally right. Pete Posthlewaite is a high point of casting; his gruff but kind Friar Lawrence is wonderfully acted, and he manages to make clear what he is saying, even to those who might not understand Shakespearian dialect. Harold Perrineau makes a flamboyant Mercutio, unafraid of dressing in women's clothing to attract attention, or go on a twenty minute long tirade (that's an exaggeration, but only slightly, Mercutio goes on forever!) without actually saying anything of importance.It was an interesting idea, and the modern day context for the most part works, helping audiences to identify with the circumstances, even if it does seem a little odd to see beach boys with pink hair and Hawaiian shirts spouting Shakespearian dialog. But Luhrmann's jumpy, incredibly energetic film style, combined with his seeming determination to turn the classic romance into an action movie, with numerous gunfights, gets tiring, and eventually deters more than complements the film. And with two dull, uninteresting performances from the lovers, the focus of the film, it's no surprise that despite Luhrmann's unquenchable energy, the film drags on and fails to retain interest.-5/10",5,2,4,7 April 2005
Gone Baby Gone," Emotionally harrowing, mesmerizing crime mystery
","'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' goes the timeless saying, and such is a maxim increasingly applied to the film industry through the years. Though originality and strikingly fresh and new ideas are often sought as the storytelling ideal, there remains something to be said for a not all together unfamiliar but resoundingly quality effort within known parameters. It is on this front that Gone Baby Gone proves a rousing success - despite being primarily recognized as another crime mystery by the author of the more renowned Mystic River, the film proves such a staunchly quality package to warrant differentiation, as well as being recognized as the emotionally harrowing, gripping and flat out powerful mini-masterpiece that it is.While the story, adapted from the Dennis Lehane novel, is well tread ground for those experienced in the crime or mystery genres, making some of the more crucial plot twists apparent before the fact, it scarcely detracts from the execution, beautifully elegant in its simplicity. Touching upon themes of class struggles, moral ambiguity, corruption as well as Catholic introspection worthy of Scorsese (Mean Streets is an obvious influence), the sheer authenticity on display makes for a genuinely compelling immersion into the slums of Boston in all of their sleaze and grit. These are real people having real interaction in real environments, transfixing the viewer by the near complete absence of Hollywood showiness or sugar-coating - rather than a finely tuned script, the impression is given of peeking over the shoulder of those interacting in real life, and the picture is more often than not a pretty one. Director Ben Affleck seems to have found his true calling with this remarkable directorial debut, as both his stellar script (co-written by Aaron Stockard) and emotionally charged directorial presence throb with passion and dedication for the film. Keeping the pace reflective and riveting without ever having to rush, Affleck holds the tension on a slow burn throughout while retaining every ounce of emotional intensity - the result being a slow, steadily affecting immersion in the story, making each twist all the more gripping, each raw human interaction all the more draining and eerily moving. Some beautiful cinematography, sublime editing and an affecting, minimalist score which only on occasion falls back on convention complete the stunning overall productCasey Affleck cements his status as a genuinely bankable leading man as rough but vulnerable investigator Patrick Kenzie, as his truly powerful, stoic, brooding presence anchors the film, his understated simmer and brutish emoting retaining the audience's full sympathies through every twist and turn. In contrast, the highly talented Michelle Monaghan disappointingly proves one of the film's weaker aspects as Kenzie's girlfriend and investigative partner, though not through lack of trying. Despite her best efforts, and impressive fuming in emotionally heated scenes, Monaghan is saddled with an insulting lack of character, often given nothing to do but stand around silently, making for a criminally choppy and underdeveloped character and a waste of considerable dramatic potential. However, Ed Harris proves at the top of his considerable game as an abrasive police officer, a dynamic powerhouse of a performance. Similarly, Morgan Freeman provides his usual quiet dignity and class with a subversive twist as a shady police captain haunted by the death of his daughter, and Freeman's wistful eyes offer uneasy entrance into a damaged soul - a truly affecting and resonating performance. Amy Ryan also impresses as the sleazy, drug addicted mother whose daughter was kidnapped, managing a brusque charm amidst her countless foibles. Despite few storyline surprises being in store, the real surprise is how flat out mesmerizing the film is, its constant eerie calm and claustrophobic intensity making for a thoroughly riveting and draining watch, near inevitable to haunt viewers for days afterwards. With sturdy, lyrical directing and rock solid performances aplenty, Gone Baby Gone breathes fresh vigour into the hard worn crime drama, easily worth a watch.-9/10",9,0,0,23 July 2008
The Lost City of Z," Welcome to the Jungle, we got no fun or games
","Percival Fawcett - intrepid explorer, whose exploits into charting the Amazon jungle in search of a mystical ancient civilization captivated the world and inspired a generation of adventure writers - would probably fall asleep during his own dour, flaccid biopic. Now, this isn't to say the only way to cinematically interpret Fawcett's life would be to whip-crack into full-blown Indiana Jones (though a film this allergic to fun could do far worse than shallow, Romancing the Stone mimesis). Instead, director James Gray strives to tap into Fawcett's mythos and mystique with the lyrical, abstract profundity of a Terrence Malick or Werner Herzog (indeed, his telling is irreconcilably indebted to Herzog's own parable of jungle madness, Fitzcarraldo). Sadly, he's too clumsy a director to commit to the kooky poetry of his thematic earmarks. Instead, his lolling sequences of Fawcett's crew wandering through the jungle or circumnavigating stuffy British Geographical Society politics - amazingly, equally drab and aimless - at times pleasantly hypnotic, but threaten to turn proceedings into The Lost City of ZZZzzzzzz. Fawcett's memoirs tell of encounters with 60 foot snakes, deadly spiders, and enough peril and adventure to galvanize Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to write The Lost World. These tales may have been tall (who's to say? are YOU going to forage through the jungle to fact check?), but it's a rare exercise in cinema purposefully downplaying the fun factor of its source material. The film starts promisingly: after an effectively squirmy opening with Fawcett failing to advance through the ranks of claustrophobic military culture in rural Ireland thanks to disgraced parentage, Gray bequeaths us a fun Ian McDarmid cameo as the evil Emperor of Geography, whose ominous monologue hypes the exotic perils of the jungle, stopping just shy of him purring 'Goooood. Goooooood!' So far so good (gooooood!). But, after a thrilling (not) foray into the fine details of cartography, we finally follow Fawcett into the jungle. And wait. And walk. And wait. And cough. And fidget. And try not to check our phones, but my goodness, is that the time? But don't worry: you've two hours of more of the same awaiting you. (I could tell, as a Canadian viewer, that my crowing this triumphantly at hearing the titular legend correctly[!] pronounced as 'Zed' rather than the customary big-screen 'Zee,' was a sign of how dire the cinematic experience was here )One brief sequence, where Fawcett's raft and crew are besieged by indigenous arrows, only to meet a bloody end by looming piranhas, plays as a lively prelude to more thrilling adventures to come. Instead, it's the activity high point, an uneasily early climax paving the way to two thirds of increasingly diminishing content. There's no facts, literature, or even conjecture to establish even the skeleton of a mythology enough to share Fawcett's burning desire to unearth the titular lost civilization, apart from a few nonchalant shards of pottery, quickly whisked away from. Instead, we're reminded that the film shares a production team with 12 Years a Slave, and is thereby a Film With an Important Social Message. Behold: lengthy, awkward, anachronistic shoehorned-in diatribes shooting for feminism and anti-colonial racial equality instead playing as Hallmark pandering, patronizing asides of white saviourism. Think of Brad Pitt's uncomfortably didactic, self-congratulatory monologue in 12 Years a Slave. Now imagine sinking into a full 30 minutes of it, in a film that really isn't an organic platform for filmic slacktivism du jour. Yeah, I saw you checking your watch there - don't even pretend. Even such a feeble ebb of a film could have coughed up some embers with an appropriately charismatic, magnetic lead. Unfortunately, Charlie Hunnam is effectively the antithesis of any such qualities. If his cross between snoozy murmuring, overcooked pontificating, and absentminded smugness were meant to play as enigmatic, he clearly dropped out of Mumblecore college too early to find a balance skewing anything close to watchable. If anything, Robert Pattinson appears to be practically bursting at the seams to chew scenery as eccentric comic relief with deranged relish - so, naturally, after an encouragingly wild-eyed introduction, he's rendered effectively mute by Gray, his performance as much of a dud as his surroundings. Sienna Miller is similarly too swamped by the script's quicksand of 'frowny, long-suffering wife with absentee husband' cliché to cough up anything resembling a spark of humanity to grab onto. So we're left with Tom Holland, funnelling every ounce of sprightly energy, charisma, and irresistible earnestness into Fawcett's son-with-prodigal-father, heralding the film's only genuine character arc. Try as he might, he's barely in it. It isn't enough. Gray's film is not entirely without minor blips of enjoyment: it's well-shot, and makes good use of the beautiful Amazonian scenery (even if it is all dulled by a frustrating grey filter - there's really no need to live up to your namesake literally, James). Add the serene, soothingly ethereal score of Christopher Spelman, and many of Fawcett's jungle walks attain a pleasantly elegiac peacefulness, like a meditative nature walk. It's just a shame that this is the extent of the film's ambitions, as we otherwise see next to nothing of the excitement, mystery, or peril that made the jungle so obsessively captivating for Fawcett, instead making each jungle reprise, instead of bustling with possibility, at most muster a murmur of placid indifference. The Lost City of Z may be benignly, mildly engaging, but, remains overall, like Fawcett, a promising curiosity fated to be buried in the annals of cinema history. So, if that feat of metatextual anticlimax was Gray's aim, he accomplished it masterfully - the only such instance of mastery throughout. Oh - are you still awake? You're doing better than me. Yawn. -5.5/10",5,53,88,20 May 2017
Ant-Man," Something's not Wright here
","Once upon a time, Ant-Man was the Marvel movie to beat. A founding Avenger with less baggage of expectation, Ant-Man allowed the studio increasing danger of collapsing under the titanic weight of their own 'universe-building' a chance to shake things up with something small (ha), intimate, and quirky. Paired with the eclectic stylistic flair and consummate comedic timing of visionary writer/director Edgar Wright, Ant-Man was primed to become the breath of fresh air in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Alas. Wright's departure from the project, followed by shady, last minute rewrites, and the hiring of Peyton Reed, best known for helming despicably generic attempts at comedy, didn't bode well. But Marvel's impeccable track record and the inspired casting of Paul Rudd suggested there was still Hope (ha) an enjoyable romp could be salvaged out of the film's prior potential. Indeed, it's hard not to sneer that the film's theme of 'second chances,' uttered roughly 1800 times by Michael Douglas with all the subtlety of a children's bedtime story, reads as a meta plea for clemency on behalf of the studio. And yet, even with this growing backlog of worrisome evidence against it, none could have predicted the final product to come. Ant-Man is, not to mince words, an insultingly poor film. Inexcusably lazy, under-thought, clichéd, soulless the list of adjectives is endless. Purportedly structured around a heist narrative, the miserable excuse for a script slaps together a slew of loathsome narrative crutches (released con coaxed into 'one last job', disgraced dad trying to win back custody rights to his daughter, emotionally distant genius forced to confront the demons of his pastyawn), glued together with laughably contrived MCU tie-ins (a dire prologue tacked on to remind audiences that Marvel's Agent Carter still exists, an Avengers cameo so embarrassingly out of place I won't dare spoil it here, ugh) in a shamefully textbook example of 'safe studio filmmaking'. One would imagine that after the rampant success of the eccentric, daring Guardians of the Galaxy Marvel would push the envelope even further into the realm of clever humour and weird levity. Instead, Reed inexplicably stoops to sassy 'comedic relief' side characters that would have felt stale in the 1980s, otherwise leaning on Paul Rudd's indestructibly affable charisma to keep the film afloat. And though Rudd is nearly impossible to dislike, turning on the charm and puppy-dog pathos and mining the abysmal script for laughs like never before, even he can only do so much to save a sinking ship (it's ironic Rudd's Lang makes a Titanic reference). Running less than two hours and still feeling offensively overlong, Ant-Man plods along at an insomnia-curing pace (Reed may as well have re-titled the film Slug-Man), counterbalancing a stupefying long training montage with terse monologues about morality so repetitive there is a legitimate worry of having entered the simulacrum of Groundhog Day. The sole consolation: the film's visual effects, while often looking slapdash and rushed, do conjure an ant-sized handful of fascinating imagery. Lang's first shrinking experience into the suddenly desolate wasteland of a bathtub provides a blip of entertainment, and there is brief joy – nay, perhaps even a chuckle or two – to be found in his ant-training escapades (watching him surf through a drainpipe on a skittering carpet of ants is a highlight). Similarly, Lang's accidental descent into the subatomic realm provides a gorgeous feast of Escher- influenced surrealism. But, before you know it, we're back to being pummelled senseless by cliché once again. Sigh.Speaking of pummelling: despite a surprisingly sound rationalization of the physicality of Ant- Man (small yet compact, 'like a bullet'), the film's action sequences are tragically sparse. It's a shame, as the unique size-changing fight choreography offers a few precious where the film momentarily sputters with some life and vigour. Surely a couple of minutes of Michael Douglas' droning could have been shaved off for a few more shots of unorthodox pounding? Ah, but that would require a director with even a skeletal grasp of energy, pace, or vision (ahem). Among the film's immeasurable log of missed opportunities: no Lang entering the human body and attacking from within, and not even a fleeting glimpse of a triumphant Giant-Man transformation (at least one climactic moment provides an ideal setup). And the Wasp? Shamefully, unforgivably absent. All the while, Christophe Beck's musical score bwomps away in the background, the most hackneyed pastiche of heroic musical clichés yet, and there are even a couple of moments where Reed has the gall to attempt to mimic Edgar Wright's trademark kinetic 'swish-pan' editing and cinematography. Rub salt in the gaping wound, why dontcha. The squandered potential on screen is almost too much to bear. Even the film's generally talented cast is Hopeless (see what I did there? I used the same joke twice. Just like Ant-Man) at providing any respite from the turgid mess surrounding them. Apart from Rudd – and even he starts to seem tired by the end – Michael Douglas snores through the film, his Hank Pym an unmistakably extraneous mentor archetype, while Evangeline Lily continues her Hobbit streak of astoundingly flat 'token action woman' cardboard cutouts. Corey Stoll, saddled with the worst lines the script has to offer (which is saying something), is so embarrassingly cartoonish here it almost overrides his previously impressive work in House of Cards, while poor Michael Peña is forced to constantly mug for increasingly cheap laughs as Lang's fellow ex-con buddy. The worst of the lot: Bobby Canavale's oafish cop/stepdad rival is hilariously out of place, while Judy Greer is given so little screen time as Lang's estranged wife she may as well have played the Invisible Woman. In conclusion (just to finish beating that dead horse): Edgar Wright once opined that 'the only bad films are dull films.' Ladies and gentlemen, Ant-Man is a bad film. -3/10",3,114,241,17 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," 'I've knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.'
","Considering how fundamentally 'safe' the superhero action film has become in terms of box office and reasonable standards of entertainment, selling Captain America, age-old icon of American propaganda on cinema screens in cynical and economically unstable times could hardly have been a more difficult endeavor – tellingly, the film was marketed simply as The First Avenger in Russia, the Ukraine and South Korea. Indeed, skepticism and uncertainty have riddled the development of the project, which was first pitched as a Jon Favreau 'action comedy' and later as a brutal, gritty, self-critical postmodern war epic. Such tonal fluctuation mirroring the social/political climate demonstrated that having a successful film with such a politically entwined protagonist, was anything but 'safe' – it's hard to imagine Peter Parker being subjected to the scrutiny of 'military propaganda' or 'patriotic cheese' that beset Steve Rogers. With this in mind, all the more credit can be given to Spielberg-cohort Joe Johnson for delivering what is ultimately the first comic book film that properly feels like a cartoon brought to life. Pitching strictly for nostalgia, Johnson bravely girds his film with the unabashed gee-wiz charm and heart of a 1940s Saturday morning adventure serial. In the process, without consistently tripping over political correctness, Johnson neatly circumvents concerns of propagandistic exploitation by delivering a film too bombastic, too colourful, too cheerily old-fashioned to be taken seriously enough as any kind of coy ideological manipulation. It's hard to imagine any contemporary audiences, cine-literate or not, being swayed to join the army by witnessing Captain America's hilariously cringe-worthy war bonds tour, arguably the film's strongest and most self-aware sequence. Even a couple of brazenly Spielbergian montages - conflating Captain America's early triumphs or the Red Skull's past crimes into a series of dramatic snapshots - somehow function as endearing and in keeping with the boldly cheerful feel, as Johnson keeps the pace whipping along with an engaging sprightly bounce, accompanied by Alan Silvestri's soaringly heroic musical score. Indeed, Captain America comes across as more of a vintage science-fiction adventure than war film, as Johnson channels the sort of deliriously cartoonish aesthetic, weapons and technology of 1940s serials, including lavish set design that would do any James Bond evil mastermind proud. Curiously, Johnson's film works in some surprisingly intense action, (including one of the more unexpectedly gruesome deaths in a comic book film), exploring Captain America's comparatively 'grounded' superhuman abilities to the effect of some of the most gripping fight scenes in recent memory, alternating tightly choreographed beat downs while adding the intriguing new dimension of his ricocheting shield to keep the action nuanced. Between the tidily doled out combat (including unique, visually dynamic showdowns between Nazi-scientist sect Hydra and the US army) and the film's encompassing virtually every form of chase scene (car, foot, submarine, motorcycle, train, helicopter, airplane and even zip-lining), there is ample material to appease any expectations for summer spectacle. Nonetheless, Johnson's film is not, despite its glossy cartoon finish, without its faults. Despite the thundering action, the film may prove too over-the-top for those disinclined to filter through a haze of charming nostalgia. Similarly, throwback cartoonish fun and self-aware irony aside, some viewers may still find it impossible to shake the notion of watching a distasteful two hour army recruitment video. Additionally, like predecessor Thor, the film does lose its footing somewhat as it approaches the climax, and its juggling the emotional demands of a stand-alone narrative while still bridging the transition towards the upcoming superhero epic The Avengers may prove unsettling for non-comic fans. Nonetheless, Johnson admirably reconciles the two, grinding the whiz-bang cheerfulness of his film to a halt with a jarring, quietly tragic ending that, miraculously, proves oddly appropriate in spite of its discordance. Either way, if ever there were a film this year worth sitting out the ending credits, this would be the one. Chris Evans as the iconic 'star-spangled man with the plan' proves the film's greatest boon. Muting his customary swagger without sacrificing his overflowing charisma, Evans concocts an effortless blend between earnestness and underhanded humour, that makes his transition from good-hearted scrawny loser to unexpected patriotic icon somehow feel incredibly believable, sympathetic and appealing, thus selling the whole film. The fact that Evans can tackle moments such as a 'this is why we fight' speech, saddled with a nearly absurd CGI- shrunken body, with a straight face and without a false note, and transition to asking his best buddy 'Are you ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of hell?' with a perfect a quiver of world-weary, witty, self-mockery in his voice, demonstrates a masterfully conscious and nuanced performer delivering his most assured work yet. However, Johnson wisely surrounds Evans with a truly impressive supporting cast, each inhabiting their cheerfully one-note characters with enthusiasm to spare. Hugo Weaving masticates scenery with appropriate preening oiliness as the dastardly Red Skull, and Hayley Atwell and Sebastian Stan inhabit love interest Peggy Carter and best buddy Bucky Barnes with laudable presence and credibility. Tommy Lee Jones has a ball wryly clashing with the film around him as Rogers' military superior, and scene-stealer Stanley Tucci infuses the film with warmth and wit as the scientist behind Rogers' super soldier transformation. Dominic Cooper triumphantly bubbles over with charisma, charm and quirky humour worthy of his superheroic son as master inventor Howard Stark, while Toby Jones slithers with welcome relish as the Red Skull's chief scientist Arnim Zola. While the true make-or-break of the character will depend on his exploration in a contemporary context by Joss Whedon in The Avengers, it is hard to imagine a more appropriate or enjoyable character introduction. Consider Captain America as Indiana Jones' square-jawed uncle – bold enough to demonstrate, by example, the role and function of a national icon, yet retrospectively wise enough to stick to its guns and striving for pure entertainment. Such an unabashed dash of fun is worthy of 'recruiting' viewers everywhere. -9/10",9,6,15,27 July 2011
Predator," 'Sport'
","With a premise reducible as 'Schwarzenegger vs. superpowered alien in jungle from the director of Die Hard', it would seem a given that Predator could hardly be less than a rip- snorting good time. And the film is more fun than one could ask for, natch, but its real surprise is that, rather than simply a guilty pleasure, it isn't half bad in any regard, boasting enough of a brain and thematic backbone to, in combination with its combustible mayhem, easily cement it as a genre classic. Boasting one of the most impressive genre resumes in cinema history, director John McTiernan certainly knows his salt in terms of hard-thwacking, supremely satisfying action and Predator, one of his earliest offerings, consistently fires on all cylinders. McTiernan is wise enough to concentrate on the minutiae within the bombastic, dwelling as much on details such as exactly how the team members strap on their weapons, cock their heads to listen for threatening sounds or sing songs to themselves to quench nerves coming away as just as memorable as any explosive showdowns. Such an attention to detail is what truly elevates the film from the chaff, with a painstakingly creeping sense of peril and dread leaving the audience constantly scrutinizing background trees, the soft crinkle of ferns, the hiss of breathing and any unexpected movement as the film stalks away from the familiar comfort of civilization into the horrific isolation of an alien jungle. For its use of sound alone, the film should be considered a classic of horror as well as action. With its claustrophobic arousal of tension, the film is unquestionably indebted to Spielberg's Jaws, the Predator's infra-red POV fittingly substituting for the lurking underwater shark cameras, yet in many ways the film eerily foreshadows aspects of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, bringing the cycle of influence (whether conscious or not) full circle. To mention McTiernan's film in the same breath as such classics is no accident, as he cannily utilizes such established conventions to bend viewer expectations and sympathies (it is worth noticing who the audience is 'watching' at what point during the film, alternatively aligned with Dutch or the Predator, making traditionally black and white sympathies murky) to draw them in all the more. While the film may lag a bit near the middle, with several 'apprehensively wandering through the jungle' scenes feeling extraneous, to say nothing of the genre cliché unapologetically yet clumsily speckled throughout ('Stick around!' smirks Dutch as he fastens an enemy soldier to a door with a knife), it is exceedingly rare to see such astute talent and focus dedicated to a film which could easily have been written off as an 'expendable' B- feature. Of course any good 'creature feature' would be nothing without its antagonist, and the Predator itself is a spectacular creation. An ingeniously inventive design, from invisibility- yielding chameleon armour to sinister clicking call to its fusion of the organic and technological, the Predator is a force of almost every antagonistic nature combined, and, chillingly enough, in the fleeting segments the audience is left alone with it, shown to be a more sophisticated extrapolation of the testosterone-pumped yahoos of Dutch's team that it hunts. Though it may be a stretch, the Predator can be seen to represent the essence of 'manhood', the masculine ideal, steadily overcoming all other semblances of machismo represented by Dutch's team and absorbing them into itself, taking skins, spines and heads for the sake of proving itself. As odd as it may seem to consider Arnold Schwarzenegger an example of progressive masculinity, Dutch, while introduced in a flurry of cigars, bulging biceps and one-liners as just as an example of the same kind of cocky manhood as his team, is the only male in the film willing to depart from the usual role of hyper-physical masculine, privileging running from the Predator for the sake of protecting his men rather than pursuing it on a macho vendetta like the rest of his team. McTiernan's introduction of Anna, the only female in the film is particularly interesting: reduced to a nearly nonexistent role, she serves primarily to articulate the attitudes of the men around her. While the majority of the team instinctively try to repress or conquer her (the Predator outright ignores her, opting instead for fellow machismo to overpower), Dutch is the only one to give Anna her say, trust her and release her. It is only through these departures of traditional masculinity that Dutch can defeat its epitome, the Predator (complete with an ironic, mockingly vaginal face), which, fittingly enough, destroys itself when Dutch demonstrates mercy towards it, unable to accept its defeat by a less primal form of manhood. In terms of performance, apart from said occasional one-liner, Schwarzenegger is refreshingly reserved, delivering, in spite of himself, a performance of credible steely focus and rough compassion, a fitting emotional anchor for such a grisly film. Similarly, Bill Duke is excellent as solemn soldier Mac, as adept at delivering a grim whisper as a heartbroken sob, and injecting the film with raw compassion and heartbreak. Jesse Ventura also stands out as the most gung-ho of the pack, his brazen tobacco spitting ('This stuff will make you a goddamned sexual tyrannosaurus!'), minigun-toting Blain providing the definitive final word on good, old fashioned, macho posturing. Whether appraised for its underlying sociological group interactions, gender politics, or simply the volume of gasps and explosions, Predator proves difficult to beat on the action/thriller front. Impeccably constructed and fun as can be, McTiernan's film is a must- see for all those capable of stomaching exploding heads and/or Schwarzenegger's sizable biceps. -9/10",9,2,2,2 August 2010
Watchmen," The insurmountable barrier of expectations - an excellent film, but never the graphic novel
","How to film the 'unfilmable'? The ever recurring question, cycling through decades of development on adapting Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's cherished graphic novel Watchmen, into a motion picture, including several defeated attempts by directors as prestigious as Terry Gilliam, Paul Greengrass and Darren Aronofsky) appeared to have finally found an answer in director Zack Snyder. Fresh off a similarly vigilantly faithful comic book adaptation of Frank Miller's 300, Snyder's vow to cherish the graphic novel as his bible throughout film-making appeared the crucial solution to the incredible difficulty of transferring the staggering variety of thematic, social and political content of Moore's dark exploration and subversion of the superhero myth: keep as much of it intact on screen as possible to satisfy the die-hard fans, without alienating those uninitiated with the source text. However, Snyder's slavish dedication to the graphic novel ultimately proves to be both Watchmen's greatest strength and most profound failure, resulting in a film which is within earshot of greatness, and yet is never quite the Watchmen of expectations.For any familiar with the graphic novel, divorcing awareness of it is simply never an option, as the substantial replication continually begs a comparison which it would seem could ultimately never prove satisfactory. And yet Snyder gives it his all, showcasing the aesthetic sensibilities honed in 300 to an astonishing degree, crafting a world of dulled hues of vibrant colours, lavish costuming and sets with an alarmingly pitch perfect professional gloss. However, as laudable as his respect for the text is, as the film unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that Snyder was simultaneously both the best and worst candidate for the directorial position. For all of his passionate adherence to his text, Snyder remains principally a visual director, and such passion does not carry through to properly mining the lusciously rich dimensions of Moore's work. Beyond the pristine exteriors, there lurks a haunting lack of depth and substance, a surprisingly hollow absence of the real feeling and emotional core of the graphic novel a director such as Aronofsky or Gilliam may have sunk their cinematic teeth into. As such, despite the meticulous recreation of nearly all the narrative and political subtexts of Moore's work (apart from the famously altered ending, which admirably accomplishes nearly the same intent as the text's), the underlying passion and emotional undertones which made them light up with such vibrant urgency are mostly lost. Nonetheless, there are moments... fleeting moments of such inspired, spot-on power and poignancy (Rorschach's backstory and an inspired use of the textually quoted 'All Along the Watchtower' song across the arctic, among others) which spike above the film as a whole and hint at the masterful adaptation which might have been.And yet, even such a comparatively pale shadow of the original proves an utterly exhausting experience, particularly for those unfamiliar with the text itself. While Snyder accomplishes a valiant job of retaining the narrative while truncating it into a palatable fashion for the uninitiated, viewers may still find the length, pacing and sheer mass of information presented daunting and somewhat of a struggle to ingest. Snyder's overly trendy cinematic sensibilities hardly help the matter, attempting to punch up the excitement factor of an extremely long, mostly narrative and character driven superhero film with sporadic slow- motion inundated and frenzied, garishly violent fight scenes, which, though enthralling and often gruesomely engrossing, prove so tiresomely in tune with recent action movie conventions such sequences adapt a look sure to appear incredibly dated within a short matter of years. A musical score which proves incongruous and jarring as often as subversively fitting and occasionally frustratingly clichÃ©d similarly reinforces the uneasy veneer.Despite admirable attempts by the cast, many struggle to fully capture and convey the essence of Moore's convoluted characters. Jackie Earle Haley proves the triumphant exception as psychopathic, stoic yet perversely honourable vigilante Rorschach. Haley's grim, caustic performance grows on the viewer like a festering sore, triggering exactly what Rorschach is, and bringing to life a character for the ages. Patrick Wilson similarly proves perfectly attuned to his over the hill Nite Owl, charismatically channelling the character's nerdiness, heroic impotence (in more ways than one) and eventual rebirth through embracing potentially out of date heroic norms. However, they prove the exceptions, as Malin Ackerman as Silk Spectre II is essentially reduced to gratuitous eye candy (which, given her infuriating deprivation of character development, is about all the character's inclusion seems meant for) but does not rise to her rare occasions to shine, showcasing a troublesome lack of dramatic ability or screen presence during crucial emotional scenes. Billy Crudup also struggles to balance godlike Dr. Manhattan's near robotic detachment and muted emotion (but, to his credit, retains impressive dignity for a consistently naked blue man), and Matthew Goode proves too watered down to fully nail the arrogant superiority of superhero entrepreneur Ozymandias. The most noticeable is Jeffery Dean Morgan as the nihilistic 'Comedian' - Morgan simply lacks the necessary spark of acerbic energy to make the Comedian work as a character, his muted performance failing to properly channel the ferocious, subversively charming snarl the narrative's series of flashbacks revolve around, perhaps resulting in the film's emotional punch remaining vaguely elusive. The fact that Snyder's Watchmen is as strong a film as it is is an incredible accomplishment in itself, yet it consistently leaves one yearning for the deeper, more rich film glimpsed only in tantalizing moments. If anything, the conclusion can be drawn that if such an overall incredibly strong adaptation can still be found to be lacking the necessary spark of the text, than the idea of a universally satisfying Watchmen film may remain forever a pipe dream. Perhaps 'unfilmable' proved a more fitting epitaph than expected - but, having been filmed, the enormous dedication and quality of Snyder's work cannot be ignored, and his Watchmen is without question accessible and well worth watching for fans and non-fans alike.-7.5/10",8,1,5,6 March 2009
Baby Driver," That's not bolognaise, Baby
","Action movies are musicals!It's an idea that's titillated film studies scholars for years - characters expressing themselves through the elaborate, narrative-pausing spectacle of shootouts and car chases in lieu of song and dance breaks. But it takes a director as fastidiously committed and immaculately mad as Edgar Wright to properly literalize the idea. And in his hands, rock-steady but drumming with excitement, we have Baby Driver - a movie as unabashedly nostalgic as it is fresh and innovative, hat-tipping to the era of Steve McQueen cool while pushing the envelope past pastiche and parody into new frontiers for the 'car chase film,' or even action genre. It's also one of the most infectiously kinetic, technically flawless, and uproariously fun times had at the movies in years - a Fast and the Furious for film buffs, conductors, and any adjacent audiences swept along for the ride.You know that feeling of cathartic exhilaration and deep satisfaction you get watching a particularly well-edited music video, that synchronizes action beats to the timing of the song? Wright kicks that out of the park with a pulse-pounding opening heist/chase, already the most thrilling thing seen in years. Already, it's impossible not to marvel at how painstaking each movement (right down to the eyes!), sound effect, and action is matched to the song - if the adrenaline rush left any space for conscious admiration, that is. And then. He just. Keeps. Going. That's right - Every Single Cut in Baby Driver is precisely synchronized with the timing of an almost wall-to-wall soundtrack awesome enough to make Quentin Tarantino and Peter Quill tap their toes in envy, like a retro-Hollywood Stomp. Even the soundtrack-free dialogue sequences are so precisely timed they carry a 4/4 rhythm and keep the beat like scat interludes (listen carefully, and you can practically hear Kevin Spacey conducting his own soliloquies). It's a remarkable, unprecedented feat of mad scientist editing that is an almost deliriously impressive feat to behold in a Hollywood film - a nearly two-hour pop-rock-funk-soul opera bursting at the seams with slick style and exuberant joie-de-vivre. Call it a gimmick if you will, but I dare to to find a gimmick as meticulous, committed, and downright rip-roaring-fun.And as for the story amidst the spectacle? Wright is a careful and ingenious enough writer to ensure he's in the driver's seat in regards to 'one last job' clichés rather than letting them drive him. He pumps in enough twists, turns, a laundry list of pop culture winks, and moments of savagely bonkers humour (come for the Michael Meyers; stay for the Monsters Inc.) into the overly familiar framework to keep it as fresh and interesting as can be. Certainly there are nitpicks - a couple of third act reversals are so earnest and contrived it's almost sweet, while Wright's unfortunate trend in vastly under-writing female leads continues with Lily James' Deborah, who, despite James' radiant charm, is transparently a plot-propelling prop rather than organic character. Still - when we're strapped to the hood of Baby's chariot, slamming around the city with some of the most plentiful, playful, and voraciously fun car chases of the past several decades (amazingly, without a lick of CGI, a-la Mad Max: Fury Road), all the more dizzying through Wright's trademark hyperkinetic, whip-pan editing and concussive sound effects? A more bonkers, spectacle-ridden action climax than the average budget-bloated blockbuster, even more dazzling by being purely done with practical effects? Watching Baby ricochet a barbed wire road block into a pursuing cop car mid-turn, still in time with The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's 'Bellbottoms?' Three words: F*cking. Cool. As. Hell ('oh sh*t; that's four words'). Wright's cast all excel at embodying their bevy of '90s Tarantino film archetypes' with as much slick charisma and idiosyncratic oddness to ensure their walking through predictable beats is anything but predictable. As the titular vehicular savant, Ansel Elgort proves himself an enigmatic leading man for the ages, hitting the perfect balance between unflappable, impassive cool and goofy charisma. Watching him sashay his way across town in a long take tracking shot - itself a playful riff on the opening to Wright's Shaun of the Dead - to the Harlem Shuffle may be one of the most irreverently joyful sequences to grace screens this year. Kevin Spacey could play his 'steely but paternal' mob boss in his sleep, were his articulate eloquence and exquisite comedic timing not signs of his being very much awake. Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm both steal scenes with tremendous aplomb, each nailing an impeccable balance of being tremendously unpredictable and frightening and deadpan hilarity, while Eiza González provides a steady, smirking foil for their hamming (no pun intended, I swear). Finally, Jon Bernthal aces his 'seething mug' Punisher shtick in an extended cameo both disappointingly and amusingly short, while CJ Jones is charm incarnate as Baby's foster father. Baby Driver may be Edgar Wright's most accessible, albeit least personal work of his astonishingly airtight career (indeed, memories of his having preemptively taken the p*ss out of the genre with Hot Fuzz are inescapable). But, apart from a couple of over-earnest plot contrivances, it only furthers his title as the industry's most inventive, fiendishly playful, and inconceivably immaculate maverick still working. So strap in for the most audaciously exhilarating and stupidly fun romp of the summer so far. Firing your gun in the air during a high speed pursuit while yelling 'AAAAHHHHH' optional. Vroom vroom.-9/10",9,1,3,10 July 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Epic, sweeping film-making at it's very best
","The Fellowship of the RingWhen one begins to write one's sentiments regarding a movie such as Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the main problem isn't having difficulty finding things to remark upon - the main problem is knowing where to begin. The Fellowship of the Ring essentially redefined the term 'quality', in its extraordinary ability to vastly succeed the already unreasonably high expectations of audiences and die-hard fans of the novels everywhere. It becomes difficult to avoid bias by painting the film with outlandish and likely unreasonable praises, but I must confess I could go on for literally pages pointing out how blown away I still am by virtually every aspect of this movie, the first, and in my opinion, strongest as a film of the trilogy. So I'll try to keep it concise - Jackson has truly brought the novels to life in a fashion one could never have imaged short of actually seeing it for themselves. The sets and appearance of Middle Earth are among the greatest ever created, an impeccable blend of CGI, constructed sets, and the already breathtaking landscapes of beautiful New Zealand. The beautiful cinematography brings this all to light again, in the best sense of the word - seldom does a movie look so, simply put, beautiful. The costumes and appearances of the various creatures and inhabitants of Middle Earth are once again, mind-blowing - some of the best and most convincing computer generated images are on display in these movies. This is all punctuated by Howard Shore's simply gorgeous and incredibly moving Oscar winning score.Acting is also simply nothing less than astounding, with every cast member not only seeming torn straight out of the pages of the novels, born to play their role, but also turning out pretty much flawless performances around the board. There are standouts of course, especially Sir Ian McKellan's now career defining turn as the warm yet incredibly wise and powerful wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortenson's wonderful flawed yet noble hero Aragorn, Sean Bean's excellent and truly touching portrayal of the quintessential flawed male character Boromir, Elijah Wood as the good hearted lead character, the innocent hobbit Frodo Baggins, and Sean Aston as his faithful and loyal companion Samwise, and Christopher Lee as the corrupted and now evil wizard Saruman the White. Cate Blanchett is a huge scene-stealer, as the regal (and briefly chilling) elf queen Galadriel, while John Rhys-Davies is perfectly gruff and hilarious as cantankerous dwarf Gimli, and Liv Tyler is breathtakingly elegant as Arwen (and thankfully given more to do than simply stand around pining, as in the next two films). Then there is of course the absurdly underrated Andy Serkis' mind blowing portrayal of the creature Gollum. Though mainly seen in the next two films, Serkis already manages to make a powerful first impression with his 2 minutes or less of screen time. Again, it seems entirely fair to say the Lord of the Rings movies are among the greatest movies ever made, for their incredibly detailed attention to the details of Tolkien's novels, and their still surprising ability to exceed expectations in every possible way in film-making and storytelling terms. This is epic storytelling at its best - if you are among the very few who have yet to see these movies, strongly consider doing so - it will be well worth your while.-10/10",10,8,10,3 April 2006
Man of Steel," You Will Believe
","Superman is Jesus. This thematic subtext is hardly new. But Superman as a Jesus who only reluctantly accepts his mantle of saviour of humankind, and inwardly harbours a childish bitterness and resentment? A Superman who maliciously enjoys the secret thrill of being able to let loose and finally hit back, channeling decades of repression and bullying trauma into a succession of world-shattering punches, released with gleeful abandon? Much more Scorsese Jesus than Jesus Christ Superstar. This, as the inevitable comparison has it, is a far cry from the venerated days of Christopher Reeve. To say this is a Superman who speaks to this day and age would be retreading a cliché already ground into redundancy from overuse. The temptation to run rampant with clichés such as 'More 'Superman Begins' than 'Superman Returns'' is overwhelming. And, yet, such clichés are the stock that heroes are born of, and continually validated by. Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer are both certainly fearless in tapping into the essence and mythos of the character, navigating clichés of classicism and 'dark and gritty reboot' ethos with grace and tact. Indeed, to say this the first Superman film that fully, satisfyingly, explores not only the cultural function of Superman but plumbs the depths of Kal-El/Clark Kent himself would not be an overstatement. Man of Steel is, if nothing else, overwhelming. The film is a relentless sensory overload, a breathless symphony of dazzling special effects, staggering scope of destruction (The Avengers now takes second place in collateral construction damage), and brutal, kinetic and frequently airborne fight choreography. From the first minutes, boldly opening with Russell Crowe's Jor-El riding a space dragon amidst the explosions of the dying planet Krypton undergoing a military coup. Already, Man of Steel has delivered one of the best (albeit microcosmic) sci-fi films in years. And, by this point, there is more than another two hours to go.It scarcely slows down, only hitting the pause button to allow dual dads Crowe and Kevin Costner (both as good at frowning and grunting as ever) to deliver stern monologues ratcheting Kal/Clark between divine purpose and personal choice. It also scarcely quiets down, as Hans Zimmer's magnificent score continuously bludgeons the audience with horns, drums and strings enough to leave the most desensitized audience member gasping for breath. Stunning is the word at hand, as seldom before has watching a movie felt so much like a workout. This is far from a bad thing, but hardly a relaxing watch. Nor, as most reviews have taken great pains to express, is levity on the table. Gone is the frivolity of Gene Hackman's prancing Lex Luthor and the bumbling slapstick of Reeve's Kent. This is a Superman prone to gritting his teeth rather than flashing toothy grins. Again, this is not a bad thing. The 'Nolan influence' is overwhelming, as the film even echoes the non- linear flashback structure of his seminal Batman Begins. Equally, intentionally or not, the film alludes to countless offerings from rival company Marvel, from the 'enhanced senses overload' purloined from Daredevil to the palpable glee of experimenting with powers of Spider-Man to military banter reminiscent of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer to flying shots lifted directly from Iron Man. However, Man of Steel is far from a derivative mess. In lieu of jokiness is enough sentiment to flood Metropolis. Melodrama too, granted. It is interesting to notice the film's unabashed embracing of the character being appropriated as an American cultural icon (one jaw- dropping Freudian slip minimizes Superman 'acting in the world's interests' into 'acting in America's interests'). But it is hard not to be pounded into willful submission by the film's incessant pace and noise into full embracing of the deluge of big, loud sentiment and purpose. Man of Steel hits hard, but hits undeniably true. It will be quiet the challenge to un-see Henry Cavill as Superman, as with past examples of the role resulting in extreme-typecasting-turned-career-stunting (poor Brandon Routh). However, Cavill's sublime embodiment of one of the trickiest characters to sell demonstrates an actor of extreme talent rather than limited range. As much as Cavill owns every angsty grimace and serene smile, it is the gleeful abandon he shows when 'letting loose', whether flying around the planet at top speed or bludgeoning Kryptonian adversaries, that truly calcifies his humanity. Amy Adams does her considerable best with feisty reporter Lois Lane, but is still limited by underwritten characterization that leaves her inclusion often feeling like an afterthought. There is no doubt, too, that audiences will take some acclimatizing to Michael Shannon's screaming, spit-spewing performance (his 'I WILL FIND HIM!' scene, while fated to become almost as meme-worthy as Terrence Stamp's 'Kneel', is still a bit much), yet there is no doubt his unflinchingly resolute Zod is entirely right for the film, and a more than worthy adversary. Diane Lane's quiet performance, conversely, is a tremendous asset, providing much needed warmth and whimsy to the film as Clark's beloved 'Ma'. Man of Steel is not a perfect film. The pacing and exposition often stumble over themselves (how exactly does Crowe's space-ghost work exactly? Never mind), and, ironically, the moments of attempted, shoehorned-in humour are often the film's weakest (Lois' thoughts on first kisses proves an unintentionally comic non-sequitar). But, as Snyder and Goyer are careful to stress, Superman is not perfect either. And, like Superman, it is easy to get swept up in the overwhelming desire to invest in the iconicity of a hero, and forgive the inevitable shortcomings. You will believe a man can fly. You will believe a hero capable of unspeakable violence. And you will believe in him, and his movie, nonetheless. -9/10",9,1,5,26 June 2013
21," Just as predictable yet enjoyable as the game depicted
","Considering the risky pleasure generally associated with gambling and the seductive thrill of watching a heist or scam unfold, it should come as no surprise that 21, a film which combines the two aforementioned premises should excel at being enjoyable. And while the film may be very familiar ground to anyone with in any experience with Ocean's Eleven style crime capers, and the majority of the film's plot points verge on being almost laughably predictable, it is executed with enough exuberant flair to make it worthwhile in the midst of its formula. A slow start gives the necessary exposition as to how a thoroughly ethical young MIT student (Sturgess)'s desperate need for money to attend Harvard medical school leads him to join a team of mathematical geniuses trained in blackjack card counting who routinely rip off Las Vegas casinos during weekends between class. However, this opening proves overlong, overly predictable, and largely unnecessary, dragging far too much before plunging into the film's real fun as Sturgess and his team are engulfed by the seductive glamour of Vegas and the thrill of the huge monetary takes. Some judicious editing, clearing away such unnecessary subplots (such as a robotics competition with Sturgess' tiresomely stereotypical nerdy friends) could have resulted in a far more streamlined and faster paced film. Some viewers may take offence to the 'Hollywoodizing' of the MIT team, with team members of different ethnicity largely shoved to the background in favour of the typically gorgeous Caucasian leads, a disconcertingly common practice in modern day cinema. However, the flashy MTV style cinematography and editing ably capture the engrossing spectacle of Vegas, and once the film gets going, it would be difficult to deny the sheer enjoyment of being swept up in the heady rush of quick wealth and all of its hedonistic trappings.The film's quality cast add credulity to the frequently underwritten characters they portray. Jim Sturgess once again impresses as the ethical math prodigy slowly corrupted by a world of superficial glamour, his endearing charm putting an intriguing enough take on the 'troubled but well meaning hero' archetype. As one might expect, Kevin Spacey effortlessly steals the show as the charismatic but ruthless professor managing the MIT card counting team, and Spacey's easygoing yet commanding presence is a profound boost to the film. Kate Bosworth contributes a typically flat performance, but given her token 'inevitable love interest' role, she fails to detract much from the film's overall quality. Lawrence Fishburne adds class, much needed dramatic weight and moments of grim humour to his antagonistic burly head of casino security, gradually catching on to the MIT team's scamming.While the age old adage of 'style over substance' certainly holds true here, 21 may essentially epitomize the modern Hollywood crime caper film, but the formula hasn't quite run dry enough to overly detract from the enjoyment factor. The film's snappy visuals and strong casting are mostly enough to make up for a largely uninspired and frequently weak script. However, fans of similar works will not be disappointed, and for those willing to forgive the film's frequent delving into the wells of convention and accept entertainment over profundity, 21 should prove an ideal watch.-7/10",7,66,100,2 April 2008
The Revenant," Those who live in Glass houses
","The Bear Necessities. The Passion of the Leo. Or, (my personal favourite), Quaaludes: The Movie. I knew something was amiss when I caught myself drumming up doofus monikers for Alejandro González Iñárritu's gruelling frontier follow-up to his Oscar-winning Birdman, rather than being immersed in its sweeping, blistering journey. On paper, everything was in place for a rugged masterpiece. So, watching The Revenant, why was my disrespectful mind still fumbling for pic-in-ic basket puns instead of being mesmerized by poor 'Heyyyyy Lee-o'? Arguably, in the face of the unrepentant agony on screen, my mind overcompensated with silliness. It's a decent point. Sadly, 'point' is another word that consistently elbowed its way into my brain - as in, 'what's the?'. Like Werner Herzog's similarly Sissyphissean Fitzcarraldo, Iñárritu subjects his cast and crew to comparable suffering to the story's characters to feel the weight of real adversity. But Fitzcarraldo was governed by a gleaming beacon of a core idea meditating on the sacrifices warranted for art. The Revenant anchors itself on wilful doubt. And, like its craggy, icy terrain, it's hard to find solid footing therein. The Revenant is not a poor film. In fact, it teeters so close to masterpiece that its slew of creative decisions standing in the way make it all the more frustrating for having opened the the conversation of grandeur, rather than simply settling for pulpy survival epic. As a sensorial experience, Iñárritu's work here is astonishing, almost unprecedented. Indeed, there's an argument to be made for Canada being the most worthwhile 'Best Actor' candidate here, as, on several levels, it's nature that's really the star of the show. Superstar-cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's famous use of only natural lighting is astonishingly evocative. A sumptuous barrage of whirling snow squalls and rivers serenely dribbling amidst sprawling tree trunks, Lubezki delivers - hyperbole-free - some of the most exquisitely expressive wildlife panoramas ever captured on film here. Pair the stunning visuals with Ryûichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto's sparse, agonizingly moving musical score, and we're reminded that 'take your breath away' is more than an expression. But Iñárritu loves his dichotomies, and with such beauty inevitably comes suffering. And here's where the 'but' comes in. Iñárritu strives for rugged verisimilitude at all costs - dialogue is naturalistic, muddy, and almost nonexistent; performances are beleaguered yet unshowy, each actor ground down to the nub, exposing the shards of truth therein. However, the execution is uneasily disjunctive with Iñárritu's natural flamboyance as a filmmaker. Fishing for connective tissue, Iñárritu sprinkles in inane, surrealistic dream sequences/flashbacks of Glass' ethereal First Nations wife. This sort of preening pretentiousness fit the smarmy absurdity of Birdman perfectly, but it's cloying and distracting here, and the pacing lurches as consequence. As such, many of the film's livelier sequences - a visually jaw-dropping assault on the frontiersmen by a First Nations tribe, fraught with kinetically swooshing bloodshed, is the most memorable - juxtapose their grit and hyper-violence with balletic cameras and concussive sound editing. This tension lends the scene a curiously detached, almost adolescent playfulness, which sabotages its visceral integrity. Several scenes of Glass' ruthless survival tactics play for unintended laughs - I dare you to watch him disembowel a horse and sleep in its carcass without the word 'Tauntaun' gallivanting through your mind. The same goes for the film's definitive setpiece: Glass' grisly mauling by bear. The duelling tensions of ferocious realism and ostentatious showiness never quite click, leaving the viewer in sensory overload between DiCaprio's squeals of pain and the noxiously claustrophobic camera-work and (thankfully) CGI bear. I should have felt ill from the scene's graphic intimacy. Instead, my brain incessantly chanted 'BEAR FIGHT', a-la Anchorman, as I waited for the noise to end. This brings us to DiCaprio. He's a stupendous actor, investing 300% in agonizing, method torment here. In fact, the shoot is so tangibly harsh, it's hard to distinguish DiCaprio's acting from simply reacting to the abominable circumstances he is thrust into. Sadly, Iñárritu's insistence on broad characterization - Glass as a force of nature - does DiCaprio no favours. We are given no character backstory, almost no dialogue, no character arc, and virtually no means of personal connection to Glass apart from his affective suffering, and DiCaprio's star appeal. While The Martian continually fought to build character and connection throughout solitude, DiCaprio's work increasingly feels less like a performance and more an episode of Man vs. Wild (and even Grylls peppers humour and humanity throughout) - an entirely physical journey of abject asking audiences to spend two and a half hours with a man they know virtually nothing of apart from his grunts and winces. It's a tragic waste.Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson do their best to amend this opacity. They're superbly, furiously emotive, both tenaciously craving moral order amidst the madness of the woods. It's a shame Iñárritu doesn't focus more on their relationship than Glass. It's more of a shame that marble-mouthed Hardy's speech (a SPEECH! So many words! I missed them so!) - 'God is a squirrel, and I ate that motherf*cking squirrel'?! - is so indecipherable; the film could ravenously use more of its delicious deliriousness. Most disappointing is, stirring visual poetry aside, how thematically empty The Revenant's antiquated, macho parable of survival and vengeance feels. Flourishes fish for mythology- subverting subtext - a far more interesting subplot involving a First Nations band searching for an abducted girl, and the slippery politics of bartering with French Canadian trappers - but are unceremoniously jettisoned for more long takes of Glass groaning. Gorgeous or not, it's hard not to call Iñárritu's bluff, and assume he set out in the woods to find meaning in the suffering of Hugh Glass, only to conclude, panting in the snow, as robbed of closure as his hero. But, like Glass, Iñárritu finds as much beauty in his journey as irresolution in his destination. And that is comforting in itself.-7/10",7,0,1,14 January 2016
Split," Bananas
","It's tempting to read the title of director M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller as a cruelly reflexive play on the schism of his infamous filmmaking career: part I (the Early Days, where he was heralded as one of the industry's most visionary living directors), and part II (a slew of exponential misfires so inexplicably ill-advised no one, most likely including Shyamalan himself, quite knew what was Happening). Sadly, although Split does recall Shyamalan's early glory days (literally - to an almost inexcusably tacky fashion), there are mere hints of promise and potential here, skulking like phantoms amongst a film too mired in silliness and indecisive murk to leave too much of a mark. This isn't to say Split is a total write-off - there are trashy thrills to be had, and pitted against the bulk of Shyamalan's last decade of work, it's practically Citizen Kane. Still, it bears the melancholy mark of a fallen maverick who hasn't so much reclaimed his mojo as located the postal code it relocated to. If anything, Shyamalan is wise to play it safe, steering clear of sci-fi, fantasy, and airbenders with a taut tale of abduction and frayed psychology that almost amorously borrows from Hitchcock's Psycho. Still, in spite of this textbook familiarity, Shyamalan still(!) somehow manages a work as loopy and hard to navigate as any of his more labyrinthine psychodramas. On the surface, he's conjured a setting rife for a satisfyingly campy b-thriller a-la Sam Raimi, replete with jittery, claustrophobic camera-work, an appropriately creaky, ominous soundtrack by West Dylan Thordson, and contrived enough reasons to strip his captive coeds to make Sharknado roll its eyes. And, for the sequences when Split commits to pure, primal 'what's around that corner' breathlessness, like a slightly sillier but equally chilling bunker buddy of last year's 10 Cloverfield Lane, it is effective as hell, and pure popcorn fun. But, rather than committing to the amiable wink and nod, Shyamalan clouds his film with an uneasily out-of-place streak of (yawn) seriousness. To say the least, it sits uneasily with a wagon-load of aped genre tropes - a grainy aesthetic that hearkens back to the Doom era of action horror, hazy mental health fretting, Madonna/whore obsessions, clumsy flashbacks to our tortured protagonist's tortured childhood torturedly; even a healthy helping of cringe-worthy self- harm hero-worshipping? - that would've felt stale in a straight-to-DVD late night special from the early 2000s. The film's lugubrious editing doesn't help, making McAvoy's mysterious madman feel as sluggish as he is indecipherable. And if that wasn't enough, Shyamalan sifts in a shroud of self-important faux-mythology (wide-eyed characters whisper mental health bunk as if reciting sacred texts, conflating mental health disorders with superpowers in a way that is, amazingly, both cloyingly infantilizing and alienating as hell) that would be borderline offensive if it wasn't such silly claptrap. Then, for those masochistic viewers still desperately trying to wrangle the film into being worth it, try our arch-foe(s)' motivation on for size: McAvoy's multiple personalities (or at least some of them ) kidnap high school girls something- something confused sexuality something-something abused as a child blah blah worshipping superpowered Satanic death cult to punish them for not having suffered enough? Hel-LO-O! They're in high school! Methinks it's you who doesn't know the meaning of the word suffer, Mr. 'Beast.' Go back to pining over a rose. Maybe sing about it. And the invariable Shyamalan 'twist?' Only that nothing, not even standalone passion projects made by former art-house darlings, is safe from the encroaching, wearing mega-blockbuster trend towards interconnected cinematic 'universes.' Yes - our entire movie outing here exists for the sake of shoehorning in an almost staggeringly self-indulgent finale linking the film to Shyamalan's Unbreakable - a modest hit from 17 years ago(!) that a minimal percentage of viewers might remember offhand sans google - just so he can chase the superhero bandwagon like Tobey Maguire pitifully wheezing after his departing bus in Spider-Man? Nah. No thank you indeed. Good day to you, sir. The film's main selling, of course, is showcasing James McAvoy's range, with the kind of role actors fight tooth and nail to show off with. Thankfully, he's fairly excellent, and transitions so seamlessly between flamboyant personalities (including some pretending to be others... oooh!) with subtle shifts of face and posture. It's almost a shame that he has to contort to the dopey 'superpower' conceits of Shyamalan's script, as he's easily fascinating and scary enough on his own without crawling on the ceiling like a bargain basement Underworld counterfeit. Apart from the central novelty of McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy gives an impressively enigmatic, haunted performance as our leading teen, plagued by plenty of inner demons pre-abduction (though, again, she's better off emoting on her own right, rather than having her performance hand- held by irksome, unnecessary PTSD flashbacks). Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula are both solidly credible, in spite of the 'panting cheerleader' stereotypes they're saddled with, while Betty Buckley works her darnedest to ground her breathy exposition-dolling plot devise of a therapist with wry sharpness and astute charisma. The thing is, you want to like Split. You can practically smell the sweat on Shyamalan trying to rekindle his rep, and scorning poor McAvoy, practically bleeding energy onto the screen, feels like kicking a (psychopathic) puppy. And hey - if you're in the market for a silly, braindead little thriller full of nerves and amiable nonsense, Split will pass the time with a couple of jumps, shivers, and chuckles, both intentional and not. But as a purported comeback from the mind behind The Sixth Sense, and with another Unbreakable sequel that next to nobody will be waiting eagerly for still in the pipeline? Let's just say that none of us, least of all Night, are now strangers to the Beast's suffering litmus test of worthiness. -6.5/10",6,2,4,5 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Borecruxes
","'These are daaaaaark times-uh', Bill Nighy Christopher Walkens in his terse opening monologue, and there's no denying that. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows heralded many things: the finale to a cinematic franchise generations had grown up alongside, the rip-roaring, no-holds-barred finale of a world of magic plunged into chaos. But, more than all that, it was a grim harbinger for things to come. Yes, this was the first mega-franchise entry to bear the suffix 'Part I', issuing in a dawn of unforgivably segmented final instalment money grabs from Twilight, The Hunger Games, and, **shudder** The Hobbit. Yes, The Deathly Hallows truly was the beginning of the end.Okay - so splitting Rowling's 759 page epic had its advantages. Rather than the usual frenzied rush and jettisoning of subplots causing fans to howl worse than Fenrir Greyback, here, returning director David Yates could take his time, allow his film to breathe, and tease out the full drama and poignancy in events rather than blitzing past them. at least that must have been how he pitched the film to Warner Bros. The polite truth is, Deathly Hallows Part I is a bit of a grim, dull, visually murky thankless mess, with only occasional sparks of the Potter magic we know and love. Mostly, it's fated to be remembered as 'the one people mostly fast-forward through in Harry Potter-a-thons'.Yates' third time in the Headmaster's seat, having conjured entries both stellar (Part V) and sour (Part VI), ultimately illustrates his greatest strengths and weaknesses as a franchise director. He's inspired at allowing small, intimate emotional moments to resonate, drawing power and poignancy from understated beats like Harry bidding farewell to his old cupboard under the stairs at Privet Drive or wandering through the room of his deceased godfather. He's also prone to balancing his propensity for solemn melodrama with bursts of the daftest humour at the least likely of times (here, fun with Polyjuice potion sees Daniel Radcliffe struggling in a bra, and *literal* toilet humour). And he can throw down with a hell of a action sequence, as his cracking wizard duels evidence, particularly an opening aerial battle against the forces of Voldemort - too short, but still liable to leave viewers gasping for breath. His Potters, love or hate them, are by far the most fundamentally cinematic of the bunch.But, with the good comes a heck of a lot of bad here. Amidst ruthlessly paring down Rowling's words to a palatable cinematic length, Yates has a worrisome propensity to forget to direct his background actors, making too many of Rowling's plentiful '_____'s dead!' announcements in ensemble scenes land with almost comically unresponsive thuds, and the frequency of flat (or should I say Stupefied) acting stripping the majority of the narrative of any real sense of urgency. But even more inexcusable is the film's thunderously clumsy editing, lumbering from plot point to plot point stitched together with dolefully lazy exposition like a full-body- bound troll, rushing through or outright excluding key moments (no Lupin confrontation? No Dursleys farewell? Meanwhile, the perfectly cast Bill Nighy is criminally wasted as Minister Scrimgeour by stripping all political tension from his cameo), while lingering exhaustively on the more stagnant moments of Rowling's text. Composer Alexandre Desplat's score is virtually nonexistent, with most scenes, regardless of the emotion, playing out in cumbersomely uncomfortable silence. And let us not forget our tour of stately British countrysides, hosted by The Lord of the Locket exacerbating the worst surly hormones our leads have to offer (and Yates sneaking in a brewing love triangle is enough to make even the most Muggle of viewers feel sick). If Yates' objective was to convey the soul-rotting boredom, frustration, and despair flecking the first half of Rowling's final novel, he outdoes himself, though it's dubious how much is intentional.Still: magic is might, and the few moments the film comes alive do wonders. An expedition into the Ministry of Magic is rife with tension and political snark (including a welcome return of Imelda Staunton's sublimely loathsome Umbridge) and a jaunt to Godric's Hollow yields pristine Gothic horror, while the shadow puppet interlude detailing the legend of the Deathly Hallows is visually dazzling fun. Upping the FX ante helps bring house elves Dobby and Kreacher to life in a far less eerie fashion (essential, as Dobby's climactic death is the film's only real emotional sucker punch), while Yates certainly isn't afraid to push the darkness to the next level. Both Ralph Fiennes's preening Voldemort and Helena Bonham Carter's delightfully demented Bellatrix get grisly torture scenes, while Emma Watson nearly steals the show, fighting back tears as she erases her parents memories. Didn't expect that when Robbie Coltrane first croaked 'Yer a wizard, 'Arry', didja?Radcliffe, while intrinsically lovable, plays Harry as too bruised and stunned to connect much to here, leaving most of the emotional heavy lifting to Watson and Rupert Grint, who hugely comes into his own here with his most impressively mature, deft performance to date beyond his customary irrepressible goofy humour. The usual supporting players delight with their fleeting bits - Brendan Gleeson's bombastic Mad-Eye Moody is hysterically grumpy as always, and the glorious James & Oliver Phelps and Evanna Lynch bring as many laughs as ever as Fred, George, and Luna, even if Rhys Ifans is nowhere near weird enough to make a mark as Xenophilius Lovegood.Even with such a dour, unrewarding plot so scant on moments of infectious, joyful magic, Deathly Hallows I still brings the inescapable charm of a Potter film, though its carelessness with pacing and editing strand it at the bottom of the cauldron. If anything, double-billing parts VII and VIII does set up the final outing as the triumphant blowout it should be, though it wouldn't take much to raise the spirits from the mucky affair that is its predecessor.-6/10",6,3,4,14 March 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Bittersweet road comedy with genuine heart
","Little Miss SunshineI must confess, what ultimately drew me to this smaller, indie black comedy was the prospect of seeing Steve Carell, one of my very favourite actors since his turn as brain dead weatherman Brick Tamland in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, play a more serious role as a gay suicidal professor. The concept sounded too great - it could either be a more serious, affecting role, or be twisted on its head for a more morbid comedic role. Well as for Carell's character, in the end he manages a good amount of both, and in fact the same could be said for the entire movie. For although I had come to see a single performance, in the end I discovered a wonderful, moving comedy with smears of poignant drama and a real heart and soul to it. The story follows an incredibly dysfunctional, yet still lovable family, including the incredibly success oriented yet unemployed and unspectacular motivational speaker dad, (Greg Kinnear) the stressed out yet constantly trying to be there for her family mom, (Toni Collette) her brother, a recently fired prestigious university professor just out of the hospital after attempting to kill himself, (Steve Carell) the constantly angry grandfather who tries to relieve his cynicism by buying porn and snorting heroin, (Alan Arkin) the mute by choice world weary adolescent son, (Paul Dano) and finally adorable seven year old daughter Olive (Abigale Breslin) who only dreams of winning a beauty pageant. The drifting apart and seemingly more incompatible family is forced to band together for a road trip when it appears Olive's dream has finally been realised, and she is given the chance to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. First time screenwriter Michael Arndt must be given tremendous credit for such a masterful piece of work, as should co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris for bringing such a wonderful piece of writing to life. The filmmakers have succeeded wonderfully in creating a myriad of fresh and interesting characters, noticeably flawed yet ultimately lovable despite their foibles. The tone of the movie is also unique, balancing the fine line between black comedy and sweet but not syrupy film boasting the true values of family and success. Somehow Little Miss Sunshine gets away with this obscure crossing of genres while creating a movie that will have viewers laughing hysterically and close to tears in turn. The pitch perfect cast is what makes the movie really succeed, with the adorable Breslin capturing every viewer's heart as little Olive but delivering a surprisingly affecting performance as well, outshining almost all fellow child actors in this day and age. Greg Kinnear is also wonderful as the macho father who promotes the values of winning above all else, despite the fact it is a quality he himself sorely lacks in his life. Toni Collette is terrific as the harried mother, trying to hold keep her eccentric family together. Paul Dano is great and often hilarious as their silent son, easily holding his own with his much older co-stars despite the fact that he has no dialogue for almost the entire duration of the film. But my two favourite performances out of a cast chock full of masterful ones are Alan Arkin as the sarcastic grandfather who still believes in 'living it up' and Steve Carell, who blends a poignant, affecting sympathetic dramatic performance with his more usual light hearted humorous side in a truly masterful piece of acting. I wouldn't be at all surprised, and in fact quite happy, if Carell ended up with a Golden Globe or Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. All in all, Little Miss Sunshine may be bittersweet, and expect to tear up many a time, but the laughs outweigh the sadness in this bittersweet yet lovable comedy about the true meaning of family and success in one's life, not to mention taking a much needed shot at the frightening states of children's beauty pageants, contrasting the refreshingly normal Olive with her disturbingly fake looking fellow contestants. Little Miss Sunshine is one of the most unique and very well made films of this year, for those in search of a laugh, albeit a thoughtful one, this one is definitely worth a watch.-8/10",8,1,4,10 September 2006
North by Northwest," 'What does the 'O' stand for?' 'Nothing.'
","By 1959, Alfred Hitchcock's star as a director had been monumentally starting to rise, propelling him past the point of respectable craftsman or even serious artist, to the point of recognition as an industry celebrity. However, contrary to the stereotype of the artist resisting the trappings of celebrity, this star image was one Hitchcock voluntarily, even consciously bought into, playing up his larger than life image of the 'master of suspense', particularly in his show, 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents', complete with his own recognizable theme song. As such, it would appear that the collection of tropes, whether thematic trends, technical similarities or recurring narrative and character types now characterized as a 'Hitchcock film' were hardly accidental, a theory for which North by Northwest proves a perfect example. Largely recognized as one of Hitchcock's most fun and least serious outings, North by Northwest can be retrospectively seen as an attempt by Hitchcock to make, in many ways, the definitive 'Alfred Hitchcock' film, intentionally encapsulating and often playing up many of the defining elements of his past films into a single, hugely enjoyable narrative. Much of what makes the film so downright fun is its synthesis between the straightforward and the cheekily tongue-in-cheek. While, if functioning as a standalone narrative, the film could easily accomplish its task of delivering a breathless, enthralling spy thriller and mystery, the real fun is to be found in recognizing how consciously and unashamedly cinematic the whole ordeal is. The plot appears tailored to intentionally deliver the maximum quantity of thrills, laughs, edginess (notice the sensors being tested in the uncommonly explicit exchange of sexual dialogue between Grant and Marie Saint on the train) suspense and memorable set pieces (especially one involving a crop duster which viewers just may have heard of), demonstrating Hitchcock's effortless command of the cinematic form and potential to warp it towards any given motivation. As such, the entire film effectively functions as its own 'MacGuffin', in the end, signifying, like the 'O' in Thornhill's name, 'nothing' - a film existing just for the sake of being a film, for showing how masterfully crafted, carefully constructed and downright entertaining cinema can be. Even the film's title was allegedly chosen as a place holder, simply because it sounded catchy, and finally kept since no one could think of a better one, with no deeper significance. This is not to say that no narrative or thematic complexity can be read within the film, but rather than it intertwines itself with this notion of willfully cultivated escapism. The most pervasive theme is the self-reflexive notion of construction - just as the plot is consciously constructed with the intent of epitomizing the heroic and spy myths, as well as Hitchcock's ever familiar 'wrong man' theme (his inclusion of Thornhill's mother, who fulfils virtually no function within the plot can also be seen as a dig at his own recurring domineering mother figures within his body of work), his film continually engages with notions of characters constructing identities and, in turn, having new identities forged for them. As Grant's Thornhill remarks, he is continually being thrust into a series of performances or roles, some deliberate, most enforced unwillingly upon him, and is only ever taken seriously by other characters in the narrative when he buys into playing up such imposed performances. However, it is also intriguing to note the series of facades and constructed identities other characters within the film assume, with many far less apparent than it would initially seem, demonstrating webs of construction within construction which ultimately add far more nuance and poignant thematic issues to the film than it is commonly given credit for. However, the film also unquestionably functions as an independent narrative, and a stunningly constructed one, both technically and emotionally. While setpieces such as the crop duster sequence and the finale on Mount Rushmore may be the ones to (justifiably) work their way into the collective unconscious, it would take close attention paid to the smaller, less obtrusive moments in the film (Thornhill's subtle manipulation of his being continually thrust into the spotlight to save himself, the effortless, rapid fire and often hilariously self-aware nature of the vibrant script) which truly demonstrate Hitchcock's impeccable command of cinematography, editing, pacing and sound (notice the pitch- perfect alternating use of utter silence or Bernard Herrmann's timeless, triumphant musical score). Willfully superficial or not, the film truly demonstrates the power of the cinematic form to arouse sensation and genuine emotional response in the viewer, delivering a peerlessly enjoyable hybrid of thrills and humour.Of course, as Hitchcock realized, none but Cary Grant (the master of his own constructed star persona) could have properly essayed the role of Roger 'O' Thornhill, as Grant's unquenchable charisma, astute comic timing and genuine presence keep the viewer firmly rooting for Thornhill through adversity after adversity, making each normally unbelievable character trait or ambitious line of dialogue somehow ring with endearing, charming credibility. Eva Marie Saint makes for the definitively ambiguous femme fatale figure, excelling both at devious betrayal and genuine, raw emotion, making the chemistry between the two stars exquisitely believable and crackling with truly dynamic energy. The similarly self-reflexive casting of James Mason as the antagonist (characters in Hitchcock's earlier Rope had discussed how Mason would make an excellent villain) proves entirely justified, as his sneering, oily, perpetually composed Philip Vandamm makes for a deliciously deplorable yet oddly charming foe to boo and hiss at. Finally, character actor Martin Landau deserves considerable plaudits for redeeming the role of the evil henchmen to a genuinely intriguing, confusing and viscerally frightening figure, and Jessie Royce Landis is a welcomely comical presence as Thornhill's scathing, society woman mother. Whether taken as self-reflexive, satirical dig at his own stereotypes or an impeccably thrilling romp on its own right, Hitchcock's North by Northwest unquestionably holds up as a timeless classic of cinema, and essential viewing for all who have yet to experience it. -10/10",10,1,4,20 November 2009
American Beauty," Beauty in the least likely of places
","To start this review, it would seem potent to almost recommend that you don't read it, unless you have already seen the film. For full effect, despite the tales of of praise and greatness the film has attracted, it's still far more rewarding to enter the experience with a relatively open mind - to simply sit back, and let the story, characters and each little intricacy wash over you, making your own assessments. Fear not - you will not be disappointed. At first glance, American Beauty might appear to be just another one of those 'realistic and touching portrait of an average family' films which continually seem to coax far more awards out of the Academy than they are worth. No. Stop that train of thought right there. Because American Beauty may be a portrait of a family, yes, but it keeps up no pretenses of normalcy - rather how 'normalcy' is a quality only represented through elaborate fronts to hide how excessively abnormal most families are, and how, quite frankly, it makes them far more interesting and compelling. The film's tagline '...look closer' for once manages to overcome the pretentious glitz of most promotional material, and actually serves as a suggestion when viewing the film. At first, the characters may seem mere archetypes, simply passed off as 'messed up' or 'weird', but honestly, such a judgement can never truthfully be made until this simply masterful portrayal has reached its conclusion, as new lights are shone on this incredibly elaborate and painfully genuine web of characters. Each character in the film, without exception, appears noticeably flawed, yes, but out of their flaws, real people emerge, complete with the depth and personal intricacies which movies are so seldom able to capture. Never once does the film ring of anything except absolute truth - these are real people we are watching here, and that is what makes them so compelling, unsavoury qualities and all. Director Sam Mendes (winner of the best director Oscar) kick started his now stellar career with this one of a kind masterpiece. Working with screenwriter Alan Ball (who also won an Oscar), who allegedly wrote the script as a play first (the influence shows throughout) Mendes is able to show remarkable depth, and rather than passing judgement on any of the players, simply presents them as they are, making stereotyping and assumptions impossible. But apart from the remarkable truth Mendes is able to retain from his actors, he also demonstrates a wonderfully artistic touch, and an almost unparalleled flair for innovative cinematography, which justifiably also took home an Academy Award. The recurring motive of roses is simply unforgettable, and although it may seem bizarre at first, there is no denying the unquestionable beauty - much like the rest of the film, in effect. Perhaps the one of the best and most truthful ensemble casts to grace the screen in ages, we never once see actors on-screen but merely the characters they inhabit so completely. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career, perfectly essaying every inch of Lester Burnham, and turning what might have been passed off as a typical mid-life crisis into something extraordinarily vivid, his usual charisma glinting between nearly closed eyes. It's unlikely that halfway through the film a single viewer will have not had the urge to strangle Annette Benning's Carolyn Burnham, which is a testament to how well she inhabited the role of the superficial, possessive wife. Yet by the end of the film, once again, judgement is reserved as she, as well as the rest of the characters, instigates a complete change in our opinions - the film culminates with no real villains, Carolyn included. Thora Birch gives a subdued yet charismatic performance as the family's troubled daughter, and Wes Bently is simply superb as the offbeat next-door neighbour, with a twisted yet genuine appreciation for beauty. Mena Suvari of American Pie fame is a noteworthy presence as the young girl who attracts Lester's attention, and Chris Cooper truly shines, there is no better word for it, as the painfully uptight and traditional military father of Wes Bently's character. All in all, American Beauty is one of the strongest character studies to grace the screen in recent memory, and arguably in film history, deserving every Oscar and award it achieved. Still, the enormous amounts of praise the movie has attracted aside, it's still surprising how affecting the movie actually is, and how incessantly it sticks with you, days, weeks, months after its initial viewing. Safe to say, this is one for the ages, and if you have yet to experience American Beauty - don't be afraid to. It may appear uninteresting and stereotypical, but upon closer inspection... beauty can be found in the most unexpected places.-10/10",10,1,2,20 January 2007
Wanted," Flashy visuals but flimsy script ultimately leave one wanting
","The steep competition in the realm of summer action romps more often than not creates the necessity for any new efforts to make an instant attempt to stand out as something new and innovative while still conforming to the tried and true conventions making such films so shamelessly enjoyable. One would be hard pressed to find a more vivid example than Wanted, appearing almost gimmicky in its flaunting of its standout selling points (bullet bending! corporate satire! Morgan Freeman AND Angelina Jolie!) crafting the image of one of the summer's most fresh bouts of carnage. And while Wanted does not disappoint on the exhilaration front, it falls considerably short of the astonishing action epic it seemingly wants to be. Despite being marketed as a fresh foray into the world of action mayhem, Wanted takes very direct influences from numerous sources, making many of its supposed innovations seem worn out and overly familiar. Apart from director Timur Bekmambetov's similarly hyperkinetic Nightwatch series, the film plunders from works as diverse as Fight Club's satirical critique of the soulless corporate world, complete with a nihilistic Norton style voice-over, to The Matrix's immersion into a new world (Jolie and Freeman's characters scream parallels to Trinity and Morpheus) and hyper-stylized, adrenaline pumping action sequences. However, where the winning combination should have clicked and resulted in one of the year's most flat out exhilarating action thrillers, instead it fizzles, its unoriginal solemnity coming across as almost pretentious and far in intent from the big, loud and very silly action movie its gleefully over the top action and laughably stilted script make it fated to remain. The main criticism of Wanted lies in its excesses: while all the elements on display appeared favourable, all are pushed too far over the top, as if attempting to up the ante on all similar action films while descending disappointingly into mediocrity as a result. The screenplay delves into a slew of enormously familiar situations as if attempting to identify and exemplify every existing action movie cliché, from the initial training montages to the 'why do we kill' assassin soul searching to double crosses, ethical responsibility, parental fixation and countless others. But where this peppering of familiarity could have made for a bombastically enjoyable time, the film is treated with such hushed reverence and solemnity that all the normally excusable cliché and lapses in credibility become all the more glaringly frustrating. What Wanted sorely lacks is the sense of light-hearted fun which would help its selling point of eye-popping action sequences fly instead of coming across as pent up and contrived. Plot frustrations aside, there can remain no doubt that Wanted's primary selling point remained the gleefully overblown shootouts, chases and bone crunching fights, and here the film flexes its cinematic muscles more confidently, providing many of the more memorable action setpieces in recent cinema (the car chases and final shootout are highlights). From the first moments of the initial shootout it becomes clear that not only has realism left the building, but taken a running dash through the top floor windows of it, foreshadowing the film's tendency to careen over the top in almost every possible fashion, to thrilling but often chaotically overwhelming effect. However, even those normally sated by flashy gunplay and lots of it may find themselves frowning in disbelief at many of the film's more ambiguous creative choices. The recurring theme of the emasculated man 'finding himself' through violence veers into uncertain ethical territory even for an unabashed action film, and the numerous staggering gaps in logic (the exploding rats were just too much), gargantuan plot holes and underdeveloped concepts (a bit of exposition on the assassin cult's mystical abilities, especially the much hyped 'curving bullets' would have done wonders) strain credibility several shades too far, even where next to none was expected in the first place. All the attitude on display makes the film appear to be trying slightly too hard to be edgy and rebellious, but its lack of originality or confident script make it seem more petulant than daring. The genius unorthodox casting of James McAvoy proves the spark of life which keeps the film afloat, his substantial charisma, perfect comic delivery and entirely credible shift from timid corporate drone to hardboiled action hero making for a supremely engaging lead. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the absurdly capable supporting cast who are almost entirely wasted in paper thin archetypes, their mere presences substituting for credible characters or performances. Nowhere is this more clear than in the case of Angelina Jolie, given almost nothing to do but near wordlessly discharge a series of firearms or flaunt her tattooed backside when called upon, with nothing more complicated to work with. Morgan Freeman is similarly firmly on autopilot in the 'dignified mentor' role he could essay in his sleep, and while a couple of unexpected character moments prove amusing, ultimately his presence is nowhere near as much of a boon as it should be. Terrence Stamp shows potential as a grave ammunition manufacturer with a mysterious backstory, but his character is critically deprived of screen time, giving him little chance to contribute anything in the way of performance. Such is also the case for Thomas Kretschmann, a strong presence as a vague antagonist figure, but given so little to do his talents are almost entirely wasted.While Wanted may frequently dazzle, its flashy visuals and thrilling action cannot mask the ultimate shoddiness underneath, the senseless fun of the action sequences being often dampened by the implausibly imbalanced storyline and downright poor script. While those in search of lots of bullets flying about and little else in the way of complexity may find themselves suitably entertained, considering the competition in the action film market and the vast potential the film had to offer, Wanted ultimately leaves one wanting. -6/10",6,23,47,8 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Hasta la Vista, doubters!
","Terminator 2The original Terminator, back in 1984, proved to be one of the best received movies of the decade, setting new standards for action films, and creating a defining role for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now, T2: Judgement Day proves to be one of the few sequels ever made which actually surpass the original in quality, bringing back all the successful elements which defined the first film, and re- creating them to a greater extent here. Director James Cameron proves to be one of the wisest directors around, as he takes what could have been a terrible gratuitous action movie, and turns it into one of the defining movies of the genre. The plot is paper thin: a killer robot from the future (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) who will grow up to be the leader of the resistance against the robot armies in the future wars against the robots. However, a different, more advanced model of Terminator (Robert Patrick) is also sent back with the intention of killing John Connor. Meanwhile, John's mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) escapes from the insane asylum she has been kept in, and gets tangled up in the mayhem.It's probably one of the simplest plots in film history, in fact, I summed it up to a friend of mine as 'Arnie is the good robot. The other one is bad. The bad robot wants to kill the kid, Arnie wants to protect him.' But the execution of this simple story has such an infectious sense of fun that the viewer can't help but love every moment of it. It's one of the few action movies one doesn't have to regard as a guilty pleasure, because it's regarded as such a classic. And after viewing it, it's no wonder why T2 has been widely proclaimed: 'The greatest action movie of all time!'Admirably, Cameron seems to know not to take himself too seriously, as shown with the opening sequence, as a nude Arnold takes out a whole bar full of bikers with the announcement 'I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle'. After claiming said clothes, he promptly snatches a pair of sunglasses and a shotgun from the astonished bartender, and is on his way, all of this accompanied by the song 'Bad to the Bone'. It really helps the film that it never takes itself too seriously, as it adds to the enjoyment factor, without any heavy life lessons being thrust at the audience. Cameron also incorporates numerous iconic shots, such as the Terminator stepping on a fallen rose, placing on its sunglasses for the first time, and the robot crushing the human skull at the beginning. The Special Effects would be considered mind-blowing if used for a current day movie, but considering the movie was made back in 1991, they should be considered nothing less than astonishing. All the effects around the T-1000's morphing properties are incredibly well done and 'real' looking - a remarkable technical achievement, which deservedly bagged the 'Best Visual Effects' Oscar. T2 also won technical Oscars for Sound Editing, Makeup and Best Sound. It's not every action movie that manages to win four Oscars - another reason the movie deserves its iconic status. But not all aspects of T2 are classic standard. As a whole, the acting leaves much to be desired - especially in the cases of Linda Hamilton and newcomer Edward Furlong. Neither give a particularly bad performance, but they each have so many annoying mannerisms, (Furlong's voice cracking adolescent screech and frustratingly blatant 80's haircut being the worst) that in many cases the viewer finds themselves wishing that the T-1000 would simply hurry up and kill them both. However, it's hard to go wrong with Arnold reprising his career defining role, and it becomes very clear that there was no better man alive to play a robot. (pause for comedic effect to set in. No? Alright then...) Schwarzenegger may probably have the least range out of any actor in Hollywood, but this was the role he was born to play, and every second he is offscreen, we desperately wish he was on screen again. Robert Patrick also plays a great villain as the shape-shifting T-1000. Though most of his part is dominated by special effects, Patrick still comes off as very menacing and dangerous - the perfect villain to counterbalance the equally stoic Arnie.So it's really no wonder T2 is considered the definitive action movie: the action sequences are superb, the special effects are remarkable, even for today, and there's this infectious sense of fun that allows the audience to overlook some of the movies shortcomings, most notably in the acting department. But all in all, T2 is a highly enjoyable and very strongly made film. Take it for what it is, and you should be suitably entertained. Which is all the movie really set out to do, so it can be considered nothing less than a rousing success. To all doubters of the movie's quality. I have only one thing to say: 'Hasta la Vista!'-9/10",9,4,6,15 October 2005
Van Helsing," This was Somers' fault
","It was obvious from the start that Van Helsing was never going to be Oscar material, but it was Stephen Somers' overconfidence in himself that caused it to tank.Let's face it: Somers is no writer. After the mummy series, he has proved himself to be an inadequate director, (although I was quite disappointed with his attempt at directing Van Helsing) and talented enough at dealing with CGI, but when he tries to put pen to paper he just ends up hurting himself, and all others concerned. The script for Van Helsing was abominable - there were only a few lines in the entire movie that I considered well written, and they were all given to Carl. I wish some directors would just stick to what they're good at, which is directing, as opposed to trying to write as well - there are many skilled screenwriters out there, why try to put them out of a job?Also, the editors seem to have fallen asleep at the wheel of this one, and the result is a head on collision. There is no sense of continuity at all in Van Helsing: it goes from having the mood of a tense action thriller to having the mood of a campy comedy. Nothing really seemed to fit together, as if they tore fragments from three different movies, mashed them together, stamped a title on it and shipped it to the theaters. I would love to know if production was rushed on this film, or if they had to move up the release date, because there are so many things that should have been changed that look like they were left in because there was no time to change them.For example, the character of Frankenstein's monster was ridiculously portrayed, with a leg squirting out steam, and the top half of his head falling off to expose his glowing, sparking blue brain. The creature is barely able to walk, and yet he swings crazily on a rope from building to building. He howls out his lines like an opera singer, which I found quite funny when I looked up Shuler Hensley who played him, and found out that he is, in fact, a singer. Was this an intentional joke? I also found it amusing that Van Helsing, a supposedly serious 'monster hunter' kept referring to Frankenstein's creation as 'Frankenstein'. This character belonged in a comedy, not a movie that was attempting to be a serious thriller.It's true that the plot is a ludicrous attempt to fit virtually every horror movie character into one story, but again, I believe that with a better director and a better script, it could have turned out passable. As it is, the movie is cringe worthy at parts, and unsatisfying for the rest. There's kind of a failed love plot between Valerious and Van Helsing, which is hinted at, but never really takes off, which gets really confusing.As well, the movie relied much too heavily on CGI, which was definitely a downside. I'm fine with characters like the werewolf or the vampires in monster form being computer generated, but it seems most Hollywood producers have forgotten the virtues of makeup. There was absolutely no need for the vampires to form those ridiculously enormous fanged mouths when they bit their victims - a vampire bite is supposed to leave two tiny holes in the neck, not tear someone's head off! And Mr Hyde, one of my favorite Horror characters, was not only completely computer generated, but also turned into a gibbering baboon! WHY CAN'T MODERN Hollywood PRODUCERS DO HYDE JUSTICE?! In League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, he was transformed into an absurdly muscled stupid guy, and in Van Helsing, they've turned him into an ape. What they should have done, is had Robbie Coltrane play the part himself with some makeup on, instead of just providing his voice, and kept Hyde more as a real person rather than a green baboon, jumping off the walls and ceiling. That would have done a lot to keep the film more grounded.The acting wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been in Van Helsing. It was David Wenham as the belligerent friar Carl who really saved the movie, taking every Lord of the Rings fan by surprise by playing a character the polar opposite of his valiant Prince Faramir. The funny voiced, bumbling and ultimately very funny Carl was definitely the highlight of the movie. Hugh Jackman did what he could with the title role, (despite his fluctuating accent: I caught some American, British, Australian, Italian and Transylvanian throughout the film. Where was Van Helsing supposed to be from, and why couldn't he keep his accent steady? This is another thing a good director would have caught) but his part was so badly written that he had to battle to make the character believable. Richard Roxburgh was campy and very over-the-top as Dracula, but good fun nonetheless. If he had toned his seemingly relentless energy down, (and with a competent director, he probably would have) and focused more on being sly and cunning, I think he could have made an excellent Dracula. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious was all right, but she and Jackman shared very little chemistry, and she was stuck with some of the worst lines in the movie, so it was hard to properly rate her performance. Despite all my criticism, I actually enjoyed this movie. It accomplished what it wanted to be, which was an exciting action film where Van Helsing gets to go blow up a whole bunch of monsters. I just think it could have been done a whole lot better, if Somers had stayed far away from the project, which would have made it a lot more enjoyable. My rating of 6/10 isn't because the movie wasn't entertaining, but because I thought it was badly done, and could have been better.-6/10",6,0,1,13 August 2004
The Men Who Stare at Goats," More gormless, bland comedy than irreverent satire, yet amusing nonetheless
","If a film's quality could be equated to the strength of its marketed potential, The Men Who Stare at Goats would have been a no holds barred cinematic triumph. Everything from its marvellously oddball title to the stellar cast assembled to the tactfully unconventional posters (announcing 'Goat' as the last star cast member of the film) suggested a gleefully irreverent, strange and wilfully brave film, whether functioning as a military spoof or oddball comedy on its own right. Bearing this in mind, the film is hardly a failure, but runs the risk of feeling like one, largely because none of the tantalizing aforementioned standards of quality are met. Rather, in contrast, the film, while still managing to amuse from time to time, feels excessively safe rather than brave, conventional rather than strange, and lukewarm and gormless rather than gleeful or irreverent.The main problem is the film's overall hesitancy, as if afraid of alienating audiences by becoming the far out, bizarre comedy it hints at, while equally concerned about pushing too many buttons by poking too much fun at the military - the irony being, both were aims the film promoted itself as meeting, thus suggesting qualities audiences would be interested in seeing in the film. Director Grant Heslov without question plays it safe, consistently hitting a tone comfortably in the midst of mainstream, accessible and friendly comedy (the musical score in particular reeks of familiar comedy cliché riffs) with occasional polite satirical barbs ('the military does some silly things in the name of war, but is ultimately still all right') being the extent of the film's much hyped exposure or caustic wit. With such a forceful 'anti-bias', the film uneasily dabbles between ridiculing and vaguely supporting the army, making it difficult for the viewer to situate themselves in the equation, and, equally, decide what to laugh at. As such, Heslov's film is far more likely to evoke puzzled glances than chuckles, from viewers just as confused as to exactly what the film is trying to say (not from being clever and hard to understand, but rather inconsistent and vague) as what happened to the advertised film they expected to, and with a more bold director and intelligent script, could have, seen.As such, the pleasure factor in the film resides solely in its superb cast, who, despite largely being given little to work with, manage to cobble together an amusing romp, albeit one still lacking in fundamental complexity and wit. Despite the questionable quality of the film at hand, one has to tip their hat to George Clooney to committing so wholeheartedly to whatever sparks of comic madness lay in it, as he unleashes his legendary charisma in full force with a welcome side order of manic paranoia and demented intensity as whiz paranormal G.I. Lynn Cassidy. Like Cassidy himself, Clooney's clipped urgency and wide-eyed passion are enough to sell what is largely a very silly and hardly believable story, and it is impossible to imagine the film holding together without his reassuring comic centrepiece of a performance. As the befuddled reporter following Cassidy's story, Ewan McGregor feels wasted, stuck with a thankless 'straight man' role, but manages to draw out several amusing moments nonetheless, many self-reflexively revolving around Cassidy's numerous Jedi references. Nonetheless, the unabashed scene-steal is Jeff Bridges as a flower-child military commander. Refusing to coast alone on either a hippie stereotype or the mere comedic tension of his character, Bridges instead infuses his role with unexpected tragic underpinnings and poignancy, managing to not only be uproariously funny but surprisingly sympathetic and moving. Kevin Spacey also raises numerous chuckles as a petulant, adversarial paranormal soldier, but one cannot help but feel both the role and his rendition of it to fall somewhat below their full potentials.The film's occasional, fleeting moments of irreverent genius (a particularly wacky ending being none the least of them) suggest an initially far more strange, silly and politically pointed film being disappointingly morphed into a more flaccid, safe substitute somewhere along the line, but such moments and the fun the cast has with them are what ultimately breathe some semblance of life into the overall work. Nonetheless, while it overall proves an amusing, sufficiently interesting and sometimes downright funny watch, there lingers a perpetual sense of vague disappointment circulating around The Men Who Stare at Goats, as if the ghost of the film's far superior potential lingers ever intangible but consistently discernible, like one of Cassidy's psychic premonitions. A worthwhile watch, but far from the triumph it rather easily could have been.-6.5/10",6,4,8,10 January 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Manifest Destiny
","The fifth film in a franchise no one would have ever expected to have such trajectory, Rogue Nation actually manages to accomplish the impossible: in the thick of a tension-building chase scene, music pounding, punches crunching, glass shattering, director Christopher McQuarrie holds a moment of silence. Actual silence. And sustains it. It feels like an eternity. It allows the viewer to reflect on how much their ears are ringing, and stretches the tension from engaging to nearly unbearable. And it is beautiful. This, amazingly, isn't even the most suspenseful moment in the film, which opens with a setpiece involving Tom Cruise actually hanging out of a plane, and gets wilder from there on. But it's perfectly indicative of McQuarrie's confidence waltzing into a franchise and making it his own. For decades, Mission: Impossible has been toying with tone, flirting with 'Bond-but- not-Bond', but without being too vanilla in asserting what it isn't. But, just as the post- millennial Bond has slunk into surly Jason Bourne territory, Ethan Hunt is finally allowed to be fun for fun's sake. And it is phenomenally cathartic. Fun should not be mistaken for levity, however. McQuarrie brings with him plenty of the burly intensity of his last Cruisefest, Jack Reacher, and sets the tone to 'bludgeon'. And not just in terms of the series' most shockingly intense violence, with clipped, brutally efficient fight scenes punctuated with sound editing like thunderclaps erupting out of nowhere. No shaky-cam or intensified continuity nonsense here. No fuss. No – the real bludgeoning is of the viewer's nerves, racking up setpiece after setpiece of unbelievable tension, all the moreso upon realization of how much death-defying was done entirely practically. You can practically hear McQuarrie shrug, saying, 'It was just easier to actually do it than mess around on some computer,' but the effect is palpable. From a rafters opera knife fight involving three(!) snipers, synched to the orchestral score dizzyingly enough to make Alfred Hitchcock sweat, to an almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic sequence of Cruise outdoing the 'switch the computer chip' climax of Captain America: The Winter Soldier while free-diving in a revolving, pressurized water tank, to a backwards-car-chase-turned-motorcycle-chase-turned- ANOTHER-motorcycle-chase (in which Cruise is literally inches from disfigurement the entire time), M:I5 is a psychotic roller-coaster of thrills. And it barely seems to try.It's almost disconcerting, in fact, how nonchalantly airtight the film feels. The pacing, script, and cinematography are slick but unshowy, allowing moments of humour to breathe without feeling like obligatory punch-ups (promoting the infallibly wonderful Simon Pegg to primary scene partner here is a genius move), and shearing the plot down to a razor-fine intensity. Yes, the script is overly prone to worming in trailer sting lines like 'this is never going to work' or 'this is our last chance' in virtually every scene, but if ya gotta do it, may as well leave them in the capable hands of Alec Baldwin, Ving Rhames, and Jeremy 'the human frown' Renner, who, vaguely bored as they might seem, can each sell a scene or punchline alike in their sleep. For such a previously vaguely defined franchise, it's oddly fun and satisfying to see the whole IMF gang cavorting around together, and have it actually feel like 'the boys are back in town'. Even composer Joe Kraemer finds yet another thrilling way of remixing that iconic musical theme that could carry the franchise by itself. It all just seems to fit. This, if anything, is the film's central theme. In a vintage Baldwinian monologue, Alec Baldwin's CIA sourpuss refers to Hunt as 'the manifestation of destiny', and it's a curiously resonant statement. Just when the film's central conceit of 'disbarred agent hunting down shadow organization to prevent global conspiracy' starts to feel a little too familiar (your turn at bat, Spectre), McQuarrie takes the sting out with an odd bent of fatalism. Here, the hero/villain dichotomy is taken to a genuinely interesting place: both rely on each other's competency to achieve their own goals, assuming no endeavour the other undertakes could fail. Their plans each systematically work because of course they do, and the perennial piggybacking of schemes is strangely thrilling. Here, Sean Harris is the perfect antagonist, in that he, unlike virtually all fellow moustache-twirlers, feels and acts like a real spy: quiet, polite, sans showboating, with only the tiniest nasal flares connoting volumes of seething villainy. It's also a rare treat to have a femme fatale figure who is genuinely hard to read or predict, but, in doing so, Rebecca Fergusson snatches the film's most impressively compelling performance, just as breezily likable as astoundingly capable in combat, complete with the most surprisingly tender cinematic hug in years, of all things. Ultimately, however, the franchise is still unapologetically a Tom Cruise vehicle, and he makes it count. Performing more jaw-dropping stunts than he has lines in the film, and wordlessly reacting to histrionic situations with the smallest of bemused head tilts like a 1000 watt Cary Grant, the 53 year old Cruise is still every inch the movie star, and it is just as thrilling as ever to see him in his element. It's rare to see a sequel, let alone a 'part 5', not only exceed its predecessors but casually cement its tone as a franchise, while casually delivering the most exciting and thrilling romp of the year thus far, but Cruise and McQuarrie have here accomplished the Imposserr, Improbable. The rather appropriate moniker for the now eagerly awaited next installment? MI6. Your move, Mr. Bond. -9/10",9,0,2,6 August 2015
Collateral," More of a drama than an action thriller
","Not to be mistaken for Governor Schwartzenegger's 2002 film 'Collateral Damage', Michael Mann, one of the finest modern crime directors takes his latest shootout down a quite different path. To quote the movie's tagline: 'It began like any other night'. Max (Foxx) is a peaceful, even tempered L.A. cabbie who is hired by a mysterious man named Vincent (Cruise) for the night to make five stops. After a body flies from a 3rd story window and lands on Max's cab, it becomes apparent that Vincent is no ordinary passenger. In truth, Vincent is a contract hit-man who has five witnesses to a drug bust to eradicate, and one night to do it. The rest of the film follows him carrying out his five hits, Max's constant attempts to escape, and the police officer tracking them down. (Ruffalo)Collateral is impressive by it's balance between more typical action violence and excitement and the perspectives of the characters. Vincent seems to be the personification of all good parent and teacher's beliefs that all bullies are unsure of themselves, and push others around to improve their self esteem. This becomes quite clear, as Vincent is openly aggressive in conversation with Max, forces him to visit his mother in the hospital, and drags him into a jazz club, forcing him to tell his interpretation of the music. When Max begins to question Vincent about his reasons for becoming a hit-man, Vincent becomes verbally abusive, and threatens to kill him on the spot. But Vincent also becomes surprisingly philosophical, musing about the reasons behind the crime and corruption in Las Angelos. Wonderful jobs all around for making Vincent a human being instead of a heartless killing machine.Tom Cruise continues to diversify his recent film roles as he dominates the screen as cold, intense hit man Vincent, playing the role to utter perfection. Foxx also continually impresses as his unfortunate victim Max, and a strong supporting cast is supplied from Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo.One of the most visually impressive films of the year, Collateral was filmed almost entirely with a digital camera to provide a more gritty look. The effort payed off, and Mann pushes the limit between a realistic and fantastical look with the canvas of dulled purples and blues that is his vision of L.A. at night. The frequent overhead shots and Michael Mann trademark constantly changing camera angles also help to embellish the visuals, with a highly satisfying result.A good story, masterfully helmed by a great director, combined with some stellar acting and strong characterizations proves to be a winner. If you aren't deterred by violence and some strong language, I would strongly recommend seeing Collateral.-9.5/10",10,0,0,25 January 2005
Dunkirk," More Styles than substance
","It's hard to walk into Dunkirk not expecting a masterpiece. After all, it's a gritty, Important, True Story by THE Christopher Nolan, bound to not only redefine the war genre, but obviously say meaningful things about Brexit.* Right? Sadly, halfway through the ensuing Lord of the Rings length (only two hours? Really? Could've fooled me) deluge of water, fire, yelling, bullets, airplanes, ticking, and the incessant air-raid siren that is Hans Zimmer, it hit me: sheepishly, ashamedly, I was bored - bored! - by Dunkirk. Nolan's objective - I idly ruminated, unfazed by the dreary din of explosions and frowning - is commendable: a war movie that captures the immersive, sensory immediacy of war - disorienting, chaotic, overwhelming, and traumatizing. Unfortunately, his result, more PTSD flashback than film, is such an emotionally hollow sensory overload that the mayhem slides right off. And, evocative or not, this a problem - because war may be many things, but it shouldn't be boring. Dunkirk's poster calls it an 'event,' and, fittingly, it's more sequence of events than congealing narrative. His characteristic time-toying editing endeavours to graft synchronicity between the Churchillian three prongs of battle (land, air, and sea), and their ensuing subplots. It's a fun conceit, but rendered a bit redundant without a concrete plot or clearly defined, or even discernible characters to anchor to. Instead, we are barraged by furious bursts of combat and sullen pauses in between, which increasingly blur into a nigh-incomprehensible muddle. There are some exceptional set pieces - soldiers frantically stranded under a flaming ocean, or a panorama of rescue vessels creeping over a horizon - but these are the exception rather than the rule in a film chiefly inundated by war tropes already done to death (pardon the fun) - just louder. In the face of such monolithic stimuli, it's a curious experience that a film so noisy and fast-paced can simultaneously feel so plodding and dull. You can't fault Nolan for attempting such visceral sensory immersion. Still, it leaves one grumbling for the good ol' days when newfangled cinematic trickery existed to support rather than supplant character building and emotionally-driven storytelling. With an overly lyrical title card downplaying the crucial historical scope of the conflict (had the beach been lost, the ENTIRE British army would have been wiped out, drastically affecting the war's outcome), Nolan's nearly wordless humans become tantamount to props - they move in formation, strike poses, and are blown away, with shockingly little emotional impact. Each time a supposedly crucial character met their end, my brain remarked 'Oh no - not...that guy!' with almost comical saltiness. Nolan is far from immune from cheese, too, and his preciously few sentimental moments are dropped in with the subtlety of a wanton torpedo (amidst such otherwise staunch realism, Tom Hardy's gas-free Spitfire takedown of all assailing Nazi forces is as much of a middle finger to the laws of physics as... Batman out-swimming an atomic bomb's fallout. Hmm). Paint a war as stirringly as you like, but when you don't care about the participants, it's about as engaging and affecting as drifting off during a high school history lecture. It's a shame, as the film looks and sounds exquisite, being virtually peerless in conjuring the sheer affective maelstrom of a combat scene. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is simply stunning, sweeping from the intimate, claustrophobic sludge of a wayward vessel full of bodies living and dead, to judiciously nodding to Riefenstahl in his long shot aerial panoramas, studying the milling geographic formations of humans on the beach like a neo-cubist ant farm. Similarly, Richard King's sound editing is startlingly visceral, with each crackle of gunfire or seismic explosion piercing with terrifying verisimilitude. With such sparse dialogue, silent film comparisons would be apt, were it not for Hans Zimmer's nails-on-a- chalkboard musical score - an incessant drone of consistently escalating crescendo (music nerds, envision Penderecki's Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima for two hours) so torturous in its intensity it recalls POW interrogation techniques; an almost tacky vying for fight-or-fight adrenal overload. Nolan's cast are given such short shrift that, even as they do their best with their fleeting coughs of characterization, we're given so little time to let their performances breathe it's a struggle to give much of a sh*t. Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles are the worst affected - each show beleaguered dregs of earnest affability amidst their frowns, but, ensconced by a mass of equally bland nameless grunts, they're ultimately interchangeably expendable long before indiscernibly caked in mud. The quietly heroic Mark Rylance and credibly shellshocked Cillian Murphy cough up terse sparks of a (gasp!) emotionally resonant subplot, but just when gossamer strands of brittle chemistry start to form, whoosh - we're whisked off to the next vague, disorienting firefight. Kenneth Branagh speaks his two trailer stinger lines with customary nobility, though Nolan is either a hysterically brazen troll or distressingly oblivious to again(!) subject a marble-mouthed Tom Hardy to a voice distorting full-face mask. Don't call him Deutschland's Reckoning.It's a struggle to think of any film as sensorially bludgeoning as Dunkirk - and if all you're after is a cinematic kick to the head, you may find it to be somewhat of a masterpiece. Then again, those seeking a heart-pounding adrenal jolt could just as easily hit up a theme park roller-coaster - sadly, Dunkirk has about as much story to tell, and isn't much more memorable. But surely it's the summer's best war movie? Honestly, Wonder Woman might take the prize (yep - shots fired). Nolan wants to leave us with Churchill's proud words in our ringing ears (thanks, Hans...), but instead, we venture to the Bard: 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.' *I doubt there's any intentional subtext. But it's dour, vaguely conservative, and feebly nationalistic, so you decide. -6.5/10",6,3,7,30 July 2017
The Machinist," Chillingly effective psychological thriller
","The Machinist Anyone, upon the sight of a near anorexic Christian Bale displayed proudly across the poster or trailer for The Machinist, must have had their curiosity piqued to a certain degree. How and why, the questions lingered, could the soon to be star of Batman Begins have lost such a large quantity of weight, and how does that figure into the plot of the film? And while the spectre of Bale is indeed a prominent point of interest for the film, by no means is the novelty of such an skeletal leading man the only appealing feature of The Machinist - instead, it only serves to compliment and add to the masterful construction of a truly classy and nerve wracking psychological thriller.Director Brad Anderson proves himself a master at effectively creating tension and atmosphere in a fashion which has become exceedingly rare in this day and age where increasingly formulaic CGI creatures, inane amounts of gore, and beautiful young women shrieking have become the standard for 'frightening' in the average Hollywood thriller. The Machinist is all the more effective by staying firmly grounded in reality, but still managing to extract many a quiver simply due to its exquisitely bleak atmosphere. Anderson's use of lighting is one of the single most effective instances of a modern film in recent memory - shrouds of darkness bathe the screen, as the spectre of Bale looms out, all the more chilling as shadows drape across his willowy form. This world of shadows is one where it seems anything can happen, and Bale's slow psychological disintegration seems entirely credible - the sheer physical agony of continual exhaustion seems to bleed out of the screen, infecting the viewer. The plot itself is one which may seem familiar grounds for viewers well versed in mind twisting films such as this, but the execution is so strong, the predictable twist at the film's climax hardly detracts from the viewer's enjoyment at all. One starts to wonder if the ending was even intended to be a surprise to the viewer, or if its purpose was merely for them to watch the dishevelled Bale creep towards this inevitable revelation. At any rate, screenwriter Scott Kosar's airtight script makes for a compelling watch, and the film's pacing is superb, introducing each new plot point at a steady pace while still allowing for the pitch perfect development of tension. The wonderful cinematography captures the shadowy locations in a wonderfully eerie fashion, and the haunting musical score adds to the mood perfectly, and although it does start to get repetitive to the point of almost being distracting at times, it's a small complaint in a mood piece as strong as this. Christian Bale has proved himself to be among the most watchable and consistently powerful performers in the industry of late, and The Machinist only proves the dedication and emotional investment he undergoes for each role. Bale resists the temptation to coast along on the shock value evoked by his emaciated form, and his powerhouse performance as chronically sleep deprived Trevor Reznik captivates in an almost peerless fashion. The strength and credibility of Bale's central performance is enough to carry the film through what might have otherwise come across as inane plot points. Bale is given quality support by Jennifer Jason Leigh as Reznik's call girl 'girlfriend', and Leigh instills her character with a down to earth dignity few other actresses would have captured. John Sharian makes for wonderfully eerie support as the mysterious Ivan, who continually causes Reznik mental strife throughout. All things considered, few films of late have parallelled the atmospheric success of The Machinist. While it's plot may not entirely be a surprise for those familiar to the genre, the gloomily lit, masterful atmosphere and pitch perfect development of tension, combined with an immensely strong leading performance are enough to make Anderson's quiet but high quality film easily worth a watch.-9/10",9,3,4,14 July 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Poor Peetah Parkah
","'Really? Why...?' Yes, this was the general nonplussed audience reaction when The Amazing Spider- Man was greenlit. Sony, attempting to burn images of emo-haired, hip-thrusting Tobey Maguire from viewers' brains, opted for the post -Schumacher Batman route, by pretending it simply never happened. Cool. Fair. So: a paradigm shift privileging, y'know fun? Orrrrrr, resetting the clock with a patented (/already stale) 'gritty reboot' (sigh). After all, why do something interesting or jaunty with the superhero world-famous for his cheeky sense of playfulness, when you could, once again, subject audiences to the death of Uncle Ben (spoilers! NOT), and his most hilariously cumbersome paraphrasing of 'with great power comes great responsibility' yet? That said, given their abominable squandering of their most popular franchise here, it seems it's a lesson Sony, more than their audiences, could benefit from hearing. Initially, director Marc Webb (guess how he got the job) seemed an ideal choice. Fresh off sprightly, revisionist rom-com (500) Days of Summer, his grasp of 'The Youths' seemed as intuitive as any - who better to breathe life into the neurotically lovable superhero fussing about dating and laundry while fighting crime right? Sadly, Webb's name is about as close as he gets to Spider-Savvy, with his laboured, dull, and loathsomely faux-hip super-sludge-fest. To be fair, Webb certainly embraces the 'gritty' qualifier with gusto, opting for a shady, chiaroscuro Alex Ross aesthetic, with flashes of colour streaking across the dark like paint running in the rain. It would be quite striking if he could conjure up the content to match. And no, the nauseating, instantly-dated 'first-person Spider-Cam' 3D shots (Peter Parkour?) don't count. Except for accurately emulating a lacklustre early-2000s video game. Instead, The Amazing Spider-Man is a fundamentally confused endeavour (granted, it's at least more consistently gloomy than its bloated, tonally schizophrenic franchise-bait sequel - though this honestly isn't much of a compliment). It wants to be serious, but fumbles frantically between grim, obsessive vigilante vengeance (yawn) and mumblecore humour (double-yawn), ultimately belly-flopping with both. It distinguishes itself by focusing on the mystery of Peter's dead parents, then only pays dreary, expositional lip-service to them. Most insulting, though: it doesn't seem to understand Spider-Man at all. Instead, the clumsiness that Webb presents suggests hackneyed studio-generated attempts to morph Spidey into their perceptions of what would appeal to as widespread a group of fans as possible. But fans smell artifice. And you wouldn't like them when they're angry (wait - that was that other guy). Our plot (evil corporation, bad science nonsense, New York in danger) is a dreary, slovenly edited remake of Sam Rami's first two Spidey flicks. Our action spurts are brief and forgettable, including a clumsy, cramped Lizard brawl in a high school, and a climax revolving around a toppling tower spire - oooh! ahh! - a set piece that even Spider-Man 3 treated superfluously in its opening action scene. Even James Horner's brassy score feels hollow and tinny rather than elating. Yet, despite its yearning to stand out, Webb's Spidey still dials up the angst and cheese factors, which drew more flack than anything in Raimi's Spiders (the cranes. THE CRANES!). At the very least, the voluminous FX budget spares no expense in making Spider-Man move masterfully, springing and swinging around like a proper super hero. Still, these are the only fleeting moments the adjective 'Amazing' remotely comes to mind, without the suffix 'ly bad' ensuing. But there's no Spider-Man without good ol' relatable, nerdy outcast Peter Parker, right? Well, see him here as you've never seen him before: kind of ...cool? Dressed like an American Apparel catalogue model, effortlessly bagging the hot girl of his dreams, and...skateboarding to Coldplay in a ship yard...?! Even worse: browsing the web (ha) with... Bing??!? Quick: another reboot! ANOTHER REBOOT!!!It's not poor Andrew Garfield's fault that his Peter is a bit of an angsty hipster prat, though, bless 'im - chock that one up to Webb bleating 'The Youths, The YOUTHS!!!' with a studio bridle in his mouth. Garfield's Spider-Man, conversely, couldn't be more spot-on: lean, springy, earnest, and constantly wisecracking, he's enormously enjoyable enough to bring into stark perspective how miscast, albeit lovable, poor Tobey was. For his time, Garfield was the first PROPER Spider-Man we'd had to date (holla, Holland!). Even if he opts for even more senseless, unmasked public face time than Tobey. D'oh. Still, ASM marks the first superhero jaunt where the romance subplot is its strongest element. Yes, really. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone: by gosh they're adorable together. Their awkward, slapstick banter, and surprisingly tender chemistry practically fizzes, and breathes the only real life and energy into the film. Stone alone is already perfection, her Gwen Stacy feisty and snappy enough to practically carry a picture, but together they're unstoppable. They're about it, though: Rhys Ifans lurks and skulks well, but he does little to punch up his Dr. Connors' vacuous obsessive scientist archetype, while saddled with a deplorably lazy CGI alter ego, unsightly for the wrong reasons (and no lizard lab coat, either. Hmpff). Denis Leary's sneering guilt barometer cop is more intolerably sour than inspirational, while Sally Field and Martin Sheen as Peter's Aunt May and Uncle Ben are both pleasant and capable enough, but barely factor in. The normally excellent Irrfan Khan's sulky Oscorp exec? Less so. But hey - at least Stan Lee's cameo is... fine? Chuckle-worthy, even? Yeah! Go Stan go. The crown jewel of the 'senseless reboot' camp, The Amazing Spider-Man is bolstered only by Garfield and Stone's effervescent chemistry, and mites of the unquenchable joy of watching Spider-Man swinging across a screen (occasionally in third person and everything!). Still, Webb does his best to quash that joy, with his cantankerous, desperately unimaginative super-flop, choking on its own unwarranted delusions of hipness. There's no J. Jonah Jameson needed to declare this sickly smudge of a film a menace. -4.5/10",5,0,2,22 October 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Paprikash
","In the 1980s cartoon Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends, arch-fiend The Chameleon's master plan left something to be desired: 'I will destroy your friendship – get you to distrust, even dislike each other!' Flash-forward thirty years, and the same conflict anchors one of the most expensive movies ever made. Okay, so it's contextualized within more sociopolitical morality debates and Avengers than you can shake a shield at. Still, veteran Winter Soldier/Community directors Joe and Anthony Russo carefully keep hurt feelings the eye of the blockbuster storm. Their ability to effortlessly counterbalance the macro and micro levels of the conflict makes Captain America: Civil War a strong candidate for the most satisfying superhero film ever. It shrugs off clichés that had been threatening to bog the genre down, while reaffirming its core populist appeal with unprecedented nuance. Switching gears from the colourful din of Age of Ultron to the far more interesting Age of Accountability, Civil War neatly consolidates the politics of its comics source text into about as in-depth an interrogation of the ethics of unsanctioned vigilante justice as we're ever likely to get in a franchise blockbuster. Like Ultron, there's simply too much going on for Civil War to not have a 'bit-y,' episodic feel, which undercuts the sweeping feeling of exhilarating, euphoric rush many of the best Marvels deliver. Unlike Ultron, all these bits are actually good. Every character's dialogue breathes distinctly and organically, while their respective subplots are fastidiously orchestrated - with even inconsequential emotional beats unexpectedly coming crashing back as red herring climaxes later on. The Russos keep the moral naval-gazing concise but impactful, giving both sides of the debate a fair hearing, without backseat driving the viewer to taking a side. If anything, considering the 'Captain America' in the film's title, Rogers' steadfast conviction in individual autonomy has its fair share of holes poked in it, making it a genuinely even moral playing ground. And if the politics are motivated a touch over-conveniently at times (Rogers' resolution to keep fighting the good fight during a inspiring eulogy is one of the film's few stumbles of contrivance, while a non-sequitur kiss briefly flirts with the surreal unacceptability of 'Brutasha'), the Russos, in true Marvel fashion, are always ready with a quip or more stunning fight choreography to keep the melodrama at bay. Ah yes - let them fight. It's no exaggeration to say that Civil War showcases, hands down, the most spectacular superhero action combat we've seen yet. The opening anti-terrorist Avenging takedown of Frank Grillo (remember him?)'s tech-beefed Crossbones is itself pulse-pounding fun, exhilarating without overstaying its welcome. But let's face it: it's the hero vs. hero airport super-brawl you came for. You're not wrong to do so; the hype doesn't do it justice. Gone is the bland spectacle of mowing through faceless CGI blurs. Here, our combat is up-close, unprecedentedly intricate choreography, grounded in character, humour and Star Wars references, crunchy with moral ambiguity, and consistently topping itself with more and more 'Big Moments.' It's almost obnoxious how awesome this fight is. That said, it's the finale you'll really take away with you. An abrupt about-face from the bombastic fun of earlier, following a trail of twists and turns we genuinely don't anticipate (including a climax riffing on Se7en of all things...), Civil War's final fight is pared-down, viciously gritty, and microcosmically ties together the entire MCU thus far. It's also exhaustingly grim, which would be a buzzkill if it weren't so intimately emotionally truthful. Still, stay until the very end of the credits if your spirits need further bolstering. The film's real battle is deciding which character to cheer for the most. We get more time with relative newcomers - Elizabeth Olson and Paul Bettany adorably weave tender humour into contemplating godlike powers amongst mortals - but veterans like Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle find new wrinkles and punchlines to explore. If Sebastian Stan's Bucky verges on tiresome histrionics, he's easily redeemed when paired with the hilarious banter of Anthony Mackie. Meanwhile, the inhumanly charming Paul Rudd delivers an infinitely more satisfying Ant-Man mini-movie in fifteen minutes than his whole flaccid feature. As new blood, Daniel Brühl's Zemo wisely stays mostly behind the scenes, deftly delivering one of the franchise's most complex, troubling foes. Chadwick Boseman's slick, sombre Black Panther is breathlessly captivating, and the prospect of waiting two years for more of him is agony. But the winner might be Tom Holland's prolonged cameo as a certain prodigal web-head, whose chatty cheeriness was so perfect it reduced our theatre to delirious cheers of euphoria. Nonetheless, the film's greatest accomplishment is reinvigorating the MCU's two most beloved characters as relevant again. Robert Downey Jr.'s career-defining sassy Stark charisma had been imperceptibly threatening to dip into the quagmire of phoned-in indifference in his last few outings. Here he's back - vivaciously emotive and present, and owning a nuanced redemption arc that we actually buy like nobody's business. Conversely, Chris Evans traces Captain America's dogmatic, unwavering morality and gradual acceptance of his role as propaganda figurehead to darker places than you'd ever imagine, his strained conviction verging on the psychotic. The MCU has largely found its groove in refuting the genre's trends of claustrophobic darkness, but allowing Downey Jr. and Evans to dabble is morbidly fascinating and entirely truthful, and a reminder of just how talented they are. Civil War isn't as taut and punchy as Winter Soldier, or liable to pump you up as much as Guardians of the Galaxy or The Avengers. It's arguably better: the mature instalment needed to keep the genre in check, leaving us genuinely fascinated to see how the franchise proceeds. The fact that it's also furiously fun, and does justice to its dizzying excess of characters and content? Maybe, as Winter Soldier's Baron Strucker proclaimed, we really are in the 'age of miracles.' -9.5/10",9,4,10,21 May 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Audiences: No Clue (what they're missing) → Edgar Wright: Gets It
","It is always truly delightful to see a major motion picture take a real chance, blending a daringly new angle into a familiar template and culminating in a doubly enjoyable final product. Director Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is such a triumph, undertaking a cocktail of manic energy and charm, dazzling visuals, unassumingly quirky humour, while still boasting an unmistakable (albeit pixilated) heart. Nonetheless, the film's poor box office suggests that many audiences and/or distributors are finding the idea of the film alienating (too nerdy? Too stylized? Too young and hip? Too Canadian?). However, at the risk of being excessively blunt, such concerns are largely unwarranted and, for the most part, missing the point. For while Scott Pilgrim may seemingly the tailor made film for those old enough to remember classic Zelda yet young enough to still have played it, the film's true genius lies in its fundamental accessibility, hitting all the right notes to delight fans of Brian Lee O'Malley's graphic novels without alienating those unfamiliar with any variety of geekdom. While video game and comic book adaptations have become quite common multiplex fare of late, there is still something that feels so fundamentally unique and crisp about a film set in a more overt overlap between 'reality' and the physics and credulity bending of the aforementioned media. Even just by considering how much astronomical thought and care were invested into the minutiae of the production (the film opens with an 8-bit, classic video game style Universal logo, and throwaway references to any number of cultural texts abound – watch for 'Launchpad McQuack'), the film boasts such a determined earnestness that it is nigh impossible not to love. Wright, expanding upon the same wild yet harnessed hilarity he exercised in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, strikes a perfect tone and pace, with quick cutting, hip dialogue and a potentially disjointed and episodic story flowing without a single stumble or hitch. Equally, the whimsical visual effects (ranging from electric bolts dancing across the screen when Pilgrim's band, Sex Bob-Omb, play, to visual sound effects punctuating brutal Evil-Ex battles, to throwaway touches such as a 'pee bar') never threaten to overwhelm the story. Yes, story. For, while the film may be an admittably hard sell (the protagonist must battle his love interest's Seven Evil Exes in wildly choreographed video game style fights to be with her? !), Scott Pilgrim is as far as can be from mere hyperactive, flashy cinematic noise. Instead, Wright continually draws the focus back to the emotional heart of the story, paradoxically seeking intrinsic realism through fantasy and achieving both the most and least believable film in ages. Tapping into the obsessions, neuroses and hang-ups of a lovelorn, confused, whiney, aimless, occasionally downright dislikeable yet always lovable 22 year old and vibrantly letting them loose on screen, Wright's film proves far more resonant and truthful than first glance would suggest. The film's set pieces, the battles with Ramona Flowers' evil exes, apart from being exhilarating blends of blinding choreography and visual trickery, ultimately prove cunningly symbolic vehicles for the characters' largely unresolved emotional conflicts being hashed out with the sort of gleeful violence any frustrated young adult is bound to want to wreak on their nearby environment. Between the stomping, hard rock score (much of it performed by the cast), Scott Pilgrim could prove one of the most cathartic movies ever. Also, on a personal note, it is rather heartwarming to see an unabashedly Canadian big budget action movie, for once set in Toronto and not 'Toronto posing as New York'.Nonetheless, all considered, it is the ensemble cast who truly elevate the film to its triumphant heights. Michael Cera, finally provided more nuance than his usual neurotic misfits, is perfectly cast as Scott Pilgrim, his nearly unmatchable comic timing and ability to bleed charm and charisma even at his most whiney, clueless and unsympathetic making Scott a supremely relatable and enjoyable emotional foil. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a remarkable job of humanizing her idolized Ramona Flowers, as every time Flowers appears too aloof and distant to truly take to, Winstead's eyes radiate a heartbreaking sense of empathy and self-regret, culminating in a beautifully understated yet effective performance. Similarly, Ellen Wong alternates between irresistibly adorable, hilariously obsessive and quietly tragic as Scott's scorned high school girlfriend Knives, the three forming an unorthodox yet perfectly pitched romantic triangle. As Pilgrim's 'supporting characters', Kieran Culkin just about steals the show as Scott's bemusedly detached gay roommate Wallace, Anna Kendrick chatters with comical scorn as his sister, and Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill are side-splitting as Pilgrim's meager yet impressive band (Pill, in particular, being graced with one of the most hilarious deadpans in cinema history). On the opposing team, each Evil-Ex in turn chomp the scenery with delicious aplomb, with standouts being Chris Evans' unforgettable Hollywood meathead, Brandon Routh as a snappy vegan with mystical powers, and Jason Schwartzman epitomizing sleaze as a smarmy record producer, though Satya Bhabha wins extra points for delivering one of the most unexpected song and dance numbers in recent memory as Flowers' vindictive first boyfriend. Apart from being effectively the most satisfying translation of O'Malley's graphic novels any fan could hope for, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World proves the film to beat in terms of fusing a bravely niche approach into good, old fashioned, accessible entertainment without ever sacrificing on edge, hilarity or even complexity and never compromised by its genre trappings. Near essential viewing and better on ever watch, Wright delivers a true KO of a film, if ever there was one. -10/10",10,7,19,27 August 2010
Quantum of Solace," Fragmentary, kinetic and vastly enjoyable - a Bond for its times
","It would seem Mr. Bond, James Bond, has yet to tire of reinventing himself. After the critical and commercial success of precursor Casino Royale, one would have expected producers to take the safe route of carrying on the franchise with the same self-reflexive yet supremely entertaining tone. But far be it from 007 to settle for the safe option, as Quantum of Solace showed fearless confidence from day one, from the tongue-tripping title (referring to Bond's seeking emotional closure after the death of the one woman he allowed himself to love) to being the first direct sequel in the series (picking up only a matter of hours after Casino Royale's finish). The final film encompasses this daring, simultaneously returning to the more fun spirit of earlier Bond outings while paradoxically proving one of the least 'Bond-like' films in the series.This curious hybridity of tone can likely be attributed to unconventional director Marc Foster, more renowned for harrowing character studies like Monster's Ball or Finding Neverland. But while not versed in action credentials, Foster cannot be faulted for lack of ambition, kicking off his film at a frenzied pace which seldom slows, cohesion cast aside in favour of sheer energy and movement. As such, the film never quite gels as a whole, but the sum of its fragmentary parts proves too entertaining for one to mind.Aiming beyond the superficiality of the traditional Bond film without sacrificing its gleeful escapism, Quantum of Solace proves the most overtly politically and socially topical Bond film to date. In lieu of the usual oversimplifications of global politics, this Bond interacts with a world where major governments lend support to corrupt dictators in exchange for oil, and the villain is frightening not because of a laughably over the top scheme to rule the world but for playing upon frighteningly valid environmental concerns. Foster's knack for credible characterisation also makes the film the rare exception to the action movie rule where the quiet character moments peppering the pyrotechnic mayhem prove among the film's most fulfilling points. As Bond, his soul as ravaged and barren as the desert setting symbolically chosen for the film's climax, desperately pursues either vengeance or peace, the film is given a crucial emotional core, with enough substance to make the film far more than an explosion-riddled guilty pleasure. However, Foster knows his demographic, and almost overcompensates for the film's surprising complexity on the action front, saturating his film with enough viciously intense fistfights (though complaints may ensue over coordinator Dan Bradley overly recycling his distinctive style from the Bourne series), explosions and various vehicular chases (car, foot, motorcycle, boat and plane respectively) to enthrall even the most jaded action junkies. Once again, Daniel Craig as 007 proves the high point of an already impressive film, masking Bond's raw, seething emotions under a carefully cultivated shell of grim stoicism, making his inner turmoil all the more affecting. Conversely, Craig is given more of a chance to exercise his suave wit this time, proving just as adept at wry quips as heavy dramatic scenes or bone- crunching fights. Olga Kurylenko's fierce simmer makes her a wonderfully compelling female lead, even if her chief motivation is overly familiar (vengeance), and Mathieu Almaric is deliciously slimy as villainous Dominic Greene, all the more effective by how eerily plausible his character is. As usual, Judi Dench shines as Bond's superior M, providing a welcome burst of perfectly curt authority and class. However, despite her best attempts at a charming performance, Gemma Arterton's throwback to the 'traditional' (ie: more passive) Bond girl proves a misfire, her brief and uneventful role marking how unnecessary and out of place her inclusion was in the first place. And the less said about that clumsy Goldfinger homage the better... Despite the myriad of its exceptional parts, Quantum of Solace never quite convenes into a cohesive whole, giving the impression of a collection of subplots enthusiastically thrust together and shot off at high octane, as heavy on political commentary and emotional drama as its abundant action. An oddity for a 007 film to be sure, but one so enormously entertaining that both fans of the series and those unfamiliar with Bond are sure to be swept up by its gleefully madcap grandeur. -8/10",8,2,4,15 November 2008
Mamma Mia!," Does not waste its emotion, but delivers an ideal cocktail of bouncy exuberance and self-effacing humour
","For the sake of making things abundantly clear right from the start, those whom generally harbour a dislike or intolerance of the movie musical genre, be forewarned: Mamma Mia! is not the film for you. It is not a film which will change anyone's mind regarding the genre by refuting general criticisms of musicals offering only shallow, superficial spectacle at the expense of content, potentially irritating bouncy exuberance and credibility straining anti-realism. Nor does it intend to be such a film, as Mamma Mia!, rather than attempting to overcome such potential concerns, embraces and exemplifies them with a cheery charm, making otherwise vacuous source material brim with such incessant energy that one cannot help but either be consumed by it or discount it completely.Yet the fact that Mamma Mia! is content as a film to settle for supremely bouncy entertainment rather than striving for further complexity does not indicate the film remains within a blissfully ignorant bubble of its own froth. Director Phyllida Lloyd is shrewd enough to inject her film with a slyly self-referential sense of humour, never afraid to poke fun at itself or the inherent silliness of the musical genre it is highly aware it fully subscribes to. It would even be an overstatement to say the film offers no deeper thematic complexity whatsoever, as a faintly detectable air of quietly introspective sadness circles around Streep's character and her reflections on aging and past party-filled lifestyle. But for the most part, the film's aim is abundantly clear - to be as silly, upbeat and flat out entertaining as possible, cranking out elaborate dance numbers to the continually thumping beat of absurdly catchy ABBA songs and proving so infectious that even the most skeptical viewers who manage to see the film through will find it exceedingly difficult to avoid singing and dancing along. While the film can hardly be considered a cinematic masterpiece, taking it at face value for all it aimed to be, it can be considered no less than a jovial success. The majority of the film's merits come from its talented cast, throwing themselves into the fray with unashamed abandon and the sense of fun they appear to be having is undeniably contagious. Meryl Streep alone makes the film worth viewing, belting out songs and performing acrobatic dance feats with the energy, skill and spunk of a woman half her age. But apart from mere musical interlude plaudits, Streep fills the screen with the star presence only she can truly deliver, contributing a wisdom etched sense of dignity and utter plausibility, making her character's embracing of her sillier, more fun loving past all the more triumphantly genuine. Amanda Seyfield also sparkles with appropriate energy and starry eyed enthusiasm as Streep's daughter, aiming to discover which of her mother's three past beaus was her birth father. As said potential parents, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and (delightfully unorthodox piece of casting) Stellen Skarsgard all have a great time embarrassing themselves, making up for their woeful lack of singing capabilities with witty, measured and charismatic performances. Similarly, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are a riot as Streep's fun loving friends, and Dominic Cooper delivers strong vocals and impressively earnest acting talent as Seyfield's free thinking fiancé. While few films will divide audiences so definitively, Mamma Mia! is commendable for never striving to be anything more than an infectiously bouncy and cheerily entertaining expanse of time, with Lloyd's willingness to poke fun at her own film adding a welcome tinge of upbeat irony. The film is single-minded enough in its purpose that those who will not be able to stand it should know well in advance, and those well versed in such fare should be swept away, having nothing less than a supremely fun time. -7/10",7,1,3,22 February 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Lyrical, crushingly atmospheric revisionist western
","Few films of the calibre of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford emerge within the cinema these days - after all, it is difficult to envision a slow, thoughtful western with a running time as ponderously lengthy as its title being an easy sell to studios who it would seem have primarily lost interest in the genre in the first place - a fact the film's continual failure to pick up a distributor despite the presence of mega-star Brad Pitt is a testament to. But at the same time it is difficult to imagine a more compelling justification for the re-emergence of dusty trails and six-shooters than this one - an astonishingly powerful, engrossing and impeccably crafted modern masterpiece, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a breath of cinematic fresh air, and one of the most impacting films released in recent memory. Director/screenwriter Andrew Dominik has crafted a modern day epic of near unparalleled mood, the sparse script providing a lyrical, crushingly atmospheric revisionist western, musing on fatalism, celebrity worship, madness and the construction of a legend in a truly gripping, inescapably thought provoking fashion. While the film's staggering running time and slow pacing will be enough to deter many viewers unaccustomed to such genre conventions, the film's consistently claustrophobic fatalistic overtones, like a steadily tightening glove, and sporadic, casual bursts of visceral violence make for a taught and engrossing watch throughout its lengthy duration. The film is hardly intended to boast an M. Night Shyamalan style twist, its most impacting plot point revealed within the title, but is instead a treatise on fatalism, and the overpowering, inescapable mood continually palpable throughout is truly crushing and stunning simultaneously. As Roger Deakins' exquisitely composed cinematography haunts the viewer with desolate visions of a withering west (the sequence of the last ever train robbery by James' gang is a moodily beautiful masterpiece in itself), Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' eerily affecting score craft a mood like none other, fully immersing the viewer within the nihilistic realm of the film and wrenching their emotions while flooring them with the impeccable craftsmanship of the work on display. Staunchly driving home the resonance of the film is its powerful cast, each giving a masterfully heartfelt performance simultaneously making the material ring with realism and simmer with incendiary intensity. Brad Pitt inhabits the fragile, world weary psyche of the legendary titular character with pitch perfect muted ferocious charisma, impeccably essaying a character inevitably on the decline while feebly grasping at trace elements of his previous infamy. Behind Pitt's glimmering blue eyes lies the haunted glint of madness, and a single moment, where James lets escape a delirious cackle of a maddened laugh is the film's single most gripping and devastating moment - one of the most full bodied, masterful performances the genre has ever generated. As astonishing as Pitt's performance is, Casey Affleck manages to match him on almost every occasion as the similarly psychologically fragile Robert Ford, toeing the perfect balance between unnerving fanaticism and eerie resentment towards his idol James. However, Affleck refuses to let the audience dismiss Ford as an imbalanced mental case, and bestows enough fractured humanity after a life of rejection within the character to make his performance ring frighteningly sympathetic, a testament to the incredible talent of the rising star. Sam Rockwell also stands out, giving a subtle but powerfully resonant performance as Ford's older brother, Charley, shining in what might have dissipated into a non-existent supporting role in the hands of a less talented performer. Paul Schneider similarly impresses as an oddly verbose outlaw attempting to escape James' gang, and Sam Shepard is a powerful presence as James' older brother, radiating calm fury and muted power ever second on screen. Haunting, resonant and tremendously moving, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford sticks with the viewer for quite some time after its initial viewing. While those unaccustomed with the western genre may find the same faults here as with the majority of its contemporaries, the sheer emotional resonance, muted technical beauty and astonishing performances are enough to buoy the film into the realm of the most powerful and affecting modern westerns, and one of the strongest films of many years past, easily worth pursuing for those seeking a numbingly powerful modern masterpiece. -9.5/10",10,2,4,7 June 2008
Batman Begins," Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise
","It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10",10,607,685,15 August 2005
Twilight," Vampiric romance lacks real 'bite'
","After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels. Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film's special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer's revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film. However, Twilight's main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky.The film repeatedly falls prey to the 'Harry Potter syndrome', feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow. But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella's (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella's emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary. The film's casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can't help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his 'sultry, moody glances' delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward's kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through 'stern but absent father' clichés to the point of being almost invisible as Bella's emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob. While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is 'passable', lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke's film is content to succumb to cliché and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too 'bloodless' to truly satisfy. -4/10",4,139,350,7 December 2008
Revolutionary Road," Disconcertingly mirrors its subject matter - attempts to be different, but ends up disappointingly the same
","Familiarity need not always be a bad thing. The concept of film genres would be essentially void without a cultural recognition of visual and narrative patterns trends establishing a sect of films. Moreover, many cinematic works incorporate the notion of cultural baggage, using familiarity with previously established conventions to add emphasis to or to subvert contemporary efforts. However, the notion of baggage can also work towards an opposite effect, making narrative material which may have once appeared fresh come across as repetitive and unoriginal, devaluing an otherwise quality film. This proves to be exactly the case with Sam Mendes' adaptation of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road. Attacking the film's formidable quality would be senseless, yet the consistent sense of unoriginality ensures the film never quite attains its desired effect, despite it being a stunningly powerful attempt. Yet perhaps this concern with familiarity should hardly come as a surprise, as the concept had encircled Revolutionary Road right from the casting of its two leads. Despite the promised subversion of the timeless love story offered in Titanic, the film's marketing and hype banked very much on the reuniting of co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and the hope that the chemistry and spark between them would go on as much as their hearts once did, leading to a potential case of cultural expectations overshadowing the effort in question. The same goes for American Beauty director Mendes once again digging up a dark undercurrent to supposedly sublime suburban life. Such a combination of factors makes the fact that Revolutionary Road is such an excellent film in itself feel almost like a shallow construction of a success, as the film appeared so tailor made to be nothing less that its own quality appears to paradoxically seem unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, the familiarity of the film extends beyond its cast and crew, as the subject matter derived from Yates' novel manages to do what it does exceedingly well while somehow managing to find nothing new to offer that countless other depictions of 1950s married life had not already unearthed. This adherence to convention becomes difficult to navigate - on one hand, Mendes might be seen as making a critical comment on the desired homogeneity of the time through ironically making use of 1950s stereotypes and familiar narrative arcs. Yet at the same time, the film exudes a continual sense of award baiting self- importance, an implied attempt to elevate it to the level of 'high drama', from the neatly pristine period exteriors and pastel coloured costumes to Thomas Newman's wistful, tinkling piano score which appears to be directly plundered from his previous work with Mendes on American Beauty. The continual sense of the 'serious, important film' Revolutionary Road seemingly set out to be, in turn makes it feel less serious and important. However, such a wave of criticisms need not overshadow what is fundamentally still an incredibly powerful, moving and classy piece of work. Mendes' directorial capabilities have lost none of their stunning emotional clout, and he demonstrates a disconcerting skill to casually manipulate audience emotions. Whether provoking cries of frustration towards the annoyingly chirpy neighbours and their inability to come to terms with the Wheelers' plan to break out of suburban conformity and begin new, more fulfilling lives in Paris, or the crushing emotional anguish at the notion that such a beacon of hope may not end up becoming a reality, do not expect to shake the flooring aftertaste of the film for quite some time. Similarly, master cinematographer Roger Deakins' use of tight framing within close interiors creates an exquisitely subtle yet unbearably uncomfortable sense of claustrophobia, perfectly coupling the barely perceivable silent emotional scream of repression pervading the film. Finally, the film's unexpectedly unorthodox yet somehow fitting final shot is so mischievously welcome that it just about merits seeing the whole film in itself. Despite the hype, the genuinely masterful performances generated by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cannot be ignored, their shining chemistry both during romantic interludes and hysterical screaming fits creating a supremely affecting piece of interpersonal drama. Few sights are so disillusioning as seeing the enthusiastic, hopeful spark in the eyes of DiCaprio at the film's opening being replaced by a flinty, critical stare painfully shortly afterwards, encapsulating the impish youngster being swallowed up through a desire to fit in with the environment surrounding him. Similarly, Winslet's eyes denote a harrowing sadness which similarly becomes increasingly deadened, to the point of the viewer being hard pressed to avoid tears themselves, conventional narrative or not. The tremendous performances of the lead duo are well supported by the efforts of Kathy Bates, gleefully irritating yet crucially heart wrenching in turn as the Wheelers' chirpy neighbour. The explosive Michael Shannon barely holds back from chewing the scenery as Bates' son, recently released from a mental hospital, with Shannon's caustic tone perfect for his nonconformist character's bitter rants. Finally, Dylan Baker is a wryly delightful presence as DiCaprio's alcoholic co-worker who hides from the dismally monotonous workplace through drinks and witty criticisms.Despite being a class act on all fronts, Revolutionary Road is in essence just as cinematically hollow as the lifestyle depicted, offering little new to offer regarding its subject matter. Nonetheless, the exceptional cast and powerfully measured direction cannot be ignored, nor can the film's lingering emotional clout. Yet, one cannot help wishing for untrod territory to be explored, or at least for Mendes to stay away from suburbia for future cinematic offerings. -8/10",8,0,0,20 February 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A classy and entertaining sequel worthy to follow the first
","As is always the case, the fear of making a sequel to a very successful and well made movie would be that the sequel might turn out to be a pile of metaphorical... well let us say dinosaur feces, kill the franchise and ruin everyone's perception of the first film. Thankfully enough, when a director as high caliber as Steven Spielberg, who directed the first Jurassic Park film to colossal effect returns for the sequel, this is seldom the outcome. Such is the case here, as 'The Lost World' turns out to be a wonderfully made sequel, almost as entertaining a suspense ride as the first was, four years prior. In fact, in terms of quality of work, storyline and such, The Lost World is easily on par with the original Jurassic Park (if admittably somewhat of a structural re-hash of the first). The most noticeable complaint is that the novelty of such excellent special effects and the like has worn off somewhat, since after the original Jurassic Park, audiences had grown accustomed to having their minds blown due to technological feats and creature effects. But that's not to in any way downplay the quality of the special effects on display here, which still easily equals any modern technological achievements, and in fact is even more enjoyable than most of today's dime-a-dozen CGI bloated Blockbusters. The robotic and animatronic dinosaurs actually interact with actors like real dinosaurs would, and there is never that sense of the effects looking almost real, but never QUITE real that most modern computer effects seem to provide. It's great to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Ian Malcolm, the harried mathematician, and once again he manages to seem incredibly believable as the absent minded theorist trying awkwardly to interact with his daughter (newcomer Vanessa Lee Chester, who gives a terrific and very endearing performance, much better than the average child star) while remaining a strong lead all the while. Spielberg also managed to snap up a number of emerging stars in supporting performances, including Julianne Moore (spectacular and very lovable yet classy as always as Malcolm's field researcher girlfriend Sarah Harding), an early impressive performance from Vince Vaughn as wildlife photographer Nick Van Owen, character actors like the always enjoyable Pete Postlethwaite as hard edged safari hunter Roland Tembo, Peter Stormare as a sadistic enforcer who meets a righteous dirty end, and Arliss Howard as the snobby and greedy capitalist who also learns that messing with nature seldom turns out as well as predicted. Of course, it's wonderful to see Sir Richard Attenbourough also make an appearance once again as founder of the park, John Hammond, who manages to show how classy a performance one can make in only two scenes. All in all, The Lost World is quite the solid sequel, and definitely worth watching, especially for those who enjoyed the first film. From the beginning with a young British girl making acquaintance with a few unexpected prehistoric visitors on a beach to the obvious King Kong reference finish in San Francisco, Spielberg once again manages to draw us into the story, and find ourselves caring about the characters and being enthralled by the wonderful special effects and tense, exciting storyline once again. This Lost World definitely deserves to be found by those who have yet to do so. -8/10",8,2,3,2 August 2006
JFK," Flawed but intriguing rumination on political events
","No one could ever expect a cinematic representation of historical events to be completely objective - film is an indisputably subjective medium, and the 'voice' of the director and producers are bound to always shine through. But objectivity is one thing, and Oliver Stone is its polar opposite. Instead of Stone's powerhouse film-making style and fierce political convictions adding substance and energy to JFK, his take on the infamous assassination and its aftermath, it is Stone's self-righteous and self-indulgent hammering of the material that inhibit the film from being the intelligent and compelling political investigation piece it could have been. As it is, while JFK could be considered a solid thesis on Stone's perspective on the events, as a film it struggles to hold up amidst the torrent of its own flaws. Stone may never have had the pretense of disguising his perception of the events of the JFK assassination and the alleged ensuing conspiracy as cold hard fact, but he certainly seems determined to beat his audience over the head with his side of the story to the point of bewildered acceptance. Stone's incredibly forceful portrayal of his own perspective, pitching his film directly to heartfelt American sentiment (even going so far as to have Costner directly address the camera when speaking of American liberty) has the final outcome emerge as just a shade away from propaganda. Stone's work tends to attract a 'love it or hate it' reaction, but with a film this shamelessly self-congratulating and painfully biased, it is distinctly hard to love it, plaudits or not. Apart from Stone's own stance on the material, speaking strictly in film-making terms, JFK also finds itself lacking. Excruciatingly long and unreasonably 'talky' (especially near the film's climax, where Kevin Costner talks for literally half an hour straight... no joke) and making use of an abundance of unreasonably clichéd patriotic sequences enough to make one's stomach queasy, Stone's film is far too self-indulgent to make its proper effect. Seldom arises the complaint that a director needs to simplify their work, but given the relatively simple plot ensuing, Stone sure manages to complicate the hell out of it, clarified with a series of incredibly contrived play-by-plays by Garrison and his team. While it is abundantly clear that Stone has done his research on the case, and it is easy to get swept up in the story to a degree, one can't help but wish that he had not found it necessary to include every last scrap of information regarding it - as such, the film feels like it is overflowing at the seams with factual information, often thrust so rapid fire into the audience's face that they have no time to process or internalize it. It is a shame indeed that the content of the film is so disappointingly brought to life, as JFK's technical work is laudable indeed, making use of terrific cinematography and editing (although the initially effective montage sequences, complimented with real historical footage do grow tiresome after being steadily overused as the film progresses) even if the normally reliable John Williams' score overloads on patriotic musical clichés to a nauseating extent. The astonishing array of talented actors substantially raise the quality of the film as a whole. While Kevin Costner as patriotic American everyman DA Jim Garrison is bland at best, painfully trite at worst and unquestionably given far too much screen time, the wonderful supporting cast are more than enough to carry the dead weight of the film's lead. Tommy Lee Jones, in a distinctly different role from his usual casting is electrifying as ominous influential businessman Clay Shaw, with a cold menace simmering beneath his character's flamboyant exterior. Gary Oldman of course effortlessly steals the show as alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - seen mostly in flashbacks, Oldman's meticulous dedication in fully inhabiting his characters is used to chilling and compelling effect. Backed by dynamic performances from Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau, all superb when given their moment to shine, the film's supporting cast raises the bar in terms of quality considerably. Unfortunately, Sissy Spacek is wasted in a banal subplot as Garrison's wife, adding a nauseatingly by the numbers 'obsession endangers family life' theme to an already overlong film. As Stone dollops on the sap and Spacek overacts to her heart's content, backed up by absurdly untalented child actors as their children, the family sequences are among the film's most painful and unnecessary. Keeping in mind that appreciation of Oliver Stone's films does tend to be just as subjective as his own cinematic stance, it becomes difficult to dispute JFK being far too overlong, overstuffed with dialogue and bombarded by offensively clichéd sequences to be anywhere near as effective as it ought to have been. While intriguing in its presentation of a distinctly one sided rumination on the events following the assassination and complimented with brilliant technical work and impressive performances from its supporting cast, Stone's distinctive slant is what drags the film down from being the taut political work it could have been, resulting in a fact bloated, lopsided and self-indulgent portrayal of American history.-5/10",5,6,23,20 December 2007
Get Out," The Alt-Stepford
","Some people go to the movies for escapism - for a diversion; a well-deserved break from real life. Then there are those who frequent the cinema for elucidation of deeper truths, or explication unpacking sociopolitical concerns of the time. Somehow (somewhat amazingly), comedy veteran Jordan Peele has crafted a film perfectly geared to appeal to either camp - and as his directorial debut, to boot. Get Out is an unforgettable cinematic experience, tackling subtext almost eerily prescient in the wake of racially-motivated hate crimes, rallies, and dangerously escalating discrimination (both explicit and pervasively subtle. But, lest prospective viewers pass it by as a soapbox diatribe, Peele opts to frame his discourse through an ingeniously un-didactic psychological horror genre lens (think The Stepford Wives crossed with Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, thrown into a Hitchcockian Psycho blender, and churned with a table saw). It's fiendishly eloquent, but almost outlandishly absurdist. And it may be the most clever, bonkers, nail-biting, irreverently ingenious, and grimly fun time at the movies this year. If that sounds like a confusing cocktail of diametrically opposed elements it is. Yet, somehow, Peele shakes, stirs, and serves the perfect filmic entrée disguised as an aperitif, its roller-coaster ride of emotions and response somehow working seamlessly as an ingeniously homogeneous film. Social satire and the horror genre have long gone hand in hand (in fact, 'We all go a little mad sometimes' could practically serve as the tagline for the movie that is 2017 ), but Peele finds that true horror lies in the crushing weight of racially-motivated micro-aggressions sprinkled out by the caste of (sometimes) well-intentioned nouveau-liberals doing their best to counteract privilege by being a little too earnest in telling the only African American in the room that they would've voted for Obama for a third term if they could. Peele's satire may be barbed - perhaps too much so not to hit a nerve for some audiences - but its teeth are razor sharp, capturing the intricacies of moments of discomfort almost imperceptible apart from those experiencing them in both hysterical and cringe-worthy detail. His airtight script is succinct but extraordinarily precise, with dialogue rife with clever wordplay (watch for all of the seemingly innocent inclusions of the word 'black' in innocuous conversation) and coy foreshadowing so intricate the film practically necessitates repeat viewings to drink it all in. And just when you're engrossed in cackling and cringing under your breath at the savage Act 1 satire, Peele cordially reminds you that you're here watching a horror film - and hits you with no holds barred. Of course, he's never fully let you fully forget it, with a chillingly surreal prologue, and poetic flourishes sneakily maintaining a mood of general unease (protagonists Chris and Rose hit a deer on the way to visiting her parents in the countryside). Some of these are artsy piece of tone-setting foreshadowing. Some are playful red herrings. Some are both, with enough narrative bread crumbs scattered to elicit some painful 'I should've KNOWN!' face-palming in the third act for all but the most eagle-eyed viewers. And none are extraneous, all firmly in service of forwarding both the film's horror tropes and real-life horror intertexts in equal, grim measure. Case in point: 'the sunken place' - a bout of hypnosis-paralysis Chris is subjected to that has the film at its most claustrophobically terrifying while also providing a crushingly perfect metaphor for feeling consistently beaten down and repressed in a closeted discriminatory culture. As things take an increasingly chilling turn for the macabre (and Peele's pitch-perfect pacing stews tension to a frantic fever pitch with the effortless nonchalance of a seasoned veteran), Get Out's ultimate, rather sordid, gag is how easy it is to miss the forest for the trees. We find ourselves tempted, alongside Chris, to write off his spine-tingling experiences as paranoia (or the film artistically extrapolating on the experience of racial discrimination), when the reality could simply be that things are, in fact, so much worse than the fears a lifetime of living in 'polite society' has taught him to dismiss as overzealous. The realization starts witty, then becomes almost overwhelmingly sobering. And there's the definitive microcosmic distillation of the film's audience experience as a whole. Daniel Kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as Chris, establishing a baseline of perfectly affable nonchalance to make the rawness with which he radiates horror at the indignities he's increasingly subjected to all the more harrowing. Still, Kaluuya's work is too sophisticated for rote 'final girl' horror reactions, and a couple of left-turn character choices skirting obvious Hollywood moral choices keep Chris enigmatic enough to remain compelling throughout. Allison Williams is equally terrific, perfecting a peppy charisma with just enough of a highly-strung edge to ensure she equally dodges cliché throughout. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford embody that particular strain of friendliness that is somehow icier and more imperious with every smile to almost unnerving effect, while LilRel Howery is reliably hilarious, pulling double-duty as the film's bombastic comic relief and incredulous moral centre. Finally, Caleb Landry Jones infuses his inherent slithering creepiness into a drunken jock archetype to perfectly unnerving effect, while Stephen Root's warm eloquence provides a welcome foil to the tone-deaf effete posturing threatening to suffocate Chris. If ever there were a single film to distill the madness of the sociopolitical climate of the past year and make sense of it with acid wit and world-weary humour, it's Peele's unforgettable Get Out. It's psychological horror film as inventive and groundbreaking as it is sadistically playful. It's an unnervingly timely, walloping deconstruction of the intimate intricacies of privilege and prejudice for the 'I'm not racist, but...' crowd. In short, prospective viewers would do well to follow the advice of its title - Get Out of your house, routine, deeply entrenched mindset, and drink in what hindsight will invariably decree the most illustrative (and fiendishly enjoyable) film of the year. -10/10",10,11,21,17 September 2017
Ghost Rider," Ill conceived and patronizing disservice to the comic
","Any fan of the comic book source material, or anyone having briefly heard of the character could easily recognize the cinematic potential for the Ghost Rider myth. How could the tale of a stunt motorcyclist, tricked into selling his soul to save the life of his estranged father and unwillingly becoming the devil's bounty hunter ever translate as something less than a dark epic thriller? Well, fairly easily, it would seem, if all parties involved seem determined to ignore the biting intensity of the subject matter and bring the story to screen as a watered down, painfully predictable tale devoid of any redeeming factors or cinematic merit whatsoever, as is unquestionably the case here. Fans of the comic Ghost Rider, be prepared - this is not the Johnny Blaze you knew and loved, this is nothing more than an inexcusable Hollywood massacre.Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, who seemed to have such a firm grasp on all of the defining assets of his source material in Daredevil's dark tale of redemption seems to have thrown any sense he once possessed off the proverbial rooftop, as his abysmally weak screenplay is at best a confused, imbalanced muddle riddled with more clichés than would seem humanly possible. The plot holes and flaws in logic are large enough to drive Ghost Rider's chopper through, and the protagonist's demonic abilities are never explained, to the point where new abilities seem to be invented on the spot, simply for the purpose of furthering the plot. (how to defeat the wind demon? By using his flame tornado ability of course! What do you mean he's never shown evidence of such a power before, he's had it all along... really!) The fact that Johnson's script could have been considered passable is really a testament to Hollywood's recent trend of tossing anything into theaters, no matter how weak or inconsistent, to make a quick buck. And while the film, being a comic book action movie, may not have required a Pulitzer prize winning script to be a success, even in the action sequences the film seems rushed, ill conceived, and frankly just plain lazy, generating no tension or excitement whatsoever. The CGI is absurdly bad, to say the least - Ghost Rider himself boasts worse animation than most 1990s video games, and Blaze's transformation into the rider, which in the comics was a haunting and painful spectacle to behold, in the film is excruciatingly poorly done and mildly humorous. It goes without saying that the characters' abilities make for some fairly brief and uneventful battle sequences - Blackheart pokes people with his finger, and they die, whereas Ghost Rider simply stares them in the face, and they collapse, (the anticlimax is astounding...) whereas Blackheart's elemental sidekicks have such terrifying powers as being able to blow hard and drag Ghost Rider into a puddle of water... oh dear. How this could have been interpreted as even potentially enthralling is more frightening than any of the characters could ever hope to become in such a hackneyed mess. Despite star Nicolas Cage's fervent admiration for the character, he is all wrong for the role right from the start - his performance, at times strangely goofy and otherwise painfully melodramatic, never comes close to capturing the dark intensity appropriate for Johnny Blaze. The normally talented Eva Mendes fumbles through her lines without a trace of emotion, her purpose in the film sadly reduced to cheap eye candy. An absurdly miscast Peter Fonda makes for a laughable devil figure, complete with a ridiculous beehive hairdo and far too many knowing references to Easy Rider to ever be taken seriously or come across as even slightly intimidating. Character actor Wes Bently at least appears to be trying as malevolent demon Blackheart, but he is saddled with most of the worst lines in the film (which is saying a lot) and the freedom to seemingly either overact or underact whimsically, making for yet another disappointingly ineffective antagonistic figure. Only Sam Elliot escapes with a trace of dignity as the mysterious Caretaker, but his oh so stereotypical 'wise, grizzled mentor' role has frustratingly little purpose in the film, making his presence seem almost unnecessary. It is nothing less than a colossal disappointment to see such a talented cast reduced to a level of such frustrating mediocrity. It is really quite as mystery as to how Ghost Rider could have misfired so severely in almost every possible front. As the film wavers uncertainly between being patronizingly predictable and absurdly nonsensical, butchering the comic book source material in the process, it still has the gall to take itself too seriously to even embrace the potential of being enjoyable in the 'so bad it's good' sense. There is little good whatsoever in Ghost Rider, and apart from genuinely die-hard enthusiasts prepared to see the original character warped inexcusably or those in search of a thoroughly mindnumbing and unenthralling action romp, it would seem prudent to avoid the film at all costs, or succumb to a disappointment of (dare I say it?) hellish proportions. -3/10",4,0,2,5 August 2007
Room," 'This is the story you get'
","Here's the catch-22 with sexual violence: we need to talk about it, but we don't want to. Can you blame us? It's horribly omnipresent in society, but disturbingly easy to largely overlook out of convenience, between those shameful deniers who live in a sunshine-and-rainbow-unicorns world where only consensual sex happens, and those who are all too aware of the tragic rates of sexual assault, but wouldn't mind an understandable break from contemplating its awfulness. Factoring in all those folks, and the poor, article-challenged audiences wandering into the wrong screening carrying spoons and bellowing 'YOU'RE TEARING ME APAAAAAAART, LISA!!!', it wouldn't be a surprise to consider Room a hard-sell as a carefree Friday night at the movies. Thankfully, Irish-Canadian author-turned-screenwriter Emma Donoghue has neatly nipped the paradox in the bud by extending the 'only poetry can properly explicate the hidden depths of trauma' maxim to the next level. Room is innately a powerful, necessary, even beautifully moving story of suffering, survival, resilience, and rebuilding. But filtered through the eyes of a child? A masterpiece. Situating five-year old Jack as narrator not only raises the stakes to almost unbearable dimensions - not only must they survive and escape, but Jack must not know - but gives us a far less graphic or painful 'indirect narrator' through which to focalize and make sense of the nuances of his and his Ma, Joy's imprisonment. Director Lenny Abrahamson allows Jack's whimsical boisterousness to shape the film, and the cameras and music mirror his exuberant attention span, bouncing around every corner of the enclosed set with the lilting dance of a surrealist fairy tale. Abrahamson imbues his film with such life that it's easy to empathize with Jack believing Room to be the entirety of existence beyond the fantasies of heaven and TV (and all without any of the tacky, exploitative FX interludes of Peter Jackson's take on The Lovely Bones). There is darkness here as well, even if Jack may not understand the full ramifications of the ominous creaking ensuing from the weekly visits from their grimy caretaker, but his accepting this as part of the fabric of life, in turn, makes it easier for us to bear as well, without lessening the traumatic context in the slightest. In fact, Abrahamson handles the first half of Room with such deft, immaculate precision that we're too busy in survival mode to fully let it all sink in. Cherishing each fleeting scrap of Jack and Ma's happiness, and bemoaning the petty squabbles which infest their relationship, there's almost a palpable feeling of 'if we keep it together and hold on, they will too'. It's only upon Jack's escape - and I dare you to find a more unbearably tense sequence in recent memory - and immersion into the overstimulating sensory flurry of an outside world he previously disavowed the existence of, that we start to feel release. It's only when we are given threads of hope to cling to - that Jack could bounce back, and actually be okay - that we, like Ma, are permitted to finally break, to let go, to grieve, and to rejoice. Donoghue's piercing, conversational screenplay teases out the ripple effects of Jack and Joy's release with gently unflinching care: the inevitable madhouse of paparazzi attention; Jack has no conception of how to play with toys, and requires sunscreen at all times due to his skin's lack of outdoor exposure; Joy's father, who cannot look at his grandson out of what he represents (wonderful William H. Macy at his most heartbreakingly earnest); her mother and new partner desperately striving for normalcy (the pristinely warm and sturdy Joan Allen and Tom McCamus). And just when we start clawing for a continual crescendo of hope, we're subjected to a talk show host interviewing Joy with a winsome, rage-inducing, abominable lack of tact Harry Potter fans will immediately associate with the similarly despicable Dolores Umbridge. Who knew Donoghue could conjure up a character more hateable than Joy's rapist. But, deft plotting and immaculate directing aside, Room as a triumphant two-hander. Brie Larson, having just closed an awards circuit with a hat-trick of accolades, still manages to exceed expectations with an incomparably brave performance, allowing her to play strong, vibrant, caring and clever, but brittle, frayed, and, essentially, very young - often all with a single look, or defeated slouch. Still, Room is Jack's story, and eight-year old Jacob Tremblay carries the film with an overwhelming talent unseen in almost any of his older contemporaries. There's never a moment of Jack that doesn't feel agonizingly real, and Tremblay's use of eye contact, or avoidance thereof, allows so much of a richer entry point into Jack's soul than even his endearingly shrill voice and fidgety physicality - he plays Jack as fundamentally unshowy and real, and is all the more captivating amidst the absurd circumstances he's surrounded by. It's arguably the most impressive performance of the year, and will unquestionably stand the test of time as one of the most powerful child actor performances ever captured on film. Unassuming and harrowingly stripped-down, hugely emotional, yet never false or saccharine, Room was a quieter entry into the 2015 awards circuit, yet by far the year's most haunting and essential work. It's utterly devastating, and yet, in unexpected ways, also certain to make your world a little brighter. When we, alongside Jack and Joy, say 'bye' to Room, it's with a similar mixture of a heavy heart, tears, and unsettling regret that we let go of a world so horrific yet beautiful. Room reminds us to appreciate and cherish what's dear - and where better to start than with such an unforgettably human piece of cinema. -10/10",10,2,5,6 March 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Stories that matter
","The Two Towers - aka: 'the one that usually gets mostly skipped during a LOTR marathon'. Perhaps a film that was continuously mistakenly referred to as 'Lord of the Rings: The Twin Towers' released the year after 9/11 was always going to have a bit of a rough go standing out amidst the splashier, more gratifying bookending acts of its franchise. It's obviously still a masterpiece - no one disputes that - but, being heavier on the action, hardship, and lacking major punctuations of narrative momentum, definitively the black sheep of the trilogy (notice the lack of Empire Strikes Back comparisons from those talking' Tolkien). But this marginalization isn't fair, as it overlooks how much The Two Towers does accomplish - arguably, the subtlest, cleverest film of the trilogy - and how indispensable it is to the meat of Tolkien's triumph. If Fellowship is all about 'why we fight' with its vision of the joyful, utopian tranquility of the Shire worth preserving at all costs, and Return of the King is all about triumphant closure, The Two Towers has the tricky task of being the 'the night is darkest before the dawn' hump of the trilogy, establishing the full scope and ripple-effects of the battle for Middle Earth, and how crucial victory is for an increasingly fleshed-out world. Jackson takes this to heart - fittingly, The Two Towers is literally darker, filtered through barren browns and blueish-greys. This darkness also amps up the violence in the notoriously most action-heavy of the trilogy. At the point where Bilbo was extolling the virtues of pipe weed in Fellowship, in The Two Towers, we're greeted with a pile of steaming, charred orc bodies and heads on stakes, having just waded through the massacre of a helpless village, and an interlude of orc cannibalism. Yum. But Two Towers isn't just viscerally grim: it also delves the most into addiction subtext. Andy Serkis' sublime, show-stealing work conveying the schizophrenic eager puppy dog and warped spitefulness of Gollum (including Frodo's tearful plea regarding why he has to believe Gollum can be saved) and Rohirrim King Théoden (proud, powerful Bernard Hill) withering at the hands of the seedy Wormtongue (the sickeningly perfect Brad Dourif) allow for quieter, moving moments of pathos amidst the more grandiose macro conflicts. It's also easily the most political, with the Ents vs. Isengard vignette proudly hammering (ha) Tolkien's anti- industrialization theme, while Treebeard's Entmoot conference is a deliciously sly parody of the slowness and inefficiency of bureaucracy in crisis situations, especially when intercut with the ferocious battle of Helm's Deep. Meanwhile, the Rohan refugee crisis has a distressingly topical political urgency of its own, keeping a human face on the devastation of Sauron and Saruman's machinations.That said, this is still the same movie where Viggo Mortensen makes out with a horse. Astutely aware of the heaviness at play, Jackson mines for comedy respites whenever he can, with many thanks to John Rhys-Davies' 'Gimli the comic relief dwarf', while Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd may as well be playing Harold and Kumar given Merry and Pippin's glut of pipe weed gags. It's a testament to all their exemplary work that their characters still integrate loveably rather than feeling gratuitous. Similarly, the fight scenes are as exhilarating as can be, with the warg fight and Ents releasing the river each invoking cathartic roars of joy, while the rain-drenched battle of Helm's Deep is a classic setpiece of vintage war tension (the opening Gandalf/Balrog plummeting fight is also fun, but a weirdly video- game-y note to open with).Jackson, now faced with cross-cutting between parallel story lines, masterfully keeps track of his overwhelming deluge of story while keeping the pace ticking. While the dour whininess of the Frodo/Sam segments do grate over time (perhaps the resonant work by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin conveys suffering too well), the addition of Gollum and, later, Faramir (the subtly magnetic David Wenham) keep the dynamic interesting. The new cast all shine in their respective moments, including Miranda Otto's feisty, lovestruck Eowyn, and Karl Urban's bold Eomer, while Ian McKellen finds interesting notes of metaphysical remove to play as the resurrected Gandalf, and Viggo Mortensen makes every beat of his hero's journey achingly, inspiringly empathetic. All the while, Middle Earth is as sumptuously gorgeous as ever (a panoramic shot of Rohan framed by the mountains with Howard Shore's soulful single violin theme in the background is arguably one of the most beautiful in the trilogy), while the CGI remains seamlessly magnificent (Treebeard in particular is a gloriously detailed creation, each notch of bark and creak of movement stunningly realized, while the Ringwraith's 'winged beasts' are also fearfully entertaining creatures). Then comes the final payoff: a montage of triumphant victory between Helm's Deep and the conscientiously objecting Ents turned Isengard-flooding activists, coupled with a show-stopping, tearjerking speech about 'stories that really matter' speech by Sean Astin. It's a long time coming, and the film's middle lags in anticipation of it, but dear god is it worth the wait - an inspiring triple-whammy that brings the house down more than almost any other moment in the trilogy. All of the immaculate, dazzlingly intricate visuals, blood-pumping combat and moving characters aside, it's these moments that really sell the soaring, larger-than-life, transcendent emotionality of the franchise. And this is why, black sheep or not, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers remains classic movie magic, and one of the most essential, incompatible films of all time. -10/10",10,0,1,8 February 2016
Schindler's List," Sears itself into the memory - both emotionally flooring and undeniably uplifting
","Films detailing the tragic events of the Holocaust more often than not tend to descend into ill-advised and horrifyingly clichéd anti-war lectures, so the notion of Steven Spielberg, debatably the founding father of the blockbuster, helming a WW2 epic may not always have been an ideal prospect, for fear that the gritty realism of the period may have been lost beneath a shiny veneer of Hollywood gloss. Needless to say, such doubts are near instantly dispelled upon viewing Schindler's List, which, while refusing to shy away from the horrific realism of the period, manages to extract moments of genuine glimmering hope out of the darkness, managing to stand out as both one of the most emotionally draining yet exhilarating and uplifting films of its kind. Dispelling all potential skepticism, Spielberg proves himself entirely the right man for the job, and Schindler's List is arguably one of his very strongest and most effective films to date. The film sears itself into the viewer's memory, with many haunting images proving inescapable, from the jarring sound of sporadic Nazi gunshots to the despairing moan of thousands of Jews crowded into a ghetto. Spielberg's effortless manipulation of the audience's emotions is laudable indeed, as is his masterful pacing between the atrocities of war and the small moments of comfort which prevent the film from descending into complete darkness. Complimented by a typically moving and beautiful musical score by John Williams, the film perfectly counterbalances despair with hope, creating a truly compelling and moving portrait of one of humanity's darker hours. The historical accuracy of the film is similarly laudable - the immaculate period costumes and expansive set design are pitch perfect, and all beautifully rendered in pristine black and white cinematography, a refreshing diversion from the colour saturated contemporary film industry. And while the film's hefty three and a quarter hour running time may be a source of complaint, it serves only to further immerse the audience within the context and period, allowing the emotional drama to resonate all the more. It would seem Spielberg was not content to simply provide audiences with a film, and instead settles for an experience - an emotional epic with an uncanny ability to draw an audience in, capture their sympathies and churn them out with a tear in their eye yet a smile on their face in a nearly peerless fashion. And despite the film's undeniable occasional forays into melodrama and cliché (Schindler's breakdown near the end, tearfully declaring that he could have saved more is a bit much...) it is difficult to turn one's nose up at so captivating and heartfelt a film as this. Liam Neeson gives a career defining performance as the benevolent Oskar Schindler, and his gentle charisma and subtle intensity perfectly compliment the many facets (womaniser, enterpriser and saviour of thousands of innocent lives) of such a monumental role. Ben Kingsley is similarly impressive as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish manager of Schindler's factory. In a role which would normally entail typical Hollywood grandstanding, Kingsley instead embraces the realism of the character with subtly churning emotions, and his performance is all the more masterfully crafted as consequence. However, despite the stellar work of the main two stars, both pale in comparison with the magnetic Ralph Fiennes, effortlessly stealing the show as impassive yet impulsively murderous Nazi official Amon Goeth. Fiennes' chilling intensity is truly a spectacle to behold, and it is nearly worth seeing the film just for his performance - one of the most haunting, but ultimately human antagonistic faces ever associated with the Holocaust. Caroline Goodall gives a strong performance as Schindler's neglected wife, and Embeth Davidtz is genuinely moving as Helen Hirsch, a Jewish slave working who attracts the fancy of the monstrous Goeth. Throughout the years, Schindler's List has been widely celebrated as one of the most powerful, draining yet uplifting films in recent memory, and upon viewing it, this status is difficult to contend. While the film may toe the line of melodrama at times, and the running time may be enough to dispel some potential viewers, the blistering emotional clout and historical poignancy make Spielberg's labour of love easily worth watching for anyone willing to undergo the admittably difficult and draining watch. Out of all the second world war films out there, Schindler's List stands out as debatably the most engrossing and ultimately uplifting of the lot, proving that in the midst of darkness and despair, genuine human emotion can still be celebrated. -10/10",10,9,13,17 October 2007
Across the Universe," Let It Be
","Certain films are bound to be hyped to the point of unreasonably high expectations, and Across the Universe proves a perfect example. Right from its conception, the film boasted immense promise - the notion of a musical populated entirely by songs by The Beatles and the astonishing psychedelic visual effects demonstrated in early trailers promised an impressive feat indeed. And while Across the Universe may not prove to be a life altering experience, it is an unquestionably innovative and visually stunning take on the musical genre, and a comprehensive enough overview of sixties teen culture, well complimented by the Beatles soundtrack.One's enjoyment of Across the Universe may vary based on what one's expectations for the film are. The majority of complaints regarding the film have been in regards to the allegedly shallow and feeble plot. While it is true that the storyline is not the most monument in recent memory, as is the case for many musicals, the story is structured primarily to drive the film from one musical number to the next, and as such, it is a rousing success. Initially presented as a more conventional teen romance (complimented well by The Beatles' earlier cheery love ballads) the film's tranquility doesn't last for long before it is plunged into some of the darkest themes of the sixties: the Vietnam war, political rebellion, protests, riots, teen alienation and experimentation with drugs, fitting well with much of the Beatles' later and bleaker works. Despite the subject matter presented toeing being fairly familiar for those with any knowledge of the decade, the script mirrors the content and changing tone of the Beatles songs admirably, and the outcome is an overall positive one, even if the emotional tension does fall flat on occasion. And while not always integrated as seamlessly into the plot as one might hope for, the musical interludes themselves are simply flooring - the visual effects are breathtaking and director Julie Taymor demonstrates an eye for colour and composition which would seem more befitting of an experimental art painting, let alone a mainstream musical. Both the psychedelic drug-induced interludes and the regular numbers boast an inventive and energetic choreography and a slew of distinctive visual styles, with Taymor drawing beauty out of the most mundane of situations, such as a football team tackling each other in slow motion morphing into a surreal but fascinating aerial dance sequence. The cast perform admirably, effortlessly underlining their brilliant singing voices with suitable emotional resonance. While many of their parts may fall dangerously close to archetypes, the cast manage to infuse new energy and interest into their roles. Relative newcomer Jim Sturgess is a noteworthy discovery indeed as British dockworker Jude, and he proves a more than adequate dramatic leading man as well as phenomenal singer. Evan Rachel Wood's Lucy, the upper class American girl turned war protester may be slightly underwritten, but her natural charisma and genuinely beautiful singing voice easily make up for an occasionally shallow character. Great support is provided by Joe Anderson as rebellious draft victim Max, Dana Fuchs as spunky rock singer Sadie and Martin Luther McCoy as JoJo - a guitarist not unlike Jimi Hendrix. The film also showcases amusing cameos from a nearly unrecognisable Bono as a cowboy hat sporting hippie singing 'I am the Walrus', and Eddie Izzard as a very memorable Mr. Kite during his titular psychedelic circus song number. Fans of the Beatles have much to enjoy from the inspired and beautifully sung covers, as well as frequent references and in-jokes to their works (some tasteful, and some groan-worthy, such as the many hammer cracks to the character Max). While the storyline may cover very familiar ground, it does make for a compelling enough template for the key events of the late 1960s, and mirrors the spectacular musical numbers spectacularly. Treating Across the Universe as a narrative Beatles concert, aided by some truly astonishing visual effects will likely yield the most satisfying and enjoyable effect. At any rate, it is refreshing indeed to see such experimentation with the cinematic form and the musical genre, especially when it yields a result this satisfying. -8/10",8,1,4,14 November 2007
I Am Legend," Sombre, chillingly effective sci-fi
","With a chaotic history (originally bandied about as a Ridley Scott/Arnold Schwarzenegger collaboration and later a Michael Bay film) and itself another incarnation of author Richard Matheson's classic science-fiction novel, one would hardly have been surprised to see I am Legend join the ranks of once promising but ultimately diluted science-fiction melded into vomit-inducing video game spin-offs. Thankfully, director Francis Lawrence and his film-making team attacked their subject matter with a mature and distinguished outlook, taking what could have easily become routine horror tripe and instead crafting a haunting, disconcerting portrait of a heroic man's steadily fracturing psyche whilst living in the shadow of a crumbling city. Director Lawrence demonstrates a superlative grasp on generating tension and suspense, making disconcertingly good use out of darkness and silence to craft a genuinely frightening atmosphere almost unseen in the majority of the film's hyper-kinetic video game spin-off contemporaries. The consistently palpable sense of tension and unease throughout is particularly gripping, as Lawrence resists the temptation to fall back upon typical, contrived scares and instead opts for a quieter, more unnerving tone, and the film is all the more effective as consequence. Unfortunately, the source of such fear proves to be disappointingly weak, as the computer generated 'infected' creatures prove to be far too poorly animated to be taken seriously. Where the use of actual live action actors with makeup would likely have been far more satisfying, instead the film presents its audience with computer generated howling monsters which would hardly look out of place in any early 2000s console game. Lawrence makes far more frightening use out of the unseen than the seen, as most blisteringly tense sequences end on a sour note with such poorly conceived antagonists. The script overall is a deceptively clever one, rising above the ranks of mindless monster horror gorefests the film will inevitably draw comparisons to. But I am Legend proves to be far too reflective and clever to fall prey to such trappings, and instead the action sequences are far and between (though blisteringly intense, making them all the more effective in their sparsity), while the film for the most part is content to focus on protagonist Robert Neville, steadily losing his mind and his purpose. And while the concept of Neville staying sane in complete isolation for so long may strain credulity, such complaints are scarcely enough to dampen the perverse fascination and enjoyment provoked by his situation, as the monotony, loneliness, hopelessness and constant sense of threat of Neville's life are believably conveyed, as his precariously designed life gradually unwinds around him. The expansive shots of vacant New York are tremendously powerful and moving, and the film practically drips with fatalism and hopelessness (flashback sequences detailing a chaotic mass evacuation of New York are particularly poignant and chilling when intercut with the bleak future). As such, it is all the more disappointing when near its latter half the film descends into more conventional and familiar horror action ground, as its conventional culmination feels like a letdown in a film which begins in such fresh, uncommonly clever and captivating territory. The concept of a film being carried by essentially a single actor would normally prove a daunting prospect, but the tremendously charismatic Will Smith proves easily up to the challenge. Deprived of the opportunity for his typical 'Will Smith' humour (though certain sly comedic moments do make their way in), Smith delivers an enormously engaging and often tragic and poignant performance as Robert Neville, sole survivor of the virus desperately attempting to find a cure. With only a dog, several mannequins and the occasional mutated creature sharing the screen with him, Smith's performance is easily worth a viewing in itself, providing sufficient emotional heart to keep the film aloft. The supporting cast are less laudable, as Alice Braga delivers a disappointingly flat performance as a fellow survivor, and Salli Richardson fails to make much of a mark as Smith's former wife, shown in frenzied flashback sequences, which also feature an adorable role from Smith's daughter Willow. Emma Thompson however makes a memorable impact in a cameo role as the creator of the seemingly miraculous virus, and one can only wish that her character was developed further throughout the narrative. Unusually reflective and subdued, yet with sufficient horror action to entertain its demographic, I am Legend surpasses the vast majority of its predecessors for refusing to dumb down its subject matter, and deliver a thoughtful, affecting portrait of a man in isolation as well as a gripping horror romp. While it may delve into cliché as the narrative develops, Lawrence's sturdy, unsettling directing and Smith's blistering performance are enough to raise the film's quality far above what it could have far too easily become in the hands of less talented craftsmen. -8/10",8,0,1,12 February 2008
A Quiet Place," Nailed it
","In December 2017, AMC theatres throughout the United States posted a notice outside screenings of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, cautioning audiences that the film contained a 10 second segment with absolutely no sound, and that this was a deliberate artistic choice, rather than a technical error (sigh). It's easy to imagine John Krasinski nearly having a heart attack (or perhaps gleefully chuckling) in the final stages of editing A Quiet Place, imagining the bedlam he was about to unleash on mass audiences that terrified of the sound of silence. A cinematic Occam's razor at its finest, A Quiet Place is an unassuming genre masterpiece: an ingeniously simple conceit whittled down to its core essentials (think High Noon, but with less talking and more ravenous monsters with dangerously good hearing). It's told with such care, compassion, and furious gusto that, as I write this, an hour and a half after watching, my entire body still aches from 90s minutes of perennially tensing up in captivated terror. Frights and fun aside, Krasinski's work is actually a thing of beauty, by the sheer act of shackling his audience down and forcing them to really listen. His film's sound editing is fiendishly simple, but damned if you don't tear shreds out of your theatre armrests with each crinkle of a falling leaf, or the faintest creak of a swaying door. Watching the film live in a theatre is a precarious experience, all too easily ruined by an audience unwilling to buy into the covenant of shared cinematic silence, where the slightest rustle or crunch of popcorn (let alone that most egregious of sins: a cell phone) feels almost profane in its intrusion. But, that blissful moment of a room full of people collectively holding their breath to the proverbial pin drop extent each time the film cuts the volume to nil is unforgettably powerful (and, yes, extremely deliberate and artistic). In short: Krasinski has made a film so painfully tense that it feels dangerous to breathe. No Hollywood contrivances or asininely unmotivated horror here; not a scrap of unnecessary apocalypse exposition or thematic spoon-feeding. Just robust, honest storytelling at its finest, and an incessant sense of genuine, palpable threat throughout, balanced by moments so tenderly human it hurts. In Krasinski's hands (and playfully sadistic sense of foreshadowing), the most innocent child's toy or household item becomes a horrifying set piece unto itself - or an unexpected vessel for hope or peace amidst the omnipresent threat. Charlotte Bruus Christensen's creeping cinematography is exquisitely claustrophobic, lurking through and pillaging each nook and cranny of the inventively average farmhouse setting. Visual effects are used sparingly but effectively, lending just enough unique touches to an otherwise somewhat familiar creature design to make them feel sufficiently fresh and nightmarish. Rounding out the package, Marco Beltrami's musical score is as mercifully sparse as it is brutally chilling in its single drone simplicity. But the film truly transcends genre not just as a flooring sensory experience, and feature-length jump-scare of the most authentic, least cheap variety. It's also, quite surprisingly, achingly emotional and daringly sweet - a tender, sincere tale of resilience, love, family, and quiet heroism in the face of unthinkable odds. Needless to say, the central foursome of Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe perform the hell out of it with universally superb, committed, and unspeakably (ha) loveable work across the board. If there's a single nit to pick, it's that the film leans pretty hard on conventional gender norms - but each character feels too authentic and heartfelt to succumb to stereotypes, with enough surprises and inversions along the way to keep things from reverting to full-on frontier mythology. Krasinski doesn't mess around with his storytelling, and we never once doubt the fact that no one is ever, ever safe. And we care for these nearly wordless people so damn much, that the constant, unwavering threat of losing them is agonizing.I'd continue to wax poetic about A Quiet Place, but, the sound of my keyboard clattering away in the silence of my apartment is starting to make the hairs on my arms stand up. Just know that, by way of closing note, I'm emphatically crossing my forearms in an 'x' across my chest. Which, as we're oft reminded here, is sign language for 'love.' -10/10",10,2,8,10 April 2018
School of Rock," Great music, funny kids, infectiously energetic Black... what's not to love?
","I have to admit, my initial impression of School of Rock was not a good one. When it was first released, I had though it would be one of those turgid family 'comedies' if the term can even be used to describe the horrible predictable messes they usually turn out to be, a-la Rebound and R.V. However, once I was finally persuaded to go see it, my mind was blown as to how very wrong I was. It's true, the subject matter is very limited and the premise seemed very questionable: an over the hill rocker (Black) intercepts his roommate's call to be a substitute teacher for a class of private school kids, poses as his roommate to make some money, and ends up teaching the class about the art of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and turning the entire class into a rock band, with the intent of competing in the local battle of the bands competition. It may sound silly and unbelievable, but the lesson learned here is never underestimate the amazing talents of director Richard Linklater and star Jack Black. School of Rock seemed to be yet another quirky edition to Linklater's extremely varied resumé, going from serious romantic dramas like 'Before Sunrise' to lowbrow stoner comedies such as the underrated 'Dazed and Confused'. But Linklater for whatever reason turned out to be the perfect choice to pull School of Rock together, making the very best possible use of the source material and even managing to make a bunch of young kids funny. This would normally be a painful process and even more painful result, but surprisingly enough the kids are actually really funny, and get a fair amount of side-splitting punch lines. This is an accomplishment in film-making itself, without even mentioning the colossal force of the film's star: Jack Black.I suppose it would really be a matter of taste, but these days it would seem Jack Black is without question one of the most watchable performers in the industry. It is true that he goes shamelessly over the top with boundless enthusiasm, but for whatever reason instead of completely falling flat, his energy is ultimately infectious, and makes you want to be rolling around on the floor, hooting hollering and busting out a violent air guitar solo with him. Black has launched quite the successful career off the success of this movie, and upon viewing his recent popularity is no surprise. There's a very likable quality about Black, even when playing a complete washed up feckless loser he still manages to capture our hearts with his cheeky, infectious enthusiasm. This goes without mentioning the guy has the best use of eyebrows since Jack Nicholson - indeed, it would seem Black can do no wrong. But although Black is without question the star of the movie, and the main attraction as well, he is not the only talent on display here: the music itself also plays a huge part in the story, and is worth the price of a rental just to listen to the soundtrack, with clips from classic Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and the Doors, not to mention Black's new humorous concoctions such as singing 'Math is a wonderful thing' when trying to convince the stuffy headmistress, (Joan Cusack, hilarious and also very much worth seeing) that he is in fact teaching the class through song. There's also a funny little role from writer Mike White as Black's roommate, the wonderfully named Ned Schneebly, and Cusack herself has moments where she threatens to outdo Black. The wonderful cast pull off the material brilliantly and again help to raise the quality bar even more. School of Rock may have sounded like a bomb waiting to explode, but in the end it turned out marvelously infectious and one of the best feel good and laugh out loud movies of the year. Black is nothing less than superb, a force of comedy nature waiting to be reckoned with, and the kids even manage to be funny and show some genuine acting (as well as musical) ability. The music itself of course is worth checking out the entire movie for, as it features one of the best soundtracks in recent history. Safe to say School of Rock is very much worth the viewing, even for those who aren't fans of Rock music, you are unlikely to be disappointed.-8/10",8,1,2,11 June 2006
Kick-Ass," As apt and representative a title as any
","To paraphrase Zoolander: 'Superheroes - they're so hot right now'. And perhaps it is its chasing such a tide of success that makes Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass - part introspective examination of the 'real world' angle of superheroism and part joyful addition to the genre crammed with enough violence and questionable content to gleefully rattle the bars of political correctness - vaguely less remarkable than had it been released five to ten years prior. This is not to say that the quality of an otherwise outstanding movie is lowered simply due to the year of its release date (to fail to appreciate the comedic marvel that is Vaughn's film would be a spoiled audience indeed) but rather that the popularity of the genre which procured a mass release for such edgy material also somewhat does it a disservice in the sense of setting a standard one inevitably hopes the film will supersede, perhaps unrealistically. As such, those anticipating Kick-Ass providing thematic ruminations on the pros and cons of comic book culture and the repercussions of heroism in a 'real', internet age to exceed (or even equal) those of other such reflexive texts such as Watchmen may be disappointed. While the film introduces many such queries, they are often left under-explored, leaving the film feeling somewhat thematically weak as well as not quite managing to 'say' anything exceptionally innovative in reference to its genre. But let's be honest - one would be hard pressed finding the average audience member to lamenting the lack of truly in-depth genre existentialism to the point of ignoring kinetic fight scenes, and such notions as theme, while interesting, feel largely incidental in favour of the film's sense of high-octane fun. Kick-Ass is a film which truly delivers what it promises, from carrying over the glorious carnage and hilarity of its preview material to living up to its title. Nonetheless, as riotously enjoyable as the film is, such a quality does again provide a niggling complaint - the film is awesome, granted, but always just as awesome as one would expect, rather than truly taking audiences off guard or pushing the envelope well past the point of hype. You do get what you pay for, for better or for worse.Thankfully, what you pay for is almost resoundingly for better. Despite a slow start in which the film riffs a touch too obviously on established superhero films (particularly Sam Raimi's Spider-Man), toeing the line of 'Epic Movie' style winks at times, Vaughn quickly finds his momentum and subsequently ramps up the pace, mayhem and fun to satisfying overdrive. With a fascinating colour aesthetic (contrasting the murky greys and browns of the city with the Crayola Technicolour of the heroes) and delightfully whimsical and effective musical score (often setting brutal violence or slapstick humour to classical music, achieving an innovative stylistic deadpan) and a snappy script keeping the tone lively, Vaughn's film demonstrates plenty to love and appreciate. But then come the fight scenes. Whirling cascades of intricate choreography, gritty brutality (particularly Kick-Ass' first attempts at combating crime) and blazing gunfire (particularly jarring for a superhero film) intertwining to become some of the most simultaneously cathartic, uncomfortable yet gleefully fun violent interludes in recent cinema, managing to both mock and relish the sadistic fun of movie violence, and ramping up to one of the most ludicrously enjoyable final payoff showdowns in ages. Kick- Ass could almost function as an exploration of the role and purpose of cinematic violence as much as comic book culture, but whether treated as probing or entertaining, Vaughn's hard- hitting tone is exceedingly difficult to shake or to not enjoy.Particular quality is extracted from the film's magnificent cast, as charismatic rising star Aaron Johnson effortlessly delivers overblown goofiness while remaining intensely likable as the titular Kick-Ass, warmly centring the film whether as exasperated nerd or wide-eyed superhero. Christopher Mintz-Plasse adds a welcome wounded resentment to his customary gawky cockiness as spoiled rich kid superhero Red Mist, and the reliable Mark Strong offers another creation of credibly stern villainy. However, the film's real triumph lies in its unlikely background heroes. Nicholas Cage shreds expectations with sublimely hilarious work as Batman-ripoff heroic patriarch 'Big Daddy', his performance pitched perfectly between manic hysteria and hokey charm (and a voice deliciously pantomiming Adam West's unforgettable fragmented Batman dialect). Equally, Chloe Grace Moretz is a comedic revelation, stealing the show as hard-as-nails vigilante Hit-Girl, and never failing to astound with exactly how far her role will push the boundaries of political correctness. Vaughn also collects a bevy of background players who deliver compelling characterisations for a change, the only exception being Lyndsy Fonseca as Kick-Ass' romantic interest, who, despite a charming performance, feels like an ultimately mishandled and incidental character, decentring the film's emotional arc somewhat. Wild, wacky and daring, Kick-Ass triumphs through managing to dredge up genuine heart, exhilaration and sentiment in the midst of occasional contrivance or excessive convention. A definitive comment on or twist of the superhero genre? Not quite. An enormous array of pulsating, tremendous fun (ultimately the point of the picture)? A vehement and blood- spattered 'HELL YES'! -8.5/10",9,2,11,28 April 2010
Gran Torino," Eastwood's towering performance rises above a rare directorial misfire
","Clint Eastwood's film-making career has led credulity to the cliché that some things only get better with age, showing a transcendent self-awareness and reflective grasp for supremely genuine emotional storytelling and allegorical commentary on America, and the steadily fading beacons of past moral values. As such, it is difficult to envision a more fitting cinematic project than Gran Torino, addressing traditional Eastwood themes of age, morality and changing times through an unrepentant racist of a protagonist forced to rethink his prejudices when confronted with close interaction of a Hmong teenager after an attempted theft of his prized 1972 Gran Torino. However, despite all initial signs looking exceptionally promising (with Eastwood's vicious growl of 'GET OFF MY LAWN' in the film's trailer delightfully hearkening back to the days of Dirty Harry sadistic cool), it is all the more disappointing to see Gran Torino somewhat miss its mark, falling short of the modern masterpiece it easily could have been. While the juxtaposition of Eastwood's snarling Korean war vet with his neighbours of various ethnicities could have offered for fascinating social commentary and an intriguing allegorical subtext for the state of American culture (using Eastwood's grizzled Walt Kowalski as symbolic for old fashioned values becoming increasingly outnumbered by exterior cultural influences and changing societal values - the American dream of a hard working family man not subverted, but shown to be worn out and fading continually out of touch), Nick Schenk's screenplay far too often only scratches at the surface instead of embracing such themes, an oversimplified bundle chock full of stock stereotypes and unconvincing supporting characters to drive its potentially poignant point home. There are moments which hint at the mature cultural reflection dancing continually out of reach (feeling old and out of touch, Kowalski snarls to himself that he has more in common with his similarly marginalized Hmong neighbours than his materialistic, self-serving sons), but such complexity is not readily apparent on the whole.The film is by no means un-enjoyable, particularly as an old-fashioned morality tale and odd- couple bonding story (the interplay between Kowalski and his unwitting apprentice Thao has many delightfully hilarious moments), but not as profound or resonant as it feels it should be - an important commentary on gang violence, among others, falls flat due to being pursued through frustrating stereotypes. As such, Eastwood's film lacks the tidy trimming of plot his other features demonstrate, starting out strong but quickly lapsing into cliché and unbelievable characterisation, eventually simply feeling overlong, somewhat rambling and lacking of clear resolution and purpose. Some scenes, beyond simply feeling unnecessary, come across as seemingly unintentionally hilarious (Kowalski's teaching Thao to 'man up' by embracing ideologies of cars, hard work - preferably in the trades - and heterosexual romance) in fashion which at times feels a directorial satirical wink, suggesting such traditional values are increasingly fading and out of touch, were it not for Eastwood's emotional focus feeling uncertainly positioned, making the viewer feeling inclined to root for a position they would normally feel inclined to chuckle at. Furthermore, the treatment of Kowalski himself carries many elements of (seemingly unintentional) near self-parody, acknowledging Eastwood's baggage as a cultural icon, but instead of tastefully incorporating it into the story or subverting it, the image becomes overblown to an almost comical extent at times - as much as the viewer wants to see 78 year old Eastwood beat up gang members, the credibility of it, trained Korean vet or not, is still questionable. The film is also let down by a sagging third act, with an ending grasping at raw sentiment but ending up with excessive sap, and the potentially poignant use of Clint Eastwood himself grumble-singing the film's title tune over the ending credits comes across as less self-reflexively beautiful and more unintentionally silly than it should be.As such, Eastwood's own performance is not only the main draw of the film, but ultimately its only real draw. However, despite narrative and directorial shortcomings, he as a performer more than carries the slack - his triumphant rendition of unrepentant, grizzled Korean war vet Walt Kowalski is endlessly watchable, as each animalistic snarl, grim spitting out of racial slurs and grimace as he reflects on his own waning physical potential are alternatively hilarious, gripping and touching, managing to take a despicable sack of a man and infuse him with gruff pathos, charisma and sly humour to spare. If the rumours of Kowalski being Eastwood's last acting performance do end up being true, it is certainly a prime example of a silver screen treasure going out on a high note. The rest of the cast fail to not only live up to Eastwood's standard, but even conventional standards of quality, as Bee Vang as Kowalski's repentant teenage protégé Thao delivers a dull, uninspired performance, making key emotional moments almost laughable, and Christopher Carley as the young, passionate priest continually butting heads with Kowalski fares little better. Ahney Her is a high point as Thao's spunky sister, but is unfortunately stuck with too many of the film's weaker lines to deliver a performance of too much merit. While Eastwood is far too competent a filmmaker to have the film descend into the self- pantomime or grim melodrama it could easily have been, Gran Torino still marks a rare directorial misfire for one of American film's most lasting and reliable filmmakers. Let down by a weak script and the occasional questionable moral positioning, the film never feels genuine or compelling enough to have its elusive purposes ring true. Nevertheless, the singular pleasure of Eastwood's towering performance and alleged acting swan song is still enough to make the film overall worth viewing, but as a whole, Gran Torino primarily marks a mostly missed opportunity for something potentially beautiful and resonant. -6/10",6,11,20,8 March 2009
The Hurt Locker," Cereal boxes and bombs: which is the real threat?
","'Not another Iraq movie'. Far from the customarily glowing advance notice that would normally grace films bestowed with even a fraction of its accolades, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker instead struggled to secure a cinema release, beset by the seemingly damning alignment with the genre of contemporary war films nearly universally bestowed with as much audience indifference as poor quality. With this in mind, one could find a particular poetic justice in watching life imitate art as Bigelow's film scraped by each set of obstacles, fighting to keep itself alive and becoming internationally celebrated with the same quiet, tenacious efficiency as its protagonists - a real life success story as moving and cinematic as any told by the industry. One could find such a poetic justice, that is, if such a romanticized telling didn't run exactly contrary to the very spirit and thematic core of the picture in question. For The Hurt Locker offers no easy emotional closure, no tidy narrative arcs, no subscription to convention and certainly no traditional happy ending. Furthermore, it might just happen to be one of the strongest motion pictures to cross screens in decades.Just as the film goes about its business in a fashion completely unlike nearly any other contemporaries, so is the viewing experience fundamentally transformed. Fatalism and stoicism barely serve to do the tone justice, as, becoming instantly immersed in an atmosphere so perpetually tense and fraught with unexpected peril, the audience cannot help but immediately adapt the same dispassionate detachedness as the American military bomb disposal protagonists, barely registering more than a numb grunt when characters are introduced, given the chance to develop meaningful emotional attachments, then abruptly killed off over and over again. This is not to say that the viewer does not grow to care about the characters, but rather the tragic opposite: they care so much about the characters that they are forced to 'turn off', as the consistent, visceral threat of losing them becomes too unbearable. Like the bomb-squad, the viewer is painfully conditioned into simply keeping going, in what is unquestionably one of the most painfully impactive participatory viewing experiences seen in ages, potentially ever. One lives as one of the characters, and if the film is a traumatic, exhausting watch, it is poignant testament to how hellish the actual experience of bomb disposal would be. Rather than traditionally milking the genre as a vehicle for political rallying, Bigelow dwells on the sheer sensory experience of war, the fragmentary plot whittled into a bludgeoning series of episodes, each one pulsating with legitimate threat that it could be the end. Gone is the familiarity of linear narrative and emotional progression; the film's dramatic confrontations happen without any regard for crescendo or reason, much like the actual experience of combat. Bigelow's jittery cameras and mise-en-scene often draw more attention to inane, incidental details than the key dramatic apparatus of each scene, uncannily recreating the non sequitur focus of a soldier knowingly facing potential death. And yet, it is all the more disturbing for a film so tense to feel so excruciatingly calm, with the serene, near silent spectacle of an operative clad in a cumbersome bomb-suit (an image oddly evoking the absurdism of sci-fi) trudging across stark, hazy whitewashed sandy cities towards potential detonation almost unbearable through its matter-of-fact eschewing of any traditional ploys for emotion. The irony that a film predicated on dismantling traditional emotional attachment to its characters should yield one of the most credible, fully inhabited performances in years makes the experience all the more sumptuous, and Jeremy Renner's work alone would already make the film essential viewing. His Staff Sgt. William James is a character for the ages, torn between a desperate yearning for any sort of fundamental connection and his inability to make sense of anything in life beyond bomb disposal, and registering the dissonance through a repulsively cocky, near suicidal addiction to risk and adrenaline as surrogate purpose. Most performers would be tempted to play it loud and large, but Renner's genius lies in his understatedness, playing James as a real person and thus making his rare eruptions of constantly bottled anguish all the more devastating, and seating his performance infuriatingly under the skin - a struggle to like, harder still not to understand, and impossible to forget. Supporting Renner, Anthony Mackie is similarly magnificent, carefully masking surges of deep seated terror and existentialism with brisk professionalism and brisk bravado, and Brian Geraghty consistently simmers to tremendous effect, a continual powder keg of a performance always at risk of erupting. Bigelow can also be commended for restricting A-list actors to almost incidental and horrifically brief supporting roles, further amplifying the unbalanced chaos of the experience. Few packages fit together with such grim efficiency and unassuming genius, yielding a stylistic feel with simultaneous gruesome realism, a crushingly immersive experience made all the stronger through desperate attempts to sever any emotional ties, all the while managing to find new ground to tread on the subject of war bereft of any loaded political baggage (its perversely genius ending recalling Easy Rider of all things). The Hurt Locker addresses the validation of human existence through the continual threat of its removal, and plunges its audience into a genuinely disturbing and moving ride, all the more through its blunt refusal to beg for any obvious sentiment. Those sneering that the Academy Awards never properly award the best picture of the year should begin removing their feet (which are bound to feel encrusted in Baghdad sand and explosive soot after watching) from their mouths now. -10/10",10,4,14,12 April 2010
X-Men: Apocalypse," First Bryan giveth, then he taketh away
","In 2000, Bryan Singer shook Hollywood with X-Men: a blockbuster that dared to take comic book superheroes seriously and intelligently. Now, in 2016, he bequeaths us X- Men: Apocalypse - the most dire sabotage to the genre's longevity and credibility we've seen since...well, X-Men Origins: Wolverine (and, amazingly, just as excruciating). My theory? Singer has consciously treated his fourth X-Men as a piece of holistic, self-reflexive, self-loathing performance art. You wanted an Apocalypse? You got one, all right. You'd expect the film's critical lambasting proceeding the airtight Days of Future Past to be hyperbole. But no - X-Men: Apocalypse really is THAT intolerable. Many have pointed to the film's Return of the Jedi 'the third one is always the worst' quip turned horribly ironic prophecy for the First Class trilogy. But what if this wasn't just a smarmy, overconfident boast backfiring hilariously? What if the film is literally cheerfully prophesying its own awfulness? Screenwriter Simon Kinberg (whose ongoing employment after penning both X-Men 3 AND 2015's Fantastic Four speaks to a deep, virulent masochism on Fox's part) meticulously collects Every. Single. One. of the superhero genre's most loathed tropes, and rubs them in audience faces to such a nauseating extreme I felt a rash breaking out over my corneas. Oodles of stilted, snoozy exposition, and uber-serious self-important melodramatic posturing? Check. Risible, shoehorned-in love scenes? Yup ('I'm on a beach' is in danger of becoming the new 'Martha' or 'Brutasha' of boneheaded superhero movie maneuvers). A plot that careens from subplot to subplot like a drunken mosquito, each only in service in the interests of (sigh) universe building, yet still unreasonably stagnant and draggy? Oh yes. A climactic blow-out so bloated with incompetent, aimless CGI it nearly outdoes Hulk's murky mess of a lake battle that then devolves into a literal, beat-by-beat remake of Fant4stic's mortifying, rushed final boss battle? Oh COME ON. This is beyond surgical, histrionically poor filmmaking. This is Fox watching the world burn. You can practically taste Singer's desperation to ape as many iconic X-tropes as possible for fear that he won't get another chance, including clumsily reintroducing his original roster, but it only makes the film more contemptuous. At one point the plot gets - literally - hijacked just to devote the film's middle third to an extraneous William Stryker/Weapon X Hugh Jackman cameo. And yes, in spite of the material's almost unquenchable coolness, it's a dud too. Singer can't even be bothered to keep up the campy, pop-art political subtext of the last two X-outings, despite the almost irresistibly spoofable Reagan administration. But, lest you find his film insufficiently profound, he has a peeved Magneto...um...destroy Auschwitz. Um. Wow. I'll just let the seismic tastelessness of that sink in, and scuttle on. Surely, you plead, there's solace to be found in our beloved cast of lovable mutants? Not so. Most of the movie alternates between the cast of actor-props practicing their constipation stares as they feign telekinetically moving/dissolving things. By the final third, the main attraction is Jennifer 'Speechsnoring' Lawrence, Rose Bryne, and Sophie Turner attempting to aggressively under-act one another (Turner wins; we have an actual contender for 'worst blockbuster performance ever documented'. Just remembering her gives me a headache). Tye Sheridan's Cyclops matches them in petulant overacting, and is just as hatable for it. It almost defies belief seeing the X-Men's single most formidable foe squandered to such an outstanding degree. Poor, poor Oscar Isaac. It's offensive enough leaving Apocalypse bereft of any context or explanation for his powers, resurrection technology, or world-destroying motivation, but he's so swaddled in mountains of torpid Power Rangers prosthetics, and given nothing to do but whisper and stand with his arms outstretched, we nearly forget about him while he's still on screen in front of us. As he innocuously and politely assembles Alexandra Shipp, Ben Hardy, and Olivia Munn's human action figures to stagnate around a desert with him (for HOURS.), CGI farts swirl around his visibly slight frame signifying his (unseen) menace. Shameful is far too feeble a word for this travesty. The rest of the cast phone it in with furious nonchalance. Michael Fassbender in particular, doesn't bother hiding his contempt at how often he stands around vacuously, stuck with a pathos subplot so strained he - literally - bellows at God. James McAvoy is on inappropriately but hysterically fine comedic form for the first third of the film before being reigned in as a googly-eyed morality platitude slot machine. We get glimmers of charisma from Evan Peters' delightfully snarky Quicksilver (and yes, he gets another slow-mo scene. Satisfied?) and Kodi Smit-McPhee's bashfully goofy Nightcrawler (even if 13 years of FX improvements make him and his 'bamfing' look even less credible than Alan Cumming in 2003). Naturally, Kinberg is clueless on how to use either to anywhere close to their full potential, sidelining both and saddling Quicksilver with a motivation so cumbersome you can feel Peters rolling his eyes as the words tumble sheepishly out of his mouth. Recognizable side characters like Tómas Lemarquis' sassy Caliban intrigue, but are virtual nonentities. Still doubt Singer's willful self-destruction? Dig this: the earlier X-Men movies fiercely advocated for education and tolerance, employing violence only to stave off hate- crimes. Apocalypse ends with Lawrence's MystiKatniss droning on the virtues of militarism Above All Else. Here is the death of Xavier's dream - so dismal that the only worthwhile embers are lazy callbacks to moments done better in other Bryan Singer X-Men films (McAvoy and Fassbender virtually shed tears of embarrassment reenacting dialogue exchanges from X-Men 1). If this is the rejigged time-stream after Days of Future Past, they may as well ship Wolverine even further back in time to put the whole sodden franchise out of its misery. -3/10",3,3,12,12 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Choose your own plot thread (geddit?)
","The most amazing thing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is how short a memory Hollywood has. Only seven years prior, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3 caused a shock wave of contempt so cataclysmic the only feasible recover was to stall for five years, then reboot the series. 'Never again,' intoned Sony executives, fearfully, 'will we stuff a Spider-Man film with so many subplots, villains, and extraneous Goblins! We've learned our lesson. Never again!' Heh.I could pontificate about how overcrowded, unfocused, and tonally imbalanced Mark Webb's follow-up to his first Amazingly-mishandled Spider-Man is, but that's self-evident (consolation: no skateboarding to Coldplay montage here. Shudder). Instead, I propose an alternate means of consumption. Seeing as Webb's Big Mac of a superhero film contains at least three shorter, more cohesive films therein, and since we, thanks to the magic of blu-ray, have the option of fast-forwarding at liberty, I propose you pick the Spider-Man film you'd most like to see, skip all the redundant mush, and just watch that film instead. Think of it as a cinematic 'choose your own adventure story'! Personally, I'm a fan of the first option: a lilting, lighthearted action-comedy vignette, just like the Spider-Man I grew up with! We open with Spider-Man swinging through the city, whooping away, the cheerful score of Hans Zimmer and his five co-composer buddies (no joke) chirping along, in pursuit of bad ol' puddy-tat Paul Giamatti and his truck full of stolen plutonium. This is about as close as cinema has ever gotten to a live-action cartoon: pastel colours, slapstick, insane action (including a police car pileup that hilariously upstages The Blues Brothers), and all-around fun. Andrew Garfield bouncing around, firing off dad jokes, is spot-on as Spidey, and Giamatti, spittle flying left and right as he grunts and snorts in his goofy Russian accent like a real rhinoceros, has surely tapped into some kind of method genius. Then, instead of the plodding middle two hours, maintain the fun and cut to the end. Oh no! Giamatti's back, nonsensically sporting a ridiculously daft mechanical suit, and helpfully naming his action figure by bellowing 'Ayy Hyam de Rchynooooo!' You couldn't ask for a more heightened, cartoon climax: a standoff between Giamatti's knave and a bespectacled boy. Just in time: rack-focus to the real Spider-Man, who fist-bumps the kid and takes over. Genuinely affecting tears and cheers, and a heroic anticlimax urges you to tune in next week, same Spider-time, same Spider-channel. Magnificent. Some may prefer the second film-within-a-film: a wacky, campy body-horror action thriller, as if concocted by David Cronenberg at a Skrillex concert. Meet Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon: an earnest, super-nerd so imbalanced we are subjected to an excruciatingly long sequence of him having an imaginary conversation with Spider-Man, straight into the camera (my second-hand-embarrassment senses are tingling!). Max predictably meets with a horrible accident, being bitten by (um) genetically-modified electric eels, and becoming the frightful, glowing, blue Mr. FreezElectro. Who controls electricity. Electro is a misunderstood monster, but quickly notices how his vilification grants his lonely existence exposure for the first time. But just when the film verges on momentary profundity, Spider-Man arrives to bash him about. In the ensuing (fairly exciting) battles, Max discovers his true calling as a dubstep artist, now providing the film with its wub-wub-wub-soundtrack in a creative choice so batsh*t it's either inspired or risible, depending on how stupefied the viewer already is. Max is subsequently tormented in prison by Martin Czokas' disturbingly over-the-top 'Europeeank' Dr. Kafka, before he and his silly wet-suit are finally short-circuited by our hissable villain, Spider-Man. RIP Max. Finally, for those three audience members who still jeer that our enjoyment-based comic book superhero jaunts still aren't gosh-darned serious enough, we have film number three: the melodrama. Behold: the trials of Peter Parker, haunted by the childhood disappearance of his parents and the stupid guilt-ghost of Dennis Leary. Even his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone, tragicomic perfection) is leaving to pursue a prestigious scholarship in England (how selfish). Appropriately, the film's lighting is so grimly grey it's like Peter's Instagram filter is set to 'tar pit'. Thankfully, relief comes in the form of clumsily integrated ol' buddy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan, valiantly out-acting his asinine dialogue), whohas a dying father. And has inherited his rare, debilitating disease. And decides he needs Spider-Man's super-blood to cure him(?!) Drat. Thankfully, we take a break from the drama llama to adventure with Peter in an embarrassingly contrived subplot to a mysterious deserted subway lab so the script can awkwardly tie off the ill-advised 'parents' preoccupation everyone had already forgotten about. Finally, Peter and Gwen are confronted by a deformed, mutated, screeching Harry, whose conflict is also rushed along by the miracle discovery of a disease-suppressing Power Rangers suit and goblin glider (duh). But this is a SERIOUS fight, involving sharp things, stentorian pleading, and tragic collateral damage: a helpless clock tower suffers for their sins! Oops – I mean the film briefly blinks awake as one of the comic's most iconic moments is realized: Gwen plummets to her death with a shockingly visceral crunch, handled powerfully enough to stun even fans with the original panel breakdown memorized. Garfield is finally allowed to flex his dramatic muscles, and his sobs of disbelief are enough to wrench tears from the most cynical viewer. The film ends on this exquisite heartbreak. Darkness. No parents. Roll credits. Still. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 should be considered a cautionary tale for the producers of (you guessed it) the next upcoming Spider-Reboot. On behalf of all the spider-fans and real rhinos everywhere who have slumped through a decade of committee-scripted spider-trash: learn from your mistakes. Pick a tone. Stick to ONE storyline and antagonist. And, for heaven's sakes, leave time for re-writes. Better yet: conclusively release the character rights back to Marvel Studios, who are capable of making respectful and fun superhero flicks without such hand-holding.Excelsior. -5/10",5,0,3,22 July 2015
Ex Machina," iRobot
","2015, the same year when a committee of top scientists, including Stephen Hawking, issued an open letter cautioning against further development of artificial intelligence in robotic and computer systems, also, perhaps unsurprisingly, saw a glut of major Hollywood releases exploring the concept in its execution. But, amidst the Age of Ultron and the chirping of Chappie, another AI film, penned and released with no major fanfare by a first-time director, quietly cemented itself as the year's definitive, and certainly most realistic, take on the ramifications of sentient robotics (and, moreover, the only one to slyly rope in software corporations like Apple as accountable for their inception). That film, of course, is Ex Machina.Writer/director Alex Garland, better known as the scribe of various smarter-than-average Hollywood romps, including 28 Days Later and Dredd, clearly has Kubrick on the brain for his work here. Rather than caving to the temptation to pump out a more action-oriented techno-thriller (behold: not a single explosion!), Garland plays things slow, taut, and creepy, which is more appropriate and effective. Both aesthetically and tonally, Ex Machina glints with a dimly chrome sheen and almost clinical stillness, establishing an eerie atmosphere of fascination and vague unease. The film is (or feels) nearly silent; characters speak only when absolutely necessary, and it would not be amiss to notice a certain robotic quality to their universally calculated dialogue. It's chilling, but terribly magnetic as a slow-burning thriller. While the pace runs the risk of being slightly too drowsy for contemporary sensibilities at times, Garland's film is undeniably all the more engaging and compelling by tonally resisting the mugging for emotion or reaction increasingly demonstrated in more rote Hollywood fare.There's also a distinctly theatrical quality at play here. Garland has tremendous fun contrasting the vast, lush, outdoor setting of his mysterious billionaire CEO's mountain retreat with the stark, claustrophobic interiors of the house, and its barren, techno-IKEA modernism, with cameras gliding down hallways and around corners with the most clipped sense of foreboding since The Shining. Moreover, the sparsity is echoed in the film's interplay between its trifecta of characters, with consistently shifting social politics and power dynamics, with pivotal information being withheld and divulged at crucial moments, keeping the film bristling with tension. The film is not a 'mystery' in any sense, but nor does its ultimately predictable execution and outcome feel like a shortcoming. Instead, Garland works with the subtext of algorithmic execution – the viewer is privy to all the information necessary to work through the film in advance, but watching its immaculate execution unfold is exhilarating in its own right.Subtlety, again, is the name of the game; all three performers play close to the chest and avoid emotional showboating, but all are universally excellent. Domhnall Gleeson proves a strong lead, blending emotional detachment, astute analytical prowess, and an understated arrogance in the perfect cocktail of software prodigy, while somehow remaining sympathetic throughout in spite of it all. The increasingly impressive Oscar Isaac sinks his teeth into the showier role of enigmatic tech genius without overselling his character's eccentricities, crafting a loud, drunken, bodybuilding persona that hides the shrewd, endlessly calculating spider within. It's a perfectly balanced performance, never campy or tacky, and one that could well worm its way into awards season by year's end. Finally, Alicia Vikander, in the time-worn role of existential android, moulds an impressively cryptic performance. Vikander interchanges pathos, naïveté, emotional manipulation, and deep curiosity, all while scarcely blinking her giant, endlessly probing eyes and unwavering inflection – an android that actually feels like an android, rather than the customary cinematic mawkish, personified parodies of sentient robotics.Ex Machina is a film that plays to its strengths. It's not as lofty or profound as a lot of comparable sci-fi parables tackling the etymology of existence, nor is its subject matter flagrantly original, or changing the face of the genre. Unlike its protagonist, Garland's film does not struggle with identity issues, and is content to deliver what it says on the tin: a lean, mean, sci-fi potboiler, tense, well-acted, and with a neat little climactic twist tying the whole thing up with a bow. It's unassuming, perfectly composed, and terribly efficient - in short, a perfectly 'robotic' film, albeit in the best sense of the word.iLike.-8.5/10",8,1,3,14 August 2015
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Superhero escapism at its most simplified and unashamedly enjoyable
","From the very onset of its being announced, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer stood out as one of the least expected sequels of the year. After the lackluster box office and critical reviews of the first adaptation of the classic Marvel comics team, it seemed unlikely that any further mileage would be attempted to be extracted from the source material. However, Twentieth Century Fox saw differently, and a sequel was triumphantly declared, begging the question as to whether the franchise would follow the recently conventional superhero route of going darker and more complex. In the end, such concerns couldn't be farther away from the intent of the project, as Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer proves just as deliriously determined as its predecessor to entertain, even at the sake of complexity, its exploration of the coming of the Silver Surfer, one of the most fascinating in the comic's history being processed as superhero escapism at its most simplified and unashamedly enjoyable.The story begins immersed in expositional drama, with the pending media circus of a wedding between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman leaving the couple debating abandoning superheroism in favour of a normal married life. However, despite the intriguing subtextual examination of the cultural role of the superhero in a media obsessed society, the madcap pre-wedding antics may be cute but are often oversimplified or overstated, the occasional profound kernel lost amidst borderline excessive silliness (Mr. Fantastic 'loosening up' at his bachelor party is fun, but a bit much). As such, it is almost a relief when the future of the world is threatened, and the real fun begins. The expanded scale of the conflict (saving Earth from destruction by intergalactic force Galactus and his herald the Silver Surfer) allows the special effects team to up the ante on flexing their big budget muscles, between exhilarating cosmically powered showdowns to more subtle touches (Mr. Fantastic's stretching ability looks far less artificial this time). John Ottman's triumphant musical score completes the heroic package, exemplifying the 'generic but undeniably fun' tone of the film. Returning director Tim Story's continual desire to keep the mood light and fun may hamper the story's potential for actual gravitas regarding the pending end of the world, but the breezy exhilaration of the film is sufficient to prevent the viewer from devoting enough attention to the ludicrous situation, content to earnestly wow and cheer rather than fret matters such as realism, coherence or the vain attempts to make Jessica Alba appear blonde and blue-eyed. Story's penchant for nodding to fans of the comics also makes the film substantially more entertaining, with inclusions such as the Fantasticar proving rousing and exhilarating, and even his revamping of the ominous Galactus proving surprisingly satisfying. In an era of superhero films attempting to continually one-up each other on the 'dark and brooding' front, it is surprisingly refreshing to see a comic book adaptation with no more grandiose goals than to entertain, sporting such an unpretentious sense of fun that one can't help but go along for the ride in despite the numerous stumbles.Once again, Ioan Gruffudd impresses as emotionally distant yet quirkily noble heroic scientist Mr. Fantastic, perfectly essaying the occasional comedic or dramatic moment which emerge from his aptly maintained front of stern focus. Unfortunately, Jessica Alba disappointingly delivers a far less inspired performance than even her usual standard as the harried Invisible Woman. Alba's flat, painfully unemotional performance is uncomfortably punctuated by her grotesque excesses in makeup, giving her the appearance of a bizarre doll rather than human being. Conversely, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as the impish Human Torch and gruffly wisecracking rock-encrusted Thing prove the casting highlights, their comedic banter and irreverently charismatic performances providing the film with much needed emotional heart and comic relief. However, returning antagonist Julian McMahon as Machiavellian Doctor Doom feels like a hasty last minute addition, his sparsity of screen time giving McMahon little chance to exude sufficient villainous menace or even appear to have much point as a character. In contrast, Kerry Washington is delightfully charming as the Thing's blind girlfriend Alicia, and Andre Braugher delivers a reliably disapproving performance as a gruff military general. Finally, the masterful motion capture movement of Doug Jones and melodious, otherworldly voice of Lawrence Fishburne combine perfectly to capture the mystery and pathos of the dynamic Silver Surfer, instilling real heart into a potentially overly artificial character. To call Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer mindless entertainment would hardly be a substantial overstatement, as the film's primary concern of delivering light-hearted fun often comes at the expense of character development and credible emotional engagement with the story. However, mindless entertainment need not be seen as strictly a negative, and those willing to take the film for what it is, a piece of not overly challenging, fun and occasionally exhilarating superpowered escapism, may well find the film a rousing success - just don't expect to remember much of it days down the road. -6/10",6,2,4,11 December 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Some things last, as the film proves testament to
","Just when it increasingly appears the wells of Hollywood's creativity have dried up, continually resorting to reworking tired cinematic and narrative clichés, films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button emerge to unexpectedly rekindle faith in the industry. Intriguing enough by its mere storyline core (a man is born a senior citizen, and 'ages' backwards throughout his life), what could have resulted in an overly gimmicky excuse for a melodrama is seemingly effortlessly transformed by the delicate directorial touch of David Fincher into something far less contentious and volumes more poignant and lyrical. A haunting, resonant exploration of time, life, death and the transition from one to the other, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button miraculously manages to be sombre and emotionally draining without once becoming excessively dour, with sublime bits of charm, humour and hope peppering the profundity and making it a true cinematic experience for the ages.To call The Curious Case of Benjamin Button close to a contemporary masterpiece would hardly be overstating things, and yet such praise feels out of place, not because the film is not deserving of it (far from it) but that it makes no claims as to aiming for such heights - were it not for the enormous budget and stars, the film could easily have been a small, independent production. Few films prove so enormously ambitious and yet ultimately unassuming, with such vast scopes, and yet such simple aims all things considered, and Fincher toes the line between the grand and the intimate with remarkable precision. Moreover, it is interesting to see perennial cynic Fincher tap into such unbridled emotional resonance (the film is unlikely to leave a single dry eye in the house), and yet such moments are pure sentiment trimmed of all sap and Hollywood tear-jerking cliché, making them all the more gently genuine and lasting. If his past films such as Fight Club and Seven appeared to be expunging hidden depths of suppressed rage and bitterness, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button appears an attempt to tap into more tender feelings, and the result is in no way less magnificent. While on very first impression the film might be sized up as overlong, rambling and full of extraneous subplots, over time it becomes increasingly clear the film's intent is not merely to tell the story of Button, but, to the best of Fincher's considerable ability, to live alongside him, complete with all the highs, lows, and little bits in between. This not only provides incredible empathy and pathos for Button's unconventional situation, but allows the story through the character to extrapolate and explore deeper existential themes, reflecting upon the notions of time and its fleeting potential, the overlap of life and death and the importance of living life to the fullest regardless of adversity. While it can be argued that despite this the script still has the occasional clunky bit of exposition, with storytelling so operatic yet paradoxically quiet and unassuming, such concerns only register as rare minute breaches in the film's incredible quality. Fincher's flair for stunning visuals also carries through in fully force, from the luscious period costuming and sets to the bold visual contrast between the exhilarating (a tense second world war sea battle) to the amusing (boyhood/elderly man Benjamin discovering alcohol) to the heartbreakingly dramatic (Benjamin's quietly horrified meeting with his father) and the seamless flow between them. Alexandre Desplat's luminous musical score and Claudio Miranda's grandiose cinematography ably reinforce the lyrical content. This all, of course goes without even mentioning the film's most central hook, the visual effects and prosthetic 'reverse aging' effects. At first startlingly convincing, the greatest testament to the incredible visual talent on display is how near immediately the viewer forgets about it, remaining so engrossed in Button's bizarre story to extract one's self from the narrative enough to properly appraise the incredible work put into it - a sign, if any, of masterful film-making. As the titular Button, Brad Pitt is simply a marvel, delivering a performance which is quiet, ego-less, unshowy and all the more supremely effective and credible for it, perfectly convincing no matter what age or contrasting physical appearance. Infusing unassuming heart and unspoken pathos into a character stoically resigned to 'unusual' circumstances rather than milking them for all their emotional worth, Pitt's Benjamin Button becomes an unforgettable underdog for the ages, all the more effective from Pitt's continual refusal to adhere to cliché or Hollywood showboating. Cate Blanchett proves just as marvellous, also essaying a character over the course of over 70 years of her life and proving completely convincing and heartwarming every step of the way while delivering a tremendously emotional performance with the utmost precision and grounded care. Rather than delivering a typical female romantic lead type, Blanchett's Daisy is a fleshed out, enormously credible human being, making her romantic struggle with Button all the more achingly affecting. Supporting the lead duo and their simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking relationship, Taraji P. Henson gives an enormously powerful yet understated performance as Button's surrogate orphanage mother, and Jason Flemyng proves a perfect combination of quirky and hauntingly credible as Button's estranged father. Finally, Tilda Swinton delivers a performance layered with emotional volumes and nuance as a fleeting romantic interest of Button's, managing to both capture the audience's heart and contempt simultaneously. Despite demanding nearly three hours of the viewer's life, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button makes every last second more than worth it, its power and incredibly uniform quality made all the more appealing by its lack of pretension and vehement avoidance of cliché. While the story or length may not appeal to every last audience member, it is all the more of a shame, as such unanticipated cinematic mastery deserves to be enjoyed and reflected upon by as many as possible. -9.5/10",10,1,2,7 February 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Superbly crafted and surprisingly relevant
","Good Night and Good LuckIn Good Night and Good Luck, actor George Clooney takes the directorial reigns to share a story which would normally sound slightly obscure, and not too appealing to today's audiences - the story of 1950's television broadcaster Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his mission to take down Senator Joseph McCarthy and his absurd anti-communist campaign. This kind of story would normally seem a bit out of place in today's theaters, but Clooney (who also co-wrote) shows a great deal of intelligence throughout his film, forcing the viewer to notice astonishing parallels between the U.S. governments of the 1950s and today, and when we look at it, how ultimately similar they are. This is the real beauty of Good Night and Good Luck - the realization as one parts the theater of how, despite all sociatorial advances, how frighteningly similar a problem still exists today.Clooney has also created an excellently made film, apart from the thought provoking political messages it raises - the cinematography is wonderful, as a camera sweeps through the lonely halls of the CBS broadcasting building, and the stark lighting on the black and white picture strongly help bring across the feel of the period, as do the excellent sets, music and 50's style costumes. The audience feels fully immersed in the middle of a 1950's television broadcasting building, so complete is the feel of the picture. Good Night and Good Luck also excels in the performance strand, bringing out wonderful work around the table, especially from leading man Strathairn, who perfectly captures the essence of heroic yet humble journalist Murrow. But although he is clearly the star of the show, he is backed up by similarly terrific performances from Clooney as CBS producer Fred Friendly, Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson as secretly married crew members (it was illegal at the time), Jeff Daniels as a not entirely supportive executive, and Frank Langella as the weary yet understanding superior of Murrow. The actual footage of Senator McCarthy works wonderfully, as it drives home exactly how very real the issue was at the time, and ground the story in real life. All in all, Good Night and Good Luck is one of the most expertly crafted films of the year by far. Although Clooney has brought his film in at a tight hour and a half, he easily succeeds in putting his point across, as well as raising several profound and thought provoking questions about the government system. Good Night and Good Luck is wonderfully made and still very relevant - definitely worth seeing for so many reasons.-9/10",9,2,4,13 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force Enrages
","In early 2017, Star Wars: The Last Jedi's trailer launched, and the world swooned. All but one. Instead, Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker grumpily intoned, 'This is not going to go the way you think' - an effective trailer-stinger line that only served to further fan the flames of excitement. Boy, was he right.No historical Star Wars whipping boys - Ewoks, Jar Jar, or George Lucas himself - have incurred the polarizing cultural ire of The Last Jedi, which courts opinions as diverse as 'best since Empire!' to 'worse than Naziism!' Objectively, it's a mixed bag of extremes, flaring up with standing ovation-worthy moments of giddy movie magic, but misfiring more than a blindfolded Stormtrooper. Halfway through my screening, clutching my Admiral Ackbar figurine in a death-grip,* I became afraid for the film I was watching. And, Yoda called it: anger and hatred were soon to follow. And the aftershocks of such potential falling to waste through carelessness and clumsiness? Suffering. If J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens courted nostalgia to the point of verging on being a New Hope remake, director Rian Johnson shrugs off the bridles of fan service with the disdain of a surly teenager - 'Let the past die,' poignantly, is less a trailer stinger than mission statement. Those expecting the 'dark Chapter II' will not be disappointed (content aside, the film is frequently so aesthetically murky it's frustratingly imperceptible during key scenes), but this is avowedly not Empire 2.0. Johnson, to his credit, makes Star Wars an utterly unfamiliar terrain, with bold left-field twists from canon and expectation providing a real sense of vibrant uncertainty. Nothing and no one is sacred or safe, and characters fail, fall, and grow in unexpected and fascinating ways. Divisive or not within the old guard of fans, a franchise that could too easily stray into stagnation here feels the most alive since the revelation of Luke's real parentage. Unfortunately, Johnson's screenplay feels like a first pitch draft, anchored on a handful of bold story beats, but with preciously little fleshed out in between. There's an overbearing sense of uneasiness pervading both plot and tone, with momentous melodrama clumsily interrupted by anachronistically inappropriate Marvel superhero-style comedic beats. Poignantly, the film's two central plot strands are BOTH(!) anchored on inert evasion, lending an irksome, procrastinating feel to the narrative. And if that wasn't enough, Johnson effectively stalls his plots about stalling(!!), orchestrating an inexcusably artificially motivated second act jaunt to a casino planet (which may as well have been named 'MacGuffin'), for the sake of a humdrum Cantina rehash and a lazy message about war profiteering. A judicious editor would have exorcized the segment completely, and saved audiences from 20 minutes of bum-numbing redundancy. Thankfully, Johnson finds his footing on the spectacle front. The Last Jedi conjures some of the franchise's most eerily beautiful settings and imagery (scars of red slicing across a porcelain salt planet; the mythic dampness of Ireland's Skellig Michael), tied together by virtually flawless CGI (though the dearth of fun and visually memorable new alien characters is a bummer), and the sheer perfection that is John Williams. Similarly, Johnson's action scenes are breathlessly enjoyable, from a succession of dazzlingly intricate lightsaber duals, to exhilarating and unprecedented usages of the Force, to an epic finale so jaw-droppingly jubilant it's about as masterfully bombastically entertaining as Star Wars gets - no idle praise.Sadly, Johnson is more adept at balancing the Force than his ensemble. Many key characters are ingloriously sidelined (sorry, Oscar Isaac's blandly charismatic Poe, and poor Chewbacca, 3PO and R2...), underutilized (sorry John Boyega's formerly interesting Finn, Andy Serkis' woefully camp Supreme Leader Snoke, and Domhnall Gleeson's warily comedic relief General Hux), or killed - sometimes offscreen(!) - with an appalling absence of deference or dignity. Instead, Johnson introduces a cabal of new players... who are universally reprehensible and useless (Laura Dern's grim Admiral, Benicio Del Toro's transparently superfluous thief, and the intolerably chirpy Kelly Marie Tran's trite Resistance hero all range from forgettable to infuriating). And: the elephant in the room that is the tragic death of Carrie Fisher? Well, Fisher herself is as fiery and ebbing with sass and aching humanity as ever, but more than a few eyebrows will be raised at some of the brain-bending character beats Leia is subjected to throughout. Ultimately, it seems that, if Johnson had his way, the film would singularly revolve around its titular trio of Jedi. The Rey/Kylo Ren/Luke Skywalker storyline is by far the film's most heartfelt and effective, and Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Mark Hamill each give blistering and formidably emotive performances. Their melodramatic morality play strikes unexpected depths of darkness, hope, and tenderness, and hypothesizing how their genuinely unpredictable story will reach its culmination will fill the year with fevered expectation.Oh - and those worrisomely cutesy Porgs? They're inoffensive, charming, and sell arguably the film's biggest laugh. Eat it (heh). The Last Jedi is, overall, worthwhile, but more fundamentally conflicted than Kylo Ren. It takes fearless strides with plot and characters, then mires them in hours of dithering uncertainty. It's infectiously, thrillingly zippy, then plodding and inert. It loves its internal lore and history as much as it resents them. It's both invigoratingly unpredictable and disappointingly safe. In a sense, it exemplifies the mantra of Yoda: it either Does or Does Not with equal conviction, with its successes mercifully (slightly) overshadowing its frustrations. If anything, Johnson's enigmatic final shot poetically speaks both to the cyclical timelessness of Star Wars, and the tremendous joys it heralds for past, present, and future audiences. Let's just hope that Supreme Overlord Disney extracts the appropriate conclusions from The Last Jedi's furor: DO keep Star Wars joyful and nostalgic, but remain unafraid to take chances. DO NOT succumb to rushed, excessively convenient scripts, poorly crafted new characters, or forced, cheap tonal shifts. Otherwise, Hamill's other trailer stinger line may yet prove worrisomely prophetic: 'It's time for the Jedi to end.' -6.5/10*:(",6,3,5,24 December 2017
The Evil Dead," A clever blend of ironic cliché and straightforward, unsettling horror - well deserving its cult infamy
","There remains a perpetually unmistakable veneer to the sect of films known as 'cult hits' - classics to certain select groups of people without being necessarily enjoyed or even known by a mass audience. It would be difficult to find a more fitting example than maverick director Sam Raimi's feature-length debut, The Evil Dead, decades before the Spider-Man films. In fact, apart from a vaguely distinctive style and cheeky humour, the two bookends of Raimi's career to date could hardly be more different on the surface: Spider-Man a mainstream, big budget action blockbuster and The Evil Dead a shoestring budget, schlocky horror comedy, tailored only really to appeal to a select fan base sharing a gruesome sense of humour. But most prevailing between the two, at the risk of delving into sentiment, is the passion and heart Raimi instils into each, regardless of their exterior trappings or financial investment. Despite being an ultimately small and unassuming film, The Evil Dead goes about its business in a remarkably self-assured and efficient fashion, just as fundamentally constructed to entertain as a certain friendly neighbourhood superhero. Given the general association of such horror fare with a sense of 'so bad it's good', it is easy to forget just how grimly effective Raimi's film is, or how much of a cornerstone for 'do-it- yourself' film-making and macabre special effects. Masking its microscopic budget with chilling use of a single forest location (decades before The Blair Witch Project), Raimi's film opts instead for horror atmosphere turned bludgeoning object, complete with a pounding dirge of an ominous musical score and frantic cinematography, zooming along the forest floor as if precipitating the tension to unbearable levels. Similarly, for all of its deliberately campy excesses, it becomes increasingly undeniable just how genuine a knack Raimi's film demonstrates for full-blown fright, with an overwhelmingly Gothic ambiance and eerily effective mastery of horror conventions, extracting surprising scares from even the most familiar of set-ups. Indeed, rather than trying to fight the inevitable onset of cliché, Raimi instead cheerily incorporates them into his film and simply uses them for his own purposes, a welcome synergy of time worn technique into an ultimately unique concoction. Similarly, Raimi shows an innate awareness of viewer expectations as well as genre conventions, and gleefully takes pleasure in inverting just about everything which doesn't contribute to the continuous sense of creeping horror turned symphonic chillfest. Many sequences which should be terrifying are instead turned morbidly funny, many seemingly innocent sequences are twisted into being frightening, the film's sole romantic part is rendered completely un-romantic, and the fleeting moments of typical horror gratuitous sexual objectification are completely de-eroticized. However, Raimi appears equally determined to work in just about anything possible geared towards making his viewers squirm, and the film delivers in spades on the gruesome violence and disturbing gross-out effects front - no matter how intentionally campy and relatively cheaply they are done, the sheer gut reaction generated by them is the mark of a true genre pro.The film also marks the breakthrough performance of soon to be B-movie superstar Bruce Campbell, and his enormously enjoyable work in The Evil Dead demonstrates exactly why his popularity would subsequently rise so vastly. Campbell manages to encapsulate the tone of the movie within his performance alone: on the surface serious and slightly nerdy, but with a thinly veiled quirky and goofy sense of humour on the underbelly, managing to not only amplify the shudders and screams of the rest of the film but bring a very welcome comic charisma to it as well. The rest of the cast appear to be giving almost wilfully bland performances, making their subsequent encounters with the demonic exactly the sort of abrasive difference needed to infuse the picture with a true shock value. As such, while most of the actors may spend most of the picture doing nothing but screaming and howling, they do it with considerable energy and aplomb, as well as a slyly ironic sense of humour making their presence all the more appealing. While likely too ironically cheesy, terrifying or wilfully gross to appeal to a mass demographic, The Evil Dead nonetheless merits its reputation as one of the defining early cinematic meldings of horror and comedy, as well as a foundational text for the school of schlocky, 'do-it-yourself' horror productions. Infamous in its cult success, the film marks a rare exception of living up to its hype, and should prove near essential viewing for any horror enthusiasts who have yet to experience it. -8/10",8,1,2,25 April 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage...'
","Few directors have established such an instantly recognizable style as Quentin Tarantino. Despite having only released a handful of works, any of them can be immediately marked as a Tarantino film by any of his trademark cinematic traits: the stylized dialogue, the edgy cinematic techniques and the macabre yet perversely entertaining violence. Having remained under the radar for a few years after having shaken the film industry by storm and spawned countless imitators in the early 1990s, in 2003, Tarantino was back with a bang with arguably his most visceral and gruesomely entertaining work to date - Kill Bill: Volume One. Using the simplest of story lines as a template for his latest bloodbath, Tarantino paints his story of an assassin gunned down at her wedding seeking revenge against the perpetrators with an operatic splendour, utilizing all of his usual trademarks with pitch-perfect intensity. With a stylized script providing some of the most quotable lines since Pulp Fiction and coy experimentation with narrative form, taking note and paying tribute to his usual multitude of nationalities and genres, from 1970s Japanese Samurai films (which the entire film is structured in the mould of), to convoluted classic french narrative, to continual innovations and experimentations in cinematic technique (with use of 'chapters', freeze frames, eclectic cinematography and interludes to Japanese anime or black and white) Tarantino is at the top of his masterful game. The film's typically quirky musical score, making use of everything from classical samurai film themes to Nancy Sinatra to original works composed by independent artist The RZA proves an odd compilation that exquisitely captures the bizarre and endlessly captivating essence of the film. Similarly, no film would pulse with the essence of Tarantino without copious use of violence, which Kill Bill: Volume One delivers in spades. While the mayhem is overdone to an almost comical extent (with dismembered henchmen spouting torrents of blood oddly enough harking back to Monty Python) several moments evoke such brutal and visceral intensity that even the most jaded viewers are likely to cringe. However, Tarantino similarly displays his uncanny talent to draw dark humour out of the most unlikely situations, wonderfully counterbalancing the very real emotional tension with unlikely humour, such as a room full of maimed bodies moaning in a zombie-like dirge. In the midst of the mayhem, it is easy to forget how hilarious the film can be. However, the superb fight choreography (in particular the staggering half hour final showdown) is breathtaking and astonishing in its intricate bloody splendour, crafting some of the most elaborate and intensely engaging sword fight scenes in cinema history. Despite the jaw-dropping technical work and masterfully crafted script, Tarantino's film really comes to life through the incredible performances of his cunningly assembled cast. Giving a career best performance, Uma Thurman is nothing less than flat out mesmerizing as the initially nameless Bride. Diving into her performance with such raw intensity and extracting every last iota of emotion from the part, Thurman's powerhouse of a performance is the beating heart which keeps the film throbbing with life, carrying both the audience's sympathies and enthralled enthusiasm with her every step of the way. Similarly, Lucy Liu is enormously impressive as a smoothly psychotic assassin turned mob boss, and watching her calm veneer melt into a captivating pillar of exposed fury is one of the film's most terrifying moments. Daryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox each enthrall given their moments to shine as two of The Bride's former fellow assassins, as does Julie Dreyfus as Liu's oily second in command. Character actor Sonny Chiba is a delightful yet dignified presence as a mysterious retired swordsmith, and Chiaki Kuriyama resonates with power as likely the deadliest 'schoolgirl' ever beheld on celluloid. Seen only in a brief cameo setting up his role for the sequel, Michael Madsen nonetheless makes a strong impression as an introspective assassin, and David Carradine is spellbinding as the never seen Bill, his silky voice winding itself around his lines like the deadly viper his assassination squad is named after - one of the most effective villains never to expose their face. Easily Tarantino's strongest, most visceral and ceaselessly stylish work since Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill: Volume One's dialogue, truly stunning cinematic style and technical work and myriad of tremendous performances (especially the astonishing Thurman) cement it as one of the most effortlessly innovative and impeccably masterful films of the decade. The effect of Kill Bill is truly astonishing; even after multiple viewings, the initial reaction of gut-level shock and awe at Tarantino's tremendous daring and perverse genius never wanes. Stylish, sadistic, cathartic fun - not for the faint of heart, but for those capable of stomaching it, Kill Bill is near peerless. -10/10",10,1,3,8 May 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," Gruesomely entertaining dark splatterhouse comedy
","From Dusk Till DawnIt is exceedingly difficult to categorize such a film as 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. Indeed, this may be a founded difficulty, as the film seems almost like two very different films each half completed, then mashed together in the middle. At first, the film seems like a standard Tarantino film, with his standard eclectic sense of dialogue and penchant for heavy violence and frequent profanity, following the story of the Geckos, two fugitive outlaw brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) on the run from the cops, trying to make it over the Mexican border with their family of hostages. (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) However, when they reach the seedy Mexican bar arranged as a safe-house for the Gecko brothers however, the film takes an abrupt face. That's when the Rodriguez influence takes over, and the film suddenly turns into a splatterhouse intentionally bad for the sake of being entertaining monster flick, as it is revealed that the bar's workers are none other than... get ready for this... vampires. If it sounds stupid and incredulous... well, it is, there's no doubt about it, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most ridiculously enjoyable splatterfest black comedies around.It's an odd little combination without a doubt, but for whatever reason, the bizarre mash of Tarantino's stylish wordplay and Rodriguez's later gore-fest seems to click, and the film comes together in a surprisingly entertaining fashion. It's nice to recall in this day and age of gravitas in monster movies that it is possible to make a monster flick only for the sake of being macabre and entertaining. The vampire effects are rather terribly done, but this is probably an intentional aspect, as it fits the oddly comedic tone of the picture perfectly. Only in a movie such as this could a director get away with giving a long monologue about Vietnam before being viciously bitten by a vampire, or a guitarist playing an instrument made out of human body parts. Such instances of coal black humour make up the most memorable parts of the film. Rodriguez also manages to draw impressive performances out of his cast, especially in the case of George Clooney, playing strongly against type in one of his first film roles as Seth Gecko, the tough as nails outlaw who is forced to become a sort of antihero to survive the vampire attack. Harvey Keitel also gives a powerful performance as the father of the kidnapped family, an ex-pastor forced to re-confront matters of faith. Keitel brings a sense of class and dignity to what is without a doubt one of the silliest films he has ever taken part in. Although Quentin Tarantino has received a lot of flack for writing himself into the script, he actually gives a fine performance as Richard Gecko, Clooney's paranoid and homicidal brother. Tarantino serves as the comic relief for most of the film's first half, especially in his first scene. Juliette Lewis gives a decent performance as Keitel's daughter who is also taken hostage, but Ernest Liu as the final kid in the family gives a rather lacklustre and unbelievable performance, almost (but not quite) ruining the superb scenes when Clooney talks to his hostages while riding their stolen RV. Salma Hayek also makes a sumptuous addition to the film, performing her snake dance, one of the most memorable stripteases in film history... without even removing any clothes!For those with low thresholds for gore or swearing, or those seeking out a more realistic and enlightening film, it is doubtful From Dusk Till Dawn will prove to your tastes. But for those willing to leave reality at the door and just enjoy a ridiculous yet absurdly entertaining vampire romp complete with intentionally inferior special effects and enough blood and gore to satisfy even the most bloodthirsty viewers, fraught with comedy as black as the night, this is the film for you.-8/10",8,0,1,11 October 2006
Jurassic World," What a wonderful World
","Dinosaurs are timeless.Ironic, perhaps, for creatures branded with the '65 million years ago' epitaph, but for centuries dinosaurs have functioned as immediate shorthand to a sense of childlike wonder and awe – sensations Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic capitalized on like few before. But these are not, as some might call them, 'the good ol' days'. In an era supersaturated with things obnoxiously clamouring for our attention, it's no wonder Jurassic World was greenlit based on a pitch predicated on the image of a teenager texting in front of a Tyrannosaurus Rex – it's a blockbuster desperately attempting to conjure up enough excitement to validate its own existence (or, shall I say, to forestall its own extinction). Fronted by Colin Trevorrow, fresh off the modest success of his feature debut, the equally earnest Safety Not Guaranteed, Jurassic World is that rare beast: an ambitious and passionate Hollywood blockbuster that wears its heart on its sleeve, practically imploring its audience to forgo cynicism and eye- rolling, and view the film with the wide-eyed joy of a child. It's a brave move in the recent realm of perennially 'DAAAAAARKNESS, NOOOO PARENTS' blockbusters. And gosh darn it, if it doesn't just pay off, soaring higher than a pterosaur bursting free of its feeble glass aviary. Jurassic World feels like the first natural continuation of the original narrative, flashing- forward from the park being a disastrous pipe dream to the point where it has been open for business long enough for investors to stress about how to wow audiences enough to meet budget quotas. This, naturally, adds a dash of satirical meta-commentary meditating on the film's dual objectives of wowing millions but also generating millions, enough for audiences to briefly feel clever while chowing down on their popcorn. In 1993, you could practically hear Spielberg snickering as he used his own movie's merchandise in the movie itself; here, I dare you not to chuckle at the spot-on 'Verizon presents: the Indominus Rex'. Trevorrow's unabashed reverence for Jurassic The First is clear: each dinosaur species is imbued with painstaking life by impressively naturalistic CGI, and the initial strains of Michael Giacchino's retooling of the iconic theme would be enough to make John Williams himself tear up. Yet, from the opening 'OMG-DINOSAUR-wait-only-a-crow' jump onwards, it's clear that Trevorrow has mixed a healthy streak of weirdness into his romp in the park. Initially, the tone takes a bit of adjusting to, as the corporate criticism is juxtaposed with the sense of childish wonder permeating the film's script to the point of painting its subject matter, themes, critiques, and even character beats with a curious innocence that verges on the cartoonish at times. Yet, Trevorrow's film is so cheery, taking such broad swipes at it feels akin to kicking a sick triceratops. And by the time the film really kicks into gear with the all- too-familiar sight of a paddock breach, Trevorrow has yanked his audience too far down the rabbit hole of madcap dinosaur fun to fret issues such as plausibility. With the Indominus Rex, Trevorrow has cooked up a movie monster for the ages. Chalk white, screeching, and replete with a laundry list of big-reveal abilities, the Indominus, like her entire movie, would feel too contrived to work if viewers weren't too busy trying to avoid soiling themselves at how genuinely terrifying and awe-inspiring she is. Her escape (a chilling Aliens-pastiche in itself) kicks the film into high gear, sparking some of the most inventively mad action setpieces of many a summer – if you thought the 'Chris Pratt motorcycling through the forest with his raptor buddies' from the trailer looked wacky, just wait to see where it goes from there. Chase follows gunfight follows swooping pterosaurs and leaping mosasaurs, to the point where the action starts to feel puppeteered by a sugar high six-year- old, but, miraculously, this 'so-crazy-it-might-be-awesome' ethos pays off enormously on the big screen. By the time we get to the all-out Deus-Rex-Machina climactic battle – which our theatre gave a standing ovation – the viewer is a child again, firmly revisiting that innocent time when a movie's fun factor could overwhelm the senses, and all was right in the world. Despite the bevy of largely one-note characters, the cast is all game enough to make their presence consistently fun. Chris Pratt, channelling his best Indiana Jones, is less fun and more of a superhero here than in Guardians of the Galaxy, yet retains his peerless charisma, whereas Vincent D'Onofrio shrugs off his nuanced antagonism from this year's Daredevil, beer-gut-strutting and sneering to the point where you want to boo him in the theatre. Unexpectedly, the most compelling character arch goes to Bryce Dallas Howard's stuffy park manager, who fights through a deluge of clichés to emerge as the surprisingly feisty and affecting emotional heart of the film. Ty Simpkins & Nick Robinson balance on just the right side of annoying as the film's requisite kids stranded in the park, even selling a potentially tiresome parental divorce subplot, while Irrfan Khan and Jake Johnson steal laughs aplenty as the park's bombastically over-the-top CEO, and grumbling computer technician (who, sadly, never gets to utter 'Hold onto your butts') respectively. Jurassic World taps into the core of what a blockbuster should be: high concept, big heart, and with plenty of 'oohs', 'ahhs', and 'AHHHHH!!!'s paving the way to what is easily the most fun film of the summer thus far. It seems almost unreasonable that a film juggling so many improbable odds and baggage should be anywhere near as enjoyable. Yet, somehow, life found a way. -8.5/10",9,8,22,1 July 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Enjoy the ride
","For all who have seen the first Mission: Impossible film, it becomes rapidly clear that M:I2 gives almost no sense of it being a sequel. This could be interpreted as either a good thing or a bad thing - it's true that the sense of intrigue and constantly twisting plot of the original is lost. In M:I2, the plot is fairly simple, and each twist becomes clear far before it happens. But enough plot is still decent, as IMF (Impossible Mission Force, hence comes the franchise title) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) races to stop rogue agent Sean Ambrose (the ever excellent Dougray Scott) from obtaining a killer virus called Chimera, after the monster from Greek mythology. To get to Ambrose, he recruits Ambrose's ex-girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to rejoin her ex, and act as the 'inside woman' for the team. This develops adequately enough, leading to the necessary insanely complicated aerial acrobatics, which are strongly reminiscent of the first film, and a bone crunching motorcycle chase to enormous man-to-man fistfight at the finale. Not too profound perhaps, but for an action movie, it's not bad.The script is very hit and miss; it's true there are some excellent and endlessly quotable lines strewn throughout, but we get stuck with a lot of overly dramatic clunkers like 'We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into Hell', which would be easier to overlook, had the cast put more enthusiasm into their performances. Indeed, Tom Cruise acts as if it was not his choice to return this time round, and Ving Rhames as computer hacker Luther Stickel is equally uncomfortable in returning. But Dougray Scott is consistently excellent as dastardly villain Ambrose, and Thandie Newton, Richard Roxburgh as Ambrose's chief henchman and Brendan Gleeson as a crooked industrialist working alongside Ambrose all give great performances.There is also an unexpected cameo from Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's mission commander Swanbeck, which would have worked better had he been developed into more of a major character, giving Hopkins more to do. As it is, he is good-natured enough with his fleeting minutes of screen time, and he's given some great lines, much in the line of M from the Bond films.Speaking of Bond, when did Hunt turn into his carbon copy? In the first movie, the filmmakers worked hard to keep the two secret agents easily distinguishable, but now Hunt seems like a pale shadow of Her Majesty's finest agent. The love plot is handled entirely in the style of a Bond movie, cheesy innuendo and all, Hunt's relations with Swanbeck are entirely the same as how Bond reacts to M, and there's even a car chase through the mountains plundered directly out of Goldeneye. Thankfully, further into the film, Hunt starts to develop more of his own personality, but there's a strong scent of Bond all the way throughout.The directing, which in the original was smooth and effortless, is sped up and choppy in the sequel. Director John Woo plays to his strengths here, but overindulges his fetishes for slow-mo and kung fu moves, making the film seem simply ridiculous at times. Even for a secret agent, it is more than impossible to take as much physical punishment and perform as many gravity defying martial arts moves as Hunt does at the film's climax, and do we really need to see a slow-mo shot of Hunt walking towards his car? Clearly, realism has left the building, (particularly in the end showdown, which is entertaining to be sure, but one can't help but laugh as Hunt pulls off far too many martial art tricks on his adversary) and it's more glaringly obvious in M:I2 than most similar action films.But in spite of all my criticism, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Because it is essential, quality film-making? Definitely not. But what it is, is some good, old fashioned, BIG LOUD FUN. Our over glorified hero takes on and defeats countless enemies while performing breathtaking stunts to the sounds of a consistently excellent blaring rock soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. What more can you ask than that? M:I2 was a genuinely entertaining blockbuster which supplied all the car chases, explosions, shootouts and death-defying stunts to make a truly excellent action film. Who really needs all that other stuff, like story or script anyway?-7/10",7,4,7,17 October 2004
Silence," One small step for mankind
","For the last Martin Scorsese cinematic outing, audiences were graced with a drooling Jonah Hill waggling rubber genitalia across the screen. If a more abrupt paradigm shift exists than Silence, Scorsese's solemn passion project exploring faith, suffering, and the ethics of martyrdom, I dare you to find it. Taking a fair share of cues from Ingmar Bergman, and with nary a jaunty rock tune in sight, Silence completes Scorsese's spirituality triptych (following Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ) not with a roar, but an appropriately introspective whisper. The clue is in the title, and Scorsese's latest work, though imperfect, stands among his most raw, yearning, powerful, and gruesomely beautiful.Charting the tormented journey of two Jesuit missionaries in 17th century Japan in search of their disappeared, disgraced mentor, Silence plays somewhere between The Last Temptation of Christ and Apocalypse Now, but is somehow bleaker than both. Before Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe (Garfield and Driver) have even left their monastery for Japan, they are already scrutinized by Scorsese's penetrating high angle tracking shots, like a literal eye of God surveilling them forebodingly. Upon their arrival in Japan (which Scorsese cloaks in perennial stylized mists, a transparent visual metaphor for the ethical and spiritual cloudiness to follow), Rodrigues and Garupe are already immediately in jeopardy. They are found by a sect of closeted Japanese Christians who cling to worshipping them with an almost manic desperation, only to repeatedly watch these followers be gruesomely tortured to death by the Japanese authorities, too recalcitrant to apostatize (publicly renouncing their faith) in front of the helpless priests. Here, Scorsese establishes the film's core thematic tension: martyrdom aside, at what point are the benefits of spiritual dogmatism outweighed by the collateral suffering and deaths of those whose lives it is meant to save? The latter half of the film is devoted to interrogating (pun intended) this question in more solemn detail. It's a gruelling, but also distressingly timely watch, and Scorsese, while stopping short of the torture-porn extremes of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, doesn't shirk on graphic imagery in detailing the agonizing torment individuals are willing to espouse and governments are willing to inflict in the name of religious dissonance. Navigating the tricky subject matter, Scorsese is (largely) careful to deconstruct his narrative's implicit colonialism, while (mostly) steering clear of its perilous potential for Orientalist othering. A more balanced take would linger less with Father Rodrigues' steadfast Christian conviction, and grant more of a voice to the Japanese Buddhists, to have their vehement rejection of external Christianity play with more context than outright tyranny (the fact that Buddhism is itself an import religion to Japan is a cruel irony the film leaves untouched). One fleeting sequence, where Scorsese's surrogate Pontius Pilate, the Japanese anti-Christian inquisitor (Issey Ogata, whose flamboyant preening is perfectly malevolent and curiously funny) rebuts why he avidly resists the encroaching Christianity in his land, is one of the film's most fascinating moments, temporarily playing the film more as debate and less as diatribe. Ultimately, Scorsese is less interested in the polemic of missionary politics and colonialism than Rodrigues' own spiritual journey, but there's still the lingering unease of the tale begetting a Letters to Iwo Jima style counterpoint to fully tell the story. Focalizing the story through Garfield's Father Rodrigues proves a risky endeavour, as his earnest-turned-agonizingly-unrequited prayer-narration initially grates to the point of prodding the patience of even the most faithful Scorsese devotees (a fact not helped by his ludicrously unconvincing Portuguese accent, though Driver fares little better, while Neeson is evidently disinterested in even attempting one). There are many moments when we yearn for the title to have been obeyed somewhat more literally, as Garfield's voice-over threatens to detract from the stunning Taipei scenery. Even with Scorsese's never-steadier directorial hand lending the film a lethal calm and perennial throb of threat, two and a half fairly plodding hours with an existential Garfield tests viewer bladder capacity to the utmost. Then, halfway through, Scorsese finally shows his hand with a cunning turning point: we finally realize Rodrigues' obsession with the spiritual glory of martyrdom isn't meant to play as sympathetic. Suddenly, images of the looming face of Christ he fixates upon begin to play as cruelly ironic, if not outright contemptible, just as his increasing refusal to apostatize plays as increasingly selfish in the face of the multitudes of Japanese devotees dying to protect him. It's a bold reversal, and only successful thanks to Garfield's fearlessly human performance. His willingness to fully embrace and embody Rodrigues' flaws allow him to glide effortlessly from his early chirpily boyish, but somewhat short-sighted devotion, to his later defeated, muted husk of a man with surprising subtlety and enigmatic dissociation. By flirting with being so inaccessible, Garfield crafts one of the most unexpectedly haunting performances of the year. Similarly, Adam Driver's cracking voice and emaciated body embody Garupe's misery and doubt with remarkably visceral power. As the resident Kurtz, Liam Neeson employs his hangdog face and gravelly, sonorous tones to project unfathomable depths of defeat and bitterness, all the more stirring when his tempting words of corruption begin to make increasing, tragic sense. Still, it's Yōsuke Kubozuka as the Gollum-like Kichijiro, Scorsese's most recent Judas surrogate, who delivers the most fascinating emotional arc. Guided by Kubozuka's petulant charisma, Kichijiro's perennial betrayals and repentances transition from numbingly tragic to slapstick humour and back again with alarming effortlessness, making him a pathetic but unforgettable creation.Beautiful, searing, and achingly soulful, Silence poses profound, challenging questions, while remaining frequently teasingly enigmatic about the answers. While not quite reaching the formal perfection and blistering resonance of many of Scorsese's earlier classics, as religious persecution continues to proliferate in the contemporary world, a film so fearlessly prescient should be considered troubling, but essential, unforgettable viewing. Just don't be surprised for the film's title to prove prophetic for the state of its audiences afterwards. -8.5/10",9,1,3,31 January 2017
Logan," The Slashist
","Never underestimate a good Johnny Cash song. His course, plaintive 'Hurt' as backing track singularly ratcheted the Wolverine 3 trailer from mild superhero curiosity to one of the year's most anticipated films - grim, bare-bones, and populated not with CGI-bloated posturing, but with genuine human hurt and heart. Then, the title drop: Logan. No numeric epithet, no pandering 'X-Men Origins.' Just Logan. It's impossibly representative; Logan is lean, mean, and, despite the lack of titular superheroic alias, the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for. Of all the hats Wolverine has worn through the years, from samurai to spandex, a cowboy hat may be the most natural fit, and returning director James Mangold keenly embraces his film's intrinsic western influences, with more Unforgiven than Uncanny X-Men at play here. Only loosely drawing on Mark Millar's seminal Old Man Logan (no mafia of cannibalistic Hulk incest offspring here, for one), Mangold's 2029- set story is nowhere near as flamboyantly dystopian as Days of Future Past. Dusty, dark and whittled down, Mangold's screenplay obstinately avoids any expositional spoon- feeding, instead trusting the strength of his performers to get the sordid backstory across, with only the faintest teases of narrative breadcrumbs (hint: always listen to the radio). Here, Fox atones for their past X-sins (no more X-cuses?) by de-mythologizing the superhero more than Alan Moore's Watchmen. Instead, our titular ex-X-Man breaks ranks with his comic book past by, in a cunning fourth wall breach, brandishing X-Men comics and knocking aside Wolverine action figures in-text, and scorning them as bullsh*t. His film follows suit, flayed of all but the most rudimentary comic book winks (and even the most fanatical nerds aren't too likely to squeal at the Reavers or Caliban, as enjoyable as Stephen Merchant's crusty, brittle performance is). If you're harbouring hope for intertextual X-nods or cameos, save it for the exquisite Deadpool 2 teaser, bub. Instead, Mangold crafts a grim, ramshackle road trip movie. He devotes far more time to basking in his characters' perennial aging agony and curmudgeonly family dynamics than the brewing military science conspiracy that prompts Logan's run. Pacing is fairly measured, including a dalliance at a family farm far more successful than Avengers: Age of Ultron's, which allows for plenty of breathing character beats, at the cost of urgency and momentum. It's spiced up considerably by Mangold's gleeful exploitation of his hard-won R-rating, and the comedic novelty of Logan and Professor Xavier spewing F-bombs (F-Men? Okay, I'll stop) has an unexpectedly enjoyable shelf life. Still, Mangold's film largely avoids flagging through its bursts of action combat. We've waited 17 years for an uncensored Wolverine fight scene, and he makes up for lost time here, each hack-and-slash fuelled by bedraggled fury and flamboyant gore, no face or limb safe from perforation. The saying may go 'It's all fun and game until somebody loses an eye,' but countless eyes are lost (or covered, for those who prefer their combat PG-13), and Logan has never felt so free. Nonetheless, my 'no cannibalistic Hulk incest offspring' jab is not wholly a compliment. There's the persistent tickle of Mangold's film, in its quest for ruthless realism, playing a touch too safe. This isn't to say we need full-blown Mad Max histrionics, but endless sequences of Logan and Laura and stabbing their way through legions of metal- armed mercenaries in lieu of a juicy big bad (Boyd Holbrook and Richard E. Grant both sneer and steal scenery enjoyably, but are disappointingly bland and forgettable) do lose their lustre over time. A third act twist literalizing the 'Wolverine's worst enemy is himself' conceit isn't innovative or memorable enough to cover the slack (apparently undershirt shade provides the film's 'black/white hat' Western moral dichotomy here), and a pseudo-science climax attempting to graft larger scope to the narrative feels rushed and forced. The most cringeworthy, however, is Mangold reworking his film as a cloying love-letter to classic Western Shane, from a clumsily gratuitous mid-film nod, to a fawning climax saturated in schmaltzy cheese. It's an unorthodox, disappointingly disingenuous surge of sentiment in a film so otherwise unpretentiously bleak, and Logan's swan song deserves better.Still, the importance of a superhero film this character-driven can't be overstated, and the work of the central trio are what really hit home. His 17th year snikting claws, Hugh Jackman has never been more committed to Wolverine's gruff charisma and burly humanity. He's so believable as a man defeated as much in soul as body, Jackman doesn't so much act as embody being dragged, cussing and screaming, over broken glass for two and a quarter hours, without the Oscar-begging bleating of a Leo in The Revenant. This is not a superhero, action star, or wounded western gunslinger. This is real hurt. That said, newcomer Dafne Keen's X- 23 is arguably even more extraordinary. She's so credibly feral she can be hysterical, heartbreaking, or truly chilling with only the slightest twitch of a lupine eyebrow. It's unclear whether she's being groomed as a new franchise headliner, but her exceptionally raw acting earmarks her as an emerging star to watch out for. Still, it's Patrick Stewart's Xavier who ultimately walks away from the show, radiating cavernously credible agony and disappointment at his diminishing mind and the suffering it has caused, all gilded with a gleefully profane sense of humour. Logan has been heralded as 'the new Dark Knight' in terms of reaffirming the potential of the superhero film, though it's a bit too derivative and tonally confused for the title to hold. What's indisputable is its status as the most blisteringly emotional, mature, and savagely hard-edged genre offering in years. Remember Wolverine's congratulatory comic catchphrase that X-Men Origins embarrassingly beat out of him? It couldn't be truer here: Logan (and Jackman himself) is the best there is at what he does. -8.5/10",8,1,5,7 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 'Cuttlefish'
","Comparisons to Spider-Man 3 are a bad sign. Sam Raimi's legendary mess set the standard for how bloated studio superhero films could easily become if not carefully curtailed. The genre was henceforth faced with a challenge: rise to the 'MORE! BIGGER! DIFFERENT AND BETTER!' demand of increasing returns in a steadily oversaturated market without buckling under the condemnation of 'WHOA! TOO MUCH!' – no easy task. Or is it? For years, Marvel Studios held the golden ticket, keeping their action driven by humour and character beats, and remembering to have fun. Audiences, it seems, were not as keen on 'BIGGER! MORE!' as on fresh, funny, and human – qualities nerd God Joss Whedon's 2012 Avengers delivered in spades. Whedon announced that his Avengers sequel would be smaller, darker, and more personal. You can guess which two he succeeded at. If anything, Age of Ultron will likely surpass Spider-Man 3 as genre benchmark for exhaustingly busy - a cautionary tale of pressures superhero blockbusters should not cave to if they want to remain relevant. The consolation: even at his worst (sadly) and most studio- bridled, Whedon remains incapable of making a work without moments of passion, joy, and gleeful inventiveness. Ultimately, most of Age of Ultron is very good; the main concern is that there is simply so much that it feels too exhausting to pack the same triumphant punch and clockwork (dare I say it) assembly of its predecessor. Whedon's TV background is apt, as Age of Ultron feels more like a miniseries - tons of worthwhile, memorable moments, but too much to watch in one go. Thankfully, Whedon keeps the kernel of the story simple amidst its thousands of locations and often unnecessary subplots (sorry overlong farm scene and Thor's mystery exposition cave). The worst redundancy is namedropping the Infinity Stones – aka, MacGuffin of most of Marvel Phase 1 & 2, and the catalyst of the upcoming the two-part Infinity Wa– oh, you knew that already? So did everyone else, thanks to Benicio Del Toro and his wacky hair in Guardians of the Galaxy. Generic climaxes or not, Marvel's biggest pitfall is now wasting precious screen time 'world-building' instead of trusting that its already established audiences know how to google. The film's action is lively, inventive, and constantly moving – the opening raid on Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann)'s Hydra safehouse alone contains more mayhem (and likely budget) than all 13 hours of the Marvel Netflix Daredevil series combined, complete with a long take tracking shot giving each character their smashing in the spotlight cleverly recalling its predecessor in Avengers' climactic showdown. This constantly zippy combat does wear a touch thin after the next several fights are similarly bouncy, and you begin to wish that at least one fight – particularly the long awaited Hulkbuster pugilistics (still awesome) – would stay still, and each blow count and resonate more. Instead, the CGI clanging becomes increasingly consequence-free, making it resoundingly less exciting over time. Whedon's ultimate boon is his uncanny ability to give each of his massive cast moments of character development amidst the mayhem (take note, Peter Jackson and his '12 hours into The Hobbit and most of the dwarfs still haven't spoken'). All of the returning Avengers feel fresh and believable, even evidencing interesting character growth. Robert Downey Jr's Stark gets as many laughs as ever, but drifts into unsympathetic, self-described 'mad-scientist' terrain, doggedly rekindling Jurassic Park's creation debate for the smart phone age of instant technological gratification. His clashes with Captain 'language!' America (Chris Evans, wearing the role like a comfortable leather combat glove) foreground the upcoming Civil War ideological conflict in the one piece of 'world-building' that feels natural and thrilling. It is odd to yearn for more Ultron in a film named after him, but James Spader's performance- captured supervillain is a thrilling, fantastically believable creation. Interpreting Ultron as a furiously resentful adolescent gives Spader's silky baritone the chance to spout out as many exquisitely sulky 'Leave me ALONE!'s as eloquent zingers. Of equal fascination is his brainchild - Paul 'JARVIS' Bettany's Vision. Scarlet with a golden cape, the '60s antique Vision is a hard sell, but Bettany's deftly ethereal performance makes his inclusion a high point (complete with a priceless sight-gag I won't ruin here). Likewise, in what should be an extraneous subplot, Andy Serkis' South African Ulysses Klaue damn near walks away with the show with his stupendously fun scene-chomping. The prospect of Serkis' return in 2018's Black Panther is mouth-watering.Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and (especially) Elizabeth Olson both impress as the 'fast and weird' Maximoff twins, wobbly accents notwithstanding, and their unique abilities help keep the smashing fresh and interesting. Chris Hemsworth's Thor steals most of the best laughs and lines, alongside Don Cheadle, who should really just get his own War Machine movie (miniseries?) already. Even Jeremy Renner's notoriously maligned Hawkeye picks up his share of character beats and laughs, mining the 'everyman surrounded by gods' trope for all it's worth. The cataclysmically weak point: the execrable Beauty and the Beast pastiche (wasn't Pinocchio enough?) Black Widow/Hulk romance. Their pairing never even remotely rings true, coming dangerously close to The Hobbit-levels of distracting, almost-tanking-the-show romance. If anything, the film is sure to play brilliantly on Blu-Ray, if only for the ability to fast-forward through these asinine 'BruTasha' interludes. Ultimately, Age of Ultron is a generally solid maelstrom of superhero fun, but somewhat too incohensive, too much, to sit well in a single sitting. The incorrigible excess would be enough to crave the smallness (ha) of Marvel's next release, Ant-Man, if it didn't look even more soulless since the departure of spark-of-life Edgar Wright. As it stands, as a more grounded antidote, Netflix's Daredevil is rather fantastic. Plus, it has a good zinger about cat videos. Whedon would be proud. -7/10",7,1,4,8 June 2015
The Dark Knight," 'You've changed things forever. There's no going back'
","Christopher Nolan must be one of the most admired men in the film industry of late. Having been handed a superhero franchise crumbling under its own campiness and trusted with the task of revamping it, adding a firm undercurrent of complexity without sacrificing the inherent enjoyment associated with a man dressing as a bat battling the criminal underworld, Nolan thrived upon the challenge, his Batman Begins providing a new height in the genre and one of the most acclaimed films of the year. And as seemingly impossible as it may have seemed to top his first effort, Nolan appears to have tapped into even more film-making genius, his peerless imagination, courage and unwavering control over every facet of his production making The Dark Knight a seamless, dazzlingly complex sequel to an already essentially flawless first effort - it is near impossible to envision the film being any stronger.Though the film embraces similar themes and plays to all the strengths of the genre, in the end the film proves a 'comic book movie' essentially in name only, as it feels as if Nolan has seamlessly melded several films into one, the tone varying from ultra realistic crime dramas (such as Nolan's inspiration, Michael Mann's Heat) to using the template of the traditional superhero/supervillain conflict as a parable of good, evil and the constant ambiguity and overlap between. In a particularly chilling passage, the Joker disturbingly dissects the effects of Batman and himself on Gotham city and how the friction between 'an unstoppable force and an immovable object', or Batman's unwavering dedication to justice counterbalancing the Joker's obsession with chaos and disarray simply leads to everlasting conflict. 'I feel like we could do this forever', the Joker wryly states, and with such chilling, exhilarating and fiendishly complex results, the possibility is mouth-watering indeed.In fact, if one was to extract any form of complaint from such a complex marvel of a film it would be that through the film's consistent breakneck pace and flurry of new plot points and story arcs, the audience is somewhat deprived of the chance to savour some of the film's elements, to take a moment to drink in the all around mastery, from the quiet character moments to the jaw dropping stunts or flooring performances. But there can be little doubt that this is fully Nolan's intent, as The Dark Knight proves an entirely different animal than its predecessor: less about characters (though their development in the simply superb screenplay by Nolan and his brother Jonathan is near flawless) than broad statements, and the lack of quiet, reflective moments simply furthering the chaotic, uncertain feel of the story. However, despite the vast, epic array of content, never does it feel like Nolan has bitten off more than he can chew, but rather than the viewer is challenged to keep up with his immensity of vision.However, those expecting a light-hearted, carefree action romp will find themselves somewhat taken aback, as the film is aptly titled, 'dark' being the operative word. Never before has a comic book film boasted a tone of such crushing realism and devastating, visceral wrenching of emotions. Yet despite the absence of outright bombastic fun, never does the question 'why so serious?' emerge, as The Dark Knight could never have been anything but, yet never proves overly morose to the point of preventing entertainment. Similarly, those fearing the genre becoming overly cerebral need not fear the action frontier being sacrificed, as Nolan somehow manages to again up the ante on his first effort's already breathless action sequences, providing enough explosions and brief but ferociously intense combat scenes to sate any action enthusiast without sacrificing an ounce of complexity. The sweeping, sumptuous cinematography and soaring score by two of modern cinema's finest composers, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard completes the sublime package, making for a technically savoury masterpiece.Christian Bale once again gives a remarkable performance, breathing consistently credible life into each of the title character's dual identities, providing a wistful desperation for a Bruce Wayne tantalised by the prospect of abandoning Batman while his alter ego is needed more than ever by his crumbling city. However, despite Bale's powerhouse lead there can be no doubt that the film's primary selling point is the flat out terrifying yet mesmerizing performance by the tragically late Heath Ledger. His anarchistic Joker unquestionably steals the show (no easy feat), flipping between darkly hilarious and chilling while remaining a consistently fascinating and compelling creation - a frighteningly real antagonist for the ages, and easily one of the most visibly unsettling and powerful performances in decades. Aaron Eckhart is similarly superb as Harvey Dent, Gotham's new tenaciously dedicated district attorney, and his inevitable fall from earnest grace is truly affecting, with Eckhart perfectly essaying the shift from charismatic to horrifying. Michael Caine offers a perfect dose of wry humour and inspiration as Wayne's trusted butler Alfred, and Gary Oldman gives a rousingly sympathetic performance as fiercely honest cop Jim Gordon, with Oldman giving one of the most credible heroic performance in recent memory. Morgan Freeman remains pure class as Wayne's CEO and Batman's secret outfitter, and Maggie Gyllenhaal proves a far superior replacement to Katie Holmes, adding a witty spark to an otherwise standard love interest role.Never once patronising its audience, The Dark Knight proves easily the most mature, staggeringly intelligent, insightful, breathless and pitch black comic book adaptation to grace the screen in recent memory, and arguably ever. Indeed, the Joker's declaration of Batman's effect on Gotham's criminals proves prophetic and parallels the effect of the film itself on its medium - there can be little doubt that The Dark Knight has changed the face of what can be expected out of a comic book movie, dispelling critical scorn and rivalling any 'serious film' in terms of complexity and film-making mastery. Never again will the face of comic book movies be the same - 'there's no going back'.-10/10",10,4,9,25 July 2008
Blood Diamond," Intense and emotionally flooring from start to finish
","It's easy to be deceived by the marketing for a movie such as Blood Diamond. While it may have been presented through movie trailers, publicity material and the like as a standardised Hollywood suspense movie, complete with Leonardo DiCaprio and the like... do not be fooled into thinking that is all Blood Diamond boils down to, because there is so very much more to it than that. In essence, the movie seems to be the amalgamation of two or three films shoved together into one - the intense, emotionally draining story of the Sierra Leone atrocities, the political story showing the futility of so much bloodshed over simple stones, and of course the suspenseful adventure movie, but one far more genuine and emotionally gripping than we have seen for years. The thing which really sets Blood Diamond apart from most other movies with similar subject matter is the way that the content is presented. Rather than a borderline propaganda film harping on our sense of guilt, trying to get us to get us to send a cheque, all of the horrendous events shown detailing the Sierra Leone crisis are portrayed in a relatively impartial yet brutally unflinching fashion. In this aspect, Blood Diamond is by far one of the most upsetting films of the past several years simply because it doesn't turn a blind eye to the horrifying massacres - expect to see entire families getting brutally gunned down for no reason at all, limbs being chopped off innocent people unlucky enough to be caught, and children wielding firearms, grunting in the fashion of bloodthirsty adults. Some viewers have complained that the intense violence especially concerning children was almost exploited, a sort of cash in for our entertainment. I disagree; the violence was incredibly upsetting, yes, but in terms of emotional impact it seemed far more genuine than any relief film or commercial. This is just as meaningful as any other Sierra Leone publicity material, and far more relatable. Simply because the massacres and horribly unjust treatment were shown in such a matter of fact fashion, simply as a fact of life, it drove the emotional resonance home all the more strongly, since the audience is haunted all the more by the knowledge that such atrocities are still going on strong in the world, simply for the sake of our decadence. Edward Zwick, director of the terrific The Last Samurai has produced a film of a similar vein, but is ultimately far superior to any work he has done in the past. The sheer emotional impact of the movie feels like a physical blow to the head, yet one cannot deny, despite the disturbingly brutal content how the film is still an enjoyable thrill ride on the side. How the two can be tacked together is beyond me, but somehow Zwick pulls it off - we are horrified yet elated in turn, all the time drawn in by some utterly gorgeous African cinematography, a tense, exciting score, a compelling and terse script by Charles Leavitt, and of course some incredibly affecting and powerful acting. As a matter of fact, there is only one scene in the entire film which comes across as cheesy or clichéd - there are more which come close, but such fears are alleviated by the superb cast acting at the top of their game. Leonardo DiCaprio has been showing a drastic increase in talent of late, but there can be no doubt that 2006 showcases what is by far the strongest work he has ever put onto a movie screen, what with his work here, and stealing the show with an immensely powerful performance in Martin Scorsese's The Departed. DiCaprio makes the role of jaded and cynical diamond smuggler Danny Archer his own, nailing the south African accent, and completely immersing himself in his character, and never once letting any trace of himself save his charismatic and flooring performance through, making it impossible to picture any other actor playing the part. Djimon Hounsou impresses similarly with a simply wonderful and haunting performance as fisherman Solomon Vandy, who is taken through indescribable trials and horrifying tribulations, all the time only wanting to use the priceless conflict diamond he hid in a hole by the river to free his enslaved family. Jennifer Connelly also gives a strong and resonant performance as American journalist Maddy Bowen, a wonderful addition to the film even if she is without question outshone by Hounsou and especially the charismatic DiCaprio. Arnold Vosloo also gives a solid performance as the the military general head of Archer's smuggling ring, and David Harewood makes one of the most horrifying villains of the past few years as one of the Sierra Leone slavers. The terrific Michael Sheen also turns in a tidy little performance as an infuriating buyer of Archer's conflict diamonds. All in all, Blood Diamond is one of the most powerful and stunningly well done films in recent memory, serving as a superb film on so many levels. Politically resonant, emotionally flooring, and packed with wonderfully genuine yet affecting performances from top to bottom, especially the intensely powerful DiCaprio and wonderful Hounsou. A superb piece of work from start to finish, expect this movie to stay with you for days after its initial viewing. -10/10",10,2,2,23 December 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Life is but a dream
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind How does one describe a film such as this? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind exudes a far different feel than pretty much any other movie in the history of film. Strictly speaking, it is a romantic drama, but there are so very many more layers to it than that. Eternal Sunshine is refreshingly surreal and weird, and yet at the same time painfully realistic and honest. This may sound like a contradiction - one of the film's points is that life is full of them. Director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman have masterfully succeeded at creating a completely unique world in which to tell their wonderful story. Being that almost the whole movie is told in the mind of Joel (Jim Carrey), and is essentially a dream of sorts, Gondry and Kaufman have concluded that many dreamlike occurrences may occur. It's sometimes hard to follow the storyline, since the story is being constantly barreled abruptly in the opposite direction, with us as the audience being taken into areas we have never seen before. But this never comes across as a problem; instead we only become more intrigued by this surrealistic storytelling, and more interested in watching the relationship of Joel and Clementine unfold in reverse. But, uniquely bizarre storytelling fashion aside, at the heart of the story is a genuine and painfully honest love story. We connect to the characters of Joel and Clementine in such a deep manner which is simply lost in modern fiction. Never once in the movie do we interpret Joel and Clementine as fictional characters - these are real people, and this is a genuine love story unfolding its complex beauty in front of us. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet each give career defining performances, and capture our hearts like no other mere 'characters' before. The supporting cast are equally note perfect, when given their moments to shine. Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood each manage to astound us in turn, and there is not a single character in the film who we as an audience fail to relate with and sympathize for. These are frighteningly real people, interacting in a very genuine fashion. Yet the movie really belongs to Joel and Clementine, and Carrey and Winslet whisk us through, dreamlike, and never fail to astound and delight us. I think it's safe to say that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best and most unique films ever made - it boasts easily the best script of its year and one of the best ever written, in my opinion. It demonstrates a complex storyline in an intricate and dream like manner, and gives us one of the most truthful and affecting love stories ever captured on film. Be warned - this movie will stay with you for a very long time, and you will almost certainly start to see parallels in your own life. Such is the beauty and power of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. A proud 10 out of 10!-10/10",10,1,3,3 January 2006
Alice in Wonderland," Soulless, by the numbers and drained of redeeming strangeness – hardly a 'wonderland'
","If ever there was a match seemingly tailor made in cinematic heaven, the fusion of Lewis Carroll's cheerfully strange children's fable Alice in Wonderland and Tim Burton, celebrated for his equally bizarre and beautifully grotesque cinematic aesthetics would seem to be it. And yet. For so definitive a pairing, the viewer is never left without a sense of want for more - an elusive sense of lacking throughout. And then the reality of the experience ultimately settles in, yielding a bounty of profound disappointment - Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a project so handpicked for success that it could never have emerged as anything but what it is: the latest in a slew of films geared for great promise, yet ultimately saddled with being a fundamentally soulless, functionable yet frustratingly by-the-numbers piece of mainstream entertainment. For all the talk of the project being darker, quirkier and edgier than past incarnations of Carroll's cherished tale, it is a remarkable experience to see dark, quirky and edgy be distilled into such an innocuous, harmless slab of comfortable, conventional film-making. There is a perpetual sense of narrative boxes being ticked: the stifling, claustrophobic aristocratic home life in Alice's 'real world', the array of visual trickery, jaw dropping sets and colourful, memorable characters, all introduced in turn for the sake allowing them all their moment, the necessary exposition for the sake of elucidating viewers unaccustomed to Carroll's world, the reveal of the hero's perilous quest and her requisite struggle with acceptance and 'coming of age'. It feels unsettling to see Burton, a filmmaker previously associated with jolting or at least tweaking expectations, delivering plot point after plot point in so cozy, docile and gormless a fashion, as if delivering the familiar formula with additional pablum rather than shaking it up. This is not to say that Alice in Wonderland is a downright poor film - the standard of quality elements on display remains impressive throughout. It is simply the perpetual sense of the film as such an obvious construction, as if slapped together in a factory from a mould designed for maximum comfortable entertainment, which undercuts all its more laudable elements. Gutted is Carroll's penchant for clever wordplay, subversive mind games or surrealist touches, in favour of a tame adventure/redemption story, with even the stranger characters and settings seemingly inserted for the sake of crafting the illusion of innovation. Equally, the constant references to Alice's previous trip to Wonderland, rather than providing an insightful rumination on the echoing of cultural narratives, instead feel muddled and unwieldly, culminating in a clumsy parable attempting to outline the inevitability of one's actions while also championing (implicitly impossible) individual empowerment, making for an unbalanced thematic centre.Even Burton's Wonderland, while providing an enjoyable mess of colour and twisted forms, evoking dregs of fascination (the castle moat requiring passage over decapitated human heads is a nicely grotesque touch, albeit one out of place in the overall kid-friendly veneer), feels a tiresomely constructed affair, as if cobbled together by a novice attempting to 'do' Burton rather than the legendary director himself. Even the much heralded 3D effects, while fun, do little to add to any immersive sense of environment or fantasy awe. And Danny Elfman's score leaves one wondering if any traces of his previous flair for enthusiastic, memorable themes remains intact, as his latest work only serves to hammer out banal musical cliché after cliché, further accentuating the overall bland and innocuous feel. Similarly, the cast run the risk of coasting by on their ideal casting rather than mustering up enough motivation to truly sell their performances. As Alice, Mia Wasikowska encapsulates the overall feel through her performance: serviceably charismatic, balancing moments of wide-eyed innocence with hard worn maturity, yet tiresomely bland and lacking any real spark. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter delivers yet another cheerfully deranged loon, but the novelty of his eccentricities wears perilously thin, making his bulging green eyes and garrulously fluctuating accents still lack the necessary punch to distinguish his Hatter from past oddball creations. Likewise is Helena Bonham Carter's petulant Red Queen, coasting on apparent autopilot and lacking the vindictive leering to make her 'Off with their heads!' really hit home. Anne Hathaway emerges in a more favourable light as the White Queen, subversively twisting the ethereal, gossamer royalty clichés with an undercurrent of irritable edge, and offering one of the film's few traces of subtlety. Such is a quality sorely lacking in the awkwardly stretched Crispin Glover's Red Knave, one of the most harmless 'creepy evil' characters in years, and Matt Lucas' comic relief twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, whose banter is so boring and banal one is left debating the purpose of their inclusion at all. The celebrity-voiced animals prove more endearing, particularly Stephen Fry's sumptuously oily and sanguine Cheshire Cat and Alan Rickman's gleefully grumpy Caterpillar, but one is left lamenting the peerless Christopher Lee's booming tones as the ferocious Jabberwocky being reduced to a single line, as shameless a piece of stunt casting as his pointless appearance in 2007's The Golden Compass. It is telling that the most enjoyable and fully realized character is the deranged March Hare, a consistent background player, who, through continually throwing crockery around and unhinged cackling, injects the film with crucially lacking dashes of spontaneity and energy. There is undeniable entertainment to be found in Burton's Wonderland: exciting battles, strangely stylized sets and quirky characters. But it is the near flaunted sense of artificiality, of the consciously constructed package of the affair, which leaves a continual disconnect between the viewer and true engagement or enjoyment. Perhaps the involvement of Disney should have suggested such a docile, friendly take, but for all averse to quality yet blandly assembled fantasy adventure, this is one rabbit hole worth staying out of. -5.5/10",5,8,14,25 March 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," The world's most banal and clichéd 'inspirational' film
","Every once in a while, a movie comes along which the general public seems to just adore, lapping up every second of it, which, when I see it... I simply cannot understand the draw, nor how the average viewer could find anything to appreciate in such a mess of a movie. The World's Fastest Indian seems to be one of the above, and it seems undeniable that I am in the strong minority here, but it is beyond me how so many viewers could take so strongly to such a trite, clichéd, rambling mess of a film. While it's true that the story of New Zealander Burt Monroe is without a doubt an incredibly impressive tale of inspiration and hope, his movie incarnation does him no justice whatsoever, as it seems nothing more than a great story hiding within a terrible movie. Director Roger Donaldson has tied together a remarkably disjointed film, stretching out barely and hour and a half worth of plot material over two hours in length, sloshing on every possible cliché all the while. There are so many scenes which seem thrown in simply for the purpose of adding more running time to the movie, (is a scene with Munroe taking a transvestite out to lunch really necessary in furthering the storyline?) or giving Anthony Hopkins yet another chance to show how charming and affable Monroe really was. At first this is tolerable, but after about 20 minutes of thrown in pointless scenes, this plot padding really starts to grate on the viewer's nerves. And it is irresistible to point out the irony of a movie based around speed being so slow moving and anti-climatic. Such irritation is strongly contributed to by the simply banal musical score, which plays upon literally almost every single movie music cliché in a particularly tasteless fashion, sounding almost like a bad Disney animated movie score. Why on earth Donaldson would choose such a turgid composer for his film is beyond conventions of logic, but it seems simply yet another terrible lapse in judgement. It goes without saying that Donaldson's screenplay is also a trite, painfully conventional piece of work, so straightforward and formulaic it could be churned up by most screenwriters in their sleep. It's also a shame that such beautiful scenery is wasted by the bland and uninspired cinematography, which seems determined to capture as little of the astonishing landscapes as possible, opting instead for more and more shots of Hopkins grimacing on his bike. For a director with such well known past credentials, it would seem Donaldson needs to take a trip back to film school to learn how to make an entertaining movie yet again. While Hopkins is the film's indisputable highlight, even he fails to live up to the hype surrounding his performance, including his own overzealous declaration of his performance as Munroe being 'the best piece of work I've ever done'. While his Munroe is a charming and affable fellow, a welcome break in character for Hopkins, Donaldson's idea of building a compelling character seems to be relying on Hopkins making the same cutesy mannerisms over and over again. (yes it is funny and charming the first time he doesn't hear what somebody says, or does something oddball and likable, but after the 30th time this is less endearing) A strong performance, yes, but in terms of being enough to carry an otherwise very weak film... not in the least. While The World's Fastest Indian was likely meant to be a heartwarming tale of hope and dedication, it's extremely difficult not to choke on the tirades of sap or stumble over every single Hollywood cliché which is revisited in the tale. While Hopkins gives an indisputably charming and likable performance, it is nowhere near enough to resurrect a film which has so little merit of any sort keeping it going. The irony of a movie dedicated to speed being so slow moving itself is one of the painfully few bits of merit to be found in this horrifyingly conventional interpretation of one of the true stories which should in all fairness have translated well into a film. The story deserved a far better telling than this. -4/10",4,3,14,16 February 2007
Avatar," 'The Future' feels very familiar...
","Twelve years after Titanic made him the self-proclaimed 'king of the world', director James Cameron, with typical boldness, has declared his intention to not only attempt to reinvent the science fiction genre, but herald in a new era of technologically fuelled cinema. Having already rocked genre foundations with the Terminator series and currently armed with new technology poised to capture and render three dimensional computer generated imagery like never before, thus immersing the viewer into a fully realized cinematic environment, it appeared Cameron was prepared to make good on his ambitions. However, it is the film's staggering (and largely self-generated) hype, building a reputation of the film being 'the new Jazz Singer', a film to radically change what the medium meant and how it worked, which, while obviously serving well to sell tickets (poignantly suggesting the ability of an otherwise less remarkable film to 'talk up' its own success) proves detrimental to the film. Avatar, while boasting undeniably flooring visuals, remains at heart a fun, solidly made yet slightly campy adventure tale, but nowhere near the singlehanded cinematic revolution it was declared to be.It is ironic that the film's groundbreaking 3D proved its largest selling point, as nearly everything else about the film comes across as so strikingly 2D. The plot, stripped of its futuristic space trappings, proves a rather blatant re-tread of Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves, a narrative already and since nearly done to death, making the 'anti-capitalist, embracing individual and collective spirit' ideology promoted feel more of a requisite narrative checkmark rather than a heartfelt message (the intriguing thematic link of humans requiring 'avatars', or inhabiting fictional, constructed external bodies to 'realize their full potential' is equally left frustratingly unexplored). It also comes across as odd that a film twelve years in production would not have time for even a brief script revision, as most of Avatar's dialogue is unmistakably banal even for an action film, and any character development is reduced to throwaway lines of exposition, making it a struggle to take to any protagonist. Similarly, likely for the sense of further cultivating the feel of an 'important, epic immersion into another world', the film's ponderous running time is simply too long to feasibly stretch out such a shallow story, giving the narrative the feel of forcibly dragging, particularly when the plot being dragged out is so howlingly predictable as is.But, the instant rebuttal arises, such concerns should ultimately be besides the point for a film whose interest is founded on its revolutionary visual spectacle. This is partially true, yet it is certainly worth arriving in the film prepared for the aforementioned complaints to mine the maximum enjoyment from the film. Nonetheless, for a film self-sold as the first step in a new age of cinema, the fact that such basic storytelling concerns can manage to distract from the sense of breathless immersion feels sub-standard and hardly groundbreaking if the allegedly unprecedented awe factor is marred by the same old complaints. The key, it would seem to an actual revolution in the medium of cinema, is a sense of roundedness – balancing the realism of the spectacle and sense of fun and excitement with sophistication, profundity and a uniform standard of quality. No matter how aesthetically groundbreaking, for a film to truly harbour a new epoch of the medium in such a cinema-conscious age, advancement on multiple levels, including narrative, would seem necessary.That being said, Avatar's CGI and 3D visual effects remain unquestionably remarkable, all the moreso through the attention to minuscule details (tiny plant filaments drifting in the wind) as the massive, sprawling extraterrestrial battles. Yet again, for a film boasting so much, one cannot help but feel slightly let down (especially with benchmarks such as the Lord of the Rings films setting a comparable standard) that the envelope was not pushed slightly more, as, once the resonant thrill of being thrust into the alien world of Pandora dies down, details such as the alien Na'vi starting to appear cartoon-like when contrasted with live performers rather than being seamlessly integrated and the fact that all the admittably impressive alien creature designs still feel excessively anthropomorphized or all have six legs, making the fantastic 'otherness' of the world disappointingly recede. James Horner's distractingly formulaic musical score jarringly clanging away in the background hardly helps.Similarly, all of Cameron's actors fall prey to the particular clunky style of performance which feels more forgivable in a film intended to be more outright fun than aiming for a 'serious epic' feel. Sam Worthington brings an affable earthiness and cocky humour to his paraplegic marine turned Na'vi saviour, but ultimately lacks the charisma to properly propel a film of such scope. Zoe Saldana tries her hardest, but ultimately is incapable of doing too much with a tiresomely clichéd 'native love interest' role. Sigourney Weaver has fun chewing the scenery at first and finally infusing the film with some honest emotion as a prickly scientist studying the Na'vi, but the normally reliable Stephen Lang and Giovanni Ribisi both wallow in campiness as pantomimes of villainy (vicious military man and petulant businessman respectively). Michelle Rodriguez delivers the most consistently satisfying performance as a cheeky military pilot, but her role is disappointingly clipped each time it generates the prospects of getting truly interesting.In the end, as aesthetically eye-popping as Avatar is, the healthiest viewing attitude is to treat it as an unassuming adventure romp rather than as the 'important cinematic epic' Cameron would have it be regarded as. Perhaps this is ultimately fitting, as, in terms of the history of the medium, film was initially created and mass marketed as a form of entertainment, and on this front Cameron's film is fully and enthusiastically prepared to deliver. An upheaval to the medium of cinema? No. A very fun and largely quality (if thoroughly flawed) slice of mainstream adventure worth seeing? Definitely.-8/10",8,0,1,22 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Relentless, mean, chilling and uniquely humorous - a welcome rekindling of roots for Raimi
","Once upon a time, long before the days of web swinging blockbusters, Sam Raimi made horror movies. Ridiculous, demented, technologically inventive and grotesquely comical horror movies of a kind never quite seen before, to be exact. Of course, as with most independent voices forced to appease mainstream audiences, while he managed to smuggle in many trademark quirky touches into the Spider-Man franchise (the ludicrously out of place Saturday Night Fever dance in the third, for starters...) he is now renowned for, many fans of his earlier, nastier films felt that Raimi's madcap genius had been somewhat quenched with his melding to the mainstream. As such, it would be difficult to envision a more conscious return to his wacky horror roots than Drag Me to Hell. While it may contain a larger budget, slightly more familiar material and less stop motion than his cult classic credentials, Raimi's latest is the sort of kinetic, freewheeling, relentless bludgeoning of horror with just enough quirky laughs thrown in which previously made his name infamous and celebrated. Avid enthusiasts of Raimi's previous gross-out fare may be either disappointed or elated to find his latest more along the lines of the first Evil Dead, a more straightforward, traditional horror film, then the inventive madness of the second. Yet this is not to say the film is not inventive or madness - far from it. In fact, like most contemporaries, in many cases the film appears structured primarily for the sake of stringing together memorably terrifying set pieces, and painfully amplifying the tension in between them, as well as satisfying Raimi's seemingly unquenchable desire for endlessly tormenting his protagonist, as much as progressing the narrative. But, at the risk of over-glorifying its director, moments which might have reeked of convention in the hands of another filmmaker become uniquely effective in the hands of Raimi, who utilises Christopher Young's vastly over the top musical score to add a demented yet supremely effective veneer to traditional 'what's behind the door?' style frights. Of course, a Raimi film would hardly be recognisable without the quirky factor, and while Drag Me to Hell generally forgoes humour in favour of frights, certain moments punctuating the film remain hilariously hard to forget (unusual possessed objects, a devastatingly creative opening fight scene, several inventive gross-out bits and at least one ironic use of Christian iconography among others). Nonetheless, as hard hitting, chilling and whimsical as the film is, it is unlikely to surpass Raimi's past work in the eyes of most fans, and those unfamiliar with his work are just as likely to be bemused as enthralled by such a brand of intentionally campy horror. Of course even considered within its genre, the film has clearly discernible flaws (an arguably oversimplified and generic script with an ending perhaps a shade too predictable and no characters quite as bizarrely memorable as Bruce Campbell's Ash), yet the crucial element to the film's success remains its dogged determination to terrify the audience as relentlessly and unpredictably as possible while simultaneously refusing to take itself seriously. Yes the fleeting attempts at moralising may appear trite, but such a daringly questionable moral stance (Christine is damned to incessant torment through a single moral lapse despite a lifetime otherwise spent attempting to better herself or others) demonstrates Raimi's gleeful refusal to confine himself with traditional emotional storyline arcs and instead have as much brutal fun in the meantime as possible. While the film may not be quite as fearlessly odd as his earlier fare, Drag Me to Hell is at least just as entertaining, which in the end is all it was likely intended to be. Even with the absence of B-movie superstar Bruce Campbell, Raimi's film is firmly carried by its capable cast. Alison Lohman is a triumph as Christine, the normally well intentioned loans officer subjected to continuous torment. As well as proving admirably game for abiding every possible trauma from being thrown around, writhing in mud and expelling insects and blood, Lohman proves enormously charismatic and frighteningly believable, making her tortures feel all the more disconcertingly affecting despite their campy excesses. Justin Long also proves a surprisingly solid piece of casting as Christine's incessantly kind and loving boyfriend, toning down his usual humour in favour of a likable and credible piece of potentially cumbersome characterisation. Lorna Raver is memorably unsettling as the gypsy woman placing the curse on Christine, as well as also proving commendably willing to subject herself to numerous unusual forms of punishment, and Dileep Rao is a laudably even and credible presence as a good hearted fortune teller. While it may prove more polarising for audiences than the average horror film, Drag Me to Hell marks a triumphant return to Raimi's formative genre, demonstrating that even after decades his ability to evoke superbly crafted scares and bizarre laughs remains intact. Audiences approaching the film with no real complexity in mind (though there are undertones to be delved up if desired) and prepared to laugh as much as scream may find the film several cuts above most modern fright-fests, and a positive omen, if any, for the creative direction of Raimi's subsequent return to the faltering Spider-Man franchise. -7.5/10",7,1,4,12 June 2009
La La Land," Dream On
","In January 2016, Aziz Ansari originated an SNL skit where he is interrogated at a police station for insufficiently adoring La La Land. 'I meanI liked it! I just didn't think it was ah-mazing!' he protests. 'What DO you like if you don't like La La Land??!' is the vitriolic, bellowed response. Well, you'd better get my handcuffs ready. A cynic would point out that every 3-5 years, Hollywood and its audiences remember the musical genre exists, and fall rapturously in love with each new tent-pole release as if its predecessors had never existed (Les Misérables? Chicago? Okay, I'll stop). I'm not cynical enough to dismiss La La Land outright as such, but I am on Ansari's team on this one. Damien Chazelle's follow up to his blistering Whiplash IS lots of fun. It's a boisterous, sweet, massively charming slice of cheese with a sloshing side order of nostalgia. And it buys into its clichéd, pandering familiarity with such outrageous gusto it's almost easy to forget how fundamentally vacuous it is. So there you go. Lock me up, and throw away the key. Like 2011's The Artist, it's a glossy, heartfelt riff on the overwhelming power of the Classics (here, in a Whiplash hangover, jazz greats receive equal adulation to Da Moofies) and how soul-crushing it can be to fall short in comparison. It's Scorsese's New York, New York for the YouTube generation, if you will. And this proves to be the film's greatest asset and pitfall simultaneously: it plays phenomenally in instalments. Chazelle is a whiz at conjuring moments of transcendental movie magic, riffing on the whimsical, expressionistic flourishes of the Singin' in the Rain era, bubblegum colours, triumphant tap dancing, floating through the air framed by a sea of stars and all. Linus Sandgren's spectacular cinematography helps astronomically to pump up proceedings, as the camera zips through parked cars, swimming pools and past whirling dancers like a caffeine-addled hummingbird. And that opening four minute long take crane shot? Has to be seen to be believed. But, for all these highs of spectacle come the crashing lows of the story gluing them together. It's immediately, unshakably apparent that Chazelle's script is too flamboyantly nostalgic to offer much that hadn't already been done to death in the 'good ol' days' it cherishes, and it's a shame to see a movie directed with such pizazz be so well, boring. The title, of course, is a double-pun, nodding not only to singing, but crafting enough of a gushy love letter to the mystique and iconicity of LA to make Woody Allen wince. Here, Chapelle trips over his own earnestness. 'An aspiring actress meets a spurned jazz pianist' verges on 'Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world' in the groan department, and Chazelle never musters up the gumption to deliver any reflexive reworking of the 'star-crossed lover/artists' formula whatsoever. Even the film's fake-out 'happy-ever-after-but-at-what-cost' ending, a melancholic, 'what might have been' fantasy dance break, is cheerfully poached from An American in Paris among countless others, making the film's one seeming deviance from cliché just as ensconced in cliché. {Maybe the 'La La' is really Chazelle retorting 'La La La, I can't hear you?'}That said, Chazelle's original tunes are more than worth their salt, a handful of charming, bittersweet ear-worms sure to light up iTunes for months. Occasionally, sly humour pokes through the polish - there's a great laugh to be had when Gosling's Serious Musician joining John Legend's pop-jazz-fusion band (meant to signify his artistic bankruptcy in favour of pop commercialism) produces the film's most infectiously memorable song. Still, post-Whiplash, Chazelle's one true love is still jazz, and the film's jazz club scenes come alive with more kinetic ferocity than any of its schmaltzy dance breaks. The 'non-professional singer musical' trope is ultimately a matter of personal preference (Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You takes this poetic accessibility to the next level) but it's effective here, thematically underscoring the dissonance of these two 'good but not amazing' dreamers slotting themselves into the iconicity of legend. It's a shame that they're further marred by consistently murky, almost distressingly amateurish sound editing, garbling the audibility of most of the song's lyrics almost past the point of comprehension. 'Naturalism' is one thing, but it's still hard to fall in love with songs we can barely hear. Still, it takes appropriately glitzy stars to own up to such a superficially pleasurable film, and it's impossible to imagine a more lovable duo than Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Endearingly clumsy singing aside, their respective astronomical charisma easily outperform their less-than-stimulating material. Underpinning her 'adorably neurotic klutz' schtick with a smattering of raw pathos, Stone's gigantic, alien bug- eyes prove capable of expounding almost alarming deluges of emotion. Hearing her show-stopping Audition ballad is so phenomenally moving that it's almost hard to focus on her amidst brushing tears away. Similarly, Gosling proves he's able to look as winningly suave sporting a keytar and red leather jacket as ever, and he's breezy, smooth and funny enough to breathe life into his stale 'frustrated artist.' Nonetheless: restricting the superb J.K. Simmons to a fleeting cameo? Borderline criminal offence. It's curious to see a movie so obsessed with history and nostalgia playing its spate of cliché so unironically, but La La Land is such a pleasantly dopey ode to the love of creation, it's evidently easy for many to overlook. Chazelle's film is likely best enjoyed outside the spotlight of the awards hype machine, where it's easier to embrace its superfluous camp and profoundly heartfelt sweetness at face value. Still, for a world so riddled with conflict and strife, there's an unmistakable value for a film so silly - episodically on YouTube, if nothing else. Here's to the ones who dream. -7/10",7,2,3,1 February 2017
Sinister," Blood Drawings, Creepy Kids, and Ghoul-Masks Softly Lit by an iPhone
","Few horror films are bold enough to not only root their cause of frights in an obsession with screens – both the computer and cinema variety – but also incriminate audiences (by proxy) as predominantly responsible for horrific happenings through their inability to tear their gaze away. Such audacious self-reflexivity should be difficult to execute without the film unraveling, but director Scott Derrickson instead alludes to recent genre trends erring towards 'found footage, documentary style realism', without skimping on the old-school supernatural scares and jumps. As such, Sinister cannily blends 'old and new', a post-Paranormal Activity thriller unafraid to exploit the genre's roots in melodrama and excess. Indeed, Derrickson, like his first foray into horror, 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose, proves adept at marinating in genre conventions while subtly riffing on them to tweak expectations just enough. The premise (a 'true crime' writer who moves his family into the house of the recent murder victims whose case he is documenting discovers a box of 'home movies' that suggest a chain of interconnected serial family murders) is just outlandish enough to be original, yet just grounded enough to fly. Equally, Sinister flourishes atmospherically, with its scores of documented murders adopting a surreal, grotesque beauty, rendered operatic through Christopher Young's exquisitely cacophonous musical score. Anchored through Ethan Hawke's magnetic, jittery performance and a couple of refreshing plot twists where (gasp!) characters actually result to horrific happenings sensibly, Derrickson nonetheless quashes such baited hope through an unflinching fatalism. Sinister's horror is fast, furious and relentless, and sure to spook hardened horror-vets and casual thrill-seekers alike.-7/10",7,1,2,28 May 2013
Snowden," You know too much, Ed Snow
","Snowden may be Oliver Stone's least controversial movie.Sure, it's a gripping, topical portrait of the era's most renowned techno-Robin Hood figure, whose whistleblowing rocked the world, critiqued as either an empowering exposé of unconscionable government overreach, or as unpatriotic treason. It's a suitably robust subject for the director who has cinematically rattled the cages of two U.S. presidents (one still in office), and mapped out an exhaustive conspiracy treatise of the assassination of a third. And perhaps it's just that - the film practically writes itself, and its execution leaves the same nagging tickle of there being preciously few surprises along the way. But Snowden isn't a film with surprises on the brain - the brazen violation of the NSA's global surveillance he publicized is shock enough. It's a film that plays up the familiarity of its sordid subject matter as a taut, playfully Orwellian 'political thriller.' And it's all the more deeply unsettling and necessary viewing for it. It's immediately apparent that Stone isn't too bogged down in solemn moralizing to have a little fun. Relishing in the exposure and expectations of entertainment even in an issues-driven film, he has a ball satirically aping the slick cinematography and pulse-pounding tension building of Hollywood spy, action, and heist genres (there's a future drinking game of 'spot the Captain America references' afoot, though goofy, out-of-place Nic Cage is disappointingly/necessarily restrained). You can practically hear Stone snickering behind the camera as Rhys Ifans (even more silkily reptilian here than in The Amazing Spider-Man)'s sinister NSA mentor - 'O'Brien,' naturally - looms over Snowden from a gigantic video screen in a hooting Orwell tribute. Why? To slyly draw out the disconnect of the age-old Hollywood escapism being applied to a disturbingly real context, of course. Snowden's thesis is that the NSA's involvement in public lives is so outrageously evil, it must be true. Still, this flirtation with Hollywood thrills isn't just enjoyable - it also helps offset the exposition density of Stone's script, which barrels ahead with full JFK-manifesto steam, rendering the complicated and controversial context crucially comprehensible. Granted, we do lose some nuance of the why and how Snowden's work with the NSA both exposed and contributed to unprecedented extremes of surveillance and privacy violation in the name of national security. Other interludes are cheerfully, transparently fictionalized (Snowden's savant level entrance exam to the NSA, and overseas spy missions that no computer technician would be trusted with). These may feel inevitable in the interests of running time and genre, but remain problematic, blurring the divide between escapist Hollywood fable and devastating reality. And there's the rub: positing the film so blatantly as mouthpiece of Snowden's side of the story - literally by the end - fumble somewhat the crafting of Snowden the character. Naturally, the volcanically opinionated Stone has no pretences of objectivity, but Snowden is a somewhat bristling reminder of Stone's monolithic, old school romanticism. His script overworks to position Snowden as an earnest paragon of Jim Garrison 'Murrca, anchoring beats on his Ideals, Torment (Snowden's epilepsy is treated as one more hurdle for him to stoically overcome), and relationship with a good woman he loves but who can't understand his Commitment to the Cause (Shaileen Woodley; spunky and charismatic beyond her tiresomely thin 'suffering love interest' archetype). There's no denying, political biases aside, that Snowden's actions showed unbelievable courage, competence, and integrity. Still, witnessing Anthony Dod Mantle's lilting cinematography and Craig Armstrong's score practically swoon over him like stylistic refugees from an unchecked Steven Spielberg film is enough to make even the most ardent supporters reel. A more interesting, nuanced take would've poked more deeply at Snowden's ideological slide from his initial, more libertarian leanings, to his investment in the Obama administration would repeal the dubiously ethical 'counterterrorism' espionage policies Snowden immediately sniffed out (though Stone does evocatively capture the rapture of hope of Obama's election day), to his eventual exposé (Stone thankfully, resists any turning point epiphany clichés). Instead, Stone truncates the narrative through temporal cross-cutting to the present, with Snowden imparting his story to a trio of harried journalists (Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson, and Melissa Leo, all of whom generously brew tension), which saddles the film with a disappointingly choppy, 'clip show' biopic rhythm. Still, for a film facilitating such a crucial cultural conversation in such an urgent, accessible fashion, these faults, none the least being Stone's peppering of cheeseball metaphors (the instantly stale motif of Snowden repeatedly photographed by his girlfriend; a laptop camera transfiguring into a leering eye), are easily forgivable enough, though they do cost the film the crisp timelessness of an All the President's Men, or even the more recent The Social Network. That said, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's casting is the make-or-break that lends the film its soul. Beyond his uncanny vocal mimicry, Gordon-Levitt digs into the core of Snowden's fierce idealism, working wiry charisma out of his steadfast competence, and the agonizing isolation of his inability to vocalize his concerns over his own workplace's actions. He may be too boundlessly likable to play Snowden as enigmatically as he'd like (though his bursts of curt selfishness - 'I wanted power, prestige, and to live in Japan' - are effective), but his quieter moments - allowing flecks of doubt to cross his eyes, or his jaw to subtly tense - demonstrate a commendably committed performance easily worthy of his subject's celebrity mystique. Teasing Hollywood pastiche and schmaltzy romanticism aside, Snowden is at its strongest when, like its subject, it sticks to its issues. Future takes may tap into the ripple effects of Snowden's whistleblowing with greater nuance and less bias, but, as an impressively entertaining manifesto informing viewers as to the issues, ethics, and disturbing nonchalance of the United States' counterterrorism overreach, Stone's film is as focused and clear-headed as they come. If there's one good example to take from the NSA, it's this: Snowden is essential to watch. -8.5/10",8,2,8,21 September 2016
National Treasure," Good, old fashioned adventure
","Benjamin Gates (Nicholas Cage) in the next in line in a family who have been searching for a mythical treasure map for generations. When he eventually uncovers evidence that the fabled map was hidden in no other place than the back of the Declaration of Independence, he decides that there is clearly no alternative than to steal the Declaration. (it's in the name of science, after all...)The thing to keep in mind most before watching National Treasure is that it's all in good fun. It isn't meant to be particularly realistic or probable - just suspenseful, exciting and, above all, entertaining. And National Treasure succeeds in being entertaining, if nothing else. Think of it as a modern Indiana Jones, albeit one which blatantly rips off Dan Brown's novel 'The Da Vinci Code' with the main plot line involving cryptic clues found on pieces of ancient architecture. However, another thing to keep in mind is that the entire story takes place in the good old United States of America, so get ready for some not so subtle patriotic messages (which may lead up to some potential propaganda interpretations) and a particularly cheesy ending, which seems to anticipate us letting out a loud sigh of patriotic pride... but is more likely to produce a pained groan.Nicholas Cage returns to the thriller genre, but doesn't give anything spectacular here in terms of performance, which is fine, since the script doesn't really call for much character development on his part - the highlight remains the adventure. Justin Bartha plays Gate's annoying sidekick Riley, meant to serve as the comic relief, but in the end, only raises the occasional laugh. Diane Kruger plays a cardboard cutout 'token female' character, who is given absolutely nothing in terms of development or necessity to appear in the story at all, except to finally (and highly predictably) fall in love with Gates. Sean Bean steals the movie as the cold-blooded ex-colleague of Gate's who is racing against him to claim the treasure first. And finally, while it's nice to see classy actors such as John Voight (playing Gate's father, who seems to act as the voice of the audience, expressing doubt that it would be physically possible to continue finding the outlandish trail of clues) Harvey Keitel (as a burnt out federal agent searching for the robbers of the Declaration of Independence) and Christopher Plummer (as Gate's grandfather, who instilled his thirst for knowledge and adventure) taking supporting roles, none of them are given much to do due to their extremely thin characterizations, and seem uncomfortable lurking in the sidelines while Nick, Diane and Justin track down the treasure.So there isn't much accomplished in terms of script or character development, acting is decent at best and the plot remains outlandish throughout, National Treasure remains a good, old fashioned, fun for the whole family movie (rated PG with no profanity or sex, and violence is virtually nonexistent) much in the mold of Indiana Jones. It's not very believable, but who needs it to be? Just sit back, and cherish the adventure.-6/10",6,1,1,31 May 2005
Beauty and the Beast," Hairy Pouter and the Reluctantly Redundant Remake
","Watching Bill Condon's Beauty and the Beast as an adult is like running into your best friend from grade school at a bar. They're hammered, decked out in a circa 2001 Avril Lavigne Sk8ter Boi outfit and faux-hawk, but surprise: they work as an insurance claims adjuster, and make awkward, drunken conversation about linoleum. Yep. Hear me out. Heady nostalgia, amusement (both uncomfortable and sincere), but all tampered by a vaguely alienating sense of antiquated tackiness and boredom. This is your old friend, and you'll always love them in spite of... them. But did you really need to run into them again like... this? This is the battle of Beauty and the Beast 2.0: not as beastly as your worst fears would have it, but a far cry from the beauty that once was. 'Tale as old as time' doesn't work as well when it's a tale barely older than the average viewer, begetting the invariable 'Too Soon!' griping. Sadly, in this case, the peanut gallery may be justified. It's rare to see a film tiptoeing around its fan following so fearfully, every frame oozing desperation to validate its own existence. From the first notes of the soundtrack, there's an uneasy balance between near shot-for-shot slavishness and defiant new beats. But, for every closed plot hole (so THAT'S why no one in the village noticed the gigantic, deserted castle!), there's awkward, superfluous character exposition (did Belle really need to be saddled with a 'disappeared parent' subplot, a-la Amazing Spider-Man?). The original songs are, naturally, too darn good not to make hearts soar, but they're staged with varying degrees of imagination and vibrancy. New tunes range from cutely forgettable to downright cringe-worthy (let's just say the Beast's solo romantic ballad plays better on Broadway...), while inexcusably lame tweaks to Gaston's legendarily raucous tavern ditty will have you pulling out every last inch of you covered in hair. And so on. More than almost any adaptation, Condon courts an invariable game of constant compare/contrast that he's fated to lose (would you want to go toe-to-toe with the first animated Best Picture nominee?), conjuring an audience commentary of 'Meh, that was better in the original' to 'Did we really need that?' Throw in some lurching pacing - how can a film 40 minutes longer than its predecessor feel so much more rushed? - and staid, wooden sensibilities, with only glimmers of the original's whimsy or the playfulness of 2016's Jungle Book, and you've got one squirmy audience. It's a shame, because Condon's fairy tale unearths plenty of magic when it's allowed to breathe. If there's one strain that feels fully fleshed out in live action, it's the poor provincial town's bullying of Belle, seeing her unmarried, innovative intellect as beyond 'odd,' but as a downright ideological threat verging on witchcraft. It's this focal point that lends surprising sincerity and sweetness to her budding romance with her ferocious captor - she connects with him as a fellow outsider, passionate, but fearfully clueless about how to societally integrate. Condon also finds surprising poignancy in the Beast's household workers resigned to living as animated objects as penance for taking no accountability in preventing his warped, cruelly spoiled upbringing. A subtle nature/nurture conversation of a social environment's power to corrupt through passive-aggressive teasing or shameful inactivity? Now that feels like classic Disney! If the prospect of 2017 special effects bringing the magic to life were a selling point, it's still a mixed bag. It's ironic that the film's prologue cautions against gaudy, superficial excess, as Condon's film is almost exhaustingly lavish, but too loud and busy to settle into the painstaking elegance of its predecessor. The surreal twisty, Jean Cocteau decor is pleasingly intricate, but almost perennially muted by murky, grey lighting, while the vaguely creepy anthropomorphic household utensils take considerable acclimatizing to. Even the 'Be Our Guest' showstopper manages the paradox of looking ferociously expensive but oddly unspectacular. Still - Condon does nail The Dance, and it alone is transcendently lovely enough to keep the film afloat, and then some. No, you're twirling around humming the theme. Hmmpff. You want to love Emma Watson's Belle. You really do. But, Hermione hangover aside, she feels distressingly miscast - as sullen and sunken as her wincingly autotuned singing voice, she's too caustic to capture more than dribbles of Belle's warmth, spunkiness, and bubbly braininess. Trading Harry for Hairy, Dan Stevens makes a superb Beast, dubious CGI aside. His Beast is a grumbling hipster, his former effete condescension bleeding into his brooding making his character arc all the more charmingly self-aware. Though far from the size of a barge (no 'biceps to spare' here, amusingly), Luke Evans swings solidly at Gaston's seismic chauvinism. But, although he hits the musical notes, he's too tentative a scene-chewer, and lacks the thunderous charisma to properly sell the narrative's masterful deconstruction of toxic masculinity (it's no wonder LeFou has to bribe these townspeople to - literally - sing his praises). Speaking of: 10 points to Josh Gad, singlehandedly stealing the show with a pitch-perfect deluge of adorably fawning silliness. While Kevin Kline's softly quirky Maurice is pleasantly winning, his additional screen time adds little to the film. Indeed, most of the comedic and emotional lifting is left to the charming voice cast, and Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci, and others all brim with the mountainous charm and silliness you'd hope for. There is beauty within Condon's film, but it's largely enshrouded by oodles of overstuffed visual dazzle and fumbling mimesis that fail to disguise the the film's heart isn't quite there. It's an amiable diversion, but a worthwhile remake? Let's just say time won't be kind to this tale. But let's be honest: it's Beauty and the Beast. Reviews or not, you're probably going to obstinately check it out anyway, muttering 'surely it can't be as bad as all that.' And you know what? Be my guest.-6/10",6,1,5,28 March 2017
Some Like It Hot," A comedy milestone way ahead of its time
","Some Like It HotThe premise for a comedy film being two men dressing up as women may seem commonplace in today's day and age, where anything, no matter taboo may be thrown in for a laugh (Kevin Smith anyone?), but for it's time, the central idea for 'Some Like It Hot' must have seemed pretty risqué. Fortunately enough, director Billy Wilder really knows what he's doing, as he handles the somewhat delicate subject matter with a deft and confident hand, not overplaying the concept but instead extracting as many laughs as he can from it while still remaining totally tasteful, which in turn just makes the joke so much richer. The script is without a doubt one of the wittiest and best constructed of all time, with tons of wonderful back and forth exchanges between Lemmon and Curtis, and the period dialogue, with names like 'Spats Columbo' and 'Toothpick Charlie' is a treat to listen to. The period feel of great depression era costumes and sets are also excellent - all together, a very convincing feel of the time period. Not to mention that there is an actually suspenseful car chase, a cinematic rarity for the time.But more than anything else, the talking point is how entertaining and funny the whole film is. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are hilarious and charming as the two beleaguered leads, forced to masquerade as female musicians to save themselves from the mob. Marilyn Monroe has also never looked so beautiful, and despite the stories of the ridiculous number of takes it took her to get her lines right, in the final cut she comes across as fairly natural, even raising several laughs. The supporting cast also give great performances and manage to also raise many laughs, especially Joe E. Brown with the closing line 'Nobody's perfect', which has to be one of the most memorable conclusions in film history. All in all, Some Like It Hot survives the cinematic test of time by coming across as just as funny when viewed currently as it must have been back in the 50s. The acting is wonderful, and Curtis and Lemmon have terrific chemistry together, and iconic Marilyn never fails to dazzle us. On a long night in need of a laugh or several, Some Like It Hot is most definitely worth a viewing - it is certainly more tasteful and unexpectedly hilarious than most contemporary comedies!-10/10",10,5,8,29 July 2006
Inside Man," Lee's mainstream effort leaves something to be desired
","Considering director Spike Lee's usual, more provocative and heated material, Inside Man, a more conventional suspense thriller seemed a bit of a change of form. Therefore, one would expect the director to have something clever up his sleeve, something genuinely different or shocking, a reason why he would accept a project so seemingly mundane and ordinary. It's likely that assumption that particularly drew viewers to see Inside Man, in short to see the trick Lee had up his proverbial sleeve, the huge twist or execution that would make Inside Man stand out enough to have the director depart from his usual material to accept it. Unfortunately enough, though such a clever twist may seem inherent throughout the film's course, it never really surfaces, leaving us as an audience constantly wanting more, hoping something more interesting and genuinely shocking and throughout provoking might turn up. Needless to say, this never really happens, and as such, Inside Man culminates as nothing more than a watered down run of the mill suspense thriller filled with plot holes and the occasional clever part. The first twist in the 'huge double-twist ending' becomes so obvious early on in the story that when it surfaces in a crescendo of dramatic music, it doesn't come as surprising at all. The second twist may pose a bit more of a surprise, and may take a bit of thought, but still... one would expect better. And even for those who did not predict either twist early on,there's still the apathy factor. There's a constant sense of 'so what?' throughout the story, as if the audience starts to question each new occurrence or event throughout the story, half-heartedly hoping that it will somehow lead to a sudden twist one would have to be carefully following to catch. In actuality, when it becomes more and more apparent this isn't going to happen, our minds start to wander and wonder why so much detail is paid to tiny, near insignificant details, or oddball occurrences, such as the constantly resurfacing Indian music, again with no plausible reason or explanation. Quite simply, the film is lacking a spark, a punch, to make the material really hit home and become relevant, or even watchable to us, the viewers. As it is, Lee loses control of us, and instead of being drawn into the half-hearted suspense, we simply wonder what is the point.Denzel Washington is easily the best aspect of the movie, his charismatic, joking, easygoing yet intelligent hostage negotiator is a truly amicable lead, the kind of quality absent from the rest of the film. Clive Owen makes a good enough antagonistic figure as the chief bank robber, but his 'calm but calculating' side which is meant to make his character seem truly menacing in the end just makes him seem too docile to pose much of an actual threat. Jodie Foster has very little to do in a tiny little role as a mysterious financial adviser sent to speak with Owen's character regarding more under the table matters. She has such a little effect on the story however, that one wonders why her character was included in the story at all, and not just more incorporated into another character. Similarly, the excellent Willem Dafoe is given absolutely nothing to do as a police captain, and it seems such a waste to give such a talented actor such a mundane and devoid of personality role. Christopher Plummer however is a strong presence as the owner of the bank in process of being robbed, who may or may not know more about it than it seems.All in all, Inside Man manages to pass itself off as an intelligent and tense thriller through trailers and publicity, but in the end is nothing special in the least - just another watered down, suspense thriller where the suspense is next to non- existent. There may be the occasional clever or quirky touch, but the inevitable racial component to the story (a particularly memorable scene recalls a bank clerk putting up a huge argument after his turban is removed by the police) is so predictable and out of place it simply raises a groan. Washington may make an excellent lead, but he is the high point in a movie which ultimately comes across as uninspired and uninteresting attempt at breeding tension and suspense. It's not a good sign for a movie's quality and content when the words which come to mind the most are 'so what?'. Such is the case for Inside Man - those not fans of Spike Lee or any of the stars might want to give this one a pass for a more intelligent and engaging thriller.-6/10",6,2,3,5 September 2006
Pulp Fiction," Twisted, perversely funny, captivating - a cornerstone of modern film-making
","When a previously unknown young filmmaker named Quentin Tarantino barged onto the movie-making scene in 1992 with a unique, quirky, disturbing and groundbreaking film called Reservoir Dogs, a noticeable change could already be seen soon after in the film industry on the whole. Cheap imitations of Tarantino's hit began to be seen, films with more stylized dialogue, harsher senses of humour usually coupled with brutal violence became much more commonplace and acceptable in the mainstream cinema. (a prime example being Tony Scott's 1993 hit 'True Romance', also written by Tarantino) Yet if Reservoir Dogs was a hit, than Pulp Fiction was something entirely more, snatching up the prestigious Palme D'Or award at the Cannes film festival and making a huge smash impact on movie viewers and the film industry on the whole, spawning generations of cult followers and would be imitators. Despite the relentless praise Tarantino and his most prized film have been awarded, upon viewing over a decade later, Pulp Fiction still manages to intrigue and fascinate, with its blinding originality of narrative, and wonderfully convoluted screenplay. No matter how terrible or disgusting the myriad of characters on display here, we never fail to be utterly fascinated by them, and after the movie has run its two and half hour course, we are left only wanting more darkly comical and fiendishly interesting pulp tales to feast our eyes and ears upon. One also remarks on how deeply the movie has permeated modern pop culture simply by noticing all of the scenes that are referenced, whether it be by the Simpsons, Saturday Night Live or other movies, such scenes as the 50s dance scene with Travolta and Thurman,the 'you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in France?' scene with Jackson and Travolta and Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames being bound and gagged by red rubber balls, only by seeing the movie will one truly understand how often it is referenced by so many sources. The movie truly defines the meaning of the term 'ensemble cast' as well, with superb and incredibly memorable performances all around. John Travolta is great as spaced out, almost child like Vincent, who seems constantly on a different page as all surrounding him in the role that single-handedly re-ignited his career, and breakout star Samuel L. Jackson is similarly terrific as his partner with a tendency for religious rants, fully deserving their Oscar nominations. Tarantino favourite Uma Thurman is also terrific as a spoiled mobster's wife, and Bruce Willis gives an excellent, engaging performance as 40s style boxer Butch. Then there's the myriad of excellent supporting players, with such familiar faces as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Amanda Plummer, Tarantino himself... even a tiny cameo from an unrecognizable Steve Buscemi as Buddy Holly the waiter in the wonderful 50s dance club scene, and Christopher Walken delivering his utterly unforgettable monologue, one of the best and most memorable of all time. All in all, it goes without saying that Pulp Fiction is a modern classic of film-making, and despite all of the hype and endless praises, one still walks away from it remarking on how unique and wonderful a film it is. For those not deterred by the strong violence, frequent swearing and racial slurs that tend to be Tarantino trademarks, Pulp Fiction should qualify as a 'must see', if only to understand all of the references in modern pop culture and see what everyone is talking about. Rest assured you will almost certainly not be disappointed. -10/10",10,2,5,25 August 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Episode II: The Raccoon Hugs Back
","Forget the Avengers. Forget the Fantastic Four. With a bust of colour, light, and Blue Suede, the Guardians of the Galaxy exploded onto the screen as the Marvel Cinematic Universe's REAL first family. And it's a word that writer/director James Gunn is loathe to let audiences forget in round two. Creatively untethered after his first roaring success, gone is any compulsory Infinity Stones hyping in favour of more belligerent, tearful outcries of 'family' than there are a new batch of chart-topping tunes (which is saying something). And while Guardians 2 may not hold many surprises, Gunn is wise enough to recognize audiences were hooked on a feeling, and he delivers another stupendously satisfying round of ferociously character-driven, pop-punk Star Wars-lite (less plot; more hugs) with demented gusto.If the stereotypical sequel trend is to always plunge into DAAAARRKKKNESS, it's a trend Gunn is happy to spit his intergalactic candy-floss in the face of. Wasting no time on exposition, Guardians 2 dives right into rambunctious fun by scene one, spewing slick one-liners, banter, and a teasing fight scene so disarmingly clever our theatre floors shook with laughter. And it seldom slows down afterwards. Gunn is that rare master of the prolonged gag that, although it really shouldn't, somehow becomes even more absurdly hilarious when dragged out to a ludicrous extent (case in point: you can now buy a Funko Bobblehead of a character called 'Taserface'), and Guardians 2 easily ricochets with as much infectious, exhilarating laughter, and impossibly catchy tunes as its predecessor (including bonus points for unprecedentedly badass use of Fleetwood Mac). If nothing else, the full resources of Weta Digital lend the scrappy subject matter the visual effects buff befitting a proper space opera (or space punk concert, in this case). Gunn's accelerated action - with jetpacks and explosions aplenty - is anarchically playful enough to even (mostly) circumvent the oft-lambasted MCU 'CGI blob blowouts,' from adversaries (including the lovably huffy Elizabeth Debicki) piloting their ships like weird, 90s arcade racing games, to a climax that will feel inventively surreal as long as you don't think of the similarities to the bloated mess culminating Ang Lee's Hulk (oops ). Still, a succession of almost alarmingly violent interludes are just as unsettling - one uncomfortably long slow-mo, laughing mass-murder(!) set to a cheery tune feels more like a Tarantino movie than anything under the Disney umbrella. Confusingly, for a film so irreverent, Guardians 2 is also strangely beautiful, rendering the jaw-dropping, explosively colourful panoramas of a plethora of alien worlds to the rusting fur on Rocket Raccoon and forehead crinkles on Baby Groot (who, yes, is as hilarious and adorable as you'd hope, without overstaying his welcome)'s forehead with consummate detail. We'll just politely overlook the juvenile Looney Tunes 'space travel face warping' effects - it's almost comforting to know that not all of Gunn's prolonged gags are as rewarding. But, more importantly, Guardians 2 is all about parents (sorry Batman), and is characteristically unafraid to dip deep into the emotional cookie jar. If the first Guardians bared all of its characters' emotional scars, Vol. 2 pokes at them and massages in some salt for good measure, giving each character a resonant emotional arc that, gags aside, makes for a surprisingly tender and sad watch. Gunn (now on solo script duties) orchestrates their interactions with more clumsiness than before, his writing sometimes hand-holding to an almost distracting extent that slightly undersells some pivotal emotional beats (similarly, characters repeatedly verbally cuing the soundtrack, via Quill's walkman, is an unnecessarily contrived screen writing cheat), leaving the occasional aftertaste of trying somewhat too hard to make a Guardians movie rather than letting it breathe effortlessly. Still, he's concocted the ultimate cosmic sitcom: a gaggle of characters painted so distinctly and lovingly that we'd watch them do anything, superfluous plot be damned.Thankfully, Gunn's peerless cast of characters are given plenty to do, and their respective takes on 'social performance masking inner pain,' win our hearts and laughs anew with eager abandon. Chris Pratt's unique blend of radiantly roguish, childlike charisma and propensity for puppy dog sadness is as heartwarming as ever here. If his listening to Cat Stevens, emotionally unpacking his 'Dad triangle' doesn't unplug your tears, you are of sturdier stuff than most of this Galaxy. Dave Bautista's Drax almost overdoes it on the comic relief front, but Bautista carefully weaves in just enough subtle heartbreak that his peerless comic timing remains unfettered, even as his jokes drift into the increasingly crude (he, after all, has famously humongous turds). Bradley Cooper's Rocket similarly pokes the limits of how much caustic, a-hole acting out audiences will buy in the name of raw, emotional hurt, but we understand him too well not to love him, prickliness and all. Michael Rooker's snarling space pirate Yondu starts out with unsettling softness, but once we acclimatize to his perturbing pathos, he's as brashly affable as they come. In Kurt Russell's uneasily charming Ego, Gunn has unearthed (ha!) a deceptively creepy villain, far more philosophically and visually memorable than his goofy premise would suggest, while fellow newcomer Pom Klementieff redefines adorable as bug-eyed empath Mantis. Still, it's the sister spat between Zoe Saldana and Karen Gillan - the MCU's first real relationship between two women(!) - that really lingers after the credits roll. Saldana and Gillan drip with pitch-perfect, seething vinegar and heartfelt hope in the perfect encapsulation of a sibling relationship: they may usually want to murder each other, but what they really want is a hug. Aww. Guardians 2, not to mince words, is rambunctiously fun, colourful, hilarious, and, above else, proudly sports its soppy, adorable bleeding heart on its sleeve. It's hardly revelatory and occasionally overly didactic, but plays to its strengths with cheeky obstinacy, and is downright irresistible for it. Will you blast 'Awesome Mix 2' on repeat all the way home from the cinema? Obviously. Just be sure not to hassle the Hoff.-9/10",9,2,4,8 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," They FINALLY got it right!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire After being disappointed each year by increasingly unsatisfying movie interpretations of the Harry Potter books (I found 2004's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' to be the worst of the lot) I think it's fair to say that my expectations for the fourth movie were not very high. Actually, to be honest, I didn't really intend to see it at all. But thankfully, miraculously, the movie defied my expectations and ended up surpassing the first three movies by far - easily the best Potter movie to date! Safely put, if you were disappointed by the earlier films, as I was, 'Goblet of Fire' should easily live up to your expectations, if not exceed them. This seems to be the best work to date of director Mike Newell (whose previous credentials included such films as 'Mona Lisa Smile' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral') and the principal kids are beginning to grow up a bit, showing that they are actually capable of genuine drama, especially Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, though Daniel Radcliffe as the title character also manages to impress. The general overall sense of quality in the movie has been greatly augmented from those of the past.But the main highlight, I would say, is despite the fact that huge sections of the book have been lopped off, the movie still seems very true to the book, and still manages to remain tense and engaging the whole way through, seeming much shorter than its almost 3 hour running time. Unlike the first three movies, which always seemed full of plot holes and missing parts, and like they were in a frenzied hurry just to get to the finish, 'Goblet' is fast-paced, but never feels rushed, and certainly doesn't skimp on the action setpieces. There's the (sadly short but still exhilarating) Quidditch world cup, the attack of the Death Eaters, Harry battling a giant dragon, swimming through Hogwarts lake, fighting off Mer-people, and the final engaging confrontation in the graveyard (not to mention the awkward hilarity of the Yule Ball, Ron's frilly dress robes and all). Let's say you certainly won't leave the theater feeling you haven't earned your money's worth. Newell also manages to extract very satisfying performances from his cast, the standout here being newcomer Brendan Gleeson as gruff, demented yet lovable Professor Mad-Eye Moody, managing to overcome his ridiculous looking eye patch and deliver the film's most enjoyable performances (though Ralph Fiennes is flat out terrifying as the long-awaited Lord Voldemort). All returning cast and crew are great, and some characters such as Neville Longbottom and Professor McGonagall are given a quantity of screen time they've been denied for quite a while, while Fred and George Weasley, as always, raise all the laughs that Moody doesn't. Safe to say, the kids have grown up enough to have learned how to actually act with conviction, and the adults seem to be racing to stay up to par. Performances are quite satisfying as a whole, and manage to stay highly faithful to the book.So overall, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire clearly surpasses the previous three movies in terms of quality, faithfulness to the source material and overall enjoyment factor. The last of the 'fun' Potter movies before the series gets increasingly dour (certainly the last where Harry is likely to excitedly exclaim 'I love magic!'), this is the first I have felt genuinely satisfied with, and clearly the best of the bunch so far. But don't take my word for it - see it yourself. Safe to say, you will almost certainly not be disappointed.-8/10",8,0,1,19 November 2005
Thor," He be worthy
","By Odin's beard! Verily, yon mighty picture house of Marvel doth demonstrate the courage of a warrior battling a rampaging Bilgesnipe to tell the tale of Thor. Metal men and monsters of medicine? Aye, but ye literal Gods of Olde, told with nary a snicker? Forsooth! But hark - they who doth dare to scorn know not the Lord Kenneth of Branagh, whose soothsaying doth be as pure as his heart. He approacheth the lore of Asgard with the eloquence of yon Bard of Olde, but addeth the slow-motion and explosions of yon Michael Bay. Zounds. And lo - though it be the first foray into fantasy outright for yon kingdom of Marvel, Thor abideth the test of time - robust, clear-headed, and, verily, as fun as it be mighty.Too ridiculous an opening paragraph for you? Thankfully, Marvel and Branagh are, quite wisely, on your side. Here, the Thor comic's characteristic Stan Lee swipes at 'Olde Englishe' are as absent as his feathery helmet (that is to say, restricted to cameo status). Branagh is cognizant of this potential for silliness, and works hard to carve out familiar, safe ground, opening with a contextual prologue that leans on Lord of the Rings tropes so extensively, it's almost a shock not to see Cate Blanchett pop up.* Still, Branagh proves as adept at blockbuster filmmaking as he is at gilding classical wordplay, and, after a few cliché-courting opening moments in the (cool but fairly wobbly CGI) realm of Asgard, it only takes moments to be swept up in Thor's brisk pacing, crisp action interludes (excessive slow-mo notwithstanding), and ready levity, all skepticism receding to a dull ebb. Instead, Marvel's challenge of selling Norse mythology as hip, blockbuster entertainment provides a intriguing opportunity to repackage the rote, superhero 'learning powers/coming of age' tropes as something altogether more mature. Unlike the average hero, the arrogant Thor begins his titular film at peak power, and the film's biggest action blowout is in its first act, where he lets loose with all the thrilling, trailer-stinger hammer-'n-lightning blowout moments against an army of frost giants in the tundra wastelands of Jotunheim. Soon afterwards, however, we're grounded in New Mexico, where our fish-out-of-water deity is, begrudgingly, forced to learn humility through nonviolent valour. Here, Branagh slows down to a crawl, with more talk of astrophysics, governmental investigations/Avengers world-building (including a happily extensive hangout with Clark Gregg's adorably deadpan Agent Coulson), and the comedic schtick of Kat Dennings (who is just funny enough to not feel flagrantly out of place) than punching and kicking. In his downtime, he stokes a romantic subplot, with flirtations housed in constellations, conflating science and magic, and pop tarts. No one could ever accuse Thor of being unambitious. If the initial premise itself heralded perilous camp potential, this forced juxtaposition is doubly so. Thankfully, Branagh meets the silliness head on with a cheerful twinkle in his eye. Ample amounts of Thor's gregarious, out-of-place posturing ('I need a horse!' and 'This drink - I like it. Another!' can face off for the film's biggest laugh) and physical slapstick help take the sting out of the Asgardian brooding, while keeping the film accessible and fun. This, in turn, carves out breathing room for Branagh's Shakespearian credentials to work their magic on the larger-than-life melodrama, helping terse, booming confrontation scenes between a golden bondage pirate and a Gothic teenager with ibex horns breathe as surprisingly natural, sombre and resonant, without hammering it home (ha). Amazingly, before you can shake a sceptre, it's all coalesced in a din of flamboyant opposites that (somehow) achieve thrilling counterpoint, woven together by the strains of Patrick Doyle's handsomely heroic musical score. By the time we're swept away to climactic battles with a gigantic Day the Earth Stood Still robot and a god vs. god beatdown on a CGI rainbow bridge (keep your Mario Kart jokes to yourself), we, like Thor, feel we've earned the catharsis of the CGI-bloated action, and are too invested not to cheer in the face of the raw jubilance of it all. Still, Branagh's careful balancing act would be nothing without the exceptional casting of Chris Hemsworth as the titular god of thunder. Bringing an impeccable comedic timing, and boisterous charisma as colossal as his dazzling physique, Hemsworth commits to his performance with such enormous, brazenly sincerity that his fall from grace and reclamation of honour are somehow as primally resonant and compelling as any high melodrama. Similarly, Tom Hiddleston attacks the inherent underdog pathos of Thor's seedy sibling Loki with such ferocious nuance and presence that he's nearly as commanding, sympathetic, and beguiling as his titular brother, even in the midst of committing unspeakably despicable villainy. Natalie Portman may struggle to fish comparable depth out of her quirky love interest/dubious astrophysicist, but she's neurotically adorable enough to make her rushed romance with Hemsworth surprisingly sweet. Anthony Hopkins lends Odin the requisite thunderous gravitas while largely resisting the expected sleepiness and impulse to phone it in, while Stellan Skarsgård is unreasonably entertaining as the resident 'straight-man scientist,' fishing perennial incredulous humour out of the chaos with practiced ease. Finally, Rene Russo, Jaimie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Josh Dallas, and (especially) Idris Elba all find their moments to lend humour and class as fellow Asgardians, despite functioning more as endearing action figures than fleshed-out characters. Despite, on paper, sounding like the superhero genre's most absurd entry, Thor excels as one of its most straightforward, breezy, deceptively intimate and character-driven, and invigoratingly enjoyable. We've believed a man can fly; now we can believe a god can fall, and capture our hearts all the while. In the words of Odin, Thor is worthy.-8.5/10*Or apparently she's just been biding her time for six years. Stay tuned for Ragnarok!",8,0,0,3 January 2017
The Untouchables," An excellent, larger than life depiction of the age of Capone
","When wanting a classic, unashamedly audience-pleasing film, one need look no further than The Untouchables. The film is partially based on the 1950's television series of the same name, but updates the retelling a bit to better suit today's audiences. The story takes place in 1920's prohibition era, when it was illegal to drink or possess alcohol. Enter alcohol baron Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and his mafia, who begin bootlegging, or illegally distributing alcohol to the public. It is the duty of Treasury department agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to stop Capone, and withhold the law, but his work proves difficult when he discovers no one is to be trusted; most everyone on the police force, media or any form of authority has been bribed by Capone to keep their mouth shut. To avoid detection, Ness assembles a handpicked team of 'untouchables', or law enforcers who refuse bribes. Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar winning performance) acts as a mentor for Ness, teaching him how to get Capone before Capone gets him - shoot fast, and shoot first! 'George Stone', or Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia) is the youngest member of the team, a sharp shooting aspiring cop with old fashioned beliefs about law maintenance. Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is an unassuming accountant who gets dragged up in the plan, but ultimately proves an essential part of the team.Brian De Palma delivers a real masterpiece here, in what is easily one of his best films: the pacing is excellent, the cinematography is superb, marvelously capturing sensational (and Oscar nominated) 30's era sets, vehicles and costumes. (Robert De Niro's costumes were made exclusively by the real Capone's actual tailors) The great cast, of course, does nothing but add to the splendor, with Costner, Smith and Garcia all giving strong performances.Connery bestows his character with his usual charisma, and enough drama to well deserve his Oscar, and De Niro creates a wonderfully wicked villain, complete with a memorable bit with a baseball bat, easily giving a picture perfect portrayal of the original Capone. Add an excellent script by David Mamet with tons of memorable lines and a wonderfully flowing score by Ennio Moricone and you get a wonderful, larger than life piece of film history. That's the Chicago way.-9.5/10",9,0,1,8 November 2004
The Fountain," Cinematic poetry; haunting and beautiful
","There are many movies which the viewer leaves with a feeling of entertainment; their money has been spent on a pleasing distraction from the doldrums of real life. Then there are films which the viewer leaves with a sense of fulfillment, as if they have witnessed something meaningful or thought provoking, an intellectually stimulating passage of time. And then there are films such as The Fountain, which defy any sort of conventional description, transcending archetype and clichÃ©, and staying in the viewer's mind for months, even perhaps years afterwards.In an age so depressingly soaked with more and more remakes, sequels and plots overdone to death, it is truly refreshing to take in a film so new, so unique, so poignant. The Fountain dares to overcome being a typically trite love story, and instead embrace themes so daunting and all encompassing few modern artists attempt to express them, such as meaning of life, the true value of love, the power of trust and belief. While these may come across as sap-ridden and over-glorified, rest assured that The Fountain handles its content in a truly intelligent and mature fashion. Because of the heavy subject matter of the film and the convoluted way its story is explained, do not be surprised if a second or third viewing is necessary to totally grasp all The Fountain is attempting to communicate. It may seem boggling or even downright confusing, but if the viewer simply accepts it as a cinematic poem, which even if not understood can still be appreciated for its obscure beauty, the film becomes much less alienating and the viewer marvels at the sheer scope of the film if nothing else. Director Darren Aronofsky deserves mountains of praise for conceiving such an ambitious and remarkably inventive feat. While his screenplay may occasionally drift into being confusing or frustrating, with extensive use of stilted dialogue and cutting in between the story's three time periods, it never affects one's enjoyment of the film - there is far too much to appreciate going on for the occasional small irritation to affect. The film's visuals, if nothing else, are worth immense credit alone - never before have such dazzling effects, as well as brilliant cinematography, inventive, stunning sets and costumes been used to such superb effect. Aronofsky avoided using CGI effects for the futuristic sequences, instead superimposing microphotography of reactions in petri dishes, and it really shows how even in such a computer saturated world as today, stunning visuals can be created without spending millions on technological costs. As well as being one of the most philosophically daunting and thought provoking films of the decade, The Fountain also proves to be arguably the most visually sumptuous movie in recent memory. Clint Mansell's exquisitely moody score is similarly beautiful, and perfectly compliments the edgy yet beautiful tone of the film.Hugh Jackman has been proving himself to be one of the most fearless, talented and charismatic actors of his generation, and he gives one of his strongest and most emotional performances to date. Playing three characters in radically different time periods simultaneously, Jackman captures our sympathies through his characters' mutual passion, drive and dedication - few other actors would have been capable of such a moving performance. Rachel Weisz, Aronofsky's wife, matches Jackman at every turn, delivering a mystical and captivating performance through each time period. Though the supporting cast is sparsely used, Ellen Burstyn stands out as a caring doctor in the twentieth century storyline, though the film unquestionably belongs to Jackman and Weisz, who prove themselves more than up to the task. It is highly difficult to describe such a radically unique film such as The Fountain - the film stands out as one of the most visually inventive, philosophical and soul searching efforts in recent history, completely unlike anything most viewers are likely to have ever seen before. Yet at the core of it all is a simple love story, which is executed with as much emotional weight and tenderness as any of the grandiose themes surrounding it. Is The Fountain a perfect film? No, though the word is hard to describe and really an entirely subjective quality anyway. What the Fountain does offer is an epic story of love and rebirth, spanning generations and complimented by simply stunning visuals. Don't expect necessarily to entirely understand the film upon first completing it, but instead allow it to blossom over time until it can be fully appreciated and respected. In a day and age so starved of originality, The Fountain is worth seeing simply for proof that fresh and touching work can still be produced, and that from the depths of commercial garbage, beauty can still emerge. -9/10",9,1,2,11 April 2007
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Love it or hate it, Black and Gass return to what they do best
","Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny The concept of writing a film review for the Tenacious D movie may seem slightly unnecessary, as just about anyone upon hearing about the film most likely already had a sense of whether or not it would interest them. Fans of the duo's rock-comedy album and cult classic television show, or the incessantly energetic Jack Black will have jumped at the prospect of an hour and a half of unfiltered Tenacious D madness, and those who generally would not gravitate towards such forms of entertainment will have already uttered a groan, and discounted any possibility of seeing the film. And while the film will prove highly entertaining for those who would normally take to this sort of thing, it falls short of being strong enough to win any fans outside of its existing demographic - those who were fans of Tenacious D already will be satisfied, but those previously unimpressed are unlikely to change their opinions very drastically after experiencing the film equivalent. Director Liam Lynch seems for the most part content to sit back with a camera rolling, leaving Black and Gass free to do what they do best - namely pull the infectiously energetic and likable slacker rocker schtick which exposed them to the public eye in the first place. What is unfortunate is the consistent feeling that the material feels too watered down to really excel as a film and reach the full comedic potential the premise originally boasted. While the occasional comedic gem may float along, for the most part it feels like these occasional high points are too inundated in mediocre sequences to be truly memorable. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies; in terms of content the film plays upon the same themes and plot points which made Tenacious D so crudely enjoyable in the first place, but the material feels a touch too familiar by this point, coming across as still enjoyable, but merely cute or chuckle worthy, rather than the real belly laughs which should have been evoked. Another crucial component of the band's charm, the music, also sadly falls short of the duo's previous material. While the film boasts a superb opening sequence and song, explaining Black's oppressive religious home life, and his determination to break free and become a celebrated rocker, after the opening credits, the music sadly never rises above anything more than satisfactory. However, the orchestral music backing up the band's music at crucial plot points was an inspired touch, adding to the faux 'epic' feel to the pair's overzealous quest, as do the tarot card transitions between plot points - another clever touch. Traits like these are what make the film ultimately rise above mediocre, and add style and class to what otherwise might have fallen apart at the seems if not packaged effectively. While the film is unquestionably centered around Black and Gass themselves, while both are sufficiently entertaining to carry the film even though its weaker points simply by their raucous charm, neither can boast the film to be among their most comedic or entertaining performances to date. And while none of the background players have very much to do whatsoever, it's in the wonderfully in-jokey cameos that the film really excels. Tim Robbins in particular is flat out hilarious as a mysterious and unsettling 'Stranger' also in search of the fabled guitar pick, and Ben Stiller is the funniest he has been in years in an excellent bit part as a guitar store employee, equipped with garish amounts of rocker hair. It's also nothing less than a scream to see the legendary Meatloaf poking fun at his hard edged persona by playing Black's vehemently religious father in the film's opening scene, as well as singing on screen for the first time since Rocky Horror Picture show. Foo Fighters musician Dave Grohl is memorably badass, reprising his role as Satan from the band's music video, and John C. Reilly makes an almost unrecognizable appearance as a flying sasquatch in an unsettling drug induced hallucination sequence. While the film may not win Tenacious D many new fans, for those who previously enjoyed their work it is still easily worth a watch. There may not be a whole lot of new material, and the songs may not be quite as caustic and catchy as in the past, but Black and Gass's collective enthusiasm is enough to guarantee that the legend of Tenacious D will keep on rocking for quite some time. Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny may not live up to its boast of being 'the greatest motion picture ever made', but it does certainly guarantee a highly enjoyable, albeit forgettable hour and a half of inspired madness and head banging rock music. -7/10",7,5,7,25 July 2007
The Departed," A heartfelt modern masterpiece
","Throughout the ages, a single question has been troubling film viewers worldwide: 'How is it possible that such a visionary and immensely talented director as Martin Scorsese has yet to win an Oscar?'. This question is provoked anew, with new heat and fervor, with the release of Scorsese's new love child, The Departed. Will The Departed finally be the film for the bushy eyebrowed maestro to take home his much deserved golden statuette? It's hard to determine, since the Academy has shown itself to be considerably impartial to his past masterpieces, such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. But does Scorsese deserve to take home an Oscar along with the inevitable critical acclaim this time round? The answer of course, is nothing less than a resounding yes.In his latest heartfelt masterpiece, Scorsese lights up with storytelling flair and passion unseen for decades, unleashing one of his most powerful and affecting films yet. After a period of trying new things and exploring new vicinities, Scorsese seems to have returned to what he knows best - the streets, this time incarnated in a contemporary Boston mob setting (which makes for a slightly amusing update from Scorsese's usual mobster flicks with the addition of frequent cell phones and text messaging in the mix). The trademark musing Catholic overtones and brutal violence are both on display as usual here; in fact as well as his strongest, this may well be Scorsese's bloodiest picture for years. But rather than sinking to the lengths of most typical gorefests, the violence serves only to amplify the edgy and intense mood of the film, driving home its emotional points in a way which has seemed lost to Hollywood of late. Expect to cringe frequently, not just because of the pain inflicted, but due to the emotional resonance which ensues. The storyline may seem a bit convoluted at times, detailing the lives of a policeman who infiltrates his way into the mob in order to act as a mole for the police force, and a fellow officer who is bought out by the mob, acting as a mole for them. However, the simply astonishing screenplay by William Monahan handles the tricky material with ease, as well as working in humour, emotional resonance, and a slew of quotable lines the likes of which have not been seen for years. Backing up this incredible script is a terrific score from the always reliable Howard Shore, as well as Scorsese's usual excellent taste in classic rock numbers, including the film's reoccurring theme, a strangely catchy mix of Irish shanty style music with heavy metal. While known for extracting extraordinary performances from his actors, once again, Scorsese has truly outdone his reputation here, as the star-studded ensemble cast delivers a combined effort which will truly knock any viewer flat, with simply superb performances from Matt Damon, a surprisingly feisty and memorable Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin and newcomer Vera Farminga. Special acclaim should be given to the iconic Jack Nicholson giving his most engaging and charismatic performance in years as a ruthless mob head, and surprise standout Leonardo DiCaprio, blowing away any past work with a stunningly affecting and emotional performance. Though awards could easily and justifiably be awarded to any cast member, DiCaprio manages to stand out not from his star status but from his simmering performance in a cast of outstanding performers - an impressive feat indeed. All in all, for those not deterred by brutal violence and frequent profanity, The Departed should be considered something of a must-see. Don't skip out, for fear of passing by one of the most remarkable screenplays in years, a stunning cast of flooring performances, and a veteran filmmaker re-igniting his past fervor with a simply marvelous film. The Departed is down, dirty, brutal, intense, heartfelt and hits home with an unforeseeable emotional impact - don't miss it. -10/10",10,1,2,15 November 2006
Psycho," The grandfather of all slasher films
","Master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock's already tremendously successful career reached arguably a new height with Psycho, a powerhouse film way ahead of its time (the filmmakers even seemed to realize this fact; the film's tagline was 'A new- and altogether different- screen excitement!!!') which inspired and pretty much pioneered the slasher film genre. It's the story everyone knows, with innocent worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) running from the law with a stolen $40 000, making the mistake of checking into a certain infamous motel along the way, run by a quirky and antisocial proprietor (Anthony Perkins) and his mysterious, never seen mother. The key to Hitchcock's classic as opposed to the hundreds of generic garbage teen slasher films theaters are unfortunately bombarded with every year, is the suspense element. Hitchcock proves his genius by realizing that the key to truly inspiring fear in the hearts of an audience is by showing less rather than more. Instead of having horrendously gory deaths every 30 seconds we have a single, infamous shower stabbing, which becomes all the more chilling by how we as an audience have to essentially imagine exactly what is happening. What is truly frightening about Psycho is the eerie tension constantly building throughout the film, reaching a point of almost feeling tangible it is so vivid. This is of course helped by the truly creative and innovative camera work, representing the film's spirit of being way ahead of its time. Psycho is perhaps one of the most cleverly shot films in cinema history, which only amplifies the feeling of dread throughout, ably backed by Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.The film also boasts some rather spectacular acting, especially for its time period. Anthony Perkins is nothing less than superb in his infamous performance as the eccentric, socially awkward Norman Bates. Perkins creates a genuinely believable character, who is all the more unsettling and yet captivating by how strangely realistic as a real person he is. Janet Leigh also helps maintain the excellent tone for the movie with her iconic performance as on-the-run Marion Crane. Vera Miles also gives a strong performance as Lila, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam is great as the Detective searching for Marion.Psycho can be considered as nothing less than a classic, withstanding the test of time and coming off as just as masterfully made and honestly tense and frightening to this day. Fueled by excellent acting, and helmed by a master of the craft, Psycho is now one of those movies which would be considered almost essential viewing. Simply put, if you have yet to see this movie, don't continue to miss out!-10/10",10,1,3,10 March 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Garish excesses of empty spectacle - too much and too superficial to even find any fun in
","Rarely can a director's style, credentials and modus operandi be encapsulated simply by their name, but no words can more concisely sum up Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen than 'it's a Michael Bay movie'. Infamous for his deliriously excessive action films, Bay tends to polarise audiences, with them either outrageously entertained or hit with fits of nausea and rage, and his latest robotic slugfest is no exception. Those repulsed by Bay's first Transformers will hardly be won over by its sequel, as Revenge of the Fallen feels less like a new narrative than an overblown retread of the first, with Bay's grandest ambition seemingly to be how much more of everything he can stuff into the template of the first film, as if assuming that more can only mean better. Predictably enough, it doesn't, as Bay's flagrant excesses go beyond guilty pleasure entertainment to simply being too much, capsizing the film through an overwhelming cascade of content, carnage, sound and CGI. It is clear by the film's most common defense, 'what would you expect from a Michael Bay movie with giant robots' that it is hardly going to be award winning dramatic material, but when such a defense is repeated ad nauseum with no other redeeming factors stated that the quality is increasingly suspect. Indeed, Bay's film feels less like cinema than being strapped to a roller coaster upside down while being shot at - an all out, chaotic visceral assault on the senses which forgoes coherence past the usual action film lapses to a complete disregard for any sense whatsoever. The word at hand is gratuitous, as if blatantly pandering to the 13 year old boy in everyone (as his comical quantity of 'Megan Fox running in slow motion shots' prove testament to) while bathing in cliché and jettisoning any sort of story cohesion. Laughably underdeveloped characters come and go with no explanation, with far too much time devoted to inane comic relief sidekicks while leads have seemingly little purpose (for all the hype regarding Megatron's resurrection, he does alarmingly little once back, and titular primary villain The Fallen has a similarly elusive role). The plot is reduced to characters screaming or babbling nonsensical exposition, and logic is dropped to the point of there being a twenty minute sequence during the final battle where it is near impossible to gather any sense of what is going on, making for a surreal, alienated feeling rather than giddy enjoyment. All of which might normally be markers for a triumphant guilty pleasure were it not for the fact that the film is simply too much to even enjoy in a purely superficial way, coming across as maddening to the point of being boring. While Bay is clearly gunning for a movie 'experience', his film is far too long and obscenely self-indulgent, bulging at the seams with numerous sequences (particularly protagonist Sam Witwicky's early college scenes and the climactic battle scenes) needing not a judicious trimming as much as a vicious hacking. Obnoxiously loud and nasty, Bay's film lumbers all over the place too much to enjoy, feeling despite the frantic movement and noise, as if nothing is really happening. All the while, it would seem Bay somewhat loses track of his film's own mythology, offering not so much plot holes as chasms. Similarly, as ironic as it is to complain about such a film having too much complexity, the narrative is simply too frantic with too much going on to possibly follow, making the already nonsensical plot amplify to frenzied levels. Instead of even a shade of a story, Bay offers absurdly juvenile humour, as if sheepishly fishing for laughs to distract from the overwhelming stupidity. Suffice to say, humping dogs, robot testicles and a very out of place thong joke are hardly adequate substitutes for narrative. Even the jaw dropping special effects which propelled the first film feel somewhat stale, with many battles shown in jittery close ups preventing the viewer from fully drinking in the gloriously realised spectacle.Similarly, while one would be foolish to pursue such fare for the sake of quality acting, the collection of Bay's actors manage to be even worse this time around. Shia LaBeouf substitutes aspiring hip mumbling and whining for charisma as harried protagonist Witwicky, coming across as simply annoying and often utterly irrelevant to the plot. Similarly, Megan Fox is even more overtly reduced to eye candy than previously, with no characterisation apart from leering attempts at being cool or seductive. John Turturro at least operates under fewer delusions of seriousness than the last film, going wildly but amusingly over the top and having a lot more fun with his character. As such, it is up to a screeching Ramon Rodriguez to derail the film even further with an astonishingly irritating and pointless attempt at comic relief, leaving the viewer continually praying he is at least granted a cathartic brutal death by Decepticon. While the return of Peter Cullen sonorous tones and Hugo Weaving's snarls as robotic rivals Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively are a high point, both of their characters are granted insufficient time to punctuate their deathly binary, making the emotional centre of the film feel even more imbalanced. While any sensible viewer would correctly expect the film to be cheesy, dumb and politically correct in every possible way, what surprises is the film's soulless lack of fun factor, with all components amplified to such garish levels that it transcends into a world of sensations, the viewer utterly overwhelmed by the cacophonous excess of spectacle being thrust in their face. Demented but hardly entertaining, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an entirely vacuous spectacle, rendered nearly redundant by its predecessor, and making it only worth viewing for those desperately craving vastly more of the same. -3/10",3,1,5,3 July 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Hell is other people
","If there were ever a film that conveyed just about everything we'd like to leave behind from the 1960s, it's Rosemary's Baby. Discussed in furtive, worried whispers by older generations, and the 'can we watch it?' controversy in the wake of director Roman Polanski's legendary sexual scandal, the film has, through the decades, become enshrouded with the sort of titillating rebellious intrigue of sneaking into an R-rated movie under-age. The final product is hardly what you'd expect: a creeping psychological thriller that leaves most of its horror tropes offscreen, Polanski's film is more of an uncompromisingly caustic social satire, and is all the scarier for it. It's a horror movie more in terms of gender politics than Satanic shenanigans, replete with some of cinema's most grotesque gaslighting, sleep-rape (distressingly laughed off in a further feat of 'oh the '60s' predatory patriarchy), and effective spousal prostitution, made all the ickier by the predatory shroud of its director. Scene by scene, flustered, passive Rosemary (Mia Farrow) is practically passed around like an eponymous joint by her vain, controlling actor husband (the sickeningly charming John Cassavetes), and their intrusively extroverted upstairs neighbours (the show-stealing, boorishly hysterical Ruth Gordon, gleefully stretching her syllables like a Looney Tunes character, and the pleasantly measured Sidney Blackmer), near-speechless as they backseat drive her social outings, sex life, home decor, fashion, food and drink consumption, and, particularly pregnancy.* When Rosemary makes one decidedly autonomous action, coming home with a trendy pixie cut, she's jokingly chided as irresponsibly impulsive, and unattractively boyish. Farrow is superb, commanding each scene with such an off-kilter, cheery charm that it's heartbreaking to see it inevitably extinguished, and perfectly essaying Rosemary's descent from her initial demure passivity into manic, bug-eyed, knife-wielding frenzy. It's tempting to write the film off as Polanski's patriarchal posturing, were it not for his subtly satirical undercurrent of critique. He drinks in each social faux-pas with a grotesque lack of hyperbole, colouring them as unforgivable (but, also, uncomfortably culturally common) with the wryest, jet-black sense of humour. Rosemary's Baby is, in essence, less a tale of the Antichrist than a scathing condemnation of the hellish people already inhabiting the planet. 
 
It's also effectively spooky, albeit predicated more on a (slightly less contemporary) steadily creeping sense of dread, with jump scares less common than surrealist dream sequences and teasingly vague political and religious critiques ensconced in acid trip sexual fantasies. Proceedings begin with an almost eerily sluggish pace, but Polanski mounts tension with Hitchcockian dedication (albeit with a touch less poise), playing each almost imperceptible sound and dialogue from the adjacent apartment as a source of ambiguously immeasurable threat. He's so singularly committed to snowballing into the film's fatalistic climax that it's easy to forget the film's airy, bourgeois openings in the thick of the frenzied, nail-biting suspense that comes. Still, Polanski's cruellest joke is transforming us, the viewer, into the proverbial Judas, where we nearly start to turn on Rosemary as well. Polanski's taut editing and clever script keep things so teasingly ambiguous that we're (nearly) coerced into joining in the film's satirically antifeminist bent, anticipating all of the cultist conspiracy, lies, and murder turn out to be a product of her paranoiac overactive imagination - or worse: hysteria, or a bout of prepartum psychosis. The real twist? Things are exactly as they seem, delivering an unforgettably climax primed with chilling gothic fervour, and the darkest of humour - none moreso than in the final, haunting shot of Farrow's sphinx-like smile. Time is less kind to Rosemary's Baby than other films of its ilk, as the garish sexual politics, benign scare tactics and initial snail's pace all war for the most antiquated of attributes. What is, sadly, timeless is the film's searing critical commentary of the beastliness of people, from the imbedded micromanagement of women's actions and behaviours, to the dark depths that people will stoop in the name of personal gratification. In terms of cinematic mission statement, Polanski seems to draw as much from the Bard as from novelist Ira Levin: 'Hell is open, and all the devils are here!' -8/10

Crazy Heart," 'Life, unfortunately'
","As difficult as it is to articulate the 'flavour' of a particular artistic genre or style, even more challenging is it to transpose such a sense into another artistic medium altogether. Yet the genius of writer/director Scott Cooper's Crazy Heart is its ability to do just that, embodying and epitomizing the spirit of country music through the medium of cinema. As such, the resulting film falls prey to the same strengths and weaknesses of its musical genre of choice: predicated on a simplistic, familiar riff, yet etched with deep sorrow and resonant human sentiment, drawing strength and stoic comfort through its determination to stick to the tried and true, thus offering little not seen before but offering it well indeed.The plot, often dismissed as '2009's The Wrestler', does indeed bank on the same skeletal narrative template as Mickey Rourke's equally Oscar-baiting offering of flawed, washed up yet redemptive masculinity, itself already precariously skirting the line of tiresome cliché. Yet Cooper finds solemn poignancy in in the familiarity, using his film as a gentle ballad which, rather than attempting to 'explain' faded country superstar 'Bad' Blake or unearth the reasons behind his decline, simply presents him as is. As such, Crazy Heart is less character study than character portrait, allowing the audience to fill in the blanks and determine Bad's morality or motivation without unnecessary directorial annotation. In fact, in many ways Cooper's film excels at taking it slow and loose, adapting a relaxed, unhurried style and pace for the sake of allowing the viewer to drink in the intricacies of Blake's increasingly decrepit life, albeit one which makes the final film drag and feel somewhat overlong for such a simple premise (an added 'romance as redemption' subplot functions mostly as padding). However, as one would imagine, the film thrives as a performance piece, not only in terms of acting but also musically, and the film's country soundtrack infuses it with an earthy weight and presence, thankfully forgoing the standard Hollywood sheen for a clunkier credibility. That being said, the show show belongs to Jeff Bridges, and his 'Bad' Blake feels just as fully realized and genuine a piece of characterization as has graced the cinema in years. His crinkled face etched with the trials of hard living and encapsulating the film's unshowy, rough and warmly genuine feel through his performance, Bridges bleeds every ounce of charisma, ruffled charm and pathos into his down and out musician, ushering in a performance frustrating to sympathize with yet impossible not to understand, and easily deserving every ounce of accolades. The rest of the cast provide conventional stock characters with earthy authenticity. Maggie Gyllenhaal compellingly blends laid back warmth with a wounded guardedness as the single mother reporter whose life becomes increasingly entwined with Blake's, despite her struggling to generate a performance standing out amidst the inherent cliché of her character. Colin Farrell shines in his few scenes, bringing an understated flashiness to Blake's musical protégée, now a country superstar, and Robert Duvall brings a stoic warmth to Blake's bartender buddy, both mercifully resisting the temptation to chew scenery evidently designated for Bridges.Even without its array of compelling performances, particularly the evident draw of Bridges, Crazy Heart would manage to overcome its inherently familiar nature with simple, honest storytelling ensconced with genuine weight and poignancy. While far from a cinematic revelation, the film's unassuming ambitions combined with genuine sentiment make the film a winner for what it is, and one song easily worth giving a reflective listen to.-7.5/10",8,3,5,11 April 2010
War of the Worlds," Special effects do not a great movie make
","It seems that director Steven Spielberg has a thing for aliens. First it was Close Encounters of the Third Kind back in the 70s, then his cute and cuddly E.T. in the 80s. Now, Spielberg creates yet another tale of otherworldly invasion, this time based on the novel by H.G. Wells, and that famous radio broadcast by Orson Wells which sent cities into panic, thinking it was really happening. (Spielberg nods to Wells' broadcast by having Morgan Freeman narrate the story using Wells' exact words) And Spielberg seems to be trying to achieve the same effect as the broadcast, to have the audience literally believe they are being invaded. As a result, the story is told from the perspective of Ray Ferrier, (Tom Cruise) an oceanside mechanic who doesn't happen to be the world's greatest dad, and his two estranged kids, 18 year old Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and 10 year old Rachel (Fanning). When the aliens attack, Ray must not only try to get himself and his kids to safety, but also learn to connect with them more strongly. It's the same kind of 'human drama in the midst of Armageddon' that Spielberg often incorporates into his films (Saving Private Ryan is a perfect example) but it's never been his strength, as is the case in War of the Worlds. The scenes of Ray trying to bond with his children are too long and too frequent, and they don't seem truthful enough to retain our attention - it seems like all involved are trying to force the emotion. Obviously, the strength of a movie such as this is the special effects, which are admittedly mind-blowing - but special effects do not a great movie make. (if only Spielberg's buddy, George Lucas would learn this...) Unfortunately, Spielberg seems to be committing most of his focus to the computerized mayhem, and letting his cast run amuck in terms of performances. Cruise in particular, seems to be trying too hard, forcing an intense performance to the point of verging on over the top. He is just too emotional, too worried, too desperate throughout - if he could tone himself down (this seems to be true off screen as well...) he would succeed with a much better performance. The cast standout is Tim Robbins as a panicky survivor of the alien attack, obsessed with the idea of striking back at the aliens. Miranda Otto also gives a gentle, forceful performance as Ray's ex-wife and mother of his two children (although her pregnancy seems to simply disappear at the end of the film, and it is never clarified if she gave birth or not) Their two children themselves are less strong performers: Justin Chatwin seems to be the perfect contrast to Cruise as his father - where Cruise was always too emotional, unable to tune himself down, Chatwin seems to struggle to portray any emotion whatsoever. And Dakota Fanning seems content to coast along on the girlish screams and terrified looks one might expect from an actress her age, despite the fact that she is far more talented then she lets on here. The main problem of War of the Worlds is it's ending. Without giving anything away, Spielberg seems afraid to provide answers to the many questions he provokes throughout the film. He leads us on continuously, waiting breathlessly for these questions to be clarified, to fill the many huge gaps in logic... but answers are never given. It's this weak and horribly predictable ending which makes one remember War of the Worlds on a sour note - which is a shame because the special effects and computer generated destruction, which is, of course, the main reason most audiences would see this film in the first place, are pretty much unparalleled in terms of raw destruction. If you are looking for a fun afternoon filled with lots of big, noisy explosions and crashes, War of the Worlds would be the perfect film for you. But if you're searching for a little logic as well... there are better movies with almost as much destruction to see.-6/10",6,0,1,10 July 2005
30 Days of Night," Gruesomely entertaining but disappointingly flawed exercise in mainstream horror
","In terms of inciting premises, few prove as fitting as the prospect of an Alaskan town, plunged into a thirty day period with no sunlight being attacked by a vicious roaming tribe of vampires. The isolated setting and uniquely unsettling natural circumstances set the scene for what should have been one of the most supremely gripping and utterly chilling horror epics to grace the cinema in years. Unfortunately, while Hard Candy director David Slade initially proved just the man for the job, it is his reliance on trite horror conventions which ultimately descends 30 Days of Night from the superb film it should have been to the lacklustre resulting product. The plot proves oddly reminiscent to classic Hitchcock thriller The Birds through its similar lack of context in the midst of a supernatural crisis. Instead of flooding the audience with eye-rolling historical exposition explaining the backstory of the vampires, Slade cuts right to the chase, so to speak, ignoring such qualms as to why and how the vampires arrived in Alaska and immediately immersing the audience in a breathless fight for survival. However laudable the lack of unnecessary volumes of backstory for the vampires is, a middle ground between it and the complete absence of context would have done wonders, elucidating certain questions and making for a more rich and compelling watch. Similarly, the weak script, leaving next to no room for character development and providing many implausible twists in character motivation, laughably clichéd horror situations and a painfully contrived ending seriously detracts from what could otherwise have been a staunchly quality horror piece.Slade's film excels on the technical front, its quality especially boosted by the unusually effective cinematography. Mercifully shying away from the trendy nausea of 'shaky-cam', the film astutely alternates between jarring, abrasive close-ups and sweeping crane shots (one sequence where the camera pulls back to a bird's eye view of the town, surveilling the helpless denizens being gruesomely obliterated by the vampire onslaught is eerily beautiful), perfectly capturing the desolate beauty of the Alaskan setting. Similarly, Brian Reitzell's musical score proves one of the most effective horror scores in recent memory, its harmonious pounding and screeching exquisitely complimenting the carnage. However, considering the film's reliance on its action setpieces to provide thrills, the action sequences, while suitably bloody, are often clunky and poorly executed, failing to generate more than a routine level of suspense or terror. Particularly laudable is the treatment of the vampires themselves - in an age where such creatures are often portrayed as slick and classy, it is a breath of fresh air to see this new incarnation of vampires: feral, bloodstained, thankfully portrayed by real actors and not computer generated, and worthy of fear, even if their curiously animalistic movements draw parallels to enemy creatures in most modern shooter games, and the vampire makeup varies between overdone and almost non-existent, either way distracting in its inconsistency. One also gets the feeling that the creatures would prove more chilling with the exclusion of Danny Huston's 'vampire speech', as his few hackneyed lines, spoken in a barking dialect only serves to deter from their overall menace. While the quality of the cast may not descend to the banal dredges which would normally plague such a work, few manage to contribute anything of interest performance-wise. While the typically wooden Josh Hartnett musters a sliver more emotion than his past work, he still remains far too flat a lead to capture the audience's sympathies or often interest. Melissa George similarly remains firmly imbedded in the realm of 'stock female action support and love interest' - while George is hardly as abysmal as she could have been, she certainly doesn't offer much in terms of charisma or emotional realism. Danny Huston adds a dash of class as the head of the vampires, though whether the odd imbalance between the humanity and feral aspects of his character was intentional or not remains a constant question throughout. Ben Foster steals the show as the unnervingly captivating mysterious stranger whose arrival heralds the coming of the vampires, and Foster's fiercely convincing portrayal of a man utterly consumed by the grasp of madness is the film's only truly worthwhile performance. Character actor Mark Boone Junior is mostly wasted as a shaggy social recluse forced to battle for his life with the rest of the villagers. A slew of frustrating inadequacies take what could have been an instant classic of the horror genre, and instead strand it in the realm of the mediocre. While 30 Days of Night offers many a scare and a gruesomely entertaining watch, don't expect much in the ways of profundity or innovation to the usual genre conventions - overall worth seeing for those willing to take it for what it is.-6/10",6,0,1,26 April 2008
Wedding Crashers," So enjoyable, you almost want to try crashing a wedding yourself!
","One of the things movie audiences have to look forward to every summer is not only the release of several sub-par action movies, but also the inevitable arrival of the next 'frat pack comedy'. As this summer's past installment of the latter, everyone must have had a general impression of what to expect from Wedding Crashers - a simple storyline which is basically only an excuse to showcase the comedic leads, and give plenty of opportunity for improvised one-liners and other such laughs. Wedding Crashers indeed lives up to the long loved frat pack formula, but still manages to take audiences by surprise in many aspects. It certainly pushes boundaries in terms of sexual content for humor, but fear not, the jokes are never in such bad taste that they fall into the realm of 'gross-out humor' - the movie is far too funny for that. And surely enough, the key to the film's success lies in its two leads: Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn seem to be a comedic match that was always meant to be, with the effortless ease and skill they play off each other, managing to evoke a laugh from the most mundane of situations. Between Wilson's laid back, easy going persona and Vaughn's manic fast- talking improvisational skills, every second the two are on screen they never come across as less than superbly entertaining. Unfortunately, director David Dobkin and other filmmakers are not content to make a movie revolving simply around the pair of them doing their thing - they find it necessary to convert the story into more of a clichéd romance near the end. Not only is this approach far overdone and not that enjoyable at all, but it completely clashes with the jovial mood of the first section. It was a good attempt at a more profound storyline, but ultimately the film would have been more entertaining had it taken itself a bit more lightly, and simply given Vaughn and Wilson more time to wreak havoc playing off each other. As such, it is still a highly entertaining film, but mainly worth watching for the first half or so. Although the focus is clearly on the two lead characters here, they are backed up by an excellent supporting cast as well, especially the beautiful and very talented Rachel McAdams as the object of Wilson's affections, and Isla Fisher as Vaughn's psychotic and overly clingy girlfriend. Jane Seymour also raises many a laugh (often uncomfortable ones given) as the mother of the two of them, and Christopher Walken... well, what can be said about Christopher Walken really? Suffice to say he is beyond excellent as usual, raising tears of laughter from doing virtually nothing at all. As much as I may have never expected to say this, Wedding Crashers would have been much more entertaining had it made an attempt to stick closer to the frat pack formula instead of trying to work a more serious romance element in, which clashed uncomfortably with the carefree, uplifting mood of its first half, which was much more enjoyable. Still, Wedding Crashers is nonetheless one of the very funniest movies released in a long while, and worth seeing if only for Vaughn and Wilson's unparalleled chemistry and amazing ability to play off each other. Expect to partake in many a laugh, however crude or filthy, when watching Wedding Crashers!-8.5/10",8,3,4,7 February 2006
There Will Be Blood," There are no words...
","It is exceedingly rare in this day and age to come across a film which brings credence to the cliché 'taking your breath away', and actually knocks the viewer flat to the point of being lost for words when attempting to capture the essence of the film. Such an experience seems to happen once or twice a decade at best, with the release of a film whose quality is undeniable, whose image is seared into the collective unconscious, and yet proves elusive in terms of putting down into mere words. Such a film is the latest staggering achievement by writer/ director Paul Thomas Anderson, There Will Be Blood - a work whose sheer masterful command of the cinematic form knocks the viewer flat like a forceful physical impact, as they sit, entranced and utterly absorbed by the spectacle unfolding in front of them. It staggers the mind to think that There Will Be Blood is only director Paul Thomas Anderson's fifth feature length film, as his incomparable command of his medium suggests decades of experience. Adapting the novel 'Oil!' by Upton Sinclair, Anderson has crafted an odyssey of greed, ambition, spirituality, family, and the subversion of all of the above, all centered around the quest of a turn of the century oil tycoon (Daniel Day-Lewis) struggling to make it big. But in the end, despite the immaculately detailed and informative journey of oil prospecting, the essence of the film could be boiled down to an age old sparring between faith and human greed and ambition, and Anderson's pitch perfect screenplay captures such underlying themes in an overwhelmingly affecting fashion.But despite the film's lengthy running time and frequent slow, moody segments, the palpable tension throughout is enough to keep any viewer utterly immersed within the perversely affecting story unfolding in front of them. While such length in a lesser film might be considered self indulgent, Anderson refuses to simply tell the story of a man, and instead engages in an epic voyage of both the triumph of man's spirit, and the decline of his soul - and for every last moment, from the near silent opening twenty minutes to the flooring, astoundingly powerful climax, the film effortlessly captivates and draws the viewer in to the dark realism of the time. From the impeccable period detail, to the sublime beauty of the expansive countrysides to the harsh, dank grit of the oil wells, Anderson shows an astounding ability to immerse the viewer within his film - one can almost smell the oil and feel the rush of flame scorching the air. Similarly, the hauntingly beautiful score by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood would normally seem more fitting in a horror movie than a period drama, but strangely enough, it perfectly compliments the eerie and tremendously unsettling tone of the entire film, matching the slow burning tension exquisitely. If there was ever any doubt as to the unbelievable proficiency of Daniel Day-Lewis, his staggering masterclass of a performance here is enough to dispel it. The sheer force and spellbinding intensity Day-Lewis radiates seems to sear through the screen, bringing nihilistic and ferociously ambitious oil prospector Daniel Plainview to life in a disconcertingly realistic fashion. Present in every single scene of the film, Plainview is a truly astounding character: a self described 'family man' who abandons his adopted son, seeing him as an 'inconvenience'; a humanitarian who threatens to murder the local pastor, and whose all consuming hatred for those around him and incessant greed and lust for conquest. Plainview is not a villain strictly speaking, but is more despicable and blood-churning than any villain could be, all the more so by the fact that despite his slew of abominable qualities he still captures the audience's sympathies right to the end of his sordid tale. Seldom in the history of the medium has a singular performance proved so incendiary, and Day-Lewis deserves every bit of recognition thrown his way. Similarly, rising star Paul Dano easily holds his own against the titan that is Day-Lewis as a young, frighteningly charismatic preacher waging spiritual war against the unapologetically malevolent Plainview, and the fact that Dano's staggering portrait of a struggling young man has been overlooked by the Academy is simply unforgivable. While the majority of the focus is on the overwhelming power of the film's lead two actors, Kevin J. O'Conner and Cirarán Hinds give strong support, as does young Dillon Freasier in his film debut as Plainview's stoic son. Despite many heartfelt efforts (including this one), no words can truly capture the impact of Anderson's stunning work. Suffice to say the film easily deserves every last bit of praise bestowed upon it, and more, as every last intricate piece meld together to form an utterly flawless and tremendously powerful piece of work. There Will Be Blood is not so much simply a film as an impeccable crafted work of art, an experience which merits viewing by any in search of astronomically powerful cinema or those wishing to see what is sure to become a modern classic in the making.-10/10",10,3,9,6 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once
","I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as 'one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles' and 'one of the classics of the 70's'. Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a 'crazy house' will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10",10,518,567,14 January 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," Watch. Enjoy. Probably don't repeat.
","Edge of Tomorrow is the kind of movie that could very truthfully boast that it offers something for everyone. Die-hard fan of the Cruiser? Here he is in best swaggering/serious face-sporting, alien-blasting form. Can't stand him? Enjoy the cathartic satisfaction of watching him be blown away repeatedly, in various gruesome or hilarious ways. What's not to love? Though its high concept elevator pitch would have it reduced to 'Groundhog Day as sci-fi action thriller', director Doug Liman's adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka's graphic novel All You Need Is Kill doesn't suffer the comparison. Thematically, there are similar takeaways about living in the moment and maximizing potential, but winding them into a slick action thriller motivates some genuinely thrilling and clever action sequences, squaring down with inventively ghastly hive-mind alien adversaries, to boot. After a cleverly laborious start with Cruise impressively playing against type as a cocky-cum-cowardly administrative weasel in a bureaucratic showdown with the masterfully grim Brendan Gleeson, the film kicks into gear with a nailbiting drop zone shootout/bloodbath. And repeat. While the film's repetition will invariably grate on some less patient audiences, Liman keeps the pacing taut - this is a war movie, after all - with enough slight variations and escalation to keep things interesting, as Cruise is trained by the fantastically hard-as-nails (and often surprisingly funny) Emily Blunt into becoming the ultimate war machine.The best bit? The mech armour battlesuits and gloriously goofy Bill Paxton aren't the only takeaways from Aliens. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie also recycles James Cameron's fusion of high tension and macho humour, which keeps the film's tongue snugly tucked in its cheek even as the explosions, gunfire, and increasingly indignant death/resurrections (Cruise gets the best 'Oh COME ON!' moment outside of Arrested Development as he prepares for a 'reset') erupt. Although this sense of fun wobbles somewhat in its Stakes are Never Higher climax, with any luck, audiences will feel too overstimulated to scorn being invested in the ride.Edge of Tomorrow, lynchpin of the recent Cruiseaissance, is a sturdy, fun, and inventive action flick, surprisingly likely to play well to a spectrum of audience sensibilities. It might lean a touch too heavily on genre conventions and precedents to earn the kind of Sisyphean viewing regiment its catchphrase demands, but giving it a pass entirely? Game over, man. Game over.-8/10",8,0,2,12 September 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," 'Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula' would be a more accurate title
","When an author's name is used in the title of a movie, we are lead to assume that the movie will be an adaptation of the author's original work. This usually signifies that the film will try to follow the story of the book faithfully, perhaps changing a few minor elements to make the transition to film easier to follow, but in general, staying true to the gist of the book. However, none of this at all applies to 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', which takes the title, characters and very basic plot elements from the novel, but not much else.Director Francis Ford Coppola feels obliged to add a love plot between the title character and Mina Murray, who in the novel, he merely attempted to transform into a vampire alongside himself. Presumably, the idea was to give Dracula more to do, so the vampire isn't reduced to a supporting character, but the love plot doesn't work at all, and it is handled extremely awkwardly, making it completely uncredible as well as unlikely. (what could Mina possibly find appealing in a vampire trying to drain her blood to prolong his own miserable life even more?!) And why the decision for Dracula's vampire brides to be naked? They were far too creepy to seem appealing to the audience, and their entire scene seemed really out of place, and just badly done in general.Many original elements from the book were absurdly overdone, such as Dracula turning into a beast,.(there was no need for him to transform as frequently as he did) Also, Dracula's moving shadow on the wall and the instantly changing hair colour of the supporting characters were laughable at best. It's true that the story focuses almost entirely on the four main characters, which is lucky, since it is impossible to sympathize in any way with the supporting characters such as Lord Holmwood and Quincey Morris, since their parts were so one dimensional and underdeveloped.However, Coppola's biggest mistake was trying to make the audience sympathize with Dracula, with him wanting forgiveness from God after swearing vengeance on him thousands of years ago. Dracula is supposed to be the quintessential monster, we are supposed to hate him, and glorify in his death, not feel sorry for him. Trying to fit both elements into the same character just failed miserably.The costumes in many cases were really quite ridiculous - when Dracula is first introduced as an old man, he is wearing a ludicrous red gown of some sort, and has his hair pulled into grotesque granny buns. How are we supposed to be intimidated by that? Later on, we find the dastardly vampire sporting John Lennon sunglasses, and a typical Johnny Depp hat. So now the vampire is going out of his way to start new fashion trends?! More unintentional laughs are now provoked.Coppola did manage to secure a couple of good casting jobs, but the casting of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker has to be one of the most noticeable miscastings in film history, as Reeves gives one of his most wooden performances ever here, also showing that he cannot fake an accent to save his life, and has the entirely wrong look for the period. Reeves drags down the movie more than any of Coppola's directorial misfires could. Fortunately, Gary Oldman is excellent, engaging and charismatic as Dracula, if not quite as villainous as one would have hoped. Winona Ryder is another who at first glance appears to be miscast, but she actually turns out a decent performance, particularly in her scenes with Van Helsing. This is of course aided by the excellent casting of Anthony Hopkins, who is very suited to the role, although he played it much colder than the character in the novel, who was considerably more warm. Hopkins' Van Helsing is a no-nonsense, no time to waste, places to go, vampires to kill kind of guy. Tom Waits also stands out as raving lunatic Renfield, one of his strongest acting performances to date.It is an insult to Bram Stoker's novel just by naming the movie after it, as it would be even if Coppola's adaptation had been done well. So many changes were made to the plot that the movie has very little in common with Stoker's book. If the film had been titled 'Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula' we would have a better idea of what to expect. Although, Coppola doesn't deserve much critical acclaim for the multiple directorial misfires he makes here. In Coppola's defense, he was probably trying to put his own spin on the tale, to leave his mark and offer a different take on the novel. But surely there were better possibilities for the film than this one.4/10",4,3,5,10 November 2004
"Hail, Caesar!"," Stale Pleaser
","'Well, I'm sorry the Coen Brothers don't direct my porn,' fumed Jonah Hill in 2007's Superbad. Flash-forward to 2016, and Hill now occupies a coveted star cameo slot in the latest by Hollywood's most illustrious filmmaking brothers (sorry, The Russos). This is the world we live in.But hey - the pictures are a wacky business, dontcha know? In fact, that's about as close to a moral or theme as we get with Hail, Ceasar. As salivary as the prospect of the Coens putting their oddball spin on the golden age of Hollywood with a bigger budget than Barton Fink was, they've sadly - seemingly unironically - fallen prey to the same vacuous glitz and cavernous superficiality of the ol' dream factory they spend an entire feature poking fun at. The result, while still pleasant and replete with choice Coen tidbits, is easily their laziest and weakest work to date. Maybe they should have added more pornIf anything, the film industry, so replete with the weirdos and sleazeballs that are the Coens' bread and butter, may have been too broad a target for them to make much of an impact. The oddest thing about Hail, Ceasar is how frequently characters make verbal reference to the film industry as a circus full of eccentrics in need of babysitting, as the playback itself feels disconcertingly welldull. We could forgive the rampantly incohesive bevy of subplots, and seemingly unintentional slew of film history inconsistencies and anachronisms (for a film championing classical Hollywood, the Coens sure seemingly didn't do much research) were there a core plot strand, or classic Coen lead, for everything to rally behind, a-la Lebowski. Instead, most of the characters we spend the most time tromping around the backstage lots with with - Brolin's growly Harry Mannix, Clooney's mawkish superstar buffoon, even Tilda Swinton's huffy twin gossip columnists - simply aren't very interesting or engaging; they're pale caricatures of characters done far more interestingly elsewhere - heck, even elsewhere by the Coens. Instead, the vignettes that buzz with the most life and infectious fun - Channing Tatum's exquisitely bubbly sailor-clad tap dancer, Scarlett Johansson's potty- mouthed starlet doing mermaid aquatic acrobatics on top of a mechanical whale, and Ralph Fiennes' prissy, effete director demurely teaching elocution - are relegated to tiny sideplots, whimsically snipped away, like pre-feature Roadrunner shorts you'd rather stick with rather than the bland melodrama proceeding them. It's a bemusing trend that at least three or four scenes throughout the film close, anticlimatically, with a cutaway shot to a character hesitantly uttering 'Huh.', as if manufacturing beats so forcedly even they weren't certain the scene had run its course. It's all so slapdash and clumsily cobbled together that Frances McDormand's cameo as an editor who is nearly throttled to death splicing together dailies in the editing suite feels grimly prescient. Still, even sleepwalking Coens still have so much to offer, and many of the aforementioned frivolous filming subplots allow them to let loose with some of their trademark bonkers surrealist visual poetry, not unlike The Big Lebowski's now infamous Viking bowling alley dream sequence. Similarly, relative newcomer Alden Ehrenreich is an inspired find as a chipper Roy Rogers-esq cowboy out of his depth dabbling in a period melodrama, and there's a delightful Wayne Knight bit that will make audiences want to dash out and watch Space Jam all over again. Otherwise, there's slim pickings on display here - even the usual Roger Deakins/Carter Burwell power combo is lacking its usual hilariously austere, cheekily operatic Coen ambiance. The Coens have always been content to opt for style over substance (or at least style bolstering playful ambiguity for those willing to dig deeper for elusive meaning), but here, we're disconcertingly short on both, in this shambling, derivative skeleton of potential. And yet, for a movie so irreconcilably flawed, Hail, Ceasar sure did leave me in a jaunty, cheery mood leaving the theatre, even while drawing up a list of its faults. Perhaps there is a sneaky meta-commentary to be had after all: this film, conflating wide-eyed Judaeo-Christian worship with snarky Communist condescension of the money-grubbing shackles of the system, sure did serve as an opiate for the masses. Hey - if the only takeaway from Hail, Ceasar, apart from some charmingly Coen classical Hollywood dance pastiches, is the urge to go out and indulge in some old- school Hollywood fare (or even old-school Coens fare), I'll take it. (But seriously - Coens: The Porno. Think about it, Joel and Ethan. It'd really tie the room -err, your careers - together) -6/10",6,3,8,7 February 2016
American Gangster," Conventional yet compelling crime drama
","Certain films appear almost tailor made for success right from the moment of conception, and American Gangster proves a perfect example. Detailing the thrilling true story of a Harlem drug lord, helmed by an enormously renowned director and giving two of the finest stars in the industry the chance to generate murderous chemistry and flex their dramatic muscles, it seemed near impossible that the film could not be a runaway smash hit. And indeed it would seem this was the attitude of those involved with the production of the film, as while the film in question is hardly a failure, the impression is given of all concerned being content to coast by on the film's respective successful components instead of really pushing the envelope to extract every ounce of the film's cinematic potential. As such, American Gangster remains an engrossing and powerful piece of cinema but considering the movie magic that could have resulted, the sturdy film feels almost like a disappointment, or at the very least a somewhat misplaced opportunity.As laudable a package as American Gangster is, the inescapable sense of it offering little of new to the crime genre and in many cases unabashedly borrowing from past efforts (one scene in particular is purloined directly from The Godfather) stifles one's appreciation of its overall quality. Had the film been released twenty or so years ago, it would doubtlessly have been praised for its storyline and thematic innovations, but after countless entries into the genre of late, characteristics such as repeatedly drawing explicit parallels and contrasts between the cop and criminal squaring off against each other and police corruption making it difficult for the one honest member to function hardly come across as revelatory. While it is clear that all parties involved have done more than their fair share of research into the life and legacy of infamous 1970s Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, the telling of Lucas' tale falls prey to overly familiar crime film conventions so frequently that there is little to differentiate the film from countless other explorations of the rise and fall of successful drug lords apart from the nationality of the title character, proudly flaunted 'true story' tag or not. However, quality is quality, and in the hands of such an esteemed filmmaker as Ridley Scott it proves a difficult trait to avoid indeed, as Scott anchors a firm directorial grasp throughout. After a slow start, detailing Lucas' work ethic and value system, Scott's film really takes off, with the veteran director extracting the maximum possible amount of tension, cinematic power and emotional clout from the compelling story, convention aside. Scott's depiction of 1970s Harlem indeed looks and feels the part, painting a vivid and memorable picture of the highs and lows of financial offerings, albeit one that does feel like an immaculate construction without the level of grit or authenticity other filmmakers such as Scorsese have pumped from the much filmed city. However, with some quality cinematography and editing and a suitably seventies musical score the film remains an overall staunchly constructed package, despite the feeling of it being very much a package and less of a flowing story.As title character Frank Lucas, Denzel Washington is truly the film's main centerpoint of quality, his quiet charisma and nobility creating a character who audiences can empathise with while simultaneously being repelled by without missing a beat. Rather than struggling with the differentiation, Washington inhabits the character so fully that such contradictions appear second nature, fully engrained in such an able-bodied performance. Russell Crowe is also a strong presence as Richie Roberts, the struggling, scruffy policeman striving to take Lucas down, but despite Crowe's trademark rugged charisma his performance still appears bland by his usual standards, coasting by on a simplistically written 'struggling, divorced but honest cop' archetype. Ably backing the two powerhouse leads, Chiwetel Ejoifor wonderfully essays Lucas' nervy yet enthusiastically likable brother and second in command, and Josh Brolin gives a gleefully repulsive performance as a seedy, corrupt policeman. Ruby Dee shines in her few scenes, a dignified yet formidable performance as Lucas' weathered mother, and Lymari Nadal instils a quiet serenity into Lucas' beauty queen wife, preventing the character from simply becoming an undignified moll. While American Gangster boasts impressive exteriors, on the inside it proves somewhat of a hollow effort, offering little new to its genre and seemingly lacking in genuine spark underneath the awards baiting outside. However, the quality on display cannot be ignored, and the film remains an impressively crafted, powerfully acted and undeniably compelling piece of work - if only there wasn't an ever persistent sense of missed potential throughout, an even greater film lingering frustratingly out of reach. -7.5/10",7,2,3,15 August 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Magic Realism
","After seeing your average movie, the audience departs with a fairly cut and dry, black and white sense of whether the movie was good or bad, and can point out exactly the high points, and what needed fixing up. And then every once in a while, along comes a movie like Stranger than Fiction, which provides no such easy answers. Don't walk into this movie expecting a typical loud, obnoxious Will Ferrell comedy  it isn't. Don't walk into this movie expecting a typical Hollywood story about change and redemption  it isn't that either. Don't even walk in expecting the most standard genre of Charlie Kaufman style 'weird for the sake of weird', because although this may be a closer fit than the other subheadings, it still fails to encompass everything Stranger than Fiction is.While it's true Stranger than Fiction does have a premise similar to the time worn story of progressive change and redemption complete with happy ending, the film is far too clever to fall into such trappings. Or is it? It becomes difficult to tell when director Marc Foster, who has proved himself immensely capable with such past hits as Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland and screenwriter Zach Helm are making intelligent social comment or self reflection and when it seems like they've lost control of their movie entirely and have little idea of what it is turning into. What should have turned out to be a quirky masterpiece ultimately ends up as less than such. There are moments of inspired genius, yes, but there are also unquestionably weak and uninteresting periods, which do serve to drive the message of isolation home, but in the end, a social comment on a boring life still comes across as well boring.However, the film also may succeed more as a philosophical message than black comedy, with musings on the concepts such as pre-determination and fatalism (the philosophical banter between Dustin Hoffman's literary professor character and the nonplussed Ferrell are among the film's high points) which also come across as frustratingly underdeveloped ideas, since the concepts hinted at are fascinating. Such is the case for many aspects of the film  they are simply hinted at, when a more in depth look might have proved far more intriguing. But once again, all the way through, the viewer is given a sense that Foster knows exactly what he is doing, and there is a reason for the frustratingly sparse nature of such concepts. Or not. The film does indeed provoke many such questions and will without doubt raise heated discussions, but it's not the kind of powerful piece of work which changes lives  simply a quirky, charmingly unconventional and frequently frustrating self-reflection piece.With a less talented cast, the idea never would have come into fruition properly, but with the ensemble of charismatic actors Foster has assembled, what might have been a very shaky film comes across as less shaky. Ferrell is refreshingly subdued as the solitary IRS agent, managing to infuse his performance with just enough sparkle for him to not come across as just as uninteresting as the character he is portraying. Maggie Gyllenhaal's character does become frustratingly predictable at parts, but she gives such a luminous performance we forgive her in our minds. But it's in the quirky supporting characters the film really draws its strength from, especially the always reliable Dustin Hoffman, perfectly understated as a literary professor examining Ferrell's predicament, and the scene-stealing Emma Thompson's delightfully quirky take on the struggling author persona.Is Stranger than Fiction a masterpiece, sure to make viewers re-consider their lives? No. But is it an interesting and quirky watch, with a great cast giving charming and eccentric performances and moments of creative brilliance that carry the film through its weaker and more frustrating aspects? Yes. Should it be considered recommended? Yes, but be advised that seeing the movie having heard as little about it as possible would be a wise idea, as most everyone is likely to have a different take on such an oddball movie, and you'll want to keep an open mind.-7/10",7,2,4,8 December 2006
The Green Mile," Truly affecting
","The Green Mile - Spoilers hereinI decided to see the Green Mile right after finishing the novel by Stephen King, to see if the movie lived up to it's glowing reputation. While I didn't doubt that the film would be good, I had my doubts if it could match the greatness of the novel, which I was truly blown away by. Needless to say... the movie is easily as good as the book, if not better, which is an occurrence that seems to happen less and less in movies these days. But with the Green Mile, director Frank Darabont and a superb cast have put together a truly touching and affecting story. Darabont, who also transferred the novel to a screenplay, is wise enough to know that Stephen King's original works are good enough without changing, and so he keeps virtually all spoken lines and events EXACTLY (and I'm not exaggerating) the same as in the novel, except for the odd time when he adds an extra line of dialogue or two to help clarify something the narrator originally said. This approach actually works out really well; it might have seemed patchy and awkward in a worst case scenario. Fortunately, the excellent cast is too experienced to let that happen. Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances yet, is wonderful as Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard on death row who comes across events he was by no means ready for. But it is safe to say that he is overshadowed (in more ways than one) by the simply wonderful performance given by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, Edgecomb's prisoner who turns out to have 'special gifts'. It's a complex enough role as is, but Duncan brings so much more to Coffey than just crying and acting dim. Beneath Coffey's outward simple mindedness, ('The name's John Coffey. Like the drink, 'cept not spelled the same.') there is a searing intelligence waiting just under the exterior, just enough for us to notice. Duncan really turns Coffey into a sympathetic character, and from the beginning, it is impossible to believe that Coffey was capable of raping and murdering two little girls - so much are we compelled to care about him. It is beyond me how Duncan could have lost out at the Oscars that year, one of the most potent examples, in my opinion, of how the Academy is more about politics than artistic merit.David Morse is terrific as 'Brutal' Howell, another guard and close friend of Edgecomb's. Morse perfectly personifies the character from the novel, and perfectly plays the role of the kind and sensitive man beneath a huge, tough exterior. Doug Hutchison is wonderfully despicable as Percy Wetmore, the spoiled brat of a prison guard, who no one can complain about, because of his political connections. So evil is Percy to all the helpless prisoners (who we care for a lot more than him) that we can't help but hate him, and feel truly satisfied when he is confined to a mental hospital at the end from being touched by Coffey, who referred to him as a 'bad man'. Sam Rockwell plays a wonderful psycho as 'Wild Bill' Wharton, going gleefully over the top, and still not seeming out of place. I was also very impressed by the performance of the late Michael Jeter as french prisoner Eduard Delacroix, he gave an excellent performance, and had exactly the same appearance and mannerisms as the character did in the novel. All around, highly impressive performances.The only noticeable flaw in The Green Mile is that with it's lengthy running time, the story seems a little slow paced at times, and too quickly paced at others. Arlen Bitterbuck, (played by Graham Greene) who was a significant character in the novel, is reduced to only once scene of dialogue, and two quick shots of him sitting in his cell in earlier scenes. The only possible reason I could find for shortening Bitterbuck's screen time so significantly would be to quicken the pace of the movie more, but since other parts drag, this intent doesn't exactly work. It's not a huge issue, but it's one that was bothering me as I watched the film. There's no doubt that The Green Mile is a highly impressive piece of work, or that it carries heavy emotional impact. An excellent storyline from the excellent Stephen King novel is updated into a truly excellent movie. Now, if only we were able to say that more often...-9.5/10",10,0,1,7 April 2005
Jaws," As ruthlessly simplistic, incessant and unforgettable as its antagonist - an unexpected cinematic triumph
","In 1974, if anyone had been asked their predictions of what upcoming release would change the course of the industry, it is impossible to imagine there being a less likely candidate than Jaws. A pulpy novel adapted by a 28 year old near unknown director yielding one of the most infamously disastrous film shoots in the history of the medium (a duration of a projected 55 days exploding into 159, with a cantankerous cast, a mutinous crew and a barely functioning shark prop) - all things considered, the fact that the film was completed is a feat in itself. And yet, paradoxically for a film centering around a series of deaths, Jaws instead yielded a succession of figurative rebirths, being credited with singlehandedly pioneering the summer blockbuster and ancillary markets, terrifying and thrilling audiences worldwide and turning its amateur director into one of the most recognizable figures in the film industry - a certain Steven Spielberg. The combination of factors clicked, Jaws wormed its way into the collective unconscious with uncanny speed, and no viewer would ever look at deep water entirely devoid of fear again.The film is a true rarity - a 'monster' film which spends most of the film avoiding showing its iconic antagonist, a horror thriller in which the characters emerge as the most memorable, and a film with the simplest of premises which has yielded countless theories on the 'meaning' of the shark (alternatively declared as emblematic of womanhood attacking the film's smörgåsbord of masculinity, cold war nuclear destruction on a small American town, or the entire film as an extensive critique of American capitalism - particularly ironic for such an outrageously financially successful film). Yet Jaws also harbours a real pulsating life beyond being a mere collection of now iconic moments and lines. Scenes such as Brody's trading silly faces with his son at the dinner table and the three protagonists' drunken comparison of scars infuse the film with a genuine heart and emotional attachment, making the masterfully concealed yet still shoddy special effects all the more easy to swallow and the film all the more engrossing. As effective a directorial calling card as any, the film serves to showcase all the attributes which would serve to make Spielberg a cinematic legend: addressing familiar viewer expectations with a paradoxically refreshing immediacy, constructed yet honest emotion, sentiment trimmed of excess sap and credible optimism juxtaposed with real terror. A simple tale of men versus shark is evolved into a larger than life cinematic parable, and, crucially, remains enormously entertaining in spite of its countless other plaudits. Yet what makes Spielberg's film the most intriguing is its ability to accomplish so much with so little. From the skeletal plot to John Williams' timeless yet almost entirely two note musical score to Bill Butler's legendary shark point-of-view cinematography to the script's impressive use of few lines to suggest a wealth of characterisation, the film thrives on minimalism. Spielberg distills conventional story complexity and nuance into emotional chords (fear of water, the unknown, etc.) as primal as the film's antagonist. And antagonist the shark unquestionably is, overblown far past notions of realistic shark size and behaviour into the definitive foe, beyond conventional notions of evil into an unflinching, incessant force of nature, and all the more terrifying because of it. And it is the shark's unpredictable tearing through the picture which chaotically deviates from its minimalism, punctuating its crisp efficiency with bursts of brutal excesses. While Spielberg amps the tension of the pending shark attacks up to near unbearable levels, their sheer ferocity and the camera's tenacious refusal to shy away from the gruesome spectacle still manages to make them shocking and horrifying despite the anticipation. However, Spielberg is not afraid to take his time - after a while knuckled opening fright, the film slows down, allowing copious time for audiences to sit with and take to the down to earth honesty of the characters while slowly but surely moving its plot along, making the bursts of shark activity all the more surprising through having lured the audience into a false sense of security. And while such thrill driven films would normally pale in a contemporary context (and it is likely the film could prove too slow and comparatively bloodless to equally enthrall more gore-saturated modern viewers), Jaws defies such concerns through its sublimely creeping pacing and masterful technical work, making the film as superb an emotional assault currently as in 1975. Roy Scheider's gruff charisma proves the perfect emotional heart for the film, making his aquaphobic Chief Brody not only innately likable but entirely credible, an unshowy yet impeccably realized triumph of a lead. Richard Dreyfus is also wonderfully memorable, his devilish sarcasm making marine biologist Matt Hooper eons away from the stereotypical ranting scientist. Robert Shaw is simply mesmerising as grizzled shark hunter Quint, toeing the perfect balance between being raucously likable and dangerously deranged, with his chilling Indianapolis monologue searing into the memory. Lorraine Gary is also an entirely human creation as Brody's wife, with each action suggesting years of familiarity and chemistry. And Murray Hamilton maintains a gleefully infuriating paradox of being an insidiously hateful character, yet too slickly charismatic and nearly sympathetic to outright dislike as Amity Island's struggling mayor, famously refusing to close the beaches despite the danger due to the income from busy season. As unlikely as it may have been, Jaws proves a truly unforgettable triumph of a motion picture, proving that narrative simplicity and being geared to be enjoyable need not be mutually exclusive from quality film-making. Even years from its initial release the film remains uniformly superb enough to justify the exceptional burst of merchandising and publicity, proving one of those few films as unlikely to be fully shaken from the viewer's head as the collective unconscious. Never again will it be entirely safe to go back in the water. -10/10",10,1,3,13 May 2009
The Wrestler," Like its protagonist, very familiar yet brutally authentic and packing a hefty clout
","For certain films, the particular package proves so impeccably assembled that it is near impossible to imagine an alternate outcome, and there are few better examples than Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler. Initially planned as a Nicholas Cage vehicle of all things, enough literature has been devoted to the poignant parallelism between the film's protagonist, former 1980s superstar wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and star Mickey Rourke and the authenticity of Rourke's casting to fill several books. And while the abundance of praise bestowed on Aronofsky's film threatens to oversell the product itself ('Witness the resurrection of Mickey Rourke' one poster quote boasts), The Wrestler remains one of those rare films which hint at a real truth behind layers of cinematic constructs, making it, if not quite 'the next Raging Bull' as many would have it, a captivating and visceral watch. Rather than challenging assertions of popular wrestling being staged, Aronofsky seems to relish them, casting an unflinchingly critical gaze upon its primarily theatrical nature, and showing his wrestlers warmly hugging before matches, talking through the fight and going out for beers afterward - a far cry from the vicious bloodlust shown in the ring. But neither does Aronofsky dismiss his chosen sport on the grounds of inauthenticity, but simultaneously finds much to appreciate and celebrate in wrestling, from the careful choreography in the ring and stage presence of the stars, to the sheer dogged determination they display towards their craft - in one particularly gruesome scene, Randy, secretly takes a concealed razor blade and slits his forehead, to finish the match bathed in a grotesque shroud of blood. In fact, Aronofsky's both critical and celebratory treatment of wrestling proves representative of his film as a whole. Functioning primarily as a character study of 'The Ram', The Wrestler is, on the surface, a devastatingly bleak film, with Aronofsky refusing to shy away from the character's fall from glory into a truly pitiful state, his pumped up body steadily withering away, and his life reduced to solitary shambles, while still coasting by on his glory days from twenty years ago. Aronofsky intriguingly explores the harrowing outcome of what to do when the one thing a person knows how to do is no longer possible when their body gives out on them, and the pitiful search for scraps of meaning afterward - a theme paralleled by Marisa Tomei's struggling stripper. But, like many such career reflective films as John Wayne's The Shootist and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Aronofsky refuses to let his deflated superstar fade away, emasculated, but instead dignifies him with a final, triumphant bout of glory.In fact, the similarities to the aforementioned westerns become increasingly inescapable as the main criticism towards Aronofsky surfaces. Much like Randy himself, the film, despite its indisputable power, feels very familiar, yet another retread of a common template seen in everything from heist or crime films (the oh so stereotypical 'one last job') to the aforementioned Raging Bull, to just about any genre proving introspective on masculinity and heroism. As such, the blend between the brutally authentic and the film's playing on the familiar makes for a touch of an imbalanced and less immersive watch at times. Similarly, as paradoxical a criticism as it may seem in such a despairingly dark film, Aronofsky is equally unafraid to lay on the sentiment, and at times, while the infusion of humour and warmth into the film is often a welcome reprieve, they do come on as a little strong, as if attempting to overcompensate for the film's overall more sombre tone (the collection of soft spoken, polite and frequently hugging and cheering fellow wrestlers is perhaps a step too far away from the stereotype). But many of the film's lighter moments are far too genuinely heart-warming to object to, as Randy's impromptu playing packaged meat football with his deli customers, struggling to comprehend a young neighbourhood boy's explanations of the game Call of Duty 4 while playing an old Nintendo wrestling game, and his clumsy attempts to win back his estranged daughter among others appear merciful pinholes of hope amidst a veil of fatalism. Similarly, Aronofsky's use of jittery, naturalistic cinematography dispels fears of the film becoming overly cinematic, while maintaining a veneer of grim authenticity to the film. While it may seem particularly ironic that the part of a former titan fading away should provide so much of a career reboot for star Mickey Rourke, the indisputable power and poignancy of his performance easily merits every last scrap of hype. Rouke is a triumph, complimenting Randy's cocky, superstar swagger with a humiliating limp, and proving just at adapt at heartbreakingly weeping over his abandoned relations with his daughter as casting a bold grin around a roaring wrestling ring - a nuanced, beautifully naturalistic and innately likable portrait of masculinity at its most stunted. Marisa Tomei is also exceptional as ageing stripper Cassidy, forced to confront her declining body as she is turned away by customers. Tomei's performance is just as willfully honest in the midst of its haunting character flaws as Rourke's, and while she may deliver less raw dramatic intensity, hers is more of a quiet, slow burning bit of characterisation which ultimately proves just as resonant. Evan Rachel Wood is also devastatingly believable as Randy's cast away daughter, with Wood providing an achingly wounded soul underneath her character's mask of indignant fury towards her father - the scenes between her and Rourke provide the vast majority of the film's most beautiful and tragic moments. Just as mesmerizing a treatment of ageing and society's reaction to it as a hauntingly poignant character study and introspective analysis of popular entertainment, The Wrestler packs a devastating emotional punch and enough surprises to make up for its predictable narrative arc and periodic excesses of sentiment. For any audiences willing to stomach its bleak and brutal content, Aronofsky's film should be considered compelling and vital viewing. -8.5/10",8,0,0,26 May 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Ape v. Skullcrawler: Kong of Justice
","Hero or foe? Beauty or beast? Poor King Kong and his monstrous cronies have spent decades of hopping back and forth on the morality spectrum, swayed by the ideological whims of their times. But this, to paraphrase the Canadian Prime Minister, is 2017. And lo - our Kong is a benevolent God, leaving no prayer unanswered. Take, for example, those volumes of prayers uttered (with varying degrees of accompanying profanity) after Kong's scaly cousin reared his irradiated head for a grand total of twelve minutes in 2014's dour, insultingly underwhelming Godzilla. Too little monster mash? Too much jingoistic military pandering? And, more than anything, too gosh darn dark, self-important, and serious? Kong, your God, has heard your prayers. And Skull Island is indeed a place where dreams come true. If you're looking for the most evocative translation of a comic book to screen in years, you won't find it in any superhero flick. Instead, indie maverick Jordan Vogt-Roberts fearlessly plunges his directorial hand into the hornet's nest of Kong's pop art potential, and shakes it for all it's worth. Enough striking, stylized candy-coloured panoramas to put Zack Snyder to shame? Check. A smorgasbord of pop culture references, aping (HA!) everything from Platoon to Jurassic Park, Aliens and more, with a playlist vying Guardians of the Galaxy for jukebox infectiousness? Yep. A cabal of established actors as cardboard cutouts running by green screens and gleefully chewing scenery? Definitely. And, most importantly, a f*ck-ton of big monsters smashing into one another? Ohhhh baby, yes. Welcome to your monthly periodical of big-budget pulp. And it is gloriously unapologetic. Kong: Skull Island may not have lofty ambitions, but it accomplishes them with furious gusto. Peter Jackson's 2005 love letter to the eighth wonder of the world devoted almost an hour to pre-island backstory and character developments. Vogt-Roberts jettisons plot in favour of momentum, ramming a comparable amount of preamble into roughly fifteen minutes, largely composed of John Goodman (the right blend of grave and twinkling, but criminally underused) booming out expositional word bubbles that almost serve to gloss over the film's scientific hokum. If 2014's Godzilla felt like a surly military recruitment video, 70s-set Skull Island is its pop-punk cousin - Apocalypse Now's Vietnam critique cut with the obnoxious zippiness of Top Gun. And audiences have to patiently bide their time for a whopping three minutes before the titular behemoth triumphantly crashes onto the scene. If you listen carefully over the ensuing spontaneous rounds of cheering, you might just hear Gareth Edwards face- palming from the back of the cinema. As for the 'let them fight' factor? Let's just say that no one could argue Vogt-Roberts squandered his $185 million, as he seldom makes audiences wait through an entire scene without dangling a new show-stopping creature feature in front of them. Painstakingly etched with impressively credible CGI, his monsters don't crawl out of the woodwork - they ARE the woodwork, a menagerie of rapturously inventive, Miyazaki-inspired giant insects, implausibly antlered behemoths, skulking krakens, frenzied pterosaurs, and the monster-du-jour 'Skullcrawlers,' who are fearfully unique enough to not feel callously expendable. Oh, and that Kong guy? Never cooler. From his unprecedentedly imposing stature to each strand of fur and dribble of spit rendered with impeccable care, Kong. Is. King. And these monsters don't just fight - they FIGHT, thrashing each other with phenomenal energy, menace, and ingenuity, with no nearby foliage or debris safe from being thrown into the fray, as Henry Jackman's thunderously kitschy score provides a delightfully melodramatic backdrop. Most importantly? No infuriating pieces of foreground set c*ck-blocking the fun. And yet, for a movie so assuredly dumb, Skull Island is surprisingly beautiful, with more boundless, lush natural panoramas, craggy cliffs, and dazzling, Life of Pi-riffing Aurora Borealis than you can shake a stomped cephalopod at. This visual feast may be more of a all-you-can-eat buffet of spectacle gluttony, but it's money deliriously well-spent. And the actual humans who occasionally, irksomely, pop up? Well, it's here that tolerance for Vogt-Roberts' commitment to B-movie storytelling is really tested. Jubilantly one-note and generally obstinately committed to ludicrous character motivations (one 'Let's go save Kong!' reversal reduced our cinema to outright unsolicited chuckles), the cast are gamely committed to taking the silliness seriously. Tom Hiddleston may smoulder like a pro, but his generic action hunk is so superfluous he could be lopped out of the film without affecting the plot in the slightest. And hey - that'd leave more breathing room for poor Oscar winner Brie Larson, trying her best to flex her jaunty charisma amidst the din. Still, din requires shouters, and, therein, none compare to Samuel L. Jackson, who outdoes his propensity to never let daft material clip his wings, spitting out an obsessive, antagonistic bent to his volcanic magnetism, complete with one of the best seething glowers in cinema history. Though toeing the line of too many characters, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Toby Kebbell, and Shea Wingham all breathe enough energy and personality into their requisite grunts to avoid being expendable monster fodder. Still, we're all waiting for the indescribably hilarious John C. Reilly to breeze in and waltz away with the picture as a stranded, samurai sword-brandishing WWII vet/goldmine of bug-eyed goofiness, side-splitting non- sequiturs ('Hey, did we win the war?'), and actual, unexpected, emotional arc. He's an almost questionably Looney Tunes addition, but Reilly's confident zaniness is almost as worth it as Kong himself.If Legendary is priming their own monstrous Avengers, Kong: Skull Island is its Captain America: The First Avenger - period-set, and bursting with irreverent, bombastic nostalgic fun. And hey - if he beckons in an era of equally rambunctious, unapologetic B-movie blockbusters that don't skimp on quality, Kong is a kind and fair God indeed. Place your gladiatorial bets for 2020 - and eat it, Batman v. Superman! -8/10",8,3,6,14 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," 'Very terrible'
","In December 2003, a generation wept, heartbroken from saying goodbye to the beloved realm of Middle-Earth, which had redefined cinematic potential and captured their hearts for three consecutive years. In December 2014, they wept again – this time from the bitter relief that the embarrassing, bloated, fecal cash-cow zombification calling itself The Hobbit was finally putting itself out of their collective misery. But Hobbit III (a sentence retch-worthy in itself) didn't go down quietly. The Battle of the Five Armies is more drunken fart than film – a gaudy, criminally soulless, grossly excessive, abrasively stupid waste of time and space, and a final spit in the face of Jackson's timeless Lord of the Rings legacy. And you thought Morgul blades were painful.If there's any whiff of sense to be found in this reeking pile of troll dung, it lies in its mid-film tangent involving Dwarf King Thorin's descent into 'dragon sickness.' Wandering the halls of his barren mountain fortress, murmuring dementedly while idly fumbling pieces of gold, and eventually hallucinating being swallowed up by the floor melting into a noxious puddle of golden goo (one of the film's idly engaging sequences), Thorin , intentionally or not, provides a pristine metaphor for Peter Jackson, drowning in his (and New Line's) gluttonous financial folly. In terms of profundity – heck, even quality – that's it, though. And I mean IT. After a jarring opening of Cumberbatch's Smaug torching Lake Town, yet another prospectively cool sequence marred by abominably stupid Benny Hill chase choreography, Jackson settles in for an abominable sludge of 'tension' (aka: stalling). If, by tension, we mean our universally dull characters repetitively braying inane lines at one another in a facsimile of military strategy filtered through despicable preschool social politics. For a change of pace, 'comedic relief' is provided by Lake Town's insufferable unibrowed asshat (I refuse to learn his name; it's more attention than he deserves) making not one. Not two. But three crass drag jokes with a Monty Python 'lady voice.' Yes, this is what $250 million went towards.Another interlude has the stunt doubles of Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and poor Christopher Lee blandly waving at the CGI apparition of a Sauron who looked more credible in 2001 (and if you think this is insultingly blatant LOTR 'universe-building', just wait until the film's conclusion). Meanwhile, snoring Lee Pace rides a CGI moose in circles as Luke Evans' Bored-sorry-Bard and Thorin frown at each other through a hole in the wall in a sequence undoubtedly meant to be nail-biting, but is instead accidentally hilarious. And then, as if exhausted by all this (in)action, Jackson makes us wait. Again.But don't worry – you'll get your battle. And therein you'll discover yet another level of disappointment, as the blurry cacophony of CGI blobs crashing into other CGI blobs proves even more boring than the waiting – just with more noise. Thrill, as nearly an hour of intolerable din manages to continually get worse. And worse. And worse. If there's an action cliché Jackson failed to throw in to this pukestew, you probably just missed it taking place in the background somewhere behind the bleating of a terrifyingly plasticine CGI Billy Connolly and the two interchangeable bad orc blobs providing dull play-by-plays like a rubbery Statler and Waldorf. See: Jackson hammer the 'hero whisks in at the last minute to save a comrade from mortal peril' button roughly 5000 times (that's barely hyperbole). See: gratuitously overused Legolas auditioning for Wicked by defyyyyyyyying gravity, hopping up a crumbling wall like an 8-bit Super Mario ripoff. See: Jackson's Tremors ripoff giant worms be momentarily cool, before, naturally, disappearing with no explanation. See: the one unexpectedly clever and hilarious moment in the thoroughly unanticipated Thorin vs. Azog showdown be entirely marred by yet another 'oh no! he's not dead' comeback so telegraphed it redefines the word 'insulting.' Meanwhile, as our heroes toddle around bumping into the abominable results of Weta's creature designers getting bored (my favourite: a four-peg-legged behemoth I unaffectionately dubbed 'Pogo Troll'), we cover our ears, grimacing with sheer loathing, as we await the deus-eagles-machina to make the suffering stop.Oh – did I forget to take a pot-shot at the worst cinematic love story of the century (keeping in mind this is a century that's produced Twilight, 50 Shades of Grey, and 'Brutasha')? I did? Well, um it's still really, really awful. Sorry. I'd be wittier, but I think Pogo Troll kicked out the last two brain cells I had left.Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen try. Oh lord, they try. But they're inexcusably saddled to supporting characters in their own movie, while we instead fret away with dwarfs whose hairstyles we've been leering at for eight and a half hours, but still don't know the names or personalities of (I'd point out that in Lord of the Rings Jackson established characters within 1-2 sentences, but you knew that already). If you needed more reasons to despise this film, just remember that the shoot isolated Ian McKellen amongst so many green screens that he literally broke down and sobbed in despair. That's right – Peter Jackson made Gandalf cry. Let the hate flow through you.But then: Billy Boyd's gorgeous voice brings us out of the darkness, and reminds us of the beauty that once was Middle-Earth. No, you're crying.If Jackson intended his third Hobbit as a surreal, scathing piece of performance art, exploring just how bad a film can be while still earning unbelievable amounts of money, he's a perverse genius. Otherwise, there aren't enough negative adjectives in the world to properly describe its filth. You'd think this kind of flagrant, campy mess could find triumph as an ironic cult classic, but it's too abrasively preening to even hate-watch without disdain overruling. Ultimately, Tolkien himself pre-emptively provided the film's perfect epitaph: 'It was called the Battle of the Five Armies, and it was very terrible.' -2/10",2,6,9,12 February 2016
Ray," Entirely driven by Foxx's stunning performance
","Jamie Foxx has never ceased to astound us this year. First, a surprisingly powerful supporting performance as Max the cabbie in Michael Mann's Collateral, easily holding his own against Tom Cruise and drawing strong support from us as the film's protagonist. Already there was Oscar talk. But now, Jamie Foxx's potential seems to have been fully unchained with his staggeringly perfect (and I don't use the word lightly) performance as Ray Charles Robinson, one of the world's most famous R 'n B singer and pianists. Never once do we question whether Foxx is creating a decent portrait of Charles or not - for the entire duration of the film, he quite literally 'is' Ray. Never once does he slip up, or falter to hold up his uncanny depiction - we see him play piano as Ray; dancing around in his seat and hugging himself afterwards included, we see him walk as Ray, and I think it's safe to say that a depiction of blind movement has never been so lifelike. (although in all fairness, Jamie Foxx wore prosthetics in his eyes while shooting, which essentially rendered him blind, so it wasn't that much of a stretch for him) We see him as Ray go through a hidden heroin addiction, and a devastating withdrawal. We see Ray as he struggles with trying to balance his belief in a stable family where the father loves and provides for his wife and children and his infidelities on the road performing. We fully get the sense that throughout all his fame and fortune, Ray Charles never really knew who he was, until he finally found the courage to face himself and find out. We quite literally get the sensation of living life alongside Ray Charles, and all the ups and downs included.Director Taylor Hackford skillfully blends flashbacks with present, while flashing newspaper headlines and articles throughout Ray's musical journey, which serve to fill most of the plot gaps and jumps that pop up ever once and a while throughout the film. Rightfully so, he knows that the story revolves around Ray, so he, in turn, lets the film revolve around Foxx and his stunning performance, which was definitely the wise thing to do. Foxx is almost never offscreen, which is good, because it's his talent that keeps us interested in what would otherwise be a rather slow moving and occasionally uneven film. But it does indeed give us a painstakingly accurate, if somewhat condensed, sense of the life of Ray Charles: all his ups and downs, triumphs and failures, happiness and sorrow. And with Foxx's uncanny performance driving the film, the occasional plot slip up can easily be overlooked, ending up with a very satisfying film.-8.5/10",8,1,3,24 January 2005
Sherlock Holmes," While it may not think (or detect) as hard as it thwacks, the cheeky sense of thrills and fun makes Ritchie's Holmes a delight nonetheless
","From the moment of its conception, Guy Ritchie's self-declared 'rough and tough' take on the world's most famous detective has been no stranger to controversy. Between its casting of an American as Arthur Conan Doyle's timeless character to the reimagining of the decidedly cerebral series as a vehicle for comedy action, sidelining the mystery and sleuthing facets, it has seemed that the film's publicity has been fated to devoting as much time to justifying itself as promoting. Nonetheless, while debates regarding the film's action slant remain largely a matter of personal taste, there can be little question that, if taken as is, Ritchie's film offers a tremendous concoction of qualities seldom before associated with a Holmes film: a fast paced, tastefully witty and exhilarating bundle of thrills and dashes of mystery, whose greatest strength (unlike most of its predecessors) is its refusal to take itself overly seriously, instead opting for a welcome, freewheeling sense of fun.That the film is hardly as profound as it could be is unmistakable, and it is true that the oversimplified plot could easily have merited from an infusion of much more mystery and complexity, with most plot twists being largely predictable and the climactic wrap-up becoming a bit silly, lost in a mess of pseudo-scientific jargon and Deus-Ex-Machina (as well as a sequel-baiting teaser ending what somewhat oafishly apes Batman Begins' more tasteful finish). Nonetheless, it is hardly the case that the film has no brain to back up its brawn, as the screenplay, while offering the odd contrived patch, deftly winds the action together with skill and class, underpinning the central narrative with intriguing thematic veins involving the onset of industrialization and the 'new age' of London nearing the turn of the century. There is even a feasible justification for the inclusion of the gleefully vicious fight scenes and elaborate choreography through the ingenious touch of Holmes logically planning out each move in the ensuing fight through voice-over, making the gruesome mayhem which follows feel appropriate rather than superficial.Of course any film directed by Guy Ritchie could hardly be found to be lacking on the style front, and despite Sherlock Holmes being easily his most mainstream effort to date, his characteristic flair is not lost in the transition. Ritchie's 19th century London is a gorgeously gloomy and murky creation, with each cobblestone street and seedy alley dripping with Gothic ambiance. Ritchie similarly shows a distinct skill in pacing, astutely abstaining from any clunky, unnecessary character introductions and instead plunging the audience straight into the action and keeping the pace brisk throughout while allowing for plenty of quieter (and often amusing) character moments in between pulsing action sequences. Capped by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer's plucky and energetic musical score which excellently compliments the overall tone, the quality components amassed make the film, simplistic or not, feel far more than a guilty pleasure.Nonetheless, it is clear that the heart of the film lies with the incomparable Robert Downey Jr. as the titular detective and Jude Law as his stoic partner Watson. Apart from pitch perfect, charismatic characterizations (superbly counterbalancing Holmes' flamboyant eccentricities with Watson's icy sarcasm and composure), the two demonstrate the most hugely enjoyable interplay and 'buddy-banter' seen in ages, and their interplay alone makes the film worth a watch. Unfortunately Rachel McAdams falls below par, her disappointingly flat performance lacking the necessary venom or sultry spark to make her femme fatale Irene Adler function, let alone come across as convincing as an adversary for Holmes (especially considering Downey Jr.'s typically grandiose and nuanced work in comparison). In contrast, Mark Strong is effectively spectral as occult-dabbling aristocrat Lord Blackwood, and while his character may feel underused, Strong hisses and looms his way into a memorable presence nonetheless. Finally, Eddie Marsan glowers with typical class as perpetual foil Inspector Lestrade.While the film may not do too much in the way of taxing the viewer's intellect nor offer much of a mystery akin to Conan Doyle's classics, there remains an elusive something about the sight of Downey Jr. whimsically plucking a violin, piecing together abstract elements into a cohesive narrative while greeted by Law's world-weary frown that nonetheless leaves the viewer with a firm sense of the essence of the classic detective tales remaining intact, albeit with a scrappy sense of humour, thrills and self-effacing fun. In fact, Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes feels somehow appropriately attuned to the concerns of the time of its release: somewhat under-thought but reflective nonetheless, all the while rapidly propelling itself along and shooting for enjoyment rather than long term resonance. But with enjoyment of such a high class, seasoned calibre, it is resoundingly hard to object, and Ritchie's film accomplishes its goal of unabashed entertainment with undeniable success.-8/10",8,0,2,21 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," Too much like the agency it portrays: slow, murky, unclear and emotionally distant
","Speaking as a viewer who had been eagerly anticipating the release of this movie since way back in the days when Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to star, I can honestly say I was very disappointed in the final outcome. Perhaps the film had simply become too hyped, with everyone proudly boasting it as 'De Niro's comeback', but... suffice to say, no matter how hard I tried to enjoy this movie, it completely failed to entice me in any way, shape or form. Director Robert De Niro tries a bold new touch by attempting a 'CIA feel' for the film, in the sense that an element of mystery is present throughout the entire plot, attempting to better immerse us in the world of lies, deception and uncertainty that was the early CIA. Unfortunately, this method backfires very noticeably, as the plot seems to weave all over the place and we are presented with flat, uninteresting characters who are denied the further development or screen time which might actually have made them appealing. We are simply presented with a slew of famous faces in tiny roles, appearing and disappearing so quickly we barely have the chance to register their presence, but there is no connection with the characters, nor the long, overly confusing convoluted plot they play a part in. But the film's real weakness is the apathy factor. In a recent interview, De Niro acknowledged his intent that the plot should be more elusive and less obvious, to make the viewer work harder and appreciate the film further. He then proceeded to mention how viewers should be emotionally affected and connect with the characters, even if the plot may not always be clear, and we may not always what's going on, or who's killing who, or why. This is where De Niro's film really loses its viewers; the fact that not only is there not enough emotional connection to coast by, ignoring a lack of plot continuity, but the fact that there is no emotional connection whatsoever. Not only do we not know what is going on, nor are able to keep up fast enough to catch onto what few plot clues we may, but we can't invest enough interest into the film to do so. After a few scenes of brief, murky, unexplained and unrelated plot excerpts and confusing flashbacks from present to past times (made more difficult by the fact that James Wilson, Matt Damon's character never seems to age, and appears the same even 20 years later) we lose interest entirely, and find ourselves unable to care for the characters, nor care what is happening. We are kept at such a distance, both through an intentionally unclear plot and by uninteresting flat archetypes of characters that any interest we might originally have retained in the film quickly evaporates. It's a shame that the film is so emotionally distancing though, as on the exterior it does appear to be a very stylish and classy piece of work. The cinematography is superb, capturing many unique, innovative shots and scenes, and the costume and set design are simply sumptuous, perfectly capturing the feel of the time period in a glossy, picturesque fashion. It is a shame how fully the apathy factor permeates the film though, because Eric Roth's script seems to be terse, tight, and engaging, but many lines are inaudible through muttering or fast speaking characters, and we are simply kept at such an emotional distance it is beyond us to make an effort to follow the rapid fire, confusing exchanges. We want to like the script, but it is so twisty and clouded with uncertainty, much like a CIA document itself, that we find ourselves also left in the dark. De Niro has assembled a stellar cast here, but he seems content to reduce most of them to very un-flashy cameos, giving us little chance to connect with any of the characters. Matt Damon is an effective figure as the film's star, James Wilson, remaining admirably cold, detached and stoic throughout the film, but the plot backfires once again - a lead character who is meant to be, all pretenses aside, boring, still comes across as boring, no matter how strongly they are played. Angelina Jolie seems a bit out of place as Wilson's spunky yet abandoned wife; she plays the part well enough, but fails to submerge her star power and charisma in a role where a much less noticeable and subdued female lead would've been far more effective. John Turturro stands out as a vicious CIA interrogator, one of the few flashes of emotion or engaging character action in the entire film, and Joe Pesci makes good use of his far too brief cameo as a mob boss. There are also noteworthy appearances by Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Tammy Blanchard and Timothy Hutton, but their parts are reduced to far too brief and uninteresting segments for us to really connect with or care about their characters. De Niro himself almost steals the show with a tiny role as a military general who constantly complains about his feet. All in all, the Good Shepherd comes across as a tremendous disappointment, considering the incredibly successful film it was poised to be. Maybe I had too many expectations, having looked forward to the movie for so long, or maybe the film was overly hyped, but either way, the film falls flat as far too long, self indulgent, emotionally distancing and just plain uninteresting, wrapped together in a bundle of self-imposed apathy. All except for fans of Robert De Niro or the rest of the cast willing to sit through an extremely long and un-engaging movie should give this one a pass, lest De Niro's self confidence be flattened forever. -6/10",6,8,9,25 January 2007
Arrival," Kangaroo
","'Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating,' scoffs Jim Carrey's lovelorn protagonist in 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He'd get right along with Amy Adams' linguistics specialist, Dr. Louise Brooks, from Denis Villeneuve's Arrival. Like Eternal Sunshine, it's a elegant, grounded but stylized portrait of grief and profound communication breakdowns amidst an almost-plausible science-fiction landscape. However, Villeneuve's film also makes its mark as one of the most haunting, introspective, and tautly, fiendishly clever films of the last several years. Like most of the best sci-fi, Arrival is not really 'about' the aliens it introduces (don't worry, that's not a spoiler), but rather what they draw out in the humans whose lives they enigmatically appear in sans explanation. Their monolithic, oblong spaceships peppering the planet not only contribute to the pantheon of evocative sci-fi imagery, but also serve as handy ciphers for social commentary. To many, they're instantly a threat, or superfluous beyond their potential for extraterrestrial weaponization (or both), and there's a chortle to be had in how unsurprising it is the film plays out amidst the cradle of stifling U.S. military bureaucracy. But screenwriter Eric Heisserer also neatly weaves in the story of Dr. Brooks, anchoring the macro conflict on her own personal interactions with the aliens as a focal point and refuge from her own almost vegetative loneliness and grief. He and Villeneuve allow Brooks' own drama to teasingly dance amidst the global histrionics, with the key conflict not being the extraterrestrials demanding to be taken to our leader, but our wishing we shared the vocabulary to express such sentiments beyond the mysterious Rorschach test ink blots they spew, like union negotiations told through smoke rings. Fittingly, in a film revolving around communication, Villeneuve is coy about showing his film's thematic and narrative hand too early. Planting firmly in the Close Encounters of the Third Kind school of mature, muted sci-fi, Villeneuve practically cackles with delight in exploiting every (good) trick in nonlinear storytelling book, using masterful editing to unspool wrinkles of story that carry unexpected waves of devastation and devastating hope. Here, Heisserer's screenplay is clever to a fault in its lean simplicity, finding power and poignancy in stark images (Brooks reveals that the Chinese military have been teaching the aliens to communicate through mah-jong, thereby establishing an inherently adversarial dynamic), with even certain lines that initially play as clunky instead proving to be red herrings, retroactively revealed as urgent clues and secret foreshadowing. It's unquestionably a slow-burner, with Villeneuve's pacing remaining firmly steady throughout, which, at times, grates against the brewing sociopolitical state of emergency, and a clinical feel that at times verges on excessively emotionally sterile. Still, the film's masterfully precise technical prowess alone makes the film worth viewing in cinemas. Bradford Young's dreamily gliding cinematography, composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's whimsically, playfully twinkling score, and some of the most unerringly spot-on sound editing in recent memory (to say nothing of the gorgeous scenic filming locations) all conflate to establish a blanket of eerie serenity amidst the global chaos. It's a fishbowl feeling that Villeneuve stirs from restlessness into deliberate claustrophobia in the final act, but, by gosh, if an audience is to be trapped in a fishbowl, it may as well be a fishbowl as beautiful as this. Many leading actors working amidst such old-school sci-fi would have succumbed to the temptation to punch up the disquieting calmness with heavy-handed scene- stealing. Thankfully, Amy Adams is a far wiser and intuitive performer than that. Her work here is exceptional in its quietness, her subtle ebb of emotions throughout seeping into the viewer like a gentle rain flecked with the lightning surges of her perilously fleeting interactions with her daughter. She abjectly avoids any Oscar- baiting melodrama in favour of simply embodying Brooks like a comfortable slipper, making it one of the most affecting and truthful performances of a woman in pain we've seen in some time. Conversely, Jeremy Renner gives a sturdy performance throughout, but he's so bland and indistinct that his casting as a character too easily regulated to expositional fountain is instantly forgettable. Nonetheless, Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg each excel at no-nonsense resonance as the commander and PR exec of the governing military, their strained and often contradictory grimness exposing the lion's share of social commentary. 'What is your purpose here?' is the guiding question for Brooks and her team. Arrival's is far less reticent. It's a story about a mother and her daughter. It's a story about a planet learning to listen. And it's a story about how time and love are the only truly reliable concepts, but not necessarily in that order. Like its depicted otherworldly visitors, Arrival is distinctly odd and discomfortingly tranquil, but stirringly mesmerizing, supremely clever, and surprisingly rewarding. Most of all, it's unassumingly unforgettable, and primed to take its place amidst the great science- fiction of the era. -9/10",9,1,3,26 January 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Shamelessly uplifting; a heartfelt classic
","It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time. Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning. It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple 'prison drama', the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free. -10/10",10,4,6,12 December 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Caw or (Knock Knock Knock)
","How the hell'd we wind up here.Trite, cursory internet film criticism. Smells like balls.Look at you – all ready to go on gushing about how much you love this movie. Having the audacity to think of it as 'intimate' and 'personal' just because it combines all of your 'favourite things': superheroes, theatre, Fellini-pastiche surrealism, Raymond Carver, long takes, drumming, and in-jokes that make you feel smart because you've heard the name Roland Barthes before. There's even a Robert Downey Jr. joke. Because he played Iron Man. Get it? Oh yes. You're so original. Aren't you clever. Aren't you special.No. You're a loser. You're washed up. Worthless. Just like that hack Iñárritu, who thinks he can prance from pretentious sob-fests like Babel and Biutiful to this piece of self-glorifying artsy trash. He thinks he can make fun of popular things and have everyone love him for it, that reminding everyone that actors are ridiculous is his meal ticket to even more critical success. And you're going to buy into it, and call this his 'masterpiece?' Pathetic.You probably think it's so clever he cast that dirtbag, Keaton, and smugly bite your tongue from pointing out how deliciously meta that is, because not stating the obvious makes you seem smarter. You'd probably go as far as to call it some kind of 'a gleefully satirical commentary on our times,' or use impressive turns of phrase like 'an elegiac rumination on the dichotomy between artistry and populism in a media-oversaturated postmodern epoch'. You WOULD call it hilarious, devastating, and riveting, and get off on 'discussing the increasingly anxious, claustrophobic blurring of fantasy and reality' with your nerd friends. Wipe that stupid grin off your face when you think about Birdman yelling into the camera about how audiences love violence and action; I don't care how much it reflected your lame sensibilities. You were probably even stunned to silence by that pointless ending, just sitting there, your tiny brain overwhelmed, with the word 'perfect' bouncing around your head. You probably even laughed at the cheap underwear gag, like a sap.Ohoho, you DID, didn't you? You're more shameful than I thought. You little worm. now you're preparing a pithy comeback about how you are a worm, who was devoured by the experience of Birdman? You disgust me.Look at yourself. You were made for more than this. Sounding off, namelessly, facelessly, on the internet, about a film you loved so much that it broke your feeble little heart when the rest of the world loved it too and it won all of those rigged (Riggan. Get it? I can be witty too. Like Birdman) Oscars because it ruined your hipster cred of loving the little superhero spoof that could. You could have had the whole world at your feet if you hadn't wasted eleven years knocking off internet movie reviews in your basement instead of doing anything of value. You criminal waste of space. And no, cackling like a fiend at Lindsay Duncan's venomous theatre critic in Birdman doesn't make it better. You're still a failure.Oh – but let's not forget to list all the little things in this little movie that made your little brain feel so many feelings. You could write an essay on Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, and how it's so 'lively', 'effervescent', and 'innovative', positioning the audience as a ghost tramping alongside Keaton, watching him steadily fray to pieces (maybe we ARE the scary voice in his head. Does that make us Birdman? Ooooooh. Complex). You probably only love the long takes because you can smarmily compare them to Hitchcock's Rope from 1948. And let's not forget the drumming. You love drums, so you've probably convinced yourself the drum score is the haunting 'heartbeat' of the film – engrossing, hypnotic, ingeniously sparse. I bet you walked home from the theatre with spectral drumming in your head, trying to graft some second-hand meaning onto your useless life. Of course you did. Why am I surprised? It's not like you could be any tackier.have you really sunk to individually praising the actors embarrassed enough to show their faces in this filth? Oh yes – casting actors from superhero movies like Edward Norton and Emma Stone is so terribly droll. You'd probably call their mugging here 'inspired,' that Norton is a 'hysterical live-wire of self-parody,' and that Stone doesn't just sulk like a petulant pre-teen – no, she gives 'the most ferociously raw and honest performance of her career.' Ugh. You probably thought that mug Galifianakis is so restrained and witty here, and that Naomi Watts, Amy Ryan, and Andrea Riseborough aren't just whiny caricatures – they're elegantly emotional. Right. And Keaton. Michael Keaton. You're just aching to call him Hollywood's comeback glory boy, as if lampooning his own sad career is so fearless. But you know better, I'm sure. You see a fiery light in his buggy eyes, like he's disturbingly in-tune with Riggan's madness. To you, he's probably tapped into an almost transcendent form of performance, and that his quirky twitches, manic braying and goofball staring into space is somehow a window into the human soul, or some drivel like that. We all know he's a Hollywood clown, so obvious and forced it makes me sick. But hey – look who's talking.Oh. I forgot. Birdman is 'flooring, virtually flawless, and the most gripping, hilarious, fiendishly intelligent parable of the year – nay, of many years.' This is REAL ART. Like it's not a pedantic, overblown student film passing itself off as a modern masterpiece to all the sheep too stupefied to object. Whatever. You dote on your silly film. I have better things to do. Like wallow in my own filth. Just pump it out and get on with your pointless existence. Scum.-10/10",10,0,2,30 July 2015
Wonder Woman," Worth waiting for (Godot)
","In 2015, the post-credits zinger for Marvel's Ant-Man had Evangeline Lily's heroine, the Wasp, promised her own super suit. Her retort: 'It's about damn time.' The world echoed her sentiments. And waited. But alas: you snooze you lose, Marvel. Wonder Woman is here, loud, proud, heartfelt, and almost absurdly fun. Not to mention: in the super-super-saturated cinemas of late, it's the first female-led superhero film in 13(?!) years? Suddenly Wasp's pithy barb feels like the understatement of the century. If we're going to continue to play the Marvel card (and we should, for Wonder Woman is more akin to the MCU's bright, mischievously fun fare than any of its sombre, melodramatic, ludicrously unironic DC precedents), director Patty Jenkins magpies the best bits of Captain America and Thor into a robustly satisfying romp. It's a lot to juggle, simultaneously sating the twin bastions of feminism and fun in the rare superhero film expected to be About Something, but Jenkins, drawing upon nearly 80 years of fandom and iconography, is rightly confident. Her social commentary streak is as hearty as her flair for fun, and she gamely plunges into the film's WWI setting as a potent vehicle for one of the genre's most potent explorations of the ethics of action combat. Jenkins juxtaposing the sparking, saturated sapphire colour scheme of Diana's Amazon island with the sepia soot on the war-torn outside world (and just when we'd been enjoying a welcome break from the gloomy DC greysÂ… sigh) succinctly feeds into Diana's indictment of human cruelty. A superhero film sincere enough to advocate for empathy and benevolent compassion instead of revenge, justice, or simply violence? It's a core moral streak so puppy-eyed and earnest it would verge on cornball were it not sold with a ferocious fervour heartfelt enough to trigger twinges of guilty reflection in between bites of popcorn. And that's nothing to sneeze at. But, paradoxically, in spite of this effective call for compassionÂ… there's almost never been a movie where watching someone punch things has felt so goddamn awesome. Jenkins uncorks action interludes with a zippy abandon, as balletic as they are concussively cathartic, so stupendously fun that you shouldn't be surprised to see audience members unconsciously swept to their feet with the infectious, heady momentum (Robin Wright, in particular, nearly steals the show with a functional cameo just by making ass-kicking in a leather miniskirt look so ferociously cool). Paired with the crisply perfect period wartime dÃ©cor, and especially when accompanied by her exhilarating and impossibly catchy guitar riff, Wonder Woman is the first superhero film in years where the fight scenes, rather than merely pleasant diversions, are moving, almost overwhelmingly endorphin-flooding experiences. The mere memory of Diana crumbling a clock tower or flattening a roof with single blows, or granted her very own Ã‰owyn moment by storming into no man's land (get it?) is enough to bring shivers of magnificence.And that's when the shoe drops, and the 'women only Texas screening'-shaped elephant in the room rears its head: we've had decades for the exuberance of men hitting things to wear off. Wonder Woman reminds us of how much fun it can be to watch WOMEN hitting things, and how desperately rare it is. Mercilessly scrutinized under the gender policing microscope, Jenkins, cannily, doesn't oversell her gender politics. Instead, she calmly naturalizes them by steering the film through Diana's headstrong, take-no-sh*t character, with each feminist beat emerging naturally through her personality. It's oodles more effective than any polarizing, dogmatic diatribe, and yields many of the film's moments of sneaky humour. One aside in particular, where an exasperated Diana condemns petticoats and skirts for impeding high-kicks, instantly cements itself as an iconic reprieve of solidarity for women's dressing rooms for the next century. Still, a Wonder Woman film would be moot without the right Gal in the lead. Here, it's indisputably clear that it's been worth waiting for Godot. Anchored by a tempestuous, fiery charisma, Godot's remarkable performance is just as unforgettable in her small moments of zealous humanity (her almost childlike indignation at a war counsel willing to abandon soldiers as a strategic coup, or equivalent jubilation when tasting ice cream for the first time) as she is fiercely convincing tossing tanks or bridling enemies with a glowing lasso. Supporting her, Chris Pine is at his most disarmingly hysterical and irreverently lovable here, and provides a welcome anchoring of incredulous realism when the film threatens to topple into being too steeped in mythology. Danny Huston's Red Skull clone hits all the requisite skulking, ominously pontificating adversarial notes, but he's nowhere near as interesting as Elena Anayu's luridly sinister and tragic Dr. Poison, who, disappointingly, is relegated to sidekick status. Thankfully, Diana's remarkably diverse cabal of 'Howling Commandos' pals remain on the right side of fun without overstaying their welcome (though Ewen Bremner is just one bug-eyed nibble of haggis away from belonging in a live action cartoon). Finally, David Thewlis' droll prissiness perfectly befits Diana's befuddled ambassador to the human world, even if his range isn't quite up for the challenge plot twists demand of him. Wonder Woman isn't perfect â€“ there are expanses when Jenkins' juggernaut pacing fumbles (especially an overlong expository origin governed by an overbearingly dour Connie Nielsen), and it toes the line of being a touch too derivative, leaning on its superhero predecessors so liberally that key emotional moments threaten to belly flop from over-familiarity. Still, it's only a fleeting wobble of tentativeness and creative laziness, that only serves to reinforce Robin Wright's advice: Wonder Woman is at its (/her) best when she truly believes in herself. Still, when Godot is armoured up, flashing her gauntlets and kicking through walls, the film achieves an almost peerless sense of infectious awesomeness. Will its legacy abide? Well, I'll let the waves of young girls (and boys!) jump-kicking and slamming their forearms together when stampeding out of the auditorium of my screening speak for themselves. -9/10",9,5,13,22 June 2017
Back to the Future Part II," Looking back from the Future to Back to the Future
","October 21, 2015 – the faithful date at which point the present became the future, and, as of now, the past. Head hurting yet? That's okay, as there has never been so seamless a blending of nostalgia and time travel as in Robert Zemeckis' breezily legendary adventure saga. Interestingly, Parts I and II often get lumped together in the public unconsciousness – fair enough, as Part II operates in part as a 'Greatest Hits' recap of the first. Still, it's fairly important to distinguish, as, temporal overlap aside, Part II is very much its own animal – and not always in a pleasant way. The film is essentially a three act, and, correspondingly, three-time affair. Act 1, 'The Future' (aka: the part that everyone remembers), is thoroughly in the vein of the original – a vivaciously animated affair, chock full with fun, sci-fi escapism. Of course, as we now inhabit the realm of 'the future', this comes with the added pleasure of compiling lists of 'things they got right' and 'things they overestimated' (I'm still waiting for my hoverboard, let alone flying car – where the '80s-futurism fashion aesthetic sits is still up for grabs). Here, Zemeckis' imagination goes into wacky overdrive, with clever gags aplenty (the 3D Jaws 19 – 'This time it's really, REALLY personal' is priceless, while the 'antique store' is funny for an entirely different reason now that cassette tapes qualify as such) and a hoverboard chase that could have been ripped from Part I, while allowing Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson to totter around in aging prosthetics as their 'future selves' is worth a giggle or two. Yes, there's a blip of eyebrow-raising discomfort at opening the film with Doc drugging protagonist Marty McFly's girlfriend Jennifer (this time, Elizabeth Shue – did anyone notice the switcharoo?) and abandoning her, unattended, by a dumpster (umm), but the flux capacitor is otherwise cranked firmly to 'zany' here. And hey – anything with cameos from Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and baby Elijah Wood in his first acting role can only be awesome. It's really quite a shame we don't get more time here (ha), as it's in this beginning segment that the film really soars. But then: as the film leaps back to its (alternate) past, there's not such much of a tonal shift as a paradigm shift. Suddenly, we're in the midst of a disconcerting It's a Wonderful Life tribute on steroids - a dark, hellish wasteland of derelict housing, surly bikers, and imposing, sinister casinos, masterminded by Biff's deranged Donald Trump doppelgänger (who, yes, even in the 80s, was based on Donald Trump- the film's most chilling prophecy). Candy-coloured, whizz-bang adventure aside, the Back to the Future saga was never wholeheartedly saccharine - there's always been resonantly somber stuff about aging, bullying, and going through life perennially unsatisfied to chew on. Still, in this dark pit of coercive, abusive marriages, corruption, and murder, all played oddly nonchalantly, it's no wonder that the recurring 'What are you – chicken?' gag loses its gas when juxtaposed with a sequence of McFly sobbing in a cemetery. Yeah - didn't remember all that, did you? I didn't think so. The sad truth is that the film as a whole can't justify such a distressingly macabre tangent. Most other It's a Wonderful Life spin-offs are careful to provide plenty of joy to counteract and contextualize their dark diversions. Here, we're stranded with preciously few of the iconic cheerful bits of Part I (no Huey Lewis and the News here), leaving little to latch onto. Even the final third, retreading the 50s-set jauntiness of its predecessor, is really more strained and convoluted, shoehorning in too many artificial conflicts, to be as fun or clever as it should be. By the time Zemeckis wraps it up with a 'to be continued' teaser for Part III, it's pretty hard to keep the frustration and feeling of being cheated at bay. Still, it's hard to beat the unquenchable sky-high charisma of the unforgettable double-act of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. While both are largely restricted to forwarding plot pieces than given memorable lines or character beats here, there's still no disputing that Marty McFly and Doc Brown remain among the most beloved and resilient of characters to ever grace the screen (even if the comparative scarcity of Doc here becomes steadily more of a disappointment). What is it a bit more objectionable is the surplus of Thomas F. Wilson's legendary butthead Biff. The larger-than-life, unapologetically awful Biff has always worked best as a foil for the more loopy and cheerful protagonists, but promoting Wilson to principle player here makes his obnoxious negativity more exhausting than enjoyable (although Wilson exploring new dimensions of surreal over-the-top performance as Biff's cybernetically warped descendant Griff in the 2015 segment is always good for a laugh, albeit a vaguely disconcerted one). Thankfully, Back to the Future Part II still upholds enough of the charming whimsy of the first to still provide a raucously entertaining ride, combined with even more brain-teasing time travel trickery to mull over for years to come. It is a shame that, 2015 sequence aside, the film feels more manufactured and becomes so unreasonably dark that it loses a lot of the joy and spontaneity of its predecessor. However, for magnanimous audiences already infatuated with the peerlessly magnetic McFly and Doc Brown, this hop into the DeLorean is likely to provide just as much of a slice of movie magic as you could wish for. -6.5/10",7,1,1,24 October 2015
Carrie," Bloody good
","Quick – picture the scariest, most blood-curdling thing in the world. Don't think – just picture it. An image; a moment; a feeling of such utter mortification, disgust, and soul-chilling repulsion, even tangentially picturing it makes your skin clammy and fills you with dread. Have it? Good. Now, let's compare notes. I'll hazard a guess: it's not vampires, zombies, or ghosts. It's not clowns, axe-murders, or murderous children. It's not falling, being trapped underwater, or in a tight space. It's high school. Yes, it's a profound enough realization to catapult Stephen King from up-and- coming novelist to genre titan, pioneering decades of audiences realizing the true horror was not elaborate fantasies on screen – it lay in the people surrounding them in day-to-day existence, and just how perverse, vindictive, and creatively cruel they could be. And it's a guiding principle that helps Brian De Palma's seminal adaptation of King's fledgling classic persist as more than a schlocky '70s thriller, landing in The Exorcist camp of one of the most deeply disturbing but perversely, sheepishly enjoyable cinematic frights of all time. And that's not even factoring in the blood-drenched mass-murder by telekinesis. De Palma, a director largely acclaimed for style at the expense of substance, here finds the ideal wedding of the two, recognizing that King's parable is all the more gruesomely effective when seen through the heightened, hormonal dizziness of high school. At first glance, we're given the sense he's somewhat sold himself short, as the cheerfully gratuitous credits, featuring a gaggle of spectacularly naked coeds bouncing around a change room, suggest a jocular resignation to the comic book camp of B-horror (B for beeeeewwwbbs, naturally). A subsequent shot of Carrie ambiguously pleasuring herself in the shower, pelted by a playfully ejaculating shower head, is straight out of a porn parody. But then: a spurt of blood, and the shower's gone ice cold, as we're plunged into one of the most chilling openings to a horror film imaginable, as Carrie's histrionics, blindsided by her first period, are trumped by the scarring spectacle of her being pelted with tampons by her hooting, jeering cohort. And then the shoe drops: De Palma, cunningly, has cottoned on to the true horror inherent in King's treatise being the see-sawing of expectations being requited and rebuffed. Initially, horror takes the backseat to satire, as De Palma gleefully lampoons the genre's objectification of female sexuality, and tacks on a deceptively savage incitement of the school system's inability to properly address bullying and mental health concerns (here, Betty Buckley expertly riddles her do-gooder teacher's kindly exchanges with Carrie with pedantic clumsiness and subtle resentment), while sprinkling in visits from Carrie's horrifically deranged mother (and the most distressingly leering Jesus on a crucifix in cinema history) so unhinged they can't help but ring grotesquely emotionally true. The social commentary is tempered somewhat by the slightly out-of-touch 'male writer hypothesizing what it's like to be a high school girl' (not helped by a cast nearly as visibly inappropriately old as Grease), but the cruelty rings hauntingly true. But De Palma changes gears to to full-blown suspense building in the second act. Hardly subtle about his amorous Hitchcock influences (check out the sampling of Psycho's shrieking strings in Pino Donaggio's elegantly bombastic musical score), De Palma treats prom like Hitch's proverbial bomb on the bus - the anticipation, watching every last piece fastidiously click into place, is what makes it horrifying. With sadistic cheerfulness and perfectly steely, squirm-inducing pacing, he cross- cuts between Carrie, audaciously daring to hope she could still integrate with her peers at prom, and her classmates taking a late night jaunt to the slaughterhouse. It's almost unbearably cringe-worthy - pop culture infamy ensures we know exactly what the coup de grace is, but can't quite look away as it painstakingly runs its course. The final blowout itself - a maelstrom of dizzyingly circling cameras, whip- pan zooms, fast-forwards, and split-screens - toes the line of being distractingly stylized, but it's too guiltily, sordidly cathartic a payoff not to drink up. What we don't expect is a climax part II - even more distressingly batsh*t, as Carrie's mother requites the looming Psycho allusions before Carrie - literally - brings the house down. Tack on a jump scare coda that suggests De Palma, smirking, trying to outdo the heart palpitations from his buddy Steve's shark movie, and there's no question we've got a chilling classic on our hands. Sissy Spacek is almost achingly perfect as the titular telekinetic, and there are few cinematic images that convey the writhing claustrophobia of adolescent isolation as her pitifully slumped, dishevelled form. Watching her painstakingly build nuggets of self-confidence, conceiving that her supernatural abilities could be miracles rather than satanic curses, to her beaming, tearful euphoria at being crowned prom queen, are almost too adorable to watch, making her descent into bug-eyed murderousness as heartbreaking as it is chilling. Piper Laurie unquestionably steals the show with a grotesquely fever-pitched tour-de-force as Carrie's fundamentalist mother, all the more titanically detestable upon realization that, idly humming while dragging and locking her daughter in a closet, she genuinely believes she's acting in Carrie's best interests. John Travolta and Nancy Allen are each deliciously awful as Carrie's malevolent bully and her dopey, sadistically eager boyfriend, their caustic banter as funny as the underlying abuse is unsettling, while Luke Skywalker-wannabe William Katt and Amy Irving are each understatedly earnest as the two sheepishly trying to redeem Carrie's year (the ambiguity of Katt's oscillating enthusiasm as Carrie's prom date remains one of the film's most enigmatic touches). Carrie may verge on being overcooked at times, but its blend of visceral imagery, incisive social critique, and bonkers climactic payoff sear its place into the annals of horror history. So go ahead: take Carrie to the prom. You just might not be sorry that you did. -9/10",9,1,1,23 July 2017

","Biographical films always prove a mixed blessing. For every triumphantly realistic (and often awards baiting) performance, there remains a certain cinematically stunted feeling, as if all concerned devoted so much attention to cramming in facts and details of the celebrity's life that the film adapts the feel of a 'greatest hits' version of their life, capturing only selected fragments rather than a cohesive sense of the life or the individual in question. Bearing this in mind leads to a central reason that Stephen Frears' The Queen is such a triumphant undertaking. Rather than adhering to 'biopic' conventions and attempting to capture and condense the life of Queen Elizabeth into a two hour film, writer Peter Morgan selects a limited scope, concentrating on the election of Prime Minister Tony Blair, the death of Princess Diana and the subsequent media frenzy, and the Queen's role and reaction within them. This focus allows for far more depth, nuance and detail to be exposed within the film rather than the usual broad strokes and generalizations, superseding the common structure and making The Queen a fundamentally fascinating watch.At first glance, given the above summary, the film being titled 'The Queen' might appear somewhat misleading, the central focus of the film being primarily dedicated to the re- creation of an almost unmatched media event through the reaction to Princess Diana's death and the political machinations ruminating on the relevance of the Monarchy in a contemporary context. And while the film begs investigation through the lens of its political and socio-cultural dimensions, it can just as easily be approached as a character study of its titular character. In terms of biographical representation, Frears and Morgan's in depth focus of a brief but essential period of her life provides a more telling representation of the Queen herself than any film attempting to cover a truncated version of her entire life could have resulted in. Morgan's fascinatingly complex screenplay fearlessly confronts notions which caused incalculable strife within the country and world in 1997 (and to some extent still do), recurringly focusing on the inescapable role of the media within contemporary government. This begs the question of whether the individuals in positions of power are running the 'people', or whether the masses in question are, by proxy, running their officials, as the public reaction to Diana's death sways the Queen's actions. However Frears and Morgan are exceedingly careful to avoid political bias, simply presenting the events in a dramatic but detached fashion and allowing the audience to complete their own conclusions and judgments. That being said, interesting political parallels are pointedly drawn in reference to contemporary events (near the end, the Queen articulates Blair's attempts to build public support for her as out of fear that someday he might be in a similarly demonised position, to which she responds with a tiny smile, saying 'And you will'), making the film more shrewdly relevant than it might appear at first glance. However, the film's beautifully measured pacing keeps it, like its title character, moving along at a brisk, smooth and continually unflappable pace, intercutting copious documentary footage within the narrative to underline its historical relevance and credibility. The film is also enormously aided by its technical components. Alexandre Desplat's sumptuously grandiose musical score creates a powerful emotional undercurrent without ever once feeling excessive or out of place. Similarly, Affonso Beato's bold, sweeping cinematography adds life and vigour to a potentially overly static drama, with constantly gliding cameras adding a lyrical immediacy to the film.Furthermore, being a highly performance driven work, the fact that the film never once lags or becomes less riveting is just as attributable to the cast's incendiary performances as Frears' masterful directorial pacing and Morgan's impeccable script. Helen Mirren, rightly awarded with a best actress Academy Award, is undeniably outstanding. Taking a character so inextricably etched as highly constructed, performative and unaccustomed to confronting emotions in anything less than a detached, quiet and dignified fashion, Mirren manages to bleed aching silent emotion, credibility and near peerless class from her without breaking stride. Mirren's Queen is never entirely sympathetic nor in any way vilified, but remains consistently a genuine human being, the slightest furrowing of her brow denoting decades of flooring experience and craft. Although the comparison might seem outlandish, Michael Sheen is almost equally superb as newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair, coming across as, eerily like Blair himself, winningly charismatic and sympathetic, yet with a minutely ambiguous exterior suggesting an underlying Machiavellian self-interest beneath the informal charm. James Cromwell also gives a fantastic performance, commanding the screen as Prince Philip, his gruff, unflinching adherence to tradition being poignantly contrasted with Blair's striving for modernity and change. Roger Allam makes powerful use of limited screen time as the Queen's chief secretary, with concern or heated contempt radiating seamlessly from his eyes alone despite a continually impassive, contained exterior. Helen McCrory is a strong presence as Blair's anti-monarchist wife, often articulating crucial truths beneath the public constructions of the principle characters, and Sylvia Syms delivers continual class and wry humour as the Queen Mother. An uncommonly vivid and riveting watch, The Queen functions just as well as an exceedingly honest character study as a poignantly representative political drama and exploration of media presence and power. Fuelled by the exceptional performances by Mirren and the rest of the cast, Morgan's meticulously superb screenplay and Frears' masterful command of the cinematic form, the film supersedes genre conventions and the usual stilted tone, making for a fascinating, highly relevant and lasting watch. Even viewers usually distanced by such a film are highly unlikely to be disappointed, so accessible and rewarding an experience is The Queen. -9/10",9,0,1,5 April 2009
1408," Gripping, albeit conventional throwback to the era of psychological horror
","The word 'horror' has become increasingly twisted in modern cinema to be equated with paper thin excuses for characters being subjected to senseless violence and various cheap shocks intended to make the audience sporadically jump rather than actually be subjected to an all-consuming sense of overwhelming fear. With that in mind, it is refreshing to see a literary adaptation from Steven King, largely considered the godfather of the modern horror story, which resists falling prey to such trappings, and instead concentrates on generating more carefully thought out scares, preying on deep seated societal terrors. As such, director Mikael Håfström's 1408 proves a merciful throwback to the days of psychological horror thrillers, concentrating more on the mind than the bile duct, and a solid enough effort to help re-instigate the initial traits of the genre into the modern mainstream. While the film's premise of a jaded writer (Cusack) with a haunted past attempting to debunk legendary horrific sites having his cynicism tested by unknown forces surrounding an ominous hotel room with a death toll of 57 may sound implausible out of context, the film's execution is just intelligent and self-aware enough to make it work. Håfström's firm and capable directorial hand keeps things suitably grounded in reality when some of the film's more far-fetched plot points threaten to overwhelm the credibility of the work as a whole (for starters, the question as to why a hotel with such a macabre past would be allowed to continue to operate, let alone have clientele is never addressed, and the ending twist may leave audiences divided as to its effectiveness...). But 1408 looks and feels like such a staunchly quality work that such complaints often disintegrate once the film picks up upon the introduction of the titular room and the viewer is wrapped up by the superbly executed suspense generated throughout. And while the film does dip rather heavily into conventions of previous similar works (the horrifying events Enslin is subjected to feel almost like a checklist of horror movie plot devices) the element which really makes the film worthwhile and excuses many of the inevitable lapses in logic is the psychological angle, leaving the audience consistently guessing as to whether the paranormal events are actually happening or whether the whole thing is occurring in the protagonist's feverish mind. While the screenplay varies between cleverly crafted lines and typical horror melodrama, the film proves an intriguing experiment in making use of a single space, and instead of the film being shot primarily in a single room proving limiting, Håfström manages to make it consistently fresh and engaging in its ever- changing state. The uncommonly innovative cinematography adds to the scare factor, as does Gabriel Yared's musical score, despite its frequent descent into horror cliché. Despite the film being for the most part essentially a one man show, the inspired casting of John Cusack as Mike Enslin proves the film's most promising attribute. With only four walls and a floor to interact with for the bulk of the narrative, Cusack's quirky charisma proves the perfect element to provide a fresh touch to what could have collapsed into commercial formulaic monotony. With a brilliantly tuned, entirely credible rendition of a scarred cynic descending slowly into madness, Cusack resists the temptation to ham it up, and instead remains coolly understated, making it all the more unsettling as his composed exterior slowly unravels. Perfectly delivering many of his character's wittily verbose lines, Cusack sells the role with a commanding credibility few other actors could have mustered. Samuel L. Jackson also makes a strong impression in his brief scenes, and despite the almost unnecessary inclusion of his character, Jackson makes it worth the audience's while with a weighty gravitas which perfectly amps up the tension for the ensuing horror. Mary McCormack also does her best as the hideously conventional 'distanced wife still attracted to the protagonist' figure, and emerges with a decent performance despite her almost criminally underdeveloped role. What could have descended into commercial drivel under different circumstances instead proves a surprisingly intelligent and capably crafted psychological thriller, a merciful diversion from the trashy gore-fests inundating cinemas these days. While comparisons to earlier King adaptation The Shining among other works are inevitable, and despite the frequent reliance on formula, somehow new frights are extracted from age-old conventions, and with a strong directorial touch and an endlessly engaging lead performance 1408 proves a gruesomely entertaining bright spark in a fading ember of a genre, one which even the most jaded horror fans can appreciate and enjoy. -8/10",8,13,15,13 March 2008
Raging Bull," Although he could fight, he'd much rather recite... that's entertainment
","Don't be misled into thinking that Raging Bull is simply a film about boxing, à-la Rocky. It does indeed focus on the life of a boxer, but there is so much more to it then that. Rather than simply being a sports story of redemption, or something of the like, Raging Bull is one of the most startling and powerful portraits of stunted machismo ever captured on film. De Niro, following up on other such personas of tough guy losers, gives arguably his strongest performance here as Jake La Motta, who slowly but surely tore down everything he had managed to accumulate around him, including a marriage, relationships with all those close to him, and his hard won boxing career. De Niro is clearly the center of attention here, and he lives up to his reputation with wonderful flair, his performance is one of the most deserving of his Oscar in history. But don't go thinking this is a one man show, although De Niro's electrifying performance is easily the highlight of the movie, once again, there's so much more to it then that. For one thing, the technical genius of director Martin Scorsese, whose bold decision to shoot the film in black and white paid off immensely, giving the film a stark, bold look, almost like an old photograph, lost in the depths of time. It's really a shame more movies aren't shot in black and white these days, in today's colour saturated world, the occasional flash devoid of colour can come as quite the relief. The legendary fight scenes are also incredible, with Scorsese determined to get his cameras directly in the middle of the action, instead of simply watching from a distance. We as an audience genuinely seem to feel every bone jarring punch, which really helps us sympathize with La Motta, rather than creating an antagonist out of the character. In fact, one of the most praiseworthy aspects of the film is Scorsese's ability to maintain a completely balanced view of the character, never taking sides to present him as a hero or a villain - a flawed lead in all cases. Even at times of spousal abuse and such, when we are genuinely meant to hate the character, we still realize exactly what in La Motta's troubled psyche is making him do such a thing, and still, somehow manage to empathize with the character. Although the film really does belong to De Niro, he is ably supported by numerous similarly phenomenal supporting performances. Joe Pesci gives a terrific performance as La Motta's brother who also falls prey to Jake's increasing paranoia and aggression. The scene between Jake and Joey with Jake continually challenging his brother to hit him as hard as he can is one of the most powerful in the movie. Cathy Moriarty is also memorable as La Motta's 15 year old trophy girlfriend, who, even though at one point being the one person he could trust, also finds herself pushed away by the boxer's growing distrust of everyone. These two fantastic performances provide excellent backup for the incredible De Niro.All in all, it seems fair to say Raging Bull is one of the most powerful and well made films in film history - with Martin Scorsese establishing himself as a master director, and Robert De Niro giving an astonishingly affecting performance, perhaps the strongest of his career, driving the stunted machismo mood of the film home. Definitely worth seeing, if you have yet to do so! -10/10",10,3,5,5 March 2006
Black Panther," Spaceship Bugatti
","There are some films where you can practically hear the history books writing themselves - though if all history books were as outrageously fun as Black Panther, university campuses would be bursting at the seams. Accompanying 2017's Wonder Woman as a triumphant one-two punch of unprecedented blockbuster representation finding record-breaking box office and critical success, Black Panther's real shock is that... yes, it is exactly as good as you'd hope. A robust, whip-smart, emotional, and superbly entertaining thriller as unafraid to dive headlong into contentiously topical politics as unabashedly indulge in superhero silliness. Some things are worth the wait. And yet, after a dizzyingly gorgeous animated prologue, establishing the MacGuffin mythology of fictional African technology haven Wakanda, we wait even longer, as director Ryan Coogler deviates into a seemingly tangential Prologue 2.0 set in the slums of Oakland, California. It's a disorienting start (but don't worry; it's only moments more before T'Challa spin-kicks someone), but its coy foreshadowing heralds an important lesson: Coogler is an immaculately precise director unaccustomed to wasting a frame of film. No one could accuse Black Panther of being unambitious, with a plot encompassing human trafficking, international arms deals, salient commentaries on tradition vs. modernity, redefining power amidst a global economy, and roughly as many political maneuvers as an entire season of House of Cards (including brazen, poignantly tongue-in-cheek barbs about immigration and colonial history) - as well as, y'know, fight scenes, cool gadgets, and all that other superhero stuff. The seamlessness with which Coogler weaves together each seemingly disparate plot thread and theme is almost mind-boggling - and yet, his film is as much a cohesive entity as it is more than the sum of its parts. Appropriately, for a superhero film whose production was inevitably delayed for decades due to its affiliation with a revolutionary political party, social politics comprise the core and foundation of Black Panther. Here, Coogler pulls no punches, but is never pedantic. We start out in fun but familiar territory, with a first act globetrotting takedown of Wakanda's arch-nemesis Ulysses Klaue (a gleefully scenery-masticating Andy Serkis, arguably Marvel's most downright fun adversary to date), reminiscent of a contemporary 007 romp (complete with T'Challa's own 'Q,' in Letitia Wright's hysterical, impossibly delightful Shuri). But, right when we begin to settle in and munch our popcorn, Coogler yanks the rug out from us, with a second act tonal shift that flips the film on its head, to the point where more than a few audience members will be left questioning the ethics and legitimacy of the hero we've spent the entire first half admiring as infallible. Enter Michael B. Jordan, who not only energizes the film with a furious surge of passion as he shifts from his early performative swagger to magnetic, fiery dogmatism, but shifts the conflict to a 'Malcolm X vs. MLK' critique of Wakanda's isolationist inertia in the face of contemporary racism and post-colonialism. It's a shockingly bold move for the normally sociopolitically safe Marvel, but it pays off, making the brewing climax not only breathtakingly tense, but an impressively nuanced conversation on ethics, empathy, and the real impact of a contemporary revolution. You won't find that in Ant-Man. Nonetheless, Coogler has his priorities straight, and Black Panther balances its political core with a raucously fun comic book ride. Aesthetically, it's a triumph - the FX, art, and costume design are flooring in their imaginative intricacy, incorporating Tony Stark calibre technology into traditional African designs and costuming (force field cloaks?! cool!), lending itself to a pragmatic sci-fi futurism unlike quite anything we've ever seen in the movies before, while the pastel hues of the 'spirit world' are jaw-dropping in their beauty. The fight scenes are thrillingly fun, balletic as they are brutal (and while T'Challa's new suit, and its explosive release of kinetic energy, adds a fun new level to the customary punching, kicking, and clawing, it's in the hands, spear, and wig of Danai Gurira's scene-stealing, steely general Okoye, that the film is at its most fun and thrilling), and Ludwig Gorasson's musical score, layering traditional African chanting and instrumentation into brassy superhero swells, is addictively sumptuous. There are occasional fumbles - Coogler's pace occasionally lags and sputters, with a more meditative second act verging on the lugubrious (and a couple of 'Remember who you aaaaaaaaare' heart-to-hearts with John Kani's deceased patriarch that can't help but have their gravitas undercut by snickering comparisons to The Lion King). Still, Coogler sinks it home with furious aplomb, steering (just) clear of conventional Marvel third act ennui with a 'kitchen sink' climax so furiously tense and bonkers (two words: WEAPONIZED. RHINOS) that all cinema armrests will be marked with the claw marks of being gripped by a captivated audience. As the titular monarch, Chadwick Boseman delivers a remarkably grounded performance. Steering the film with a regal calm undercut with muscular emotion and crucially accessible doubt, the film revolves around his steady, magnetic presence, as the showier, scene-stealing bits are commanded by the trio of powerful women ensconcing him (the perfection of Wright, Gurira, and the luminous, passionately charismatic Lupita Nyong'o). Martin Freeman's befuddled fed provides 'fish out of water' access to Wakanda with customary dry wit; he's fun without (quite) overstaying. Finally, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker, and Angela Bassett all elevate one-dimensional secondary characters with gravitas and class, while Winston Duke's M'Baku is so ferociously terrifying mitigated by some of the most precise comedic timing seen in years, he damn near strolls off with the film himself. A staggering accomplishment as fun as it is masterfully thoughtful, Black Panther may not quite settle into The Dark Knight territory of genre-transcending masterpiece, but it pounces proudly at its footsteps, this decade's 'thinking audience's blockbuster with a conscience' to beat. Soak in the well-deserved fun, and let the BET's 2010 cartoon theme triumphantly play me out: 'Black Pan-ther! Black Pan-ther!'  -9.5/10",9,3,10,7 March 2018
Iron Man," Everything one could hope for in a superhero blockbuster
","With comic book films becoming an increasingly common component of the summer blockbuster season, the question emerges: how to make a mark as unique in the midst of so much superpowered competition while still holding true to the elements which made the originals such successes in the first place? It would seem director Jon Favreau has found the answer. From the opening chords of AC/DC's 'Back in Black' it becomes instantly apparent that Iron Man is going to be a different kind of comic book movie. Instead of the filmmaker's usual aspirations to have the source material adapted as darker and grittier than its comic book origins could ever have been, Favreau is not afraid to embrace a very much needed sense of fun without descending into the rampant silliness which consumed Tim Story's Fantastic Four. As such, Iron Man essays a superb balance between embracing every last enjoyable detail while maintaining the gravitas and complexity of its original story and characters, a seamless melding of intelligence and action clout. What really sells the film is its intelligent script, with a series of astutely crafted lines a far cry from the usual clunking variety which could have been conceived by the average six year old boy. Favreau's Robert Altman influence also leads to some highly enjoyable improvisations on top of the scripted material (Downey Jr.'s exchanges with his robotic helpers are priceless). Similarly. by updating Stark's backstory from Vietnam to a more topical Afghanistan, the film has added political poignancy, making some intriguing tongue in cheek comments about the American military. While the occasional lapse in realism and occasionally conventional character motivations may prove problematic to some, such are easily excusable considering the medium from which the story is faithfully adapted, and Favreau's solid directing outweighs such inconsequential concerns with a sheer unabashed sense of enjoyment and unfiltered movie magic. Though the bulk of the story is dedicated to the usual origin tale, Favreau by no means skimps on the jaw-dropping action setpieces, generating some genuinely gripping and tense sequences (Stark's capture in Afghanistan is visceral and engrossing) as well as the requisite adrenaline pumping exhilarating ones - Stark's testing of his Mark One armour to escape captivity is full throttle entertainment and the final showdown is easily the show stopping setpiece of the year thus far. The film's flawless special effects are perfectly executed, used to full effect without ever swamping the picture. The Iron Man armour itself both looks and sounds brilliant, a clanking cacophony of assembled parts coming together for a heart pumping streamlined exterior. Similarly, the musical score, while not the most original, provides some suitably heroic themes and proves enthralling in its own right. Enough praise cannot be bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr., who, overcoming every last inch of apprehension over his casting, is by far the key element to Iron Man's standing out from the waves of other superhero films. Delivering one of the strongest performances in his formidable career, Downey Jr. effortlessly inhabits every last contradictory inch of Tony Stark like the pristine suits the character himself dons. Putting his own unorthodox spin on the character through his wisecracking, motormouthed energy, Downey Jr. still stays true to the spirit of Stark and his darker overtones, even making the transition from callous, arrogant billionaire weapons vendor to iron clad humanitarian feasible through his extraordinary charisma and gleaming, passionate intensity. To say that Downey Jr. is perfect for the role is an understatement; a testament to the use of quality actors for bringing immortalised comic book figures to life instead of ham-handed fresh young faces chosen for looks over talent. While the rest of the cast cannot quite match up to Downey Jr.'s dynamo of a performance, all prove equally adept in adapting their comic book incarnations in a plausible fashion. Terrence Howard delivers an appropriately curt dignity to Stark's military ally Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, adding the perfect clipped acerbic deadpan to the character. Similarly, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a surprisingly convincing potential love interest as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts, her natural charisma and share of icy comebacks easily proving a superb foil to Downey Jr.'s livewire of a performance. Jeff Bridges moulds his usual laid back image into one of a despicably greedy businessman concealing his shockingly selfish dealings under a veneer of oily respectability, his unconventional performance easily overcoming the trappings of his otherwise conventional villain figure. Shaun Toub is charming as Yinsen, the mysterious scientist who saves Stark's life in Afghanistan and helps him construct his first suit of armour, with Toub's irreverent edge preventing the role from becoming a stock 'mentor' figure. Simply put, Iron Man is everything a comic book movie could hope to be: a perfect balance between the grittily serious and exuberantly enjoyable, flawless special effects and a roster of incredible performances. Iron Man proves an example of the quintessential blockbuster: one not afraid to think while simultaneously bludgeoning with entertainment - for those in search of entertainment without jeopardising brain cells, Iron Man should prove just the thing. -10/10",10,12,22,8 May 2008
Mother!," I can't give you anything but Love, Baby
","If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, it's a clear sign of how generally reviled Darren Aronofsky's mother! was, as it's monumentally clear that nothing like it - at least with a $30 million budget made by consummately safe Hollywood players - will probably ever be attempted or allowed again. That's somewhat of a shame, as mother! is a genuine risk, and doubly so made by a mainstream Hollywood studio. A bizarre social experiment in aggressively polarizing arthouse wackiness disastrously mismarketed as Blair Witch style horror (an entire other movie could be made about the inevitable Hunger Games diehards walking out, bug-eyed and traumatized), mother! is a ferocious howl into the wind of a film. It's a surrealist Biblical allegory by way of gruelling, abjective Von Trier/Jodorowski-esq social satire, with scathing commentary on ideological gender disparity, the environment, mass media, the artistic process, and the breaking point of societal social norms, punctuated with some of the most harrowing imagery committed to cinema in years. It's a rough, beguiling, frequently frustrating, and utterly uncompromising fever dream of a film, and an intentionally difficult watch. In short: not exactly an airy, carefree Friday night popcorn romp. Still, Aronofsky's feverish vomit of ideas and themes are (overall) worth sifting through and grappling with, if only for the delirious pub night conversation to follow. In terms of what the film is actually about... that's a matter of interpretation. Allegories span the Book of Genesis to the experience of childbirth to the sheer angst of waiting for overstaying party guests to leave so you can finally go to bed, though Aronofsky teasingly suggesting the film play as a double-bill with his 2014 Noah is a bit of a hat-tip. The thematic common denominator, in short, seems to be that the world is a fundamentally sh*tty place - and a fundamentally sh*tty place to be a woman specifically. The pathetic fallacy sinks it home with appropriate ickiness, with blood oozing from floorboards and squirting from exploding lightbulbs, as the walls crinkle and burn, exposing a throbbing internal heart, in feverish episodes which could be anything from mini-seizures to foreshadowing. Aronofsky accentuates the isolation with a disquieting lack of music and sickeningly claustrophobic cinematography (you can count the number of shots not primarily filled by Jennifer Lawrence's face or body on one hand), making the Grand Guignol grotesquery and proliferation of bodily fluids of all kinds all the more in-your-face. Still, in the face of the histrionics to come, it's the film's first act that crawls under the skin arguably more memorably. A black comedy of manners, Aronofsky allows his pair of perturbingly oblivious uninvited house guests (Ed Harris - goofily cheery with just a glint of sinister unpredictability, and the utterly terrifying, scene-stealing Michelle Pfeiffer, like the Angel of Death circa Sex in the City) to push the boundaries of social acceptability like a nightmarish version of If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. It's an appropriately unnerving calm(ish) before the storm, and subtly twisted enough to squeeze out barks of uncomfortable laughter amidst the frowns and cringes. For the love of God, get off the sink. One takeaway, which has most viewers particularly up in arms, reads the film as a life-imitates-art parable of artistic muses and the creative process, and an uneasy romance between a demure young muse and a tormented Creator twice her age (hmm... that sounds familiar). Reducing the film as such doesn't quite do it justice, but the cynical eye-rolling at its problematically antiquated gender roles is very fair, just as the antiquated arthouse trope of women grotesquely, violently suffering to underscore a thematic point is done to grisly, unearned excess here. Naturally, it all escalates to a hysterical boiling point, where Aronofsky doesn't just jump the shark so much as pole-vault the seven seas here, with a batsh*t climax seemingly geared to offend as many mainstream sensibilities as possible, and prompting even the most jaded viewers' jaws to plummet like a cartoon pantomime of Jim Carrey in The Mask. Nonetheless, in a movie rife with chaotic imbalances, Jennifer Lawrence's formidably commanding performance provides a gravitational anchor throughout. Functionally a timid, 1950s housewife plopped into the middle of The Revenant, Lawrence is in almost every shot of the film, and the sheer mountainous deluges of feelings that burst out of her as she is raked over proverbial and literal broken glass, as well as every other imaginable tribulation, is exhaustingly worthwhile. Javier Bardem is similarly sickeningly magnetic, an enigmatic mix of charismatic and charming as much as he is sterile and sinister. And, as the conflict elevates to increasingly kitchen sink levels of insanity, Domhnall Gleeson, Kristen Wiig, and Stephen McHattie each pop up when least expected, generating performances as rawly affecting, only to disappear with as little fanfare. Is there any value or remotion in mother!? Well, brushing aside all pontificating on how subjective an experience cinema is, it's safe to say that Aronofsky's film isn't meant to be 'liked' so much as seep in like a vicious hangover, its aftertaste like the sweaty, throbbing clarity that comes after a bout of violently throwing up. It's loud, abrasive, and clumsy, and its ideas are calamitously assembled at best (even Aronofsky, in the midst of animatedly unpacking his motivation, eventually sheepishly confessed 'It's probably best not to overthink it'). But as a raw cauldron of feeling and primordial angst, mother! takes bold, unsolicited chances, and, as Hollywood releases are increasingly taken to task for being placid and safe, it's too much of a worthwhile experimentation of sweat, fire and bile not to champion, problematic, confusing, and displeasurable as it may frequently be. Suffice to say - whether you find mother! fascinating or traumatizing, it is one of the few movies you will genuinely never forget. -7/10",7,0,3,20 January 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Marvel's schadenfreude
","Welcome to 2016 - the year where NO HEROES CAN BE FRIENDS. And here, amidst the releases of Daredevil vs. Punisher, Captain America vs. Iron Man (+ Marvel entourages), and X-Men vs. Other X-Men (sort of), comes DC comics' massive, go- for-broke tent-pole for its own super-franchise, too serious, even, for the conventional 'vs': Batman v. Superman Colon Dawn of Justice - the (self- declared) 'greatest gladiator match in the history of the world'. But, after the dust settled, and my ears stopped ringing from the Hans Zimmer sledgehammering, we reflect on the adjective choice. Greatest? Nah. Surliest? Messiest? Unintentionally silliest? Better. But seriously (for being serious is about all it does) - the film is so hallucinogenically, histrionically mishandled that it almost defies belief. Visual pizazz aside, we're closer to Batman & Robin than Batman Begins (yup, I went there); more Breaking Dawn than Dawn of Justice. You'd expect BvS to be excessively grim and mopey, with an overinflated sense of self-importance (all of which are true). What you don't expect is how downright strange it is. Amidst its two-and-a-half hour running time, there is more time devoted to Batman hallucinating abduction by alien bug monsters than actually battling Superman. Characters spout dialogue so utterly odd (Jeremy Irons' wry Alfred - a momentary highlight - blathers similes about 'Mozart on the harpsichord'; Holly Hunter's scowling senator spits allusions like 'rasslin' a pig' and 'p*ss in a jar') it's more jaw-dropping than the film's action. And everything is so drenched in half-cocked discussions about Gods and morality it plays like a drunk football player puked in a theology textbook. And then it hits us: Zack Snyder, unsatisfied with delivering the pugilistics fans so desperately crave, is striving for artistry. For profundity. The problem? Snyder, while gifted at conjuring undeniably stunning, albeit showy, cinematic tableaux (though his best here are pilfered from Frank Miller, natch), has all the profundity of a popsicle stick. Seeing him sprinkle in dopey fantasy/dream interludes with such delirious abandon is so unintentionally amusing you almost feel guilty for jeering. This batsh*t (ha) solemnity seeps into the plot as well. Initially, focalizing the plot around the criticisms of Man of Steel's collateral damage is clever, but Snyder's head is too much in the clouds to know where to take it from there. At least twice, characters pause, extensively, midway through cumbersome, meandering monologues, as if even they're literally forgotten what they're talking about, and it's the most honest the film ever is. Hands up if you came to a movie titled Batman v. Superman eager for nearly two hours of nonsensical, stalling subplots about African arms dealers, corporate subterfuge and computer hacking, Scoot McNairy's screeching amputee defacing Superman statues with the words 'False God' (yawn), and Lawrence Fishburne's Perry White griping about travel expenses? How about the beloved (not) Marvel-derivative 'universe building' tie-ins to other future Justice League members so gratuitous it's gleefully disgraceful? Yeah, I thought not. But plot schmott - let them fight. Problem here? Snyder's internalized Man of Steel's critiques so much that even he seems to despise Superman, regulating him to a supporting character, bereft of development, and more destructive narrative prop than character - a fate not helped by Henry Cavill's unfathomably surly, charmless performance. So: Batfleck, then? Not so much. Affleck looks the part (and his batsuit/armour do look spectacular), but, despite hints of promise in his haggard rage, his brooding mostly comes across as sleepiness. Moreover, he's besieged by the script's violently uneven misreading of the character, plaguing him with so much vacant staring we genuinely worry for his mental wellbeing. Hell, it would explain his impulse that Superman's inability to prevent collateral damage warrants being viciously stabbed to death as a preventative measure (listen for Christian 'I have one rule' Bale weeping at the back of the theatre). So, the two heroes sneer and posture at each other redundantly, and we can't help but despite them both, let alone give a damn who wins. And when they do - FINALLY - trade blows? They don't so much fight as take turns pummelling each other while the other lays there, stunned, crashing around a deserted building, as Hans Zimmer bwomps away in the background. It's impossible to imagine a more underwhelming, less cathartic, imaginative, and thrilling bout - and its resolution, where Batman flips from attempted murder to being bosom buddies with Superman, is so abrupt and for so ludicrously inane a reason, it plays like an SNL parody, and is just as deliciously hilarious. Thankfully, the climactic showdown with completely unsurprising twist villain Doomsday does - FINALLY - perk things up a bit, providing both a more mobile foe and the introduction of Gal Godot's Wonder Woman (who is introduced by an 80s hair metal guitar riff, of all things), though it still plays as an overcooked remake of The Incredible Hulk's Harlem brawl. Otherwise, there's really perilously little redemption to be found here. Jesse 'Mmm!' Eisenberg's Luthor, even more unmotivated than Batman, is a squeaky, gibbering mess of tics, like a high school student doing an impression of Heath Ledger's Joker, while Amy Adams' Lois is such a whiny damsel it's genuinely embarrassing. Even Wonder Woman has her undeniably cool entrance marred by cameras lingering on her chest and crotch like a 90s video game. Classy.The thing is, so many of BvS' innumerable flaws could be tolerated - stupid plot, dubious writing, and even boring fights - if it were fun. But Snyder's odyssey of awfulness is so drab, grim, and odiously self-satisfied that fun is like a long-lost mythical concept, with only shards remaining, deeply buried, like elusive kryptonite. The film's most worthwhile attribute has been an interview of Affleck confronted by early critical panning. A sea of disappointment dances across his face, calling the bluff of the colossal, shameful dud he's staked his recent reputation to. Batfleck is now Sadfleck. Now that's justice. -4/10",4,4,8,26 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," Death of a Salesman; Birth of a Show
","Cinema can have a cruel sense of dramatic irony. Only a few months after the Ringling Bros circus announced its final curtain call, due to waning ticket sales and those pesky animal rights activists, comes the release of The Greatest Showman - a loving, nostalgic movie musical tribute to its founder, that could well have rekindled affection, interest, and, crucially, ticket sales. The juxtaposition is poignant, as the film is, at once, a decidedly old-school musical love letter to big-hearted dreamers, but sprinkled with a healthy seasoning of behind-the-curtain artifice and capitalistic pragmatism to help it land in a more cynical contemporary market. Here is a worthwhile spiritual sequel and prequel at once for those wowed by 2016's La La Land: a comparable narrative hamster wheel of short-sighted crutches of cliché, bolstered by truly magical forays into spectacle spectacular. And are you not entertained? Suffice to say, if The Greatest Showman stands the test of time, it will not be due to its plot. Barnum's 'Rags-To-Riches-but-AT-WHAT-COST' tale is so perilously over-familiar that it verges on the redundant, and you can practically hear director Michael Gracey keeping his eye on his watch through each perfunctory story beat, awaiting the chance for his next musical interlude. Equally uneasy is Gracey's treatment of his titular showman. On the whole, it's a fairly rosy-cheeked take on Barnum, playing up the 'bringing joy and wonder to the hearts of the masses' angle of a characterization that would otherwise be, in essence, 'Capitalism: A Love Story.' A more intriguing take could have inverted the focus, making our put-upon circus performers the central protagonists, and Barnum a more enigmatic Gatsby or Wizard of Oz figure, charismatically sweet-talking them into the conflicted stardom of being his mawkish show ponies. It's poignantly fitting to keep Barnum the face and star of his venture, but it does make his film somewhat lopsided and unnecessarily clichéd. Yes, circuses are nostalgically magical but now ethically uncertain terrain, perhaps explaining the film's desperate, somewhat inorganic fumbling for thematic urgency and redemption. Earnest pretentions at 'be yourself and be proud' empowerment, 
painting the circus as a refuge for and celebration of the otherwise ostracized (insert discrimination/diversity/racism subplot and requisite torch-brandishing mob here) never fully land, while spending most of its energies asking us to root for Barnum, who cheerfully exploits his unconventional stars for money and social status. Barnum's initial crass pitch of 'They're gonna laugh anyway, kid - may as well get paid for it,' before launching into his silver-tongued empowering spiel, is about as close to the grimy, hard line truth as the film ever gets. Still, if you hold back tears during the scene-stealing Keala Settle's bombastic showstopper, 'This Is Me' centrepiece number, you're made of sterner stuff than me. Thematically, the film is more interesting when flirting with unpacking the schism and values of high/low culture and entertainment/cultural value that Barnum becomes obsessed with - even if Gracey resorts to the tired cliché of the most abominable movie critic since Birdman to espouse armchair cultural philosophy. It's tempting to take the bait and extrapolate to a meta-commentary of the film as a whole (if it's significant for one person, regardless of crass intentions, it has value), though still a shame, in the post-Hamilton era of ethically nuanced musical protagonists, that the film balks at digging deeper into Barnum's seedier real-life marketing practices in the name of making a quick buck. But, just like the real circus, it's probably best not to peek behind the curtain for optimum enjoyment, as Gracey's flair for eye-popping cinematic razzle-dazzle is easily worth the price of admission. Anchored on a backbone of exceptional, almost obnoxiously catchy song numbers by La La Land/Dear Evan Hansen's Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the film's neo-nostalgia pop flashiness feels far more organic and earned than Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby. Replete with exceptionally vibrant costumes, lighting, flooringly immaculate choreography (many dances - particularly a stomping, shot-taking barroom face-off between Jackman and Efron - genuinely do feel unlike anything we've ever seen), and hummingbird cinematography, perennially whizzing between and around the highs and lows of the big top, perfectly encapsulate the dizzying, cotton-candy high of a circus extravaganza. There are times when the kaleidoscope of colours, movement, and CGI verge on overstimulating, but it's fairly apropos for a film about the notoriously hyperbolic Barnum similarly stuffed with spectacle embellishments around every corner. But, if nothing else, the film finds wings solely as a vehicle to showcase the cinematically untapped musical prowess of Hugh Jackman. Brimming with a jubilant, airy charisma, lighting-quick dance moves, a commanding belt, and a devilish twinkle in his eye, Jackman has never been so explosively, infectiously fun as he is showing off here. Zac Efron similarly impresses with airtight song and dance prowess, even if his (fictitious composite) straight man voice of reason character feels somewhat superfluous to the plot. Michelle Williams, similarly, is a joy to watch, but a tragic case of a phenomenal performance and voice utterly squandered in one of the most inexcusably under-written 'I Am Wife' plot devices pitfalls in years. Thankfully, Zendaya is slyly, impishly likeable as a precocious trapeze artist, while also anchoring a racism-fraught romantic subplot with applaudable gravitas. It's actually refreshing to have a film so holistically at peace with its ethical dichotomies - yes, it's fairly artificial, junky, exploitative, and fundamentally commercially-minded. But, gosh darn it, are you not entertained, at all costs? Ultimately, it may not be everything you ever want and need, but it's an intrinsically harmless, stupendously fun ride, and so far from the belly-flop off a trapeze that could have been. If nothing else, the film lays a strong foundation for an inevitable run of Broadway revivals - one of which, assuredly, will work closer towards fully requiting the lofty promises of the film's title.

Casino Royale," Revamped 007 plays a winning hand
","Come 2002, when the world's favourite martini-sipping British secret agent was found driving an invisible car and racing to defeat a madman attempting to fry Korea with a giant magnifying glass, it had become clear that the immortalized Bond, James Bond had strayed a bit from the mark. Fortunately, producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson had a ready solution to save their beloved franchise from going belly up  take the Batman Begins route, ditch the franchise and start from the beginning once again by showing exactly how Bond earned his double-oh stripes, and morphed into the suave killing machine we all know and love.The rest, as they say, is history, with the addition of director Martin Campbell, veteran of the Zorro movies, who performed a similar revival of the Bond character with 1995's superb Goldeneye. Campbell shows a similar flair for bringing 007 to life here, as Casino Royale, adapted from author Ian Fleming's first novel proves to be one of the most powerful and intense Bond movies to date, allowing us as an audience to finally get behind Bond's skin a bit, and learn what drives him, why he is who he is. But don't be fooled into thinking this new Bond is strictly a character piece  Campbell shows no restraint in instilling the film with enough action to keep even the most sated Bond fans more than satisfied. Despite this, Campbell manages to make the title game of poker, where Bond must triumph to bankrupt a fleeing arms dealer, almost as tense and suspenseful as any action sequence; where the film might have lagged terribly is instead a high point.When re-igniting a franchise as iconic as 007, the casting of a suitable Bond was essential. Understandably, star Daniel Craig had more than a bit of pressure bestowed upon him, and more than a few naysayers. Fortunately, all those who knocked Craig as Bond are likely choking on their martinis at this very moment, as Craig shows the ideal mix of suave charisma and an intense dangerous streak, proving to be the most faithful on-screen adaptation of Fleming's beloved character. But be warned  while he still is without a doubt still Bond, James Bond, this Bond has an edge unseen since the Connery era. In the slick black and white pre-credits sequence, Bond describes his first kill, shown in flashback with Bond attempting to dispatch his target in a bathroom by fist, feet, mirror, sink and water. When asked how his target died, Craig simply deadpans 'Not well', a throwback to the dark, edgy one-liners which established the Bond spirit in the first place. This intense yet classy sequence sets the tone beautifully for the rest of the movie  Bond is back, but the gadget bloated days of invisible cars and satellites are gone  this Bond is down, dirty and dangerous.While the film without a doubt belongs to Craig, he is aptly backed by a superb supporting cast. Eva Green's Vesper Lynd proves to be one of the most interesting and well developed women ever seen in Bond's life, and Green brings a distinct edge, yet affability to her essential character. Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen makes a more than suitable villain as arms dealer Le Chiffre. Mikkelsen shows he doesn't need plans to take over the world to be one of the most menacing foes seen in years. Watch for a particularly disturbing torture scene, bringing a deadly streak to a series usually so full of fantasy escapes. Character actor Jeffrey Wright makes a welcome appearance as Bond's American counterpart, Felix Leiter, and Dame Judi Dench produces what is without question her strongest performance as MI6 head M. Dench bestows M with a hard as nails front (her 'God I miss the Cold War' line is one of the most memorable moments of the film) yet with a deeply concealed compassionate streak. Dench brings out every potential subtlety to her character in a masterfully layered and highly enjoyable performance.All in all, Casino Royale should prove enough to sate the needs of any 007 enthusiast, while also showing something new, sure to connect with any who may have felt the Bond series had strayed too far off track into the realm of fantasy. Director Martin Campbell and star Daniel Craig have brought both the character and franchise back to life in a fashion better than anyone could have predicted. Bond is back, and better than ever  don't pass this one by.-10/10",10,2,4,1 December 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Painting with broad strokes
","Many have referred to the recent career of American auteur Woody Allen as his 'European vacation', having departed his beloved New York to begin experimenting with different narratives and cultural observations overseas. It would seem Vicky Cristina Barcelona proves the end of Allen's 'vacation' (his next film marks a return to New York) and as such, Allen seems determined to make the most of his last departure from tradition, toying with narrative, character and thematic development. The resulting film as such feels slightly piecemeal, but hardly in a negative sense, as Vicky Cristina Barcelona merely brims with the impulsive exploring one would expect at the end of a vacation, and the impulsive sense of artistic whimsy is one difficult to resist. While once again abstaining from his traditional New York locations (this time transposing his pallet from England to Spain) and trademark neurotic humour, Allen demonstrates a welcome return to his acute knack for dissecting and observing human behaviour. Exploring a myriad of sexual habits and practices as well as his usual meditations on the nature and quality of love, the potentially redundant and overdone source material is given a fresh and fascinating spin in the hands of the veteran storyteller. But given his past credentials, it is interesting to see Allen experimenting with a different cinematic voice, albeit one which is still easily recognizable as his. Despite his complex and profound subject matter, Allen's sparse and rather matter of fact script feels almost overly simplistic, the bulk of the character development and contextual grounding of the plot performed in concise, clipped sound bites - rather than the viewer inferring Johansson's character to be neurotic and afraid of commitment, we are simply informed that she is as such, a tendency which comes across as rather jarring at first. However, Allen's shrewdly cunning scripting makes such a narrative voice clear to be a deliberate choice rather than simply poor writing, as if tiding the viewer by with blunt surface description while leaving the inherent subtleties left to be discovered by the viewer. The comparison can be made to Bardem's painter character, as it seems Allen has simply chosen to paint with broad strokes, his deceptively simplistic overtones masking a far more complicated and fascinating underbelly left mainly to the viewer to discover through what is not said, rather than what is.Nonetheless, not all of the film's potential problems can be explained away as deliberate artistic decisions quite as easily, particularly an ill-advised omnipresent narration, which starts off giving the impression of being sharp and satirical, but becomes quickly overused, after which it abruptly disappears for almost the rest of the film. This tendency to tell not show makes Allen's film feel remarkably un-cinematic at times, with the narration seeming a lazy and complacent way of quickening the story rather than letting it unfold, undermining an otherwise refreshingly unique and fascinating narrative. Similarly, the overuse of certain musical motifs becomes frustratingly repetitive, although the beautiful Spanish architecture and locations are captured with an excellent touristic flourish, sweeping the viewer up in the heady luxury of a Spanish holiday as the protagonists themselves. Despite excellent past work as Allen's latest female muse, Scarlett Johansson appears somewhat wasted here, her usual spunky exuberance and sultry charisma appearing oddly stunted. Paradoxically, her character, who in theory should have been the most interesting (the struggling artist attempting to find her niche in life and love, while welcoming experimentation along the way) disappointingly proves one of the more poorly written, and although Johansson does her best, infusing her character with an appropriate degree of teasingly seductive charm, it is a shame her character was not explored more fully. The true breakout star of the picture is Rebecca Hall, last seen as Christian Bale's wife in magician thriller The Prestige. Hall shines as a more typical Allen leading lady, mastering the neurotic self-guessing, pragmatism and guilt-inducing impulsive spells of her character with a particular down to earth yet bubbly style all her own - an entirely credible and hugely enjoyable performance. Javier Bardem is perfectly cast as the suavely overconfident artist just as determined to drink in the pleasures of life as he is cynically convinced of its worthlessness, his comic deadpan and extravagant screen presence making him a perfect foil for both leading ladies. However, it is the entrance of Penelope Cruz halfway through the film when the plot really picks up speed, her suicidal, fiercely proud yet chaotically unpredictable artist and ex-wife of Bardem's character proving a sublime catalyst for the other major characters to play off of. It is impossible to imagine a more fitting performance than Cruz's for the role, her ferocious, borderline psychotic energy proving alternately hilarious and terrifying. Patricia Clarkson also gives a typically strong performance as the family friend of Vicky's putting the two women up for the summer, and Kevin Dunn is a suitably distant presence as her absent husband. Few movies provide such an odd mishmash of quietly whimsical storytelling touches, but there is no question that Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona adds up to an altogether pleasant experience. With appealingly complex undertones discernible beyond the deceptively simple exterior and peppered with an array of terrific performances, while the film may be somewhat of a departure of form for Allen, it is a welcome return to his intelligent introspection and quality of old, and one without question worth a watch. -7.5/10",8,7,16,18 October 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Mindless entertainment of the foremost quality
","Despite frequent critical bashing dismissing such efforts as empty vessels for pyrotechnics, making a proper action movie does take a certain craftsmanship completely separate from the sort which would result in a quality conventional drama. Keeping that in mind, it would be difficult to dispute the claim that few films in the genre have demonstrated such consistently quality work bearing on such standards as the Die Hard series - in fact, it is debatable that the series helped originate the standard for 'summer escapism' in the first place. Those familiar with the former antics of wisecracking cop John McClane will be thrilled to hear that Live Free or Die Hard, the fourth film in the series, exemplifies everything which made the first three successes. The MacGuffin of a plot, detailing a computer centered widespread terrorist attack on Independence Day weekend is just sensible enough to give Willis some credulity in his rampant destruction, striving to save the day once again. And while the usual gaping plot holes, archetypal characters and clichéd situations are as prevalent as ever, and as usual both McClane and his adversaries rack up enough damage to kill an entire army singlehandedly without being significantly slowed down, but such concerns are for the most part besides the point. This is, after all a Die Hard movie, action fantasy at its foremost, where any plot hole can easily be explained away by an explosion or two, and director Len Wiseman certainly does not disappoint on the explosion front. Keeping things moving at a thunderous pace, the astronomical number of action or chase sequences easily makes for the most consistently action packed and flat out exhilarating Die Hard film to date. As would be expected, the action scenes are as usual the central draw of the film, and they live up to expectations formidably, delivering some of the most gripping, deliriously entertaining thrills seen in years - the sheer unapologetic destruction almost laudable in its blatant ignorance of common sense or decor. Bearing this in mind, it is the slower, emotional scenes which really drag down the film the most. One would be hard pressed to find an audience seeing a Die Hard film for any heavy emotional introspection, and while an attempt at giving the characters depth is a nice attempt, with such a paltry script, such scenes would have done better being left out entirely if not rewritten, to leave room for more interesting scenes (or at least those containing explosions). Instead of adding emotional depth or poignancy to the film, soul-searching exchanges between McClane and his daughter or hacker Matt Farrell are almost laughable in their sloppily written cliché, and detract from the heart-pounding fun of the rest of the film. The musical score similarly wallows in cliché, though does prove similarly adrenaline pumping, and compliments the action well enough, without adding anything special. As would be expected for such a film, performances are generally an afterthought, and while hardly as abysmal as they could have been, the cast generally fail to outshine the explosions they come into contact with. Reprising the signature role he could play in his sleep, Bruce Willis extracts every gruffly endearing iota from John McClane, wisecracking and slickly delivering formidable destructive onslaughts with ease. Justin Long suitably inhabits the role of manic computer hacker Matt Farrell, essaying the comic relief and 'civilian voice of reason' figure with aplomb. Saddled with most of the worst lines in the film, Timothy Olyphant makes for a rather drab villain, deprived of any real menace or merit apart from angry frowning. Fellow adversary Maggie Q excels in her action scenes but is given next to no character to work with outside of them, apart from posing statuesquely on occasion. As McClane's headstrong daughter, Mary Elizabeth Winstead does little to improve her weakly written part, but Cliff Curtis does his best, putting forth a quality performance as a harried FBI head of security. Watch also for an amusing Kevin Smith cameo as a laughably nerdy hacker.Fans of the former three films will doubtlessly be drawn to the same unabashed sense of mindless destruction which made the earlier installments so shamefully enjoyable, and Willis back on the top of his game makes the ride a blast. While those seeking character development or sensible plots are clearly on the wrong track entirely, Live Free or Die Hard hits hard on every front which a Die Hard should - yippie-kay-ay!-8/10",8,1,2,8 May 2008
X2: X-Men United," Impeccable blend of cultural commentary and comic book action; the definitive superhero sequel
","The X-Men series has always demonstrated more promising opportunities for deeper poignancy than the typical superpowered slugfest, a trait which director Bryan Singer embraced for the first film adaptation of the timeless comic book series. And while the fear that the unique gravitas and social scope of the first film might be lost in a flurry of mindless action associated with the typical sequel, X2 exceeds any seemingly insurmountable expectations by exemplifying and even expanding upon every successful element of the first, making its mark as one of the few sequels to not only match but surpass the quality of its predecessor. What could have been simply played as an all out action film instead retains laudable cultural context, as returning director Singer tackles his source material with a slightly more fun, enjoyable tone without losing an ounce of the serious realism or societal commentary which permeated his first effort. As prejudice towards mutants becomes more pronounced and the rift between them and 'normal' humans grows ever larger, morally ambiguous fields emerge and extremes are taken by both sides of the issue to eliminate the other, giving the film ample opportunity to touch upon issues of discrimination (Iceman's 'coming out' scene to his parents draws explicitly poignant parallels to homosexual repression) or other issues of impressive complexity for a superhero blockbuster. As such, certain storyline similarities to the first do emerge, but these are hardly apparent and utterly insignificant in the face of such a uniformly superb work. The film's clever script balances its wide array of characters just so unlike the slightly rushed and chaotic feel of the third instalment, as each character shines given their appropriate moment without the film ever feeling cluttered or imbalanced. Similarly, many knowing winks of humour result from throwaway references for fans of the comics (watch for fleeting mentions of Gambit, Sebastian Shaw and Dr. Henry McCoy) without ever jeopardising the credibility of the film. The film similarly boasts more streamlined action setpieces than its predecessor (Nightcrawler's opening attack on the White House is a breathless, superbly gripping piece of work), as computer animation is seamlessly melded with practical effects and makeup, culminating in a laudably realistic depiction of superpowered beings in a frighteningly real world. The quality cast inhabit the potentially daunting material with a passionate urgency, fusing potentially laughable subject matter into an affecting and exhilarating work. Reprising his defining role, Hugh Jackman once again effortlessly essays the animalistic charm of the savage Wolverine, his roguish charisma remaining pitch perfect for the role. The calm dignity of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan provide dramatic backbone as opposing mutant figureheads, the peace seeking Professor Charles Xavier and ruthless war mongering Magneto, bringing class and distinction to the film and helping to sell many of the less realistic moments while also both demonstrating surprising vulnerability during respective captivity sequences. Returning cast members Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and James Marsden continue to impress, expanding upon their previous incarnations of their roles, and Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore contribute a surprisingly feasible youthful existentialism subplot. Despite minimally written roles, Rebecca Romijn and Kelly Hu provide suitable menace instead of simply statuesque forms as the shapeshifting Mystique and ominous villainous Deathstrike respectively.Yet most commendable are the new cast members, as Brian Cox chews scenery with the utmost of bottled fury as military extremist William Stryker and Aaron Stanford inhabits simmering defiance like a second skin as the unpredictable Pyro. Yet the film's most resonant and ultimately affecting performance without question is provided by Alan Cumming as outcast teleporter Nightcrawler. His soulful interior poignantly counterbalancing his demonic exterior, Nightcrawler serves as a figurehead for humanity's close-minded discrimination, and Cumming's masterclass of a performance extracts every possible ounce of humanity and sympathy from the character - one of the most moving and fervently felt performances ever seen in a comic book adaptation. With exquisitely thrilling action to put most summer blockbusters to shame and an undercurrent of thought provoking profundity which could give most dramas a run for their money, X2 proves an almost faultless piece of quality film-making as well as easily one of the strongest comic book adaptations ever released. Even those usually put off by superhero films will have much to appreciate, and fans of such material will be hard pressed to find a film nearly as bombastically satisfying as X2. -9.5/10",10,0,0,18 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fear not: Episode VII does not try - it does.
","The scariest movie of 2015 had nothing to do with the horror genre. No - for fans worldwide of the most beloved film franchise of all time, it lay in the mouth-watering yet trepidatious pending release of its newest instalment. These fans had already been burned once, the scars of a disappointment a decade old still glimmering. Dare they risk investing once again, for fear of agonizing disappointment (you know what they say about fear, anger, hate, and suffering)? To this cherished community: fear not. Star Wars is back, and it is worthy of the name. Wresting the reigns of power away from the endlessly tinkering George Lucas and into the hands of a Star Wars fan was unquestionably the right move, and franchise messiah J.J. Abrams knows exactly what the world needs out of a Star Wars film at this juncture: reverence and reassurance. Abrams' brisk, no-nonsense storytelling is at its best here, not homaging so much as inhabiting the formula: a vintage epic which whisks along at a rollicking pace, filled with mysterious mythology, Oedipal melodrama, and trademark scrappy humour, plus more than a few congenial winks that this is familiar for all the right reasons. It's a perilous balance between cute nods and becoming a sea of references, but Abrams threads it with the ease of Han Solo's Kessel Run. Seamlessly blending in old favourites so the exuberance of their resurgence punctuates plot points (our heroes have a breathless escape on the Millennium Falcon, receive helpful exposition from C-3PO, and even Admiral Akbar rears his head during a climax that is bound to involve a trap), the heroes of old are elevated to a level of mythic significance in-text, so new characters ooh and ahh at Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Luke Skywalker along with their audiences. Why fight it?In fact, if there's a major bone to pick with Episode VII, it's how heavily it leans on the narrative of A New Hope. Sure, playing it safe by channelling the original trilogy is the smart choice, but The Force Awakens' plot is derivative to the point of nearly being a functional beat-by-beat remake at times, which makes several purported 'plot twists' lose a lot of their oomph. It's a shame, as such allegiance is wholly unnecessary, as the most interesting bits here involve establishing Episode VII's own internal mythology, most of which is left tantalizingly off screen. Hopefully, having placated audiences here, Disney will relax somewhat and allow future instalments to take flight and become their own animals, while still in keeping with the spirit of the universe. Sensorially, The Force Awakens is a warm bath of familiarity. The grittier, 'lived-in' visual aesthetic of old is immaculately restored, with a glut of stupendously imaginative character designs peppering the backgrounds (none of Guardians of the Galaxy's 'all aliens are pink or blue humans' nonsense). Gliding through a desert filled with the behemoth corpses of Imperial Walkers and Star Destroyers to a shockingly tense lightsaber showdown in a snowy forest, with just a dash of gorgeous Skellig Michael, Ireland for good measure, coupled with all the gleefully evocative whirrs and thrums of Ben Burtt at his best, and, of course, the indispensable work of John Williams sounding his liveliest in years, The Force Awakens is a sensory wonder to behold. The Star Wars universe has evolved in an infinitely more credible fashion than any of the flashiness of Lucas' later works - a gorgeous and rich interstellar realm that feels entirely inhabitable.Impressively, Abrams interweaves old and new faces believably, rather than steering by fan- service. Daisy Ridley makes for a subtly compelling lead, grounding her cut-glass accent with a rough tenacity, making her amiable, mysterious, and unpredictable, and all the more engaging for it. John Boyega is similarly fresh, with a welcomely quirky, twitchy charisma and levity - a hugely enjoyable neurotic foil for Ridley's deadpan. It is genuinely fascinating to speculate where the franchise will take them next. Adam Driver's Loki-Vader Kylo Ren would be hilariously dismissible in his angst (as evidenced by the priceless #EmoKyloRen Twitter handle) were his performance not so volcanically, magnetically raw and emotive. He's captivating, nuanced, and the perfect fit for the franchise. Chameleonic Oscar Isaac brings a brawny affability to ace pilot Poe Dameron, while Domhnall Gleeson's prissily rigid general crescendoes into rabid Nazi ravings with eerie precision. It's a bit of a shame to see Lupita Nyong'o under-utilized as a generically warm/wise bespecled Jedi-sympathizer, while Andy Serkis' gigantic Emperor-redux rumbles well, but disappointingly joins the Thanos school of 'unthreatening chair-dwelling overlords being saved for later instalments'. Age has only helped Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher sink deeper into the skin of their career-defining characters. Han and (General) Leia continue to epitomize craggy charm and humour, even as glimpses of world-weary regret speckle their superb chemistry. Finally, the long- awaited Mark Hamill is perfectly ethereal, and the soulful weight imbuing the eyes of Luke the Jedi Master carries 30 years of catharsis in itself. As a treat, the eagle-eyed will enjoy hunting for sly cameos by Simon Pegg and Daniel Craig, both excellent. Above all else, The Force Awakens is fun. Robust storytelling across a sumptuously textured universe, grounded by commandingly committed performances (and yet another unreasonably lovable droid). Plagiaristic or not, I grinned from start to finish. Years after The Lord of the Rings wrapped, there is finally a new trilogy to set that buzzing fire of 'EEEEEEEE!!!' in audiences' bellies, counting down the days until the next instalment. Han said it best: this long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away feels just like coming home. -8.5/10",9,1,8,31 December 2015
Rear Window," A culture that loves to watch
","Only in the hands of master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock could a seemingly simple tale about a man in a wheelchair watching his neighbours be twisted into a captivating tale of suspense and intrigue, mixed with a sturdy backbone of moral and ethical dilemmas and a social commentary on the culture that would be viewing the film. Hitchcock, who was notorious for mixing in such deeper themes with seemingly superficial suspense epics seemed to particularly relish the tale of Rear Window, a film entirely devoted to a man simply watching. At first glance, the plot sounds overly contrived, even downright dull, but under Hitchcock's careful grasp, the film never drifts into anything less than crackling with low key intrigue and tension - but always equally thought provoking as well as entertaining throughout. Rear Window proved innovative in film-making style as well as supremely entertaining movie - a masterpiece in pacing, as well as a unique narrative style. The story plays itself out as a murder mystery, but as the plot unfolds, the solution remains abundantly clear to the audience watching the events transpire. Rather than throwing in a hackneyed forced plot twist near the end, Hitchcock is content to simply let the climax unfold exactly as the viewer would have predicted all along - after all, the joy of the film is not solving a mystery, but merely observing the murderous event itself transpire. In a day and age grown so accustomed to climatic plot twists, the absence of any is in itself more of a surprise than another forced plot twist would have been. Unfortunately, one of the film's minuscule flaws is that its ending comes across as a touch abrupt and forced; a minor lapse in pacing in a film which proves an otherwise stellar example of it. But Hitchcock is not content with simply telling his story in an innovative fashion - his trademark deeper and darker themes make their way into a story which seems deceptively simple, brilliantly written by John Michael Hayes. In many ways, the premise of Rear Window serves as a social commentary on mass culture: people love to watch. How else to explain the enormous generation of income of the film industry than the general public's fascination with the stories of other people; often moreso than in their own lives. James Stewart's character seems to act as a representation of most audience members - too captivated by the social dramas of his neighbours and the glamour of potential murder (another trademark Hitchcock theme) to pay attention to his own life. And there is no denying that it is enjoyable to watch, as we, the audience, get easily drawn into the private lives of these seemingly inconsequential characters ('Miss Torso', 'Ms. Lonelyhearts' and 'The Pianist' as Stewart refers to them) framed by the spectacular cinematography, all shot from the room of Stewart's apartment - another reference as to how little it takes to entertain an audience. Indeed, Rear Window seems to serve as a precursor to the world of reality television, and the fascination ensuing from watching shows such as Survivor or Big Brother - simply observing 'real life' as it is billed.Hitchcock also raises moral issues as to the ethics of observing to the point of intrusion of privacy in a scene where Stewart debates the ethics of spying on his neighbours, even if he may bring a murderer to justice. Hitchcock seems to be silently making raising the question to his audiences - we are a culture that loves to watch, but is it always right to watch, and are we always meant to see what we see? Whatever decisions or interpretations audiences may take out of Hitchcock's social commentaries, their mere presence in the film make the unfolding of the plot that much more interesting to follow, and add strongly to the quality of the film overall. An already brilliantly realized film is only made more powerful by the immensely capable cast - James Stewart proves perfect casting as the ornery yet charming L. B. Jeffries, the wheelchair bound photographer with a bizarre interest in his neighbours' private lives, determined to prove one of them to be a murderer. The peerlessly elegant Grace Kelly brings sheer class to the film as Jeffries' socialite girlfriend, though how could Jeffries ever be capable of pushing such an ideal woman away, and why she continue to be interested in one who comes across as a cranky older man is truly a question for the ages. Character actress Thelma Ritter proves an unquestionable scene stealer, raising many a laugh and making use of many of the film's best lines as Jeffries' unassuming but sharp tongued nurse. Wendell Corey is a similarly strong presence as Jeffries' detective friend who is eventually drawn into the conflict. Raymond Burr, seen almost entirely in extreme long shots still establishes himself as a formidable and intimidating presence as the suspected murderer, and some of the suspenseful scenes involving his character are some of the best nail biting sequences Hitchcock ever churned up. All the supporting players, also seen only in long shots still manage to draw the audience into their personal lives, forcing them to care even when they realize they should be observing dispassionately - an inspired directorial touch. All in all Rear Window proves to be one of Hitchcock's most fascinating yet philosophical films in a career demonstrating many of the same traits. Though Rear Window may sound slow and uninteresting at first glance, there is a certain fascination the film evokes which triggers inevitable repeat viewing after viewing. This is one window which demands looking into. -10/10",10,3,5,14 May 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A fitting climax to a peerless cinematic legacy
","As the saying goes, 'All good things must come to an end', but seldom does one wish to refute such a statement as strongly as in the case of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion. The title proves prophetic, as the film marked the true ascent of Jackson's films into the realm of abiding classics.Debate over which film can be regarded as the strongest of the three continues eternal and remains largely a matter of individual taste, but a strong case can be made for Return of the King being at least the most rounded of the trilogy. With epic, rousing battle scenes to match any set pieces of The Two Towers and heartfelt emotional moments to rival any in Fellowship of the Ring, Return of the King exemplifies the trilogy's strengths while providing the necessary catharsis for the entire painstaking journey. And an emotional climax it is, as Jackson delves into the darkest and most tumultuous expedition into Middle- Earth. From the first notes of Howard Shore's flat out stunning musical score, the viewer is ensnared, as Jackson generates gruellingly heartfelt emotional resonance with awe-inspiring ease. Only in the hands of such a confident filmmaker could such unbridled sentiment steer clear of the embarrassingly melodramatic, but in such an engrossingly crafted world, even the most stilted lines ring as rousing, genuine and emotionally resonant - it would be a feat indeed for any viewer, no matter how jaded, to hold back tears at the film's wrenching finale. Despite the occasional trimmed scene (fans of the novel may lament Saruman's death scene, seen on the DVD extended edition), Jackson as always remains obsessively faithful to Tolkien's vision, and while the enormous running time and conclusion after conclusion may prove trying to those unfamiliar with Tolkien's works, it is impossible to imagine a more satisfying adaptation of the timeless novel.But even viewers spoiled on Jackson's first two takes on Tolkien's fantasy world will find themselves spellbound by the visual mastery on display. Easily a pinnacle of cinematic aesthetics, Jackson's Middle-Earth remains an indescribably lush, expansive tapestry of imaginative beauty. Seldom has a world been so credibly and completely generated, with staggering attention to detail ranging from the vast action set pieces (Jackson gleefully indulges his schlocky horror roots with Frodo and Sam's eerie, unbearably tense battle with monstrous spider Shelob, and lets rip with the enthralling siege of Gondor. And if his cross- cutting between Gondor's face-off with the combined armies of Mordor and the overwhelmingly heightened volcanic climax at Mount Doom can become infuriating - I'm prone to yelling 'GO AWAY, TROLL' at this point - it's testament to how painfully invested the viewer is) to the smallest etching on a soldier's helmet. It is such minuscule details which reveal that Jackson's dedication is not just to showy exteriors but in truly bringing to life the spirit of the source novels, and as such, The Return of the King proves peerless.Capturing an audience's interest and sympathies for three vast films in a row would be no easy feat, had the exemplary cast not created some of the most beloved film characters of all time. While keeping tortured protagonist Frodo an engaging and tragic lead instead of simply bug-eyed and annoying is a thankless task, Elijah Wood remains quietly charming enough to master the audience's sympathies throughout. Ian McKellen redefines the word class as noble wizard Gandalf, while mercifully still allowing moments of warm humour to slip through the cracks of his dignified solemnity. Viggo Mortensen's quiet yet ferocious charisma makes his heroic Aragorn a truly powerful and resonant figure, and Sean Astin infuses the wrenching journey of Frodo's noble companion Sam with pulsing emotion and endearing heart, a truly remarkable performance. The forever underrated Andy Serkis generates an enormously powerful performance, riddled with menace, humour, pathos, and exceptional physicality as the viciously obsessive Gollum. Bernard Hill emanates subtle nobility as patriarch Théoden, while David Wenham is truly compelling as discounted Gondorian noble Faramir. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan expand beyond comic relief to true dramatic sentiment as hobbits Pippin and Merry, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies continue their comic banter and exhilarating fight scenes as elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli to welcome effect. Similarly, the often overshadowed female cast members more than hold their own despite lack of screen time, as Miranda Otto is rousing and gripping as tenacious noblewoman Eowan, and Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler prove distinguished and mesmerizing as Elven royals Galadriel and Arwen. Such praise could prolong to the extent of the film's succession of endings. Suffice to say, The Return of the King embodies the strengths of a trilogy that, uncontroversially, can be considered some of the greatest filmmaking of all time. A truly stunning melding of exhilarating action, devastating emotional storytelling and sumptuous visuals, The Return of the King proves an engrossing epic of cinematic magic in its most most fulfilling, unpretentious form. Even for those normally dismissive of the fantasy genre, the last of Jackson's cinematic masterpieces is almost sure to enthral and capture the heart as next to no other film can. -10/10",10,1,3,24 September 2008
The Truman Show," Disturbing, compelling, relevant
","I happened along the Truman show when it played on television. Thinking it would simply be another Jim Carrey vehicle (I'm not much of a fan of his outrageously over-the-top style of comedy) I passed it by. When I came across it again, flipping channels, I stopped to watch for a bit. Needless to say, it only took a few minutes until I was completely engrossed in the story, and angry that I had missed the first half of it. Surprisingly enough, while channel surfing later that same night, the same movie was playing yet a second time on the same channel, right after it had finished the first time. What struck me as extraordinary about this chain of events was that it was disturbingly similar to the strange coincidences experienced by the title character of the film. Truman Burbank has lived his life believing himself to be no different than everyone else around him. But after a few strange events happen, and an ever strengthening feeling that the world seems to stop when he isn't around, Truman begins to notice signs that all is not right around him. Unbeknownst to him, Truman Burbank is the most famous man in the world. But sadly enough, it isn't the world he lives in. All his life, Truman has grown up in a completely simulated environment, a gigantic set. Truman has lived for 30 years on television, 24 hours a day. I have to admit - the concept was unique. And the execution was excellent - as we slowly discover Truman's situation, we develop a bad taste in our mouths at the sheer lack of humility it would take for a human being raised for the sole purpose of providing fodder for a television show. We sympathize and pity the innocent Truman, as he makes up feverish solutions for his feeling of being followed, including that his 'dead' father is actually alive, and looking for him. This goes far beyond any cloning moral dilemmas - this is a truly sick concept. Director Peter Weir, who is emerging as one of Hollywood's most talented directors, plays the disgust element regarding Truman's situation strongly. He also provides an interesting portrait of the media and television industries, part satire and part thoughtful reflection. Yet it's hard to believe the 'thoughtful reflection' side when all audiences watching Truman's show seem to be characters straight out of a satire - ditzy restaurant waitresses, a cackling man watching from his bathtub... we can't take these characters seriously enough to reflect on what they represent in our society. Nevertheless, Weir maintains a firm directorial hand throughout; his pacing is superb, and his choices of music are, as usual, unexpected, refreshingly different (droning didgeridoo in the background reminiscent of 'Dead Poet's Society'), and completely succeed in beautifully complementing the film. Weir is no stranger to casting comedic actors in dramatic films, he evoked a similar performance out of Robin Williams in 'Dead Poet's Society'. Here, he manages to morph Jim Carrey from playing the role of Truman as a straight out comedic role into playing a real person, who has the occasional comic moment. Besides being refreshingly subdued, Carrey also turns out a brilliant and consistently watchable performance, which is lucky, since his character in the film parallels his character's role on the TV show. The entire picture revolves around Truman, and Carrey carries (no pun intended) the film with ease. It comes as a let down then, when Carrey lets himself drift ever so slightly over the top at parts, when Truman starts to go hysterical, believing people are following him. In these parts, we start to see Jim Carrey, and not the masterful facade of Truman Burbank he has created.The supporting cast is less developed, also paralleling Truman's TV show, where characters seem to simply float in and out, never really connecting with the lead. The character of Truman's wife, played by Laura Linney, is hastily and sloppily written out of the story, leaving more room for a developing romantic subplot (which, mercifully, is only taken to a certain level) between Truman and a former 'cast member' (Natascha McElhone) whom Truman believes is the only woman he ever loved, and who, in turn, has developed feelings for Truman. But McElhone has one of the flimsiest characterizations in the film, despite how pivotal her character is, only really getting the chance to stare anxiously and complain about how this treatment of Truman is wrong. It's nice to see cameos from Harry Shearer as yet another news anchor, and Paul Giamatti as a show technician, but most of the acting support comes from Ed Harris' masterful performance as Christof, the man who orchestrated and directed virtually every aspect of Truman's artificial life. Harris is spellbinding, overshadowing every actor present except Carrey himself as the character stubbornly refuses to come to terms with the moral issues of his hit TV show.Don't be mistaken into thinking The Truman show is a typical mainstream Jim Carrey comedy vehicle. If you go in expecting this, you are likely to be disappointed. However, if you go in anticipating a thought-provoking masterfully executed film which raises significant moral questions and causes us to strongly re-examine our TV addicted society... you may find that The Truman Show is about as good as you could hope for. If it wasn't for the flimsiness of the supporting characters, the occasional plot hole and Carrey very occasionally drifting into his OTT comedy persona, The Truman Show could easily be the best film of the year. As it is... well, to say the least, it definitely deserves a viewing. And don't be put off by dislike of Jim Carrey - if you didn't like him before, you will now.-9/10",9,1,2,31 July 2005
Godzilla," 'And also featuring Godzilla!'
","Let's be honest: you love Godzilla. Who wouldn't? And even if you were one of the few who didn't quite love Gareth Edwards' Monsters (not monster-y enough...?), you'd find it hard to deny its impeccable technical mastery and surreal beauty. So, how could the twain meeting, not unlike a couple of frisky extraterrestrials, not make for a modern monstrous masterpiece - the 'Christopher Nolan of giant monster movies', as the sepia-toned poster screamed? Well, quite easily, apparently. It was tacitly assumed that Edwards would retain Monsters' artistic grit but substantially ratchet up the pace, mayhem and fun in a fashion befitting Godzilla. Instead, Edwards' crack at Big G is a misguided, soulless, plodding, jingoistic, reluctant blockbuster so hell-bent on realism (and there's a pretty tenuous grasp on that here as well) that it squashes virtually all the giant fun they set out for. The film starts strong: a brief surge of tension with a harrowing radioactive meltdown, followed by a blur of cryptic exposition, with the words 'prehistoric mega-predator' uttered a lot, with a cheeky potshot at the 1998 monstrosity to boot. It's all a bit clumsy, but eerily fun, and enough to pique excitement. This is a Godzilla movie! This dreary start is only the calm before the storm. But Edwards carries on, scene after scene of barely lit scientific subterfuge, and it lags enough for questions to start bubbling: how does Ken Watanabe's mysterious scientist know this storied palaeontological history? Surely it's not just because 'he looks wise and Japanese'...But that's okay, because the fun really kicks off when we... get to spend lots of quality time with Aaron Taylor-Johnson sleeping his way through the prestigious role of 'abrasively bland military meathead'. Thrill as he...suppresses sentiment and forces awkward chemistry with his wife and kid, and, um, sulks through unresolved tension with his estranged father. Whee. But hey - Edwards has bagged the beloved Bryan Cranston. Now the fun starts, as his intrepid scientist...grimaces and yells trailer stingers for 25 minutes before Edwards pulls a Psycho and kills him off for forced dramatic effect, right when he was becoming interesting?! Oh no. Oh hell no. Oh yes. Gasp as this mega-blockbuster lumbers along, agonizingly slowly, indecisively flitting back and forth between a bevy of quality actors (hello David Strathairn and Sally Hawkins!) playing virtually nameless, one-dimensional characters, expressionlessly mumbling their dialogue - generally variants of 'oh no!' - as if off cue cards. Marvel at the excruciatingly long cutscenes of military jingoism, where nameless men in camouflage frown a lot, and sit around aimlessly. Rah. But it's all worthwhile, as, roughly four hours into the film, we have our first monster sighting! At long last, it's... 'Muto'? What the hell is that? Yup - our main playmates for the toy soldiers are two generic Cloverfield rip-offs, who squawk and flap around whimsically as scientists grimly ponder their motivations. And, yup, we get to watch them bang too. And, it's...surprisingly boring. Yikes.But behold! After all this agony, there he is - Godzilla! The king of monsters! Look at him in all of his awe-inspiring glo- hey! Get those needless foreground set pieces out of the way! Tilt that camera up! Gareth. Buddy. How can you be this cruel. You get the idea. 'Realism', to Edwards, means the titular character cameoing in his own movie (less than fifteen minutes of screen time!!). Instead, swathes of hilariously uninteresting grunts shuffle back and forth, each time coming precariously close to a monster action setpiece that would probably be tremendously fun if Edwards showed it, instead of playfully/sadistically obscuring most, aping a horror trope that became tiresome eight years ago. But no - fun is nowhere near gritty enough for the realism on display here. Realism - like Taylor-Johnson's butthead popping up at each successive monster sighting through rampant coincidence to lend 'human scope' to the carnage (it doesn't). Or his dreary wife (poor Elizabeth Olsen tries, but deserves much better) making absurdly nonsensical decisions, including child abandonment, to require saving and venerate his manliness. But let's not forget Watanabe, whose performance consists of staring, bug-eyed and slack-jawed, into the distance. Over. And over. And over. Watanabe either has a shaky grasp on how PTSD works, or, breaking the fourth wall, is sharing his reflective horror at the disgrace unfolding around him. I prefer the latter. Let's be honest: he's really just here to say 'Let them fight!' anyway. And when Edwards reluctantly, fleetingly, indulges, it's...yeah, okay, it's pretty darn cool. Edwards still has an undeniable penchant for atmosphere and set design, and, aesthetically, he's made another downright beautiful film (when the perennial sepia murk clears away enough to see it). Alexandre Desplat's bombastically roaring musical score breathes as much radioactive fire into the proceedings as possible, but he's got his work cut out for him. And Big G himself is a visual triumph, all scales and sinews heart-poundingly rendered, and it's stupendously fun watching him show the Mutos who's boss. Heck - he's such fun I'd even watch a whole film about him! Someone should give that a whirl sometime. Despite all of these abundantly warranted criticisms, there's a rather excellent film lurking in Godzilla's ponderous belly. It's about twelve minutes long, and consists of all of the time he's on screen. Thanks to the power of YouTube or blu-ray track skipping, you too can witness this cinematic marvel - and cast aside the bloated, sludgy carcass weighing it down. Otherwise (and I never thought I'd say this), if you're hell-bent on an English language Godzilla, there's that 'we do not speak of it' one from the 90s starring Matthew Broderick the worm guy and half the cast of the Simpsons. It's trashier and sillier, but at least more fun, and - tragically - aesthetics aside, there's not much of a jump of quality. There. I said it. Come at me, Godzookys! -5/10",5,2,3,17 December 2015
Casino," 'For guys like us, Las Vegas washes away our sins. It's like a morality car wash'
","Perhaps proving the theory of cinema bringing to life the dark desires audience members dare not act out, the American film industry and audiences alike have always demonstrated a perverse fascination with the crime epic - films detailing the illustrious life of those prospering off a life of breaching conventional codes of ethics. Such is a theme that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese has returned to time and time again: demonstrating the pros and cons of a life lived on the other side of the law. And while Scorsese's mob classic Goodfellas charted the rise of a lowly hood through the ranks of the mob, Casino details the contrary: a life of luxury at the top of the mob, the consumption of man's soul by greed, betrayal and maddening violence, and the inevitable plummet which ensues. Although comparisons to Goodfellas may prove inevitable, (given the similar subject matter, stylistic narrative and cinematic techniques, use of brutal violence and even the re-use of actors De Niro and Pesci) to fail to recognize the staggering accomplishment that is Casino, similarities or not, would be unforgivable. Ultimately the two are entirely different animals, as Casino, despite its glitzy exterior, demonstrates a distinctly darker storyline throughout, as its meticulously constructed, precariously balanced criminal organization begins to be torn apart from the foundations, with cataclysmic outcomes. The script, written by Nicholas Pileggi (working from his own source novel) and Scorsese himself is a fiercely memorable piece of work, punctuated with harshly realistic characters and scenarios, and a slew of maliciously well crafted lines. Although De Niro and Pesci's dual voiceovers can be slightly distracting, leading one to believe that the film might have benefited from the elimination of the Pesci voice-over all together, they do provide intriguing contrasting sides of the same story, and one can hardly fault the writers for experimenting. The legendary Scorsese is operating at the top of his game here, bringing all of his trademark meticulous professionalism to play with devastatingly effective results. By moving his film along at a steady, blistering pace, yet still taking his time, allowing his characters to slowly unfold throughout and giving the audience plenty of time to drink in the seductive yet tainted luxury of the lifestyles of high profile casino officials, Scorsese uses his film's hefty duration to his advantage, immersing the audience within his story in a truly peerless fashion. With typically superb neo-noir style cinematography (with many lengthy sweeping shots, capturing the breadth of the casino in all of its hedonistic glory) and editing, and enormously well complimented by one of his patented soundtrack amalgamations, Scorsese's work similarly excels on a technical front, making for a supremely impressive piece of film-making. As per usual, Scorsese extracts riveting intensity and realism from his cast, with captivating results. Robert De Niro inhabits the role of casino owner Sam 'Ace' Rothstein with a masterful conviction and charisma, dispelling all fears of him coasting by on such an admittably familiar role. Joe Pesci runs the risk of being forever typecast in a role only a shade away from his performance in Goodfellas, but fiercely proves his peerless status in inhabiting psychopathic loose-cannon mobsters. Sharon Stone delivers a surprisingly powerful performance as Rothstein's endlessly greedy drug-addict trophy wife, entirely believable as her character arcs from smoothly manipulative to dizzyingly cocaine-addled and truly pathetic. Don Rickles is a charming presence as Rothstein's right hand man in the casino, and Frank Vincent gives a strong performance as a suspicious fellow member of the mob. James Woods proves grotesquely memorable as Stone's past pimp boyfriend, and Woods shines in his few scenes, chewing the scenery with disconcerting aplomb. Kevin Pollack also impresses as a smooth talking 'front man' for the more sinister undertones of the casino.Brutally intense and endlessly fascinating, Scorsese's crime epic delivers a sufficiently flooring clout to easily merit distinction from Goodfellas' shadow. A masterclass of brilliant writing, blistering acting and disturbingly realistic thematic content, Casino proves another towering accomplishment from the incomparable Scorsese, one worth seeing by any in search of searingly powerful and impeccably crafted film-making. -10/10",10,1,1,16 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," 'It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense'
","(cue the 20th Century Fox fanfare) A cameraman exclaiming 'Pass me reel R2-D2!' A gigantic dog (Indiana, of course) riding in the passenger seat, conjuring images of a gigantic furry co-pilot. Birthed from a childhood enraptured by Flash Gordon, homaging Kurosawa, and nodding to Kubrick, John Ford, and Leni Riefenstahl. And still so much more. It's hard to dispute George Lucas' Star Wars being the defining cinematic event of the century. For a generation of moviegoers it was a life-changing spectacle, inspiring the most joy and awe since Georges Méliès at the turn of the century. And if Méliès wowed with magic tricks, Star Wars is pure movie magic: spawned from a lifetime love of the movies, and redoubling that love for adventure and imagination in immeasurable audiences of all ages for decades to come.It's impossible to fathom how much of a gamble A New Hope was, yet all the cast and crew speak of having had 'a good feeling about this' (ha). Now, it's textbook: the quintessential 'hero's journey' slotted into a dangerous, beautiful universe of (still) unprecedentedly jaw-dropping sets, costumes, and practical effects (distasteful, retroactive CGI tweaks be damned), with a gorgeously scrappy, tactile design sensibility unlike anything anyone had ever seen. Throw in more quotable dialogue than Casablanca, a plot too exciting not to bounce in your seat for, with the editing hyperdrive exploding from each plot point, character, and lightsaber clash to the next at light speed, and we're blissfully, jubilantly swept away. Lucas's true wisdom lies in his committing so passionately to the science-fiction genre (previously largely wasted in clunky kids' serials), fleshing it out with enough stock mythology for children of all ages to dive into, while leaving enough mystery to let their imaginations do the rest. Even Lucas' whim to anchor his space opera on a political revolutionary coup and spirituality debates (his cleverly vague 'Force' is scoffed at as an 'ancient religion,' but we're all savvy enough to know it's, again, simply magic) gives just enough of a sociopolitical backbone to have all the high- flying sci-fi not feel like a superfluous toy parade. No - this is the grandest of storytelling, undercut with just enough ingenuity and wicked humour (look for the Storm Trooper bumping his head mid-chase) to still feel like an underdog indie movie. Somehow. We open with a monumental space battle, blending the otherworldly awe of Kubrick's 2001 with enough thrilling gunplay to put 007 to shame (sorry James). Then: that stalking, asthmatic tyrant, striking fear into the hearts of generations. Clearly, nothing would ever be the same. But, after seducing audiences with this triumphant opening, it's easy to forget how weird A New Hope becomes. Suddenly, our shootout has transmogrified into a shambling, nearly silent film full of inanimate droids bantering in a desolate desert, accompanied only by the exuberant whiz-whirr-bleeps of Ben Burtt's peerless sound design and John Williams nonchalantly offering up the single most iconic, elating film score of all time (including a main theme so transcendent no one would ever again hear a major fifth without humming it - sorry, music teachers worldwide). But before you can say 'made the Kessel Run in twelve parsecs,' we've met our sandy-haired hero and his valiant (sometimes scoundrel) companions, and are off to rescue the princess and save the galaxy. We're her only hope, after all. Nonetheless, starry-eyed with iconography and whistling the Cantina Band jazz, let's not overlook the darkness. If Luke scrutinizing the charred skeletons of his murdered surrogate parents(!) isn't enough, see Princess Leia abducted and tortured before witnessing the genocide of her entire planet(!!). This may be bouncy, kids' wish- fulfillment, but the stakes aren't just high: they're downright scary. When our heroes cheat death, beset by grungy alien attacks, wheezing psychopaths, and the muck of a trash compacter, we genuinely believe they might not survive - and some don't (RIP Porkins). Certainly, there are minor quibbles - Episode IV is easily the most languid of its trilogy, with some lurching editing and omnipresent wooden acting (recalling Harrison Ford's legendary 'You can type this sh*t, George !' gripe) - but these somehow only feed into its inextinguishable, pugnacious charm. And by the climactic intergalactic dogfight, we're using the Force too ferociously to keep Luke's x-wing intact long enough to blow up the Death Star to sweat it. Pew pew pew. Still, it's through the unforgettable characters that Lucas' space opera transcends to masterpiece. Mark Hamill - too gosh-darn bashful and fresh-faced not to adore in spite of his emotionally inexpressive farm boy whining. Harrison Ford - the most suave, charismatic scoundrel in cinema history (though for all his flawless, impishly cocky posturing, it's his flustered yammering over an intercom - 'Boring conversation anyway' - that stands out as the film's funniest moment). Carrie Fisher - too gutsy, sparky, and prone to bellowed, hysterically sarcastic banter to ever cave to a damsel in distress stereotype. Alec Guinness - impossibly classy as Lucas' playfully enigmatic Gandalf surrogate - trading barbs with the imposingly debonair Peter Cushing and the godlike booming of James Earl Jones. The amiable nattering of Anthony Daniels, jaunty bleeping of Kenny Baker, and fluffy looming of Peter Mayhew. And a supporting cast of aliens and robots so unfathomably imaginative, you can't help but want to clutch the action figures of even those who pop up in a single, unforgettable shot. Forty years on, and now the single most lucrative Disney franchise, Lucas' galaxy far, far away continues to change the world as much as it did a long time ago. Whether providing new hope for starry-eyed Padawans waving invisible lightsabers or for veteran Jedi gripping their Bantha dolls, sporting 'Han shot first' t-shirts, and watching the title crawl for the thousandth time, there has never been, and never will be, any movie quite as magical as Star Wars. May the Force be with you. -10/10",10,0,1,16 February 2017
50_50," Beats the odds
","Cancer sucks. There is no denying it. And, as such, the prospect of a mainstream 'comedy' revolving around a young man who contracts cancer would appear a dubious sell at best, whether for fear of it being melancholic or flooded with saccharine 'laughter is the best medicine' tripe (interestingly, it appears the subject and blended tones have become somewhat of a trend of late, as director Ian Fitzgibbon's equally fantastic Death of a Superhero illustrates). Nonetheless, co-star Seth Rogen's proposed (and rejected) tagline for the film accurately and succinctly conveys the film's approach to its subject matter: 'F*ck Cancer'. This is not to suggest that the film gears wholeheartedly towards Rogen's usual ribald humour (though there is more than enough to keep the film gleefully enjoyable), but rather its refreshingly straight-shooting approach to a universally dreaded illness that has already been rendered redundant through a succession of banal, pseudo-profound Hollywood weepies. Conversely, director Jonathan Levine and writer (adapting his own autobiographical experiences with cancer) Will Reiser opt for an honest, human, tasteful (yes, even that), and necessarily funny mediation, making 50/50 not only on the effects of cancer on those suffering it but how those close to them find ways to manoeuvre meaningful relationships around it. The autobiographical elements in Reiser's screenplay are what truly sell the film, as the film offers countless moments too strange not to be real, and come across as just downplayed and natural enough to provide all the hilarity, tragedy and poignancy that grandiose Hollywood set pieces could never approach (wait for a fleeting moment when Gordon-Levitt's Adam discovers a tenaciously annotated book in Rogen's apartment for a joyfully distraught emotional meltdown). 50/50 functions as one of the best 'tearjerkers' in years, because it is clearly more interested in making audiences laugh, thereby making the sadness all the more genuine and affecting in contrast. Equally, it feels all the more inspiring an optimistic to have a cancer film with a positive bent be based on true experience, as it serves to sell the film's optimistic approach as ultimately more credible than mere Hollywood contrivance – even a romantic subplot comes across as tentative and offbeat enough to function admirably within the scope of the film. However, the true joy is watching 50/50 explore all of the figurative 'elephant in the room' circumstances revolving around cancer that most other films would either lose sight of or balk at. Pivotal concerns such as the infuriating dismissal of constantly being told 'Everything's going to be fine', how friends and family being alternatively overbearing or absent can lead to an overall sense of alienation (watch, too, for the film's skillful editing and cinematography echoing these contrasts) and whether a bald head could offer the silver lining of a sympathy one night stand are all addressed frankly and honestly, and feel all the more effective for it. If there is a single concern to be made, it is that the film's pacing may feel ever so slightly off, giving less of a sense of a steadily mounting sense of urgency as Adam's condition worsens, but this too could be attributed to the disjointed sense of impending morality of cancer (as Adam suggests, everyone is dying, some simply faster than others), and thus comes across as a minuscule concern at most. Joseph Gordon-Levitt only furthers his reputation as one of the most interesting contemporary stars, by cementing Adam as a human first and a cancer patient second. Blending a clipped, controlled approach to emotions with steady, fumbling attempts to reach out (as well as a laudable foregrounding of Adam's less than redeemable features, both before and after his diagnosis), Gordon-Levitt is as charming and hilarious as he is heartbreaking, emerging as one of the most compelling protagonists of the year. Equally, while his presence may have largely functioned to help greenlight and publicize the film, Seth Rogen channels his standard brand of bawdy humour through a far more sympathetic lens, as most of his character's quips (telling Adam 'C'mon, let's go get laid' on the night before a life and death operation) come across as defense mechanisms preventing him from going to pieces. The two share an easy chemistry, and their buddy act makes for a truly enjoyable spectacle. However, Anna Kendrick effortlessly matches (if not surpasses) them with a stellar turn as Adam's awkward, over earnest young therapist. Kendrick's unique charm and odd, irreverent portrayal of pathos mark her character as undeniably lovable and Kendrick herself as one of the most gifted rising talents in the industry. Bryce Dallas Howard emerges less favourably, being unfortunately typecast as Adam's neglectful girlfriend, though it is admirable that the script and Howard herself work hard to ingrain the character with some small vestiges of truth and balance, and Howard delivers a strong performance nonetheless. Finally, Angelica Huston steals scenes with remarkable aplomb as Adam's frantic, overprotective mother, and Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer make a delightful double act as Adam's cantankerous but good spirited chemotherapy buddies. 50/50 may not be an out-and-out comedy or tragedy, but it is certainly one of the most hilarious yet upsetting films of the year. It may not be a 'feel-good' film, but audiences will inevitably leave feeling fantastic. And it may not even be the singular most definitive cinematic treatment of cancer, but there is no question that it is certainly one of the most fresh, enjoyable and human mediations on the subject. -9/10",9,1,2,21 October 2011
What We Do in the Shadows," Vampires, not tramp-ires
","In search of the final nail in the coffin of the sordid cultural relevance of Edward and Bella? Look no further than the supremely delightful What We Do in the Shadows. Here, newbie vampire Nick drunkenly parades himself through the streets of Wellington, braying 'I AM TWILIGHT' as a pick up line, only to be greeted with blank looks of vague derision. It's pristine satire - gently but insistently raucous, and playing more off of Nick's incredulous 'Isn't this cool anymore' expression than the gag itself. And the best bit? It's only one of a nearly nonstop smorgasbord of sneakily clever, deliciously quotable gags the film offers. If Shaun of the Dead's 'rom-zom-com' infused the zombie horror genre with a much- needed surge of frantic humour and schlubby humanity, What We Do in the Shadows blends vampires, who have already been subjected to oodles of daft action and risible romance, with The Office's mockumentary deadpan and a thoroughly New Zealand 'no bullsh*t' ethos, to similarly sterling effect. Co-director/stars Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi may thrive in 'chortle-funny' rather than the deep belly-laugh kind, but the chortles come so incessantly and raucously, they provide just as much of an ab workout. When you finally acclimatize to the spry wordplay, ('we are werewolves, not swear-wolves!'), lovingly integrated pokes at other vampire lore (including the bad etiquette of attending a vampire costume ball dressed as Blade, despite the fact that apparently 'Vampires love Wesley Snipes!'), and faux-historical interludes (apparently Naziism was just as controversial within vampire circles), you think you might find rest. But it's only moments before you're blindsided again by interludes involving a pair of impossibly stupid police officers, or laughs as unobtrusive as a cutaway to Waititi playing a mournful trumpet. The film is nonstop, evidencing a breezy, cheerful humour that is too earnest not to love. It helps that Waititi and Clement wear their hearts on their sleeves, with an uncanny ability to tease out the silliness in vampire lore while still committing to the emotion at the heart of it. There's an undercurrent of deep, anachronistic loneliness imbued in the film's leading trio of bloodsuckers, which somehow makes their interludes of squabbling over the (five years) overdue dishes, or forlornly learning how to use Facebook all the funnier in their sweetness. Similarly, in this realm of immortal horror monsters, death comes fast, furious, and with unapologetic bluntness, and the cheerful interjections of staggering bloodiness that sprinkle throughout the film (sometimes quite inconveniently getting all over the furniture), or omnipresent threat of the documentary crew getting devoured, keep the fun appropriately gruesome throughout. In terms of cohesiveness, there's no question that the film is unapologetically episodic, like a prolonged sitcom episode or beefed up SNL sketch, but Waititi and Clement keep things nimble enough to keep the joke from wearing thin, before calling it quits with a chipper non-climax that's so nonchalant, it's only retroactively that it feels like it delivers the loose resolution you'd hope for. And, honestly, material this hilarious earns all of the clumsy non-sequiturs it can muster. Still, the film's ruthless silliness and sweetness consolidate into the perfect cocktail (presumably a blood-tini) in the hands of the effortlessly funny cast. As the ageless, effete dandy and tentative moral compass of the group, Waititi himself is massively adorable, pairing bug-eyed cheeriness with a cartoon Dr. Strangelove accent to tremendous effect. Similarly, Clement commits his post-Concords star power perfectly towards the enormous presence of his larger-than-life, crestfallenly ineffectual Vlad the Impaler. Jonny Brugh's scene-chewing rock star arrogance is all the funnier once paired with the clueless boorishness of Cori Gonzalez-Macuer or the indignantly neurotic Jackie van Beek as scene partners. Finally, Stuart Rutherford redefines the potential of the comedic deadpan as impossibly unflappably software analyst (and very human) Stu,* while Rhys Darby (don't call him Murray) is as reliably hilarious as ever, cameoing as an exasperated werewolf. Thoroughly sweet, disarmingly sad, cheerfully bloody, and infectiously watchable, What We Do in the Shadows proves one of a preciously slim caste of horror spoofs with genuine wings. While it's inevitably prime material to be gobbled up by Flight of the Conchords converts, it's also accessibly goofy enough to stand alone as one of the most unobtrusively funny sleeper hit comedies of the past several years. Just be cautious not to falsely publicize the film amidst the lingering forces of Twihards, or risk incurring Clement and Waititi intoning that these are vampires, not tramp-ires. Zing. -9/10*Also, did you realize 'Don't eat Stu!' was a pun? Because I didn't until long after the credits rolled. What a delightful film.",9,0,2,8 January 2017
Deadpool," 'Shh - my common sense is tingling'
","Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wadeser, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, 'an avocado had sex with an older avocado'. This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent ('count the bullets' being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as 'that British villain' brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10",10,73,148,15 February 2016
Fantastic Four," It may not be fantastic, but it is good fun
","It seems that naming a movie 'Fantastic Four' just provokes trouble, especially when it fails to be as, well... fantastic as everyone would hope it to be. But Fantastic Four really isn't as bad as most people would have you think. True, it certainly isn't one of the best superhero movies out, (it was certainly bad timing to be released short weeks after the superb Batman Begins) or even one of the best Marvel movies, but Fantastic Four is still solid entertainment, which, fortunately, is all it set out to be. Director Tim Story shows a rare bit of logic (unseen in last year's atrocious 'Taxi') in recognizing the fact that the origins and powers of the heroes are too far-fetched to be taken seriously enough to play the movie in a darker, more serious manner, such as the X-Men and Spider-Man films. Instead, Story is content to make the movie fun. And herein lies his strength - the movie is fun. But it's when Story aims for the emotional impact that we recall how inept a director he has been in the past, and long to see how much better a more talented director would have made the film. Moments such as the rocky disfigured Thing being ostracized by society are often laughable rather than heartbreaking, if it wasn't for the strength of Michael Chiklis' performance. He makes us really feel Ben Grimm's pain, despite only being able to express it with his eyes, covered by his heavy latex suit, and his strong (no pun intended) performance rises above the mediocre script.As is the case for the Thing, the spirit of the original characters is successfully brought to life by the cast. Ioan Gruffudd is an admittably obscure choice for Mr. Fantastic, when one reflects that actors such as George Clooney were considered, but he proves to be wise casting, capturing Reed Richard's sense of disconnection from reality, so concerned is he with the 'greater good' of mankind. He comes off as a believable man of science, and not a parody of one. The casting of the simply gorgeous Jessica Alba clad in spandex will draw many male fans, but her performance is competent enough as well. Alba brings out the uncertain side in Sue, unsure whether to discipline her hotheaded brother in a motherly fashion, or act just as immature as him. (as she does during the inevitable romantic subplot, which is handled surprisingly tastefully, mainly due to the quirkiness of the very different characters of Reed and Sue playing off each other) As said brother, Chris Evans plays Johnny Storm as well as the script would allow, but the character comes off as disappointingly shallow - a typical immature hothead whose only objective is to have a good time. Another character who would benefit from more development is the villainous Victor Von Doom, whose backstory is changed from that of the comics to strangely resemble that of the Green Goblin from Spider-Man, right down to losing his business enterprise, and donning a mask from a personal collection. It's clear that Von Doom has always been a horrible person, but we are given no explanation as to why. However, Julian McMahon is suitably menacing, especially during the sequence of discovering his powers for the first time. While he may not be given a very developed character, McMahon plays the part for all it's worth, reeking cold, suave hatred and ego - a capable villain to counterbalance the varied powers of the four heroes.Overall, Fantastic Four serves it's purpose, which was to be entertaining. It doesn't strive to be particularly profound, or express truths of human nature. (as the X-Men films do) But with a mediocre screenplay, and a director who proves decent at providing entertainment, but struggles to capture the dramatic moments, the film leaves much to be desired. There's a consistent sense of 'what if...?' throughout, as if a better version of the film is just in sight, but not quite achieved. Perhaps with a more capable director and a slightly touched up script, Fantastic Four could have lived up to it's name. As it is, the 'Fun Four' proves an equally effective alliteration, and one which, given the final outcome, is more accurate.-7/10",6,0,1,18 July 2005
Click," A bit of profundity mixed in with the typical Sandler formula
","I must confess - right from the get go, I expected 'Click' to be a terrible, poorly conceived mess, barely worth seeing at all. The premise (a man receives a universal remote control to control all aspects of his life) sounded ridiculous and not even possibly coherent. Nonetheless, I went to see Click anyway, in the hopes that the always dependable Christopher Walken and star Adam Sandler might be able to raise the odd laugh. Needless to say, Click is far better than initial impressions might allude to, and while for the most part it is a comedy and a very successful one, there is a surprising amount of profundity mixed in, touching on themes such as lifestyles and priorities; what is really important for us. While the movie does follow the typical Sandler comedy formula of comedic beginning, sad climax and emotional, life lesson bearing happy ending, it is surprising how well director Frank Coraci manages to handle the differing tones of the movie. Unlike last year's excellent summer comedy Wedding Crashers, the more dramatic upsetting 'life lesson' segment of the story in Click does not contrast quite as evidently, it blends more seamlessly with the rest of the picture rather than an abrupt change in tone. That being said, there are complaints which come to mind, the most evident being that the more profound themes explored in the movie are only scratched upon, when they could have been developed a bit deeper to make for a more compelling story. It's also true that the movie relies on typical goofball comedy schticks such as fart and dog humping jokes, or Sandler in a fat suit perhaps more than was quite necessary, the child actors get quite annoying at times (though unbelievably cute at others) and the main premise for comedy being Sandler's continuous dumbfounded reactions to his world changing around him as his life is fast forwarded ('Whoa mom, you're REALLY old!') get quite tiresome and very repetitive after a while, but again, the material is handled much better than would be expected. It's true that in different hands the movie might have crumbled, but with Adam Sandler in the lead, Click becomes a roaring success. Sandler is the pinnacle of both moods of the story, the light comedy and more serious drama, and manages to pull off both with typical aplomb, showing depth and skill rarely demonstrated before. Christopher Walken of course steals the movie with his increasingly unexpected and hilariously oddball appearances as Morty, the mad scientist style proprietor of the universal remote. There are also welcome supporting performances from Kate Beckinsale as Sandler's character's wife, managing to give a strong performance despite a horribly written character with next to no depth whatsoever. It's also wonderful to see former Fonzi actor Henry Winkler, giving a charming performance as Sandler's father, and the voice of TV's Marge Simpson, Julie Kavner as Sandler's mother. Sean Astin also has a small supporting role, being mainly the brunt of jokes directed towards his character wearing a speedo, but a noticeable presence nonetheless.All in all, be prepared to be taken by surprise by Click - it boasts far superior storytelling than one might be lead to expect, and particularly impressive dramatic acting from star Adam Sandler near the end. Click may not be the most entirely mature and insightful film you've ever seen, but it sure manages to do so far better than one would expect. All in all, an ideal summer movie - worth seeing!-7/10",7,1,3,30 June 2006
Annihilation," Moldy phoenix
","When it comes to cinematic alien invasions, our poor planet has been bombarded with onslaughts ranging from ET adorable to War of the Worlds sinister, and everything in between. And yet, in the face of 'take me to your leader' overexposure, we've never seen anything quite like Annihilation. Appropriately building from what is known into something fundamentally new, director Alex Garland fuses equal parts Big Questions science-fiction (the film's closest spiritual sibling is 2016's Arrival and its rendition of a sentient consciousness that is fundamentally non-human) with inventively disturbing body horror, and intertwining, fatalistic environmental and psychological allegories, all stitched together through a slow, Kubrickian creep into the metaphysical. And if all of that hasn't deterred you, you're probably ready for the deep dive into the Shimmer, and to press the pause button on reliable sensory intake and reality for a feverishly engrossing two hours. Those familiar with Jeff VanderMeer's novel - the first of his 'Southern Reach' trilogy - are right to be suspicious: it's hard to picture a more medium-specific text relying more on surreal, dreamlike ambiguity, unreliable narration, and the unseen to convey its sense of infectious terror. Thankfully, director Alex Garland shows a knack for cinematically transmuting the dreamlike dizziness of VanderMeer's prose, with atmosphere and mise-en-scene so evocative the theatre air feels damp, and sticky, and our skin begins to itch. Garland's 'Area X' is as innocently beautiful as it is almost imperceptibly grotesque, with gorgeously unobtrusive FX lending the lush foliage a subtle sense of unease. As cameras airily drift through with a disconcerting innocence and sickening sense of dread, we begin to doubt our senses: is that nauseatingly fluorescent lichen speckling the trees moving, or was it just a trick of the light? Surely that wasn't an almost inaudible cry of terror in the peaceful breeze...? That flower assuredly didn't have a human face. That woman had all of her facial features intact... Right? The discomfort is woven uneasily together with Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury's unexpectedly zen musical score - an almost folksy guitar strum - that feeds into the film's tone of beautiful tranquility feeling nauseatingly 'off,' before showing its hand and imperceptibly morphing into a dread-inducing, spine-tingling drone that will haunt your conscious mind for hours to come. Naturally, some things are lost in translation. Although Garland impressively avoids caving to easy Hollywood closure (though he does throw us a couple of bones of clarity to anchor the plot on - probably more nuggets of certainty than VanderMeer sprinkles through his entire trilogy), there's a distinct skeleton of conventional structure and contrivance that makes proceedings feel just a whit overly familiar (particularly in the climax) - especially in the face of the freshness of the unrepentant, unhinged ambiguity of VanderMeer's Southern Reach. It's tantalizing to imagine what cinematic boundaries might have been pushed by a slightly more daring auteur - a Tarkovsky, Jodorowski, or even Kubrick himself, all of who imperceptibly flavour the film - let loose in VanderMeer's wacky, macabre playpen. Regardless, Garland is a master of the inventively harrowing set piece, and his film's horrors are sparse but chillingly memorable, and just as effective in their anticipating as their execution. Garland's sensibilities are anything but cheap: each jump scares, gory dismemberment, and horrific mutation feels appropriate and strangely elegant in their grotesquery. Ultimately, however, Annihilation is less preoccupied with fright than destruction and rebirth (individual and collective), digging into a mature, existential examination of change, not as an ultimatum, but as an ongoing, morally transcendent process. Natalie Portman's propensity to infuse dead-eyed flatness with such churning intensity makes for the perfect (un)emotional anchor amidst the throbbing madness that ensues, her unyielding, flinty making it her strongest work in years. Supporting her, Oscar Isaac* adeptly subverts his customary charisma with a queasily 'off' emotional disconnect, while Jennifer Jason Leigh commands the screen with an alarmingly coy sphinxlike grimness. Tessa Thompson, conversely, offsets the creeping nihilism of her surroundings with a soft-spoken, brittle sweetness, perfectly counterbalanced by the volcanic, combustive emotion of the scene-stealing Gina Rodriguez, cathartically the only character who seems properly perturbed by the encroaching wrongness of Area X. Don't be thrown by the film's tepid marketing and the insinuated lack of studio confidence in a simultaneous Netflix release. Annihilation is bold, clear-headed, and unmissable for all science-fiction stalwarts, even if its chilling warp into brain-bending surreality may be anchored on just a couple too many nuggets of accessibility to fully capitalize on VanderMeer's feverish tone. Regardless, Garland has crafted one of the most atmospheric, inventively creepy, and existentially haunting movie romps of the past several years, sure to itch and nibble at viewer's brains with images and ideas long after the jarring reversion to normalcy once the credits roll. -9/10

Sin City," Like reading a comic book - literally
","Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who also co-directed and wrote the screenplay) Sin City tells three stories of crime, corruption, and redemption set in the fictional town 'Basin City'. The first story details the quest of Marv (Mickey Rourke) who searches town for the man who murdered Goldie (Jamie King), the woman he believes to be his one true love. The second tells of Dwight (Clive Owen) who must cover up the death of a corrupt police officer (Benicio Del Toro) in order to avoid a war between the cops, and the girls of old town, led by Gail. (Rosiaro Dawson) The final story shows Hartigan, (Bruce Willis) a beat up retired cop framed for a crime he didn't commit, trying to save the life of a girl whose life he saved at a young age, who grew up to become a stripper, (Jessica Alba) while all the while being tracked by a mysterious stranger with a grotesque appearance. (Nick Stahl)It's a churning vat of old fashioned pulp style stories, each one more dark and edgy then the last. And yet, Sin City itself is morbidly fascinating; if you don't mind delving through the haze of sleaze, violence and corruption you'll find a really compelling story underneath the hard exterior. Sin City exudes the essence of classic film noir, except combined with over-the-top violence, characters and dialogue to maintain that comic book feel. Giving co-director status to creator Frank Miller and allowing him to write the screenplay was perhaps the wisest move director Robert Rodriguez ever made, because Miller's gritty influence shines through, perfectly capturing the mood of his original creations.And the visuals... extraordinary. The entire film is shot in black and white, except for certain items which appear in colour. (a red dress, red blood, although sometimes the blood is stark white, and not to mention Nick Stahl's character, Yellow Bastard, who is, indeed, yellow) Rodriguez is also smart enough to use a greenscreen backdrop, so as to recreate Miller's gritty, moody sets by computer animation instead of trying to create them first hand. And it works, wonderfully - the sets perfectly set the tone for the rest of the movie: dark, bold, over-the-top and quality work unlike any other. Add the characters' noirish costumes (almost every male character sports, as Marv puts it, a 'damn fine coat') unique appearances, (it says a lot for the quality of the movie when a character like Yellow Bastard doesn't seem out of place) and movement (take note that if the movie was paused at any given point, the frame would look like a panel from a comic book) and Miller and Rodriguez perfectly nail the comic book feel.It also helps that a wonderful cast has been assembled to bring life to the mayhem. Spot on performances abroad here, but the standouts in my opinion were Elijah Wood, who was truly chilling as Kevin, the silent, cannibalistic serial killer; Nick Stahl as Roarke Junior/Yellow Bastard, a truly creepy and disgusting character; Clive Owen, playing against type as Dwight; (who isn't exactly a sophisticated, British gentleman, but then again, no one in this film is) Mickey Rourke as Marv, managing to turn out a stunning performance, even with his face buried under several layers of latex; Benicio Del Toro almost unrecognizable as corrupt cop Jackie Boy and a welcome appearance from Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, an enforcer specializing in inflicting pain. The hard edged ladies also do a great job, with Jessica Alba, Rosiaro Dawson, Carla Gugino, Jamie King and the rest all giving great performances.It's all in the style of such films as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, so it may be wise to use those films as guidelines of what to expect in terms of content. It's true that Sin City is not for everyone: the violence is brutal and unflinching, most characters are disreputable, manipulative and sleazy, and the whole feel of the film is undesirable, and not too cheery. But if none of that deters you, Sin City should be known as a must see, for the superb visual stylistics if nothing else. But the style and feel of the comic books is perfectly captured and thrust into our faces. Frank Miller must be proud.-10/10",10,21,23,1 May 2005
Spectre," Timeliness threatens Timelessness
","Anniversary hangovers can be particularly rough, and few have more practice than the world's favourite martini-guzzling secret agent. Why, when he celebrated his 40th, he took four years to recover, returning with a face-lift, more grizzled and gritty than ever. Now, after the rip- roaring party that was his 50th, Bond, James Bond has never had such a tough act to follow filling his own shoes. This may have been easier if 007 hadn't, as usual, taken on impossible odds by juggling his own paradoxical expectations (still tormented but ALSO breezier, classic Bond fun? Gah!) and trying to outperform every other comparably popular contemporary franchise to boot. As such, Spectre, Bond's second outing headed by the visionary Sam Mendes, is an overall rewarding but frustratingly muddy committee-scripted affair, caught in a tug-of-war between innumerable creative visions, and neglecting to fully satisfy any of them – a 'kite in a hurricane' indeed. Bond has always struggled with somewhat of a genre inferiority complex, swaying with the tides of each action film trend du-jour, while carefully maintaining his core constitution. Often this is advantageous – we wouldn't have the sophisticated Daniel Craig run had Casino Royale not been caught in the crosshairs of Jason Bourne and Batman Begins. But, nine years later, Bond's arch-nemesis is a different superhero altogether: Marvel Studios, and their increasingly insufferable insistence on connective tissue 'universe building', which threatens to topple the film. Spectre begins with a phenomenally gripping pre-credits sequence, easily among the franchise's very best, opening with a silky Touch of Evil tracking shot through the impeccably choreographed mayhem of Mexico city's Día De Los Muertos festivities, and closing with a bone-crunching helicopter tussle teetering perilously close to the vast crowds (Mendes oversteps somewhat with the plodding, theme-bait title card, though). The opening credits are classic campy fun, in spite of Sam Smith's instantly forgettable theme tune dud, though the octopus imagery verges on hentei a bit too close for comfort (but hey – who's to say Bond's tastes haven't changed through the years?). Immediately, after some topical rumblings about drone surveillance, Bond is off, and the audience is enthusiastically along for the ride. Alas, the ride is long. Mendes is an elegantly precise director, and with the help of Hoyte Van Hoytema's soaring cinematography and Thomas Newman's sumptuously textured musical riffing, conjures up some of the franchise's most sensorially lush sequences. But, while Mendes' classical (read: leisurely) sensibilities were only occasionally intrusive in Skyfall, Spectre breaching two-and-a-half hours (Bond's longest outing yet) feels increasingly indulgently lumbering. It doesn't help that, come the halfway point, Spectre becomes almost more intertextual quilt than film, shoehorning tenuous expository linkages between Craig's last three films into a plot audaciously pilfered from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and a far lazier rendition to boot. It's a major misfire, and the uneven footing makes the film's tentative leanings towards the conspiratorial silliness of the Connery/Moore era an even wonkier suture with Craig's characteristic grimness, which Mendes is reluctant to fully relinquish. It's far from a complete bust, with a slew of cathartic combustibles and rip-roaring car chases (and Mendes is classy enough not to sully them with needlessly jittery intensified continuity), and gorgeous location-hopping that are quintessential Bond, but Spectre is so top-heavy in terms of quality and originality that its plentiful good bits grow increasingly difficult to remember. Trouble is, with so many prominent nods to early 007 romps (albeit integrated far more tactfully than the cloying winks of Die Another Day), and only the laziest husk of a conceit to fall back on, the film has increasingly little of its own to give.Craig, who memorably hyped the film by saying would rather slit his wrists than reprise the tux (perhaps rocking the Goldfinger white tux here was sufficient), hits all the marks with his usual flinty charisma, even offering a sprinkling of icy wit and repartee. Nonetheless, his brawny, surly vulnerability feels palpably strained, making two-and-a-half hours of him frowning somewhat belaboured. Mendes assembles a tremendous supporting cast, but sadly fails to utilize any satisfactorily. Léa Seydoux (recycled from competitor Mission: Impossible – the nerve!) is tenaciously emotive and magnetically engaging, but saddled with a far too bland a characterization to elevate her beyond 'the average Bond girl', as Mendes strives to. Particularly disappointing is Christoph Waltz, who, after a superbly creepy shadowy introductory sequence, glazes over while expounding the film's clumsy chronology and continuity (with an ill-advised 'big reveal' moment falling flat). It's a genuine shame to see Waltz slump where he should strut. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, and Ben Whishaw are all perfectly charming as Bond's new MI6 family (Whishaw in particular is a goldmine of crisp one-liners), but Andrew Scott's spark is constricted by his 'Moriarty-lite' archetype. Particularly dishearteningly marginalized is Dave Bautista, credibly intimidating, but utterly wasted as generic muscle without any defining quirks to elevate him to the timeless Oddjob-calibre he deserves. Meanwhile, Monica Bellucci, nailing an achingly nuanced performance that somehow, with a single tear, reconciles the emotional state of Bond's pantheon of one-night stands, is kept to a disgracefully brief cameo. For shame.The real irony: Bond has now survived for 53 years with a timeless, iconic formula, only tweaking when necessary. To see him quiver with self-consciousness here marks a worrisome juncture where his figurative grandchildren (Mission: Impossible, spy spoofs such as Kingsmen and The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and even superhero films themselves) threaten to jostle him into irrelevance and antiquity if confident stability is not asserted. Daniel Craig has spent the last four films reaffirming that, yes, the world unequivocally does still need James Bond to return – and the plethora of phenomenal entertainment in Spectre's first half further substantiates it. It's time he started believing so himself. And if it takes another face-lift to see that actualized, perhaps it's time to give Craig the break he craves, and hit the casting floors for the next Bond, James Bond. -6/10",6,4,9,10 November 2015
Moon," 'I want to go home'
","Calling a film 'the antithesis to Transformers 2' may not seem the most obvious complimentary statement, yet that has, comically enough, been the most common plaudit bestowed on director Duncan Jones' Moon. Most critics have heralded the film as a welcome bout of intelligence in a summer where science fiction is generally synonymous with explosions. Which is entirely true, and would be an unremarkable compliment, were it not for the fact that to distill Moon to simply being an intelligent film released in a season where thoughtfulness is a rare quality in mainstream cinema would be a notable instance of short- sightedness, for Jones' film is a rather remarkable concoction, and one well worth seeing regardless of the season or year. While the science fiction genre is known for examining the future, Moon, while set 15 years from present time, clearly has its eye on the past. With a wonderfully nostalgic lo-fi veneer, complete with chunky lunar buggies and medical style white walled space station, Jones picks his influences well, paying homage to the wealth of slow burning, existential science fiction ruminations of the 1960s and 1970s (most obviously Kubrik's 2001), both visually and thematically without ever drifting into over the top excessively cheeky referencing. And yet, Moon proves an appealing contradiction, as, despite its lofty, challenging ideas, they are presented in a format far more accessible, unpretentious and easy to follow than most of the past efforts it emulates, as if determined to meld a mainstream template with a more elaborate, art cinema aesthetic. The hybridity works, making Moon far more than a mere throwback film, and a far more beguiling and intriguing take on content both familiar and new.The word of choice is sparse, as Jones captures the cold isolation of solitary employment on a space station with particularly chilling efficiency, using expansive yet claustrophobia inducing sets to deftly craft a sense of continual unease and discontent, exceptionally amplified by Clint Mansell's minimalist piano score. But what makes Jones' film stand out amongst countless other science fiction efforts with coldly pristine visuals ruminating on the essence and meaning of humanity are its welcome moments of warmth and humour. From the blinking smiley face of robotic companion GERTY (superbly voiced by a monotone Kevin Spacey) to protagonist Sam Bell's teary fondling the screen while playing a tape of his daughter back on earth, seldom do such films dare to engage with the heart as much as the brain - less detached and far more engrossing through its emotional resonance. Above all else, it is the exceptional performance of Sam Rockwell which anchors the film. Stuck with essentially a solitary show in a static location, Rockwell delivers a triumphant character study without unnecessary showboating, compellingly portraying Bell's intense loneliness, boredom and gradual mental instability through perfectly calculated frantic bursts between manic energy and subdued pain. Never anything less than riveting while quietly unassuming, the always wonderful Rockwell has rarely been better, and his work here proves concrete testament of his star calibre charisma and presence. Thought provoking yet accessible, slow burning yet consistently engaging, Moon proves the ideal reprocessing of the science fiction of old, blending familiar visuals and themes with recent ones into something fundamentally new. While it may not quite be profound or innovative enough to mark a new staple in the genre, Moon marks a large step for the contemporary relevance of science fiction, being easily worth examining for those seeking out intelligent life in the dark recesses of modern cinema. -8.5/10",8,2,3,7 August 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Cinematic life imitates art; an uplifting, unexpected triumph
","If there is anything director Danny Boyle seemingly refuses to do, it is play to expectations. Following a slew of praise circling around his recent delving into science fiction (superb zombie film 28 Days Later and existential space travel film Sunshine), it is hard to imagine a project more out of left field for Boyle than a game show centered romance set in India. But however unconventional it may appear, the conviction and passion Boyle invested into what is arguably his strongest piece of cinema makes Slumdog Millionaire, much like its subject matter, seemingly overcome all obstacles and adversities to end up as the almost universally recognized smash hit of the year. Upon attempting in to zero in on the film's massive source of appeal, it would seem that it is the odd juxtaposition between the gritty urban realism of its setting and magic realism of its central conceit which makes the film such an appealing oddity. What might have emerged as a relatively typical story of underdog romance in a different setting or set of circumstances is transformed into an honest, pathos tinged yet triumphantly uplifting hymn to life and persistence through adversity. Boyle's emphasis on the hardships of growing up in a poverty stricken Indian slum makes protagonist Jamal's inevitable triumph all the more jubilant, as the audience's sympathies are so resoundingly behind him after surviving his incredible, harrowing journey together. After two hours of struggle, hardships and despair, one can't help but earnestly wish for him to overcome the obstacles in his path and have his stubbornly single-minded determination be rewarded by the sort of happy ending only the movies could truly deliver, making what otherwise may have proved a cop out of a happy ending instead a rejuvenating entry into the pantheon of movie magic. Of course the technical plaudits of Boyle's film are inescapably masterful, combining A.R. Rahman's pulsating powerful musical score and director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle's raw, violently mobile Scorsese-esq camera-work for a depiction of Indian slums erupting into urgent cinematic life. Dealing with potentially tricky setting, Boyle deals with his subject matter with the utmost of sensitivity and tastefulness, never exploiting the poverty to the point of formulating an urban testament to the horrors of humanity's excesses, but instead driving home his dramatic point while still extracting a hauntingly beautiful as well as chilling aesthetic out of mountains of garbage, violence and destitution. However, beautiful or not, the film is often a difficult watch, with Boyle refusing to shy away from some of the more brutal aspects of Indian slum life, including orphaned beggar children having their eyes put out with hot spoons to attract more pity and money from passers by, and the infamous torture sequence where Jamal is interrogated under suspicion of cheating at the game show. Far from being senseless, these moments of brutality establish a deadly reality to the tone of fantasy romance which might otherwise overtake the film, keeping an appealingly balanced and understated tone throughout. Nonetheless, countless plaudits or not, the film is hardly perfect, as it cannot be denied that the basic premise of Jamal's life experiences coincidentally serving to provide him with the answers to each 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' question strains credulity to excessive points (as well as the latter questions of the game-show coming across as conspicuously easy to fit the narrative), but so firmly does Boyle manoeuvre audience sentiment that this potentially hokey approach instead becomes one the viewer urgently wants to subscribe to, regardless of the plausibility of it. Similarly, for all of the screenplay's strengths, for the sake of narrative speed or cohesion, character development occasionally suffers. Moreover, the 'history/social context of India in point form' approach through telling Jamal's life through flashbacks may prove unsatisfying to some viewers, but Boyle's neat cinematic sweeps, daring sentiment and punctuations of brutal honesty and realism make the film a lasting, troubling and eventually supremely satisfying experience. Co-director/casting director Loveleen Tandon's influence becomes most prominent through the selection and direction of the film's exceptional cast, who contribute an alluring energy and authenticity to the complex subject matter, unquestionably bringing the film to life. Dev Patel is truly heart-warming as the stoically irrepressible Jamal - while initial criticisms may dismiss him as overly bland, over time the harsh reality to Jamal emerges, and what at first might seem a lack of emotion later becomes apparent as a protective exterior of stoic resolution. Patel knowingly interjects with moments of caustic fury or sly wit which add nuance and substance to a tortured character, making Jamal instead one of the most inspirational pieces of characterization of the year. Similarly, the luminous Freida Pinto makes Jamal's love interest truly human in the midst of the horrors beset her, making their unconventional budding romance just quirky and understated enough to work, and not be consumed by melodrama. Despite an underwritten character, Madhur Mittal builds layers of devastating depth to Jamal's Jamal's ruthless, self-serving but ultimately human brother Salim, refusing to bank on antagonistic conventions and keeping his character frustratingly yet believably complex throughout. The supremely talented child performers playing the lead trio at earlier installments of their lives also demonstrate surprising versatility and authenticity, maintaining a human context to the troublesome story. Finally, backing up the lead performers, Anil Kapoor is slickly despicable yet perversely charming as the host of the Indian incarnation of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'. The combination of flashy, operatic exteriors and the old fashioned, intimate story lying on the interior make Slumdog Millionaire a winner, melding unashamed sentiment with enough realist social context to make it uplifting without being a guilty pleasure. While advising seeing the film may seem slightly redundant considering the swarms of critical praise circling it, reflection and distancing from the hype still reveal a film, which, while hardly perfect, has more than enough unassuming charm to warrant the recognition.-9/10",9,2,5,16 February 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," A boomerang powered by nitroglycerin (or: 'It's FuriOsa, not FurioSA')
","Early on in Mad Max: Fury Road, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the film's gas-mask- huffing overlord (don't call him 'Bane 2.0' or you will have Tom Hardy's permission to die) jeers at his pitiful subjects not to 'become addicted to water, as it will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence'. The warning may as well have extended to the film's audience to not get addicted to breathing. George Miller's retread of his apocalyptic '80s asphalt nightmare is arguably even more bonkers than its predecessors, bludgeoning viewers at such a gleefully manic pace that holding one's breath becomes as much the norm as the pounding sands of the film's eternal desert. The film, undeniably, is 'capital-M movie-making' at its most batsh*t, as Miller, finally gifted with a $150 million budget, orchestrates his apocalyptic fever-dream with frantic energy and furious passion. The film undeniably takes some acclimatizing to. No time is wasted on extraneous exposition; after a brief, grim Tom Hardy voice-over, the viewer is immediately thrust into a world of bone-crunching fight scenes, demented –and often deformed, or otherwise grotesque - characters hooting and bellowing while attempting to kill one another, constantly covered in sand, accompanied by the 'Inception-on-twelve-cups-of-coffee' soundtrack by Tom Holkenborg, constantly blaring like a car horn from Hell (so absurdly fun that hearing it on cinema speakers is worth the admission price alone). The prospect of spending nearly two hours in this world initially seems intolerable. And this is all before anyone even starts a car. Nonetheless, Miller's wild ride is one absolutely worth taking. Amidst the constant cacophony of overstimulation framing an almost cunningly simplistic plot ('drive that way, then drive back'), Miller has crafted a fascinatingly thought out society, and allows discrete scraps of bloodbaths over water and oil, feudal politics, and ramshackle, cultish spirituality to hit the viewer like bugs on a windshield. And, lest it seem the film had begun on too calm a note, the insane momentum steadily picks up – chase upon chase upon explosive spears and flamethrower-guitars and concussive sandstorms and blood and screaming and swallowing silver spray-paint and drums drums DRUMS. until it finally quiets down, perfectly timed to just avoid audience heart attacks. All of a sudden, we're watching a different film. Quiet, reflective, poignant, and gently desolate – a softly heartfelt interlude of a skeletal matriarchal society (credited as consultant is Eve Ensler of Vagina Monologues fame, of all people). All of a sudden, the contrast to the blaring first half of the film is striking: this is what's at stake, and worth the spectacularly named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron)'s mad dash to flee the dystopic wasteland with Immortan Joe's imprisoned sex slaves in tow. There is so little beauty left, the film suggests, that the few dregs of it are worth fighting for, worth giving anything for. It's an inspiring message, which, curiously enough, even extends to its antagonists: sadistic rapist overlord Joe is genuinely devastated and grieves when one of his harem, bearing his unborn child, is killed in the chase, giving his muscle-bound behemoth of a son (Nathan Jones) the chance to issue the most oddly sympathetic line in the film: 'I had a baby brother, and he was perfect in every way.' By the time the film ricochets to its even more haywire climax (almost exclusively filmed with practical car chases and stunts, and all the more aggressively thrilling for it), it has earned its insanity on an almost primal level, with the fate of the world feeling like it actually rests on one of the most insane car chases ever filmed. Tom Hardy has always been at his best when punching things ferociously, muttering like an unhinged maniac, so it's impossible to imagine a more perfect piece of casting as a post-Mel Max. Theron's Furiosa easily grabs the show by the horns, not only perfectly essaying the quintessential badass, but imbuing her with more aching emotion and raw talent than anyone would ever have expected out of a Mad Max sequel(?). The film's most joyful scenes involve the two of them forming their uneasy alliance, taking turns passing guns and the steering wheel back and forth as they clamber over one another in impeccably choreographed symmetry, forced to collaborate not out of trust, but more out of 'who's more likely to kill me first'. Each of the quintet of 'wives' – particularly Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Zoë Kravitz – impress, providing crucial doses of indignant humour, courage and pathos alike. Even the normally grating Nicholas Hoult coughs up a compelling character; his Nux, a teenage Gollum desperate for validation like a kicked puppy, becomes steadily more sympathetic and likable as he evidences the film's most evident emotional arc. In an age where too many audiences sneer at the CGI-bloated contemporary blockbuster, Fury Road provides enough of a tangible, cathartic glut of chaos and melodrama for even the most jaded to feel like they've finally watched a MOVIE again. By the time the viewer is finally left with a moment to catch their breath, they are caught between wanting to pass out as if they've just spent hours at the gym, or prepared to burst into a round of manic applause. Mad Max: Fury Road is a gloriously committed budget-bloated B-movie that is more engrossing and infectiously fun that it has any right to be. To paraphrase one of the film's most bombastically emotional moments: 'WITNESS IT.'-8.5/10",9,0,9,15 June 2015
Gladiator," Are you not entertained?
","Few films deserve the title 'Masterpiece'. Being able to capture the emotional impact, dramatic force and all around power of what we would consider a masterpiece is simply beyond most films that make their ways to the cinema these days. I think it's fair to say the Gladiator is one of the very few films that does not fall short of expectations. Instead, it easily surmounts them, drawing the viewer in, and forcing out of them every possible emotion by it's sheer power. We can't help but cheer when Maximus strikes down yet another foe in the arena, we can't help but boo and groan with malcontent as the purely evil Commodus (there's no other way to put it) plans his next scheme. Gladiator manipulates our emotions in a way that is fantastic to behold - Hans Zimmer's beautiful and majestic score keeps the mood flowing, and the simple story is brought up by the sheer scope of the production and the incredible performances driving the film.It's been said so many times by now, but Russell Crowe is nothing less than magnificent, easily deserving his Academy Award for his performance. His stunning performance drives the film, and keeps the audience engaged throughout - never once can we take our eyes off him, or be drawn out of the incredible story he draws us into. Joaquin Phoenix, playing Maximus' nemesis, the scheming Commodus, is stunning. The sheer evil he exudes must be applauded, as his paranoid, arrogant, power-hungry dictator is slowly but steadily forced out of the favor of the people by Maximus is breathtaking. We develop a genuine hatred for Commodus, and openly cheer whenever Maximus wins public favor over him. Few villains have matched Phoenix's ability to be genuinely vile to the core. Connie Nielson is also terrific as Commodus' strong-willed but fearful sister, living in a web of apprehension once her brother takes power over Rome. Oliver Reed, sadly in his last performance, is great as Proximo, the slave dealer, who as Maximus puts it, is 'in danger of becoming a good man'. Djimon Hounsou is wonderful as Maximus' loyal fellow slave and gladiator, and Richard Harris is a strong presence as Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor of Rome, slain by Commodus' murderous ambition.I am hard pressed to find any flaw with Gladiator. It excels in every possible area - wonderful set and costume design, a superb musical score, top notch performances, and an overall sense of power which cannot help but draw you in, and let the viewer witness the majesty firsthand. Are you not entertained? At the very least, you should be.-10/10",10,3,6,16 March 2005
The Social Network," Text-speak as high drama
","If the idea of the creation of a social networking site for college students yielding the world's youngest billionaire feels surreal, then the notion of a box office smash hit about a young man creating a website should prove even more indicative of the disorientation of the self- appointed 'age of media'. Nonetheless, David Fincher's The Social Network is happy to hit the ground running, apparently thinking of itself as a current day All the President's Men (or, as Fincher calls it, 'the Citizen Kane of John Hughes movies') through being a suspenseful, youth-oriented movie providing a 'commentary on its time'. That the film's overall tone is far more snappy, cynical and noncommittal is as telling of 'the times, a-changin'', as it is poignantly hard to tell whether Fincher's film fails to make any grander statements about its era or youth culture, or, ironically, through skirting the issue it perfectly represents them. However, first and foremost, The Social Network functions as both drama and character study, detailing the now infamous story of 19 year old Mark Zuckerberg's spark of internet genius spiralling into a series of heated dramatic confrontations, lawsuits, explosions of stock and cementing a place in the cultural lexicon unlike any other, now known as the website/company/landmark Facebook. It is important to keep in mind that the film, while rooted in fact, is an unabashedly embellished and fictionalized telling predicated more on dramatic effect than factual realism (with some of the points of the story reeking more of obvious artifice than others – particularly the tragically ironic ending). However, if nothing else, there is no doubt that Fincher and screen writing Aaron Sorkin have created one of the more exciting films of college students speaking fervently over computers to hit cinemas in ages, as Sorkin's slickly polished script allows each line to crackle with the visceral immediacy of a fistfight.In fact, the film functions so well as an impeccably oiled machine that it largely vetoes its own concerns about bias within the story (whether or not Zuckerberg is 'to blame' for allegedly stealing the idea of Facebook from a commission from fellow Harvard students, ruthlessly cutting his own best friend out of his company, troubling preconceptions of private and public spaces and so forth), treating everything, characterization included, as if subjective, circumstantial evidence at a trial, up for individual interpretation and reprocessing. Sorkin leaves it nearly impossible to 'root' for anyone or anything in particular, as the narrative feels locked into a consistent feeling of wheels inextricably in motion, beyond all notions of emotional investment and simply intended to be appraised and marvelled at. One could raise the concern of the film being too emotionally closed and distant (particularly ironic for a film about a social network predicated on 'bringing people together'), were it not for the envisioned rebuttal, as if delivered in a rapid-fire, acerbic monotone by Jesse Eisenberg, that it simply has bigger fish to fry than satisfying trite, conventional emotional expectations. This is a film with a story to tell and a message about its times to convey (albeit in a somewhat muddled fashion), and, like a good piece of software, it refuses to compromise or slow down in the midst of accomplishing its core objectives. Even Fincher's visual aesthetic captures this sense of sleek efficiency, his crisp, clean cinematography drinking in a depiction of Harvard neither excessively romanticized or banking on stereotypes. Channeling the driven anxiety of his antihero protagonist, Fincher shoots conversations and programming sessions like nail- biting stakeouts and college parties as if alienating action sequences, keeping the pace brisk and the tone ominous throughout. If nothing else, it is refreshing to see a film set at a college which doesn't come across like a beer commercial montage (although it is clear which beer brand gave Fincher the most funding), thankfully concentrating more on the story and characterizations as self-contained rather than wallowing in attempting to deliver another banal treatise on 'this is what the point of college really is'. As characterizations go, it would be difficult to ask for a more grimly memorable one than Jesse Eisenberg's (undeniably artistic licence fuelled) take on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Muting his natural neurotic charisma through a steely deadpan and constant, unmoving half-frown, Eisenberg proves scarily good not only at inhabiting the piercing, controlled mania of Zuckerberg but also turning him into an oddly sympathetic, Machiavellian antihero, just as easy to respect and even like as to despise – it is easy to picture business majors worldwide taking notes. In contrast, Andrew Garfield brings a far more familiar emotional centre to the film as Zuckerberg's eventually jilted friend and business partner Eduardo Saverin. With a casual, likable aura and welcome strains of humour (one of the best scenes of the film is Saverin's agonized confession at not knowing how to change his own Facebook relationship status), Garfield makes Saverin's fade out from the Facebook all the more upsetting, providing intriguing counterpoint to Zuckerberg's snappy success. Finally, in a gleefully self-reflexive piece of casting, Justin Timberlake oozes glamour and sleaze as the manipulative creator of free music downloading site Napster, not chewing scenery so much as salivating upon it and providing a deliciously detestable face to corporate ambition. While it may or may not have as much to say about the presence of technology in contemporary social relations, the blurring of the spheres of private and public and the tension between individual or collective success as it may or may not mean to, The Social Network provides an impressively assembled slice of fun and profundity, with all creative talents concerned functioning at the top of their games. Even (or perhaps especially) for those few still to be drawn in by the seductive allure of Facebook, Fincher's film still proves an intriguing and even exhilarating watch, and one of the best films of its year. 'Like'. -8.5/10",9,2,4,11 October 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Shamelessly enjoyable; the quintessential adventure film
","Unlike most movie serials, for which sequels generally prove to be reluctant, hackneyed affairs, the Indiana Jones series proved the exception - after the consistent quality and inventive charm of the first two, the series practically begged for another follow-up. And why not? After all, Harrison Ford's rugged hero was already a public icon, and had made his way into cinematic history, and it seemed that the masterful teaming of director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas could do no wrong, without question knowing how to deliver an intelligent but still supremely entertaining film. Therefore, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was born, and quickly eclipsed the previous two installments, ending up with an almost note perfect adventure romp.Any viewer familiar with the first two films should well know that the film unavoidably doles out handy helping of storytelling cliché and stretches credibility and realism... this is, after all, an Indiana Jones movie, and such complaints are instantly brushed aside as the viewer gives in to the sheer sense of unashamed fun and adventure. The film, like the previous two has a timeless sense of enjoyment which never seems to lessen, no matter what age or generation the viewer is from. Although it might be passed off as a 'kids movie' by more jaded viewers, you would have to consciously try not to enjoy yourself when watching Last Crusade. The legendary Spielberg returns to what he does best here, as his seamless direction raises the series to new heights. John Williams' iconic score couldn't be better, or more fitting, and adds to the enjoyment of the film tenfold. And while Temple of Doom, the last film in the series, may have gotten caught up in its own dark drama perhaps a bit too much, the airtight script for Last Crusade never presumes to take itself too seriously; remaining suspenseful yet incessantly enjoyable, with tons of endlessly quotable punchlines (it would be a surprise indeed to hear that any prospective viewer had not at least heard of the 'You were named after the dog?!' line). But do not be fooled into thinking that simply because this is the most tongue in cheek film in the series that it descends simply into bawdy comedy throughout - the film retains, if not improves upon the political tension and suspense of the prior two, while improving upon the salty wit which has made the series so lovable. Harrison Ford is on top form in his career defining role, and it still remains to see if Ford will ever boast a stronger performance - his Indiana truly is the definitive adventurous rogue. But the main reason the film is set ahead of the previous two in quality in the end, boils down to a single name: Sean Connery, who shamelessly walks away with the film, playing against type as Indiana's absent minded professor father. Connery's comic timing is perfect to a tee, and he and Ford show unparalleled charisma - the scenes of them bantering back and forth, most memorably when tied to a flaming chair, are among the most enjoyable moments ever committed to celluloid. The two protagonists are given excellent support from the ever lovable Denholm Elliot, returning as constantly baffled Doctor Marcus Brody, and the brilliant John Rhys-Davies, reprising his role as robust guide Sallah. Julian Glover and Michael Byrne make for suitably menacing adversaries, though they toe the line of just plain campy a bit too often to be truly effective. Allison Doody also drifts over the top in her 'femme fatale' role, but proves peerless in the 'creepy and obsessive' front. Watch also for a tiny role from River Phoenix, perfectly essaying a young Indiana Jones in the film's superb flashback opening sequence.Although the Indiana Jones series has spawned countless imitations and rip-offs, this is without question the penultimate - the indisputable high point of the genre, and Last Crusade is arguably the strongest of the three Jones movies, perfectly blending adventure, comedy and suspense all without missing a beat or faltering in the slightest. It only takes a few notes from John William's unforgettable score to ensnare the viewer, and melt whatever cynical defenses they may be clinging to, infecting them with the sheer sense of fun. The film has a replay value like no other, and never is the sense of unbridled enjoyment dampened in the slightest, no matter what age of the viewer or how many times they have already seen it. If you are among the few having yet to experience the classic adventure epic that is Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - suffice to say whatever expectations, you will not be disappointed. -10/10",10,1,5,16 July 2007
The Proposal," Despite a formulaic template, unexpectedly sweet, insightful and witty in spite of itself
","A romantic comedy with situational comedy revolving around two mismatched individuals, a looming wedding and an extended family full of quirky characters - with such an astoundingly familiar premise, one could hardly be chastised for feeling apprehensive about The Proposal, or for dismissing it as yet another of a slew of formulaic, forgettable romantic comedies. However, despite well warranted skepticism, the film's main trick card is that, in spite of it all, it is actually a worthwhile watch. Despite its formulaic structure, The Proposal boasts a welcome wit, traces of honest emotion and even a dash of profundity, assuring that while it may not be the innovative cinematic masterpiece of the decade, it at least makes for a pleasantly surprising and thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience. Director Anne Fletcher demonstrates her genre experience by showing enough sense to, rather than caving to its inherent story clichés, hit them over the head with as much spunky exuberance as possible, making the narrative, however predictable, substantially more difficult not to derive at the very least small glimmers of enjoyment from. But what comes as the most surprising are the surprising vestiges of life in Peter Chiarelli's screenplay, with not only a welcomely barbed wit and some genuinely unpredictable laughs worming through the formulaic situational comedy, but surprisingly credible bits of interpersonal interaction. Life stories, personal quirks and inner demons shared by the characters feel a cut above the usual formulaic dredge offered in such circumstances, making the individuals emerging all the more easy to warm to. Fletcher amplifies the realism aspect with fleeting moments of uncommonly artistic technical work, frequently using high angle shots to accentuate closeted emotions and feelings of inferiority, demonstrating far more thought being put into the project than the sort of by the numbers mess it might easily have been.Fletcher even manages to work some unorthodox traces of profundity into her work, as the initially cute toying with gender roles (Bullock as the icy workaholic boss, Reynolds as her neurotic assistant) turns into more of an outright exploration of the male/female binary, of the arenas in which women commonly gain power over men, and the ethical and social consequences of the inherent imbalances and struggles. Carefully dodging caving to traditional patriarchy or outright feminist preaching, Fletcher manipulates her cast of alternatively credible or cartoonish characters sufficiently to point out the flaws in either extreme, while making the eventual leveling of power dynamics between Reynolds and Bullock laudably palatable. As such, in spite of all this, it is a substantial shame to see the entire work drift inevitably into maudlin, syrupy cliché by the end, as the sharp and snappy picture leading up to the teary climax proves a far more self-aware and intriguing animal, making the eventual descent into overt formula feel somewhat of a letdown. Nonetheless, there can be no question that the real strength of the film lies in the performances of its two leads, and the prickly chemistry between them. Sandra Bullock finally peeks out from autopilot, delivering a performance which, no matter how familiar, admirably succeeds in capturing the essence of a conflicted human being, and managing to be both contemptuous, sympathetic and endearingly goofy all the while. Ryan Reynolds, meanwhile, puts his triumphant mastery of comedic timing and dry sarcasm to perfect use, while also demonstrating a scarcely glimpsed potential for bringing credible life to genuine human emotions, purloining many of the film's best lines and scenes while never unreasonably taking command of his scenes. The supporting cast is hardly as remarkable, but most do perfectly suitably jobs, with Craig T. Nelson a sturdy presence as Reynolds' gruff, domineering father and Betty White managing to for the most part evoke laughs out of a worn out 'comic relief grandmother' figure, despite coming across as simply irritating more than one would care for. Malin Ackerman is given next to nothing to do as Reynolds' ex- flame, but Oscar Nunez is a welcome scene stealer as an unorthodox male stripper, bringing in many of the film's more raucous laughs. Despite its eventual caving to cliché and patches of false or unbelievable emotional exchanges, The Proposal manages to accomplish its purpose of being charming and enjoyable with enthusiasm to spare, while managing to work in some unexpected laughs, endearingly sweet patches and even emerging as a mite profound and genuine in spite of itself. While there is still a frustrating sense of the far superior picture which might have been, the film remains worth a watch, if only for the pleasantly surprising moments of quality which pop up welcomely in the midst of its more familiar trappings. -6/10",6,0,3,24 July 2009
Jurassic Park," Life has found a way
","I must confess to having always had a soft spot for dinosaurs. Ever since a very young age, dinosaurs have never failed to fascinate, interest, and more importantly, entertain me. I believe the same is also true for most of the general public - dinosaurs are just interesting creatures, no matter what way you look at them. It would therefore seem an excellent premise for a film, to have dinosaurs, which always serve to be entertaining, and show them in a modern context interacting with everyday humans we can relate to and sympathise for. And that, I believe, is the beauty of Jurassic Park - it's ability to blend the real with the fantastic, to make a film that is, in the end, fictional, and yet so grounded in reality. And director Steven Spielberg does so to the extent of his considerable ability here in Jurassic Park.Spielberg has shown, throughout his extensive career, that he has an almost uncanny ability for entertaining his audiences. Whether it be clutching the sides of our seat white knuckled in fear and tension or evoking tears out of the most stubborn viewer, Spielberg has proved a master at manipulating the emotions of his audience, and more importantly, providing them with the entertainment they want to see. And what better way to entertain an audience then an island full of dinosaurs, breaking loose and wreaking havoc? Indeed, Jurassic Park remains the best of the best of action thriller movies, still managing to evoke enormous tension and suspense even after multiple viewings. The infamous scene with the velociraptors in the kitchen still manages to scare the hell out of me, even after having seen it countless times. This is emotional storytelling at its very best.It's admittably true that the special effects are very much the focus here, and they are indeed enough to hold up the movie by themselves alone. Almost 15 years on, the dinosaurs still look and act astonishingly real, and the animatronic effects prove so much more effective than today's CGI bloated blockbusters, since having real robotic dinosaurs make them seem so much more real - they actually interact with people and objects like real creatures. It still amazes me what we are capable of, technologically in film these days, and it's really only the Lord of the Rings movies, Peter Jackson's recent King Kong and the Jurassic Park movies than manage to impress me to such a degree.But Spielberg isn't content to have a movie dominated by impressive technological effects - he still manages to bring excellent performances out of all his actors. All cast members are perfectly cast, and manage to come across as entirely real and in-depth people rather than shallow movie characters, especially Sam Niel's rough-around-the-edges palaeontologist Alan Grant, and Jeff Goldblum's eccentric chaoitician Ian Malcolm. But Laura Dern is also very engaging and affecting as spunky paleobotanist Ellie Sattler. Sir Richard Attenborough effortlessly steals the movie from all but the dinosaurs, as the visionary founder of the park, John Hammond. But performances are pitch perfect across the board, even from child actors Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards. Watch also for supporting roles from a pre-stardom Samuel L. Jackson and comic Wayne Knight.So all together, Jurassic Park is easily one of my very favourite movies of all time, and clearly deserves to be recognised as one of the most entertaining movies ever created. Just as John Hammond wished to create an entire new world for the pleasure of others, Steven Spielberg and his crew have done the same, working from the brilliant novel by Michael Crighton. If you are among the few who have yet to see Jurassic Park, I would strongly recommend do so. In terms of penultimate entertainment and stylish movie magic... life has found a way.-10/10",10,2,3,5 January 2006
Beetlejuice," Indoor Outhouse
","Hyperbolic as it may sound, there has never quite been another film like Beetlejuice. Vomited from the maniacal mind of Tim Burton, before his name became tantamount to an adjective, the film is such a flurry of paradoxes that it really shouldn't work. But work it does, not so much bending genres as warping and distorting them like the monstrous pantomime faces scrunched by its ghostly protagonists – a ghoulishly zany live action cartoon filled with wonderful weirdness, and an unequivocal 80s classic. Only Burton could transmogrify the horror of life after death into a rambunctiously mischievous fairy tale, but the snarkily cheerful Leave it to Beaver New England introduction proves a perfect setup to the ensuing punchline of the afterlife. Naturally, in the hands of dear Tim, the true horror of death lies not in the exquisitely realized, gruesomely surreal Dune-like wasteland of horrific stop motion leviathans, but in purgatory ultimately functioning as a garish, never-ending bureaucratic waiting room, with drawling receptionists thumbing copies of pedantic instruction manuals. The horror the horror! Indeed, for all its zaniness and Tex Avery-style slapstick, Beetlejuice is a film brimming with surprising heart and cleverness. Burton has always been at his pitch-black, satirical best ripping apart ideologies of 'normal life', and he has a ball equally taking jabs at our goodhearted ghostly protagonists (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, both charmingly flustered), who are tickled pink by the prospect of a 'staycation' cooped up refurbishing their home, or the house's posthumous inhabitants (the deliciously demented Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara), who tastelessly claw at postmodern décor or oafishly Machiavellian capitalism, goaded on by their preening design consultant Otho (the note-perfect Glen Shadix). By contrast, it's pretty easy to sympathize with their goth daughter (Winona Ryder at her surly, adorable best), who cheerfully pens suicide notes beginning with 'I am *utterly* alone' before it was cool. This all goes without mentioning the film's star attraction: Michael Keaton, as the titular sh*t- disturbing Bio-Exorcist. Keaton's career-defining performance is truly on another level of comedic genius, as he roars through the film like a Tasmanian devil Rumplestiltskin, riffing, swearing, crotch-honking, and guzzling scenery like the demonic snake he eventually transforms into. It's a tantamount to Keaton's wacky, manic charisma that he's barely in his own movie, and yet provides one of the most unforgettable filmic characters of all time from essentially an extended cameo. And yet, the film's most bizarrely impressive accolade is, in spite of this cauldron of seething, seemingly antithetical weirdness, Burton has managed to stir up a strangely, unprecedentedly feel-good film. Somehow, in its mad tornado of satire, gorgeously oddball visuals, and adventurously eccentric performances, seasoned with Danny Elfman at his infectiously bouncy best, and sprinkled with a couple of Harry Belafonte Calypso dance numbers for good measure (naturally), Burton's Gothic ode to the afterlife couldn't surge with more life and vibrancy. Beautifully grotesque and morbidly heartfelt, for audiences familiar or inexperienced, it's unquestionably worth reciting the name three times, and uncorking the spectacular insanity of Beetlejuice.(It's show time!) -9.5/10",9,4,6,9 November 2015
The Soloist," Powerful and poignant in unexpected ways; familiar while thankfully side-stepping cliché
","Sometimes Hollywood continuity can lead to enjoyment of certain films being undermined by factors external to the world of the film itself. It is in this way that Joe Wright's The Soloist, like its protagonists, experienced its fair share of 'setbacks'. First primed as a surefire Oscar nominee released during November awards season, the film was subsequently held over until the following spring, leading to dubious speculations over its quality. Similarly, the unexpected juxtaposition with a sumptuous, unintentional inside joke proved difficult to shake: Hollywood satire Tropic Thunder, released earlier in the same year, left an infamous monologue (coincidentally spoken by Soloist star Robert Downey Jr.) regarding actors selecting roles involving mental illness for the sake of awards glory fresh in the collective unconscious, making Jamie Foxx's role as a schizophrenic musician a source of ridicule for many. As such, if anything stands testament to the quality of Wright's film, it is its ability, like its protagonists, to overcome such external setbacks with its dignity intact, a powerful watch peppered with unexpected moments of humour and poignancy, making it all the more compelling an experience. From its very conception, the film marked an uneasy yet somehow functional interplay between the authentic and cinematically fantastic. Despite its 'based on a true story' tag (despite taking certain artistic liberties, such as oddly enough portraying Steve Lopez, in real life still happily married, as divorced for the sake of parallelism with Ayers), the film could hardly offer a more familiar conceptual framework. Hearkening back to many similar efforts, Rain Man being the most famous, a superficial reading of the film would suggest yet another trite, pseudo-uplifting tale of personal growth through adversity and friendship. And while The Soloist does fulfil such narrative expectations, Wright is too clever to stop there, and instead subtly bends his focus past mere conventional playing to sentiment. In numerous sequences, Wright's camera slowly extends upwards to a bird's eye view of the entire city or dwells on lengthy montages of nameless impoverished masses simply living their desolate lives, as if quietly needling the audience that the scope of the concerns depicted extends far beyond the individual case represented. This intention is made all the more clear by the fact that the final pre-closing credits title does not pertain to real life protagonists Lopez or Ayers, but rather states 'There are 90, 000 homeless people in Los Angeles alone'. Similarly, fears of an overly saccharine ending are dispelled by Wright punctuating his climax with a voice-over by Lopez ruminating on whether his actions actually did help Ayers at all. Rather than caving to easy sentiment, Wright lets the mood of the moment build, only to undercut it with bleak realism, adding most expansive degrees of gravitas and poignancy. Yet Wright is equally unwilling to let his film descend into the usual dour moralizing offered by other such films with 'social messages', and peppers his film with moments of oddball humour (brilliantly benefiting from his casting the master of deadpan, Robert Downey Jr.) to provide endearing reprieves. Similarly, Wright demonstrates his true directorial prowess through moments such as daring to take breaks from the narrative and often just sit back and listen, allowing his audience to be just as captivated by Ayers' playing as Lopez is, and it is commendable indeed to have a mainstream film promoting the power of musical concerts. Even more magic and haunting (and familiar, oddly enough to viewers of Pixar animated film Ratatouille) are Wright's attempts to cinematically 'get inside' Ayers' head, reproducing his auditory appreciation for music through a slew of dazzling colours and patterns. It is these fleeting inspired moments which lift The Soloist above the banal and the conventional, adding just enough unexpected or unanticipated moments to make the movie a captivating watch, no matter how familiar the premise. Nonetheless, as with many such character driven pieces, it is the casting which ultimately makes the film. Continuing a spectacular recent comeback, Robert Downey Jr. delivers yet another testament to his being arguably the most watchable actor in Hollywood as jaded journalist Steve Lopez. His unique verbal style and energy helping to swallow up the most hackneyed of lines, Downey Jr. is superbly charismatic and believable, not only providing most of the film's welcome comic relief but a superbly realized dramatic backbone, never once faltering as a commanding lead. Despite Jamie Foxx, first plugged as the film's Oscar grabber, recently being under critical fire for offering an overly stereotypical portrayal of a mentally ill man, his Nathaniel Ayers feels every inch a real person without inappropriately milking sympathy or depression from the audience. Foxx offers a real haunting life behind periodic twitches and mumbles, careful to keep Nathaniel highly dignified and self-sufficient as well as cheerfully accepting of his position, proving highly inspirational, but in somehow a completely unexpected manner. Catherine Keener also delivers a terrific performance as Lopez's (in the film) ex-wife, measuring a sardonic and critical veneer with a truly resonant human side, her excellent charisma helping to carry a stale 'emotional support' role. Tom Hollander is the most objectionable presence, feeling out of place and vaguely offensive as a snide, fundamentalist cello teacher working with Ayers, but Nelsan Ellis counterbalances him as a warm, measured and wryly humorous relief worker. While using words such as 'powerful', 'resonant', 'touching' and 'uplifting' to describe The Soloist might only suggest the film's worn out, superficial premise being realized, Wright somehow manages to stay a step ahead of the game. Extracting such emotions at unexpected moments or times while maintaining a final impact which is not only daringly bleak, but also quietly truthful without ever becoming excessively sombre and dour, Wright's film remains unexpectedly fascinating, and worth seeing even for those skeptical of the film's initial presentation.-8/10",8,2,3,10 June 2009
The Martian," It will survive
","Poor Matt Damon. In movie history, there's never been an actor to have built a career around needing rescuing. In fact – hey, wait a moment, didn't we just watch some space movie last year about him being abandoned on a distant planet? What's the point of another one so soon? What a rip off! Grumble grumble, get off my lawn. Okay, granted – the proximity to Damon's space marooning in Interstellar is a bizarre and unfortunate coincidence. But that's about where the similarities end between Nolan's space odyssey and Ridley Scott's The Martian. Yes, really. I promise. As Damon's astronaut Mark Watney might quip – 'Trust me – I'm a botanist. We're well-versed in sh*t'. Quip is the operative word - considering the 'man down' premise and Scott's space pedigree, there is nary an ounce of Alien's claustrophobic astro-terror here. The Martian, is, quite surprisingly, one of the funniest films of the year. Thank Drew Goddard, as his masterfully nimble adaptation of Andy Weir's bestseller practically sparkles in not only making thorough scientific exposition thrilling, but systematically using it as set-up for some pricelessly memorable punchlines (there are countless such examples, but Watney's unpacking of how he qualifies as a space pirate is arguably the best). While the creator of Cabin in the Woods might seem an odd bedfellow for legendary classicist Scott, it's really quite thrilling to see their respective sensibilities click into place like the Canadarm - unorthodox, but as complimentary and effective as can be. Goddard circumvents Watney's isolation by motivating his dialogue through regular video log entries – a genius and surprisingly uncontrived touch – while Scott, master of spectacular setpieces, employs every trick in the book to tremendous effect. The film's immaculate editing paces with supremely satisfying steadiness, always gunning forward yet never rushing, allowing the tense bits to speak for themselves. The Mars storm which maroons Watney is a masterpiece of tension, but just wait until you see the climax which, in true Goddard fashion, is anchored on an Iron Man joke. Flawless. Throw in a soundtrack full of gleefully obnoxious disco songs peppering Harry Gregson-Williams' spectacularly playful yet lonely score, and we have liftoff, Major Tom.That's not to say all is postmodern riffing here. Like many of its contemporaries, The Martian isn't afraid to go big with idea or emotions, meriting every second of the film's expansive running time. Thematically, apart from the obvious moral of every human life having worth (rousing in itself), the film is equally a love-letter to the adventurous spirit of scientific exploration, and space travel in particular (science hasn't looked this cool since Bill Nye). The film's release right after NASA's announcement of more space travel ventures being greenlit couldn't be better – between this, Interstellar, and Gravity, disasters and all, it's impossible to imagine being more pumped for space exploration. This is largely thanks to The Martian's exquisite, jaw-dropping visual effects and Mars scenery, so rich it's almost a character in itself, which gives the film (ironically) a far 'earthier' aesthetic than most planet-jaunting sci- fi. Even the 3D – normally extraneous – demonstrates painstakingly crafted depth of field for artistry, making The Martian one of the best looking films in many a recent year. And I'm not just talking about the cast. Okay, okay - speaking of, we're blessed with a treasure trove of performers here. Leading the pack, as the eponymous 'Captain Blondebeard', Damon, gives arguably a career-best performance. His 'gee whiz' charm is counterbalanced by a perfectly honed wry wit and stoic confidence muscling through an underbelly of utter despair, of which we get only tasteful glimpses. In a film full of aforementioned bigness, Damon dedicatedly farms for small moments – see the infectious delight of his growing potatoes in his own feces in Martian soil, or his grim righteous indignation that having nothing but disco music to listen to is the worst part of his isolation, while his quiet 'nah, I'm not gonna die here' may be the most emotionally pure moment of the year. There's never a moment of disbelief at NASA dropping and risking everything to bring home such a triumphant character. Supporting Damon, each ensemble member are practically bursting at the seams to excel in their given moments. Chiwetel Ejiofor finds every scrap of warmth, humanity, and passion as NASA's Mars mission director, while Jessica Chastain infuses unseen reservoirs of dignity and moralism into her mission commander without descending into archetype. Jeff Daniels was born to chew on the grim, deadpan dialogue he is even here (his icy 'I'm the director of NASA' is unforgettable), while Sean Bean is so ruggedly dignified and credible he even stomachs a Lord of the Rings gag without the screen imploding in a farcical meta overload. Michael Peña is pristinely funny while tastefully stopping short of the boorish mugging he is subjected to in Ant-Man, while Donald Glover (doing what Community fans will dub his best 'Abed impression') gives a hysterical cameo as a loopy and potentially genius astrophysicist. Kristen Wiig is unobtrusively effective in a rare dramatic role as NASA's PR director, while Sebastian Stan and Benedict Wong (whose entire career seems comprised of space movies) each give resonant performances. Even the normally intolerable Kate Mara's sulk is channelled well into the role of a snarky astroprogrammer – arguably the film's loftiest feat. Space movies are a vast and intimidating genre, and The Martian isn't perfect therein – there's just an ounce of predictability a dash too much Hollywood polish for Scott and Goddard's work to reach the realm of the Kubrickian greats. Nonetheless, work this vibrant, visually gorgeous, and hugely entertaining is still necessary viewing. In terms of standing the test of time, The Martian, just like its concluding musical number, will survive. -9/10",9,3,6,21 October 2015
V for Vendetta," Vive la Révolution!
","V for VendettaThere seems to be a common trend in the movie industry lately of comic book movies turning out to be among the most stylishly made and most entertaining movies around. Looking at last year alone, we have Sin City, Batman Begins, A History of Violence, which were all excellently done and supremely entertaining. Following this pattern of hits, we have V for Vendetta, based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore. Vendetta details the story of a totalitarian society in England in the not so distant future, where a mysterious masked man known only as V uses terrorism maneuvers in order to make a poetic point about the state of their society, in the hopes of winning more people to his cause. After saving the life of a young girl (Natalie Portman), V may have found an ally on his quest for revolution and change. This movie is a fascinating piece of work for so many reasons - there is the political aspect for one, and it is very interesting to notice the daring implied similarities and references to today's U.S. government. The story is endlessly compelling, much moreso than pretty much any movie of its genre lately, and each plot twist leaves us anxiously waiting, at the risk of coining the cliché, but literally at the edge of our seats, waiting to see what happens next. Also, visually, V for Vendetta is pretty much without peer these days - most modern movies are fortunate if they have a single image that stays seared into your memory for a while after viewing - V for Vendetta has a dozen of such images easily, if not more. (for all who have seen it, without giving anyway anything to those who haven't: think of the domino shot now) The cinematography here is particularly noteworthy, and shows incredible imagination and vision that most movies simply lack, sadly enough. And of course, given that the movie was written by The Wachowski Brothers, there are, of course, several Matrix style fight sequences and a bunch of contrived and philosophical to the point of confusion monologues, mostly spoken by revolutionary V. Fortunately, (or unfortunately I suppose, depending on one's preference) the script for V for Vendetta is nowhere near as incomprehensible as that of the Matrix, which makes the movie a lot easier to follow and enjoy, as it lacks that constant sense that the audience is meant to forever stay two steps behind the plot and be left in the dark forever. V's central belief of an icon being so much more noteworthy than a flesh and blood individual who can be easily dispatched or removed is a particularly interesting concept, one also touched upon in last year's Batman Begins, another highly successful and incredibly well made comic book movie. On top of everything else, performances are also very impressive throughout, especially from Natalie Portman as the haunted heroine of the story, Evey, proving once again how dedicated as well as incredibly talented an actress she is. Endless praise also deserves to be bestowed upon Hugo Weaving for bringing flesh and blood to the icon of the character V. Despite the difficulty of having facial expressions covered up by his eternally smiling mask, Weaving walks away with yet another iconic character beneath him, following up his last turn with the Wachowskis as Agent Smith in the Matrix. It is astonishing how much character he manages to get across with only his wonderful voice and body language. The movie also boasts a very strong supporting cast, with great performances also from Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, and John Hurt as the leader of future england - a sort of Stalin crossbred with Hitler type of figure, who is seen for the most part as a giant head seen on a huge viewing screen. In his limited yet essential screen time, he makes a wonderful antagonistic figure. Overall, V for Vendetta is one of the strongest and most entertaining movies in a very long time, following the trend of excellent comic book movies lately. Rest assured the movie's message will stay with you for quite a while after, and don't be surprised to find certain epic images or sequences seared into your head for a while after. V for Vendetta is one of those movies which mixes philosophy and profound critique of modern life with incredibly entertaining, fast paced storyline and exhilarating action sequences - definitely worth seeing, if you have yet to do so! -10/10",10,2,5,9 April 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The Ferrell crew do Nascar
","Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky BobbyIt seems safe to assume that Talladega Nights was one of the most anticipated films of the year, from all who enjoyed 2004's Anchorman, and wanted more of the same screwball brand of ridiculously random improv comedy. Well director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell and co. have all done their utmost to recreate the winning formula which made Anchorman such a hit two years back, and for the most part succeeded. There is, however, a noticeable change in tone, with despite the fact it was the insanely obscure improving scenes which proved such a hit with audiences, such scenes, which were basically the focus of Anchorman are seldom seen in Talladega Nights. There is much more of an emphasis on racecar driving, and hair raising crashes, as if McKay had the same sort of ideas as the last time, but a bigger budget to bring them to life, which was likely the case. That being said, if so, said budget was put to use well, as the driving scenes are exhilarating and tense. But at the same time, it's almost sad, because it feels like the charm and spirit of Anchorman's low budget hilarity has been lost - as if McKay put too much emphasis on the driving and not enough on giving us the back and forth improvisation scenes that proved such a hit. There are several, to be sure, but many feel kinda staged, as if trying to imitate the Anchorman style, such as the dinner scene where Ferrell prays to 'Dear Lord Baby Jesus' which starts out hilarious, but goes on far too long. In fact, the bloopers and outtakes played over the end credits provide some of the most memorable laughs in the movie, and it's a shame they couldn't have been better incorporated into the film. There's also the whole 'redemption' storyline, where Ricky Bobby is forced to learn the errors of his ways, correct his spoiled persona and learn the true meaning of winning, which I suppose mirrors the storyline of Anchorman, but comes across as cheesier and more patronising this time round, and given the somewhat harsh comedic tone, it would be almost better to see an unexpected unhappy ending, just for a bit of variety. Once again, Will Ferrell is given free reign to basically do what he does best, and he is truly hilarious once again, bringing life and punch to the character of Ricky Bobby, the incredibly spoiled racecar driver... with two first names. But as was the case with Anchorman, the supporting characters threaten to steal the show away from what was meant to be Ferrell's moment to shine - Gary Cole is nothing less than flat out hilarious as Ricky Bobby's disgusting loser of a dad, and if there was a single standout to be picked from the hilarious supporting cast, Ali G. star Sacha Baron Cohen would be it with his side-splitting turn as an eccentric and very gay french racecar driver, Jean Girard. John C. Reilly also raises many a laugh as Cal Naughton Jr., Ricky Bobby's faithful best friend and co-driver, who always places second to Ricky Bobby's inevitable first. But there are also several superbly talented cast members who are not given nearly enough to do with the material provided, in particular the criminally underused Amy Adams, who is utterly adorable in her far too short role as Ricky Bobby's manager. The always reliable Michael Clarke Duncan also gives a strong performance, but once again, audiences wish that he'd been given a slightly bigger part, or at least more comedic moments (such as a blooper over the end credits where he sings!) Ferrell's Anchorman co-star David Koechner also turns up in a tiny appearance, though it's hard to see why, as he is given absolutely nothing of note to do, which is sad for all those expecting another performance of Champ like calibre. While the more primary cast members are more than sufficient in terms of providing laughs, it's just a shame these incredibly talented supporting players were given so little to do. All in all, The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is most certainly worth viewing, especially for fans of Will Ferrell, or his last collaboration with director Adam McKay, but unfortunately enough, Talladega Nights doesn't quite live up to Anchorman in terms of memorability and quotable lines. (though the 'Help me Jesus! Help me Jewish Guy! Help me Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft to get the fire off me!!!' which headlined all the trailers is still just as laugh out loud funny when hearing it in the film, fear not) But Ferrell, and supporting cast such as Reilly, Cohen and Cole are more than capable of providing a hefty enough share of laughs, and for all racing fans, the Nascar scenes are exciting and tense. Ricky Bobby may prove just the thing for a night of summer fun, but there is an overall feeling of somewhat wasted potential, as if it could have been so much better than the very entertaining film it already is. -7/10",7,1,4,11 August 2006
