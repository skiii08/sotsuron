The Blair Witch Project," too much hype
","It seems like the UK is the last country to see The Blair Witch Project, so I tried to avoid ALL the hype by not watching anything on it and making sure I saw it on the day of release and I still think there was too much hype!!It was certainly different to most horrors, but I wouldn't say it was scary. It was more tense than scary.  But it's definitely worth seeing.One thing I found interesting was the fact that there's no soundtrack, when you think about it, can you imagine a film without music in the background when you get to a scary bit? I can't.  But that's what's magical about Blair Witch...it works well enough without music.8/10",8,0,1,31 October 1999
The Village," Great film, I loved it...
","I'd been looking forward to this film for a long time, and just before I went to see it I came on IMDb to see the rating and what other people thought. I was really disappointed to see such a low rating, and I skimmed some of the comments and most seemed to be negative. However I still went to see it and I thought it was excellent.I had expected more of a horror film and I agree with people that the trailer is misleading, but perhaps if the trailer wasn't as it was then I wouldn't have had the urge to see the film in the first place.I find it interesting that lots of people guessed the ending. I didn't have a clue...maybe I am stupid, I don't know. But I didn't watch the film trying to guess the twist the whole time. I watched it for what it was and I really enjoyed it.I haven't come away from a movie in a long time where I have thought about it so much afterwards.Excellent film, can't wait for the DVD. 9/10",9,0,0,27 August 2004
