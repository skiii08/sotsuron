Walk the Line," Fantastic 'Channeling' of Cash!
","Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic in this film--it was as if he had 'channeled' the incredible Johnny Cash, not acted as him. There was true pain in his eyes when there needed to be, which I guess isn't surprising given some of the things Joaquin has lived through in his own life (the death of his brother, for example).The chemistry between Joaquin and Reese was amazing as well. On stage as well as off, there was intense passion between them--sometimes positive and sometimes negative.Hard to believe, as well, that Joaquin and Reese sang all the songs in the film!To tell the truth, I didn't expect to love 'Walk the Line,' even though I have immense respect for the 'Man in Black.' Nor did I expect my very British husband (who isn't a music fan) to enjoy it. However, we both left the cinema raving about it.Worth every penny...I will definitely see it again!",10,2,4,13 February 2006
