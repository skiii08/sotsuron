The Avengers," 'The Avengers' kicked all the bottoms but...'HULK IS THE STRONGEST THERE IS!!!!'
","The meanest and most awesome comic-book-flick I've seen in a long time. The Avengers has it all.I am a very big 'HULK' fan and that's what shows in the movie along with the title of this review I am writing. It only falls short of the Christopher Nolan directed 'The Dark Knight'.The cast of characters is very good... 'unparalleled' to be exact, as I liked Edward Norton(in The Incredible Hulk-2008) more cause he did portray 'Puny Banner' better, trust me when I say because he resembles the most with the original Bruce Banner(or the 'Puny Banner' that's what the Hulk calls him) in the comics. What can I say, Ed Norton did not sign a longer contract with Marvel :(. Now lets get to the movie(No spoilers for people who have not seen this movie cause I really want everyone to see it). Nick Fury knows that the world is under threat and he plans to defend it with everything and anything he has. He has got one Scientist who can become a 'Noble Laurette' in a subject in one night, he has a Super Soldier who woke up after eight decades, one Demi-God who controls thunder-and-lightening, one sexy-super-hot-spy who would do anything for what she believes, a guy with exceptional killing skills who could shoot a bird from a mile with a bow and arrow and 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK'. Loki played by Tom Hiddlestone is perfect(just not as menacing as the comic books). However the movie unfolds with unknown enemies from the sky like the ones never seen before and more. This movie is about not one man or superhero(though it begs to be). What I mean is if 'The Hulk' is taken out dunno who would have won(I am definitely biased here, you see I heard the most whistles and applaud when Bruce Banner came back to Manhattan on a bloody old motor bike in ragged clothes both the times I went to see the movie) and I agree with them.For those who came in late please watch all the movies I am listing here Hulk(2003), The Incredible Hulk(2008), Iron Man(2008), Iron Man 2(2010), Captain America(2011) and Thor(2011). You need to see all the titles to know what is happening and please please please don't forget to see the end credits as Marvel packs a punch in the end(post credits scene), those are the most important scenes if you want to follow a series finale such as 'The Avengers'.I am waiting for Iron Man-3, Thor-2 and 'The Hulk - Reboot series from Marvel' before another Hulk movie in 2015(possibly). Sorry Mark Ruffalo but Ed Norton was more convincing screaming 'HULK SMASH...' than you however you did a great job taking over from him. 'Hats Off' to Josh Whedon for this awesome flick I witnessed.Looking for more from you Josh :). 9/10 for your effort.",9,1,4,6 May 2012
Van Helsing," Fantastic - Nothing but Fantastic!!!
","As I have mentioned, this movie is nothing but FANTASTIC... I have read both Mary Shelly's Frankestien and Bram Stoker's Dracula but this is beyond both. In the true sense of Novels, I have loved it. It sums up the futuristic and medieval novels to an extent that it becomes a story of its own. Whilst, I would not want any human being on this earth to miss this movie still for the sake of it, I will write a review. It contains and mixes Sci-fi, spiritual and gorish elements that make it ordinary but still it draws inspiration from all of these.The story is simple, Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman) has to stop Dracula and he does not know how. He gets a warrant from Rome and executes it with the help of his companion Carl(David Wenham). Stephen Sommers is a director of too much grit in movie making. He has chosen to give Mummy's incredible power and believes that just like God evil has its own will to move forward. This movie does the same. Challenge the Almighty and fail. The ultimate fight of Good vs Evil. Where good wins because the will and not the weakness of the evil. A fight to death that makes Dracula believe that he has finally found his match. The portrayals of the character of Dracula, Van Helsing(different first name) has been epic. The visuals according to me whether CGI or just plain movie making have been good. Maybe due to my Indian heritage I felt the movie was less time consuming still I feel it was perfect. While Kate Beckinsale, Josie Maran and the other two ladies make the men go mad Hugh and Richard Roxburgh make the women crazy with their intelligent & beautiful acting. It is a perfect movie to be seen during a holiday. Alan Silvestri makes it good with the background score and the people acting in it bring it to life. A story weaved with logic, reason and fantasy. A perfect blockbuster with good cast and music. Watch it for a good re- imagination of the books that this movie relates to. 8 stars of 10. Would love another Van Helsing movie with a bit more.A late review but fans' of Dracula, Frankestien and Hugh would love it. Still wonder why Hugh chooses movies that makes sure that the woman his character loves won't be with him . May be he loves his wife too much.Watch it as a couple of classic stories with a modern twist.",8,5,10,29 December 2013
