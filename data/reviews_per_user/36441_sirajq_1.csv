Despicable Me 2," A lot of fun, but Despicable Me 2 is no where near as good as the original
","My hopes were high for the sequel to the hilarious family film Despicable Me. However, they were not matched. Despicable Me 2 has wonderful, vibrant, colourful animation, and the minions still keep is laughing but other then that, there really isn't anything memorable here. The story is weak. The humor is mainly aimed at little children, which is not necessarily a bad thing and it ends all too suddenly. Also, the love story between Gru and the special agent (Chill, i really haven't spoiled anything) feels forced.All in all, Despicable Me 2 is an enjoyable Family film, but a poor sequel to the wonderful original Despicable Me.",6,3,9,25 June 2013
