Hereditary," Honestly just crazy. In a good way.
","Once it was over I was so confused and then I was like... WAIT WHAT? This movie was good as hell. Follow it closely and pay attention and you will enjoy every minute of it I guarantee. The ending, about the last 20-30 minutes, was just insane to me. It was disturbing and I absolutely loved it. Watch this!!!! They certainly don't really make movies like this anymore.",8,1,5,13 September 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Best Star Wars movie I've seen
",This is my favorite Star Wars movie ever. This movie didn't necessarily feel exactly like a star wars movie - and that is exactly what made it good.,10,3,5,14 September 2019
The Shape of Water," A great romance movie (for people with an open mind)
","I was so skeptical to watch this movie considering what everybody was saying about it. But once it had ended, I decided that this was actually going to be added on to my list of favorite movies ever. Yes, it's weird. Yes, it's different. And yes, it's not for everybody. (Obviously. That's the point isn't it?) Anyway, I would still recommend this movie to anybody, even if you go into it a little bit skeptical. I'm usually a sucker for romance movies, and this one changed the whole game. 8 stars, give it a watch!",8,2,9,13 September 2019
