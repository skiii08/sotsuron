Requiem for a Dream," Dreams dont come true
","Requiem for a Dream follows the impact that drugs have on a group of four people living in Brooklyn. The characters, Mother, Sara Goldfarb(Ellen Burstyn), Son, Harry Goldfarb(Jared Leto), Girlfriend Marion Silver(Jennifer Connelly) and best friend Tyrone Love( Marlon Wayans). 
Sara feels trapped in her apartment with no real identity. Her son Harry takes advantage of her for his drug use, along with the help of his friend Tyrone. The girlfriend Marion of Harry, is a spoiled and detactched rich girl with a seemingly good heart. The theme of this film is one of despair and lost identity. Sara has the opportunity to be on a game show she watches daily. As she tries on her favorite dress from Harrys graduation she sees that she cannot fit. The memories of the dress remind her of a happier (and thinner) time. Her neighbors encourage the use of diet pills and thus starts her decent into mental instability, weight loss and paranoia of her refrigerator. The director makes use of loud metal grating sounds as the refrigerator taunts her. Harry and Marion are polar opposites in class and choice of drug. She is affluent and uses prescriptions to party, where as Harry is chasing low cost heroin to support his high. The lost identity of Marion as a poor little rich girl in Harry's world further highlights this despair as she attempts to fit in his world. Including varying degrees of prostitution and self degredation. Tyrone and Harry plan to buy drugs, cut them and sell so they can make it out of the despair their constant search for drugs costs them. A deal gone wrong takes the money they have been saving and forces Marion to see that her escapisim with drugs requires actual action on her part. The lighting used for interior scenes in Sara and Marion's apratments are low and stark. The colors of grey, black and white do not change even when the drugs are in their system. The jump cut of getting the drugs ready, the dialated eyes and heavy breathing share the viewer as a participant in the rush. The despair and lost identity in this film are mirrored by Valley of the Dolls. Another film where despair is supplemented by drugs and the lost identity they try to replace. The mania, outbursts and destruction have the same feel to the viewer. Requeim for a Dream is a more than appropriate title for this movie. The despair and chase of the illusive dream life are haunting to watch, yet riveting to the emotions the film brings to life",10,0,0,29 April 2018
