Life at this time no longer greets any future, nor looks back at any past, it becomes a futile experience and self-consolation in vain In the emotions piled up day after day, he escaped everything but obeyed the time and kept moving forward.
So friends are so important. If the audience is the person who reads the letter, after listening to all this, they will think that this is just a young boy muttering, and then silently walk away. However, friends will not, so one person's story becomes the story of several people, the lives of several people are mixed with youth, and everything starts to change.

Oldboy," About Incest
","The brutal and almost perverted revenge caused by an unfavorable love is bound to be achieved by causing another unfavorable love. Ignoring the fierce bloody and psychological distortion process for a while, the theme of the film is clearly cleared in a clearer way. This incident of incest is faced with the brave posture of resistance shown by today's powerful ethical and moral system, and some kind of interpersonal crisis of modern people revealed in this stiff and unpretentious posture.
Just as Marquez said in his magical realism masterpiece, the end of incest-a person with a pig tail, modern biological science can also testify to it, incest will lead to deformity of future generations due to the similarity between genes. However, the reason why incest has become a taboo is not such a biological reason. To trace back the history of mankind with the population of the earth today, we can simply make a simple estimate of the population of thousands of years ago or even ancient times, and then we have come up with an impossible number. Such a fact of population growth. This incident proves that incest is not a long-forbidden and rare, but a basic fact of human beings for millions of years. The reason is very simple, it is just a small number of people. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a social organization without incest. Because incest succeeded in preparing the network of in-laws, it enabled the continuation of society, and people in any society without it would be unsustainable.
The birth and reproduction of human beings, from the necessary combination of men and women to family construction to today's monogamy, is a long evolutionary story. From the initial biological, physical, and slowly to the so-called cultural and social evolutionary path of today. One of the basic premises for its realization is the gradual increase in the number of people, so that people no longer have to choose whom to combine from in-laws; at the same time, another more important reason is not fertility distortion, but incest. The disorder caused by human relations makes incest gradually unnecessary and further becomes a taboo.
Therefore, the original primordial incest can actually be generated naturally; now incest has become a problem again. It is actually artificial. The most important thing is of course all kinds of sexual taboo thinking, which causes the so-called sexual repression. Sex has become a shame and even a sinful thing, and the lust can't find an exit. It makes people return to the ancient stone carvings that have only direct blood relatives and only a few heterosexual blood relatives in disguise. . In this way, incest seems to have gone from the ancient 'naturally forced' occurrence to today's 'artificially forced' occurrence. And this is the most important reason for the film to be almost invisible but concealed under the modern incest system.
Finally, in the wilderness and snow of the desert, the father realized the detached love with his daughter by choosing to forget. This scene is like the ancient moment when humans are scattered in the earth, but the truth is that this is an extra-legal place free from ethics and social taboos. Love itself is not guilty, even if it is not good, who has hurt it? In fact, it is meaningless to discuss the actual rationality of the ending. It is just a window that condenses the airtight cultural and moral system constructed for modern human civilization, and a buffer that dispels the pressure of the system. Belt for some people who can't bear the burden to take a breath.",7,0,0,25 April 2020

","After adulthood, the relationship with my parents is getting weaker and weaker. I have tried my best to fight for myself to live out. I don't think it's a big deal to be far away from my family. The pleasure of freedom diminishes the inner thoughts and attachments.

The Devil Wears Prada," After watching this movie
","I have always regarded fashion as vanity and the pursuit of little girls. The pursuit of fashion makes me feel uncomfortable, but as my age grows, some views have slowly changed. Attitude can largely reflect her attitude towards life. Exquisiteness, self-discipline, and love for life ... These beautiful qualities and fashion are closely connected. In addition, fashion can also reflect a person's aesthetic. People who understand beauty can always find the beauty of life.
A person's life depends largely on his choice, not his personality. Two people with similar personalities may also live diametrically opposite lives. However, no matter which kind of life you choose, you must do it To the extreme, this is responsible for oneself and for life. Once a decision is made, there will be a lot of things that need to be abandoned. When making these decisions, it is necessary to be decisive and determined, not to be nostalgic and hesitant.
This society is very good at implementing the rules of survival of the fittest. This is true in any field. Never complain about life. It is the key to improving your own abilities. When realizing your dreams, please do n't take the ideas of others too seriously, because, when a person makes a choice, it will always hurt some people. This is not anyone 's fault. Life is like this. When others stagnate, it is themselves who are ultimately hurt.
The relationship between people is not about accommodation, but about being yourself and showing your value. Use is not a derogatory term. To be precise, a person's use value determines his social status. Life and work can't be the best of both worlds. If you know the trade-offs and balance, you can get a better life, but you also lose the opportunity to do things to the extreme.",8,0,1,10 May 2020

","Two originally lonely people chose to live again because of the appearance of each other. The two impressive scenes were that when Leon opened the door, the light hit Mathilda's face, and her entire world lit up. And when Leon finally tried to walk towards the door, it was the same light. The light from the world with Mathilda shone into his world, but at the last moment it tilted down and fell, forming a permanent regret.

American Beauty," A Male Perspective
","Don't old stories from a male perspective say that women are too material, too fickle, and too hypocritical to make marriage unfortunate. Would it be an unfortunate tragedy if men could become responsible, not boring, and work hard to care for their families and children as well as their mothers did? It'd.
Because people are things without conscience. The male perspective and the female perspective are insatiable, hoping that others will clean up the mess for themselves.

Spirited Away," My Favorite Animation
","Innocence is valuable because it is not stubborn, or persistent, changed by the external environment. The biggest difference between adults and children is not the soundness of the mind and the clarity of the mind, but the growing loss of possession and happiness. Because there is too much temptation in the adult world, adults often judge themselves based on what they see in others' eyes, whether they should be successful and feel happy. In the child's innocent heart, the entire world is rewarding itself, laugh when you are happy, and cry when you are sad. Live simple, so happy. Chihiro's salvation and salvation all come from her innocence. Even if she is in desire, a childlike heart can always lead her out of her confusion. So this return to the self is not only because of the courage of Chihiro, but also because of her innocence from the heart.",10,0,0,17 March 2020

The Butterfly Effect," Can We Choose?
","It can be seen that when one of the details is changed in the past, people's destiny will change in different directions. That is, people's life will be changed in different ways by a little bit inadvertently. This should be the reason why the film is named the butterfly effect. But the meaning of the film is not limited to the explanation of the chaotic theory of the butterfly effect. It seems to imply such a problem: if you want to make the status quo better and have the opportunity to come back from the unsatisfactory past, the ending Can it be perfect as you wish? The film also seems to give the answer: when a hypothetical tragic ending is attempted, trying to change them from the beginning often goes against the wishes, leading to a more tragic ending. This should be the theme of this film.
There are infinite possibilities in life, we can only experience one of these infinite possibilities. We always think that if the past is not very good, it will be better now, but the fact is often that if the past is really not the same, your Part of the goal is achieved, but worse things may happen to yourself or those around you. Because you are not God, you can't let things develop in the direction you set up. Even if you have the superpower to go back to the past, you still can't lead the future to your design blueprint, and you can't accurately control the direction of destiny. When you are happy to achieve a certain wish, there will always be another regret waiting for you, and there will always be things that you did not expect. Because there is always an unexpected flapping of butterfly wings, no one can grasp this except God.
The accidental flapping of butterfly wings will bring a hurricane thousands of miles away. A change in detail may bring a completely different fate. If we cannot predict or avoid when and where butterflies will flap their wings, we cannot predict or avoid which details of life will bring us huge changes. So we have to believe that existence is reasonable, and you and everything around you are the best. Do n't regret which intersection of life you have taken the wrong way, because every choice you ever made was the result of a mixture of countless antecedents and countless details in the background of space and time at that time. Make the best arrangement. It is better not to imagine changing the past. Accepting reality and moving forward is always better than indulging in the fantasy of changing the past.",7,0,0,30 April 2020

This is a 3D movie, so I have to mention the special effects. It is really natural and has a sense of substitution. It has a very good modification effect.
In addition, there is another feature of the movie critics. There is a musical stage drama.

","The film is based on the Mexican Day of the Dead, a story about dreams and death, and a story lingered by affection and love. Death and love are the core themes. The story revolves around the twelve-year-old Mexican boy Miguel's pursuit of a music dream. Miguel loves music, but in the concept of family, their family is cursed by music, so his dream is rejected by his family. So Miguel embarked on a dream-seeking journey secretly.
By chance, he touched a guitar, which brought him into the world of the undead. Surprisingly, instead of being cold and horrible, this world is colorful.

Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Beautiful Once
","I was attracted by the artistic picture and soundtrack of this movie. In the past, it was the cooperation of handsome men and beautiful women, and it can be said that the classic picture repeatedly appeared in my mind. I watched their long-term love fade and then came a turning point. My favorite scene in the whole movie is the meeting of Brad Pitt and Julie. When the eyes meet in the air, I think something is doomed. The next thing is to fall in love and then get married and then betrayal. In the end, everyone is not hiding and starting to be the most real self, originally thought that the other party did not like it but the other party loves the most real self. I remembered that sentence, you don't have to change it for me, I love the original you",6,0,2,8 April 2020

12 Years a Slave," The End of Freedom
","In the long history of mankind, people's understanding of freedom is completely different in different times. Step by step, people in each era traded huge sacrifices for the beginning of the next new stage, bringing a little freedom to the people. Now that human rights have been greatly respected, our understanding of freedom has become a need for a job you like, a life you want, and a home in a developed city. It seems incredible to people in any past era! I don't know how people in the future will think about the problems facing society today, but the problems must be solved well. The significance of history lies in letting people in the new era know the tremendous efforts of former people, and letting people in the new era believe that many things in this world will become reality, and our pursuit will surely be echoed! Looking back at the painful hurried and miserable past can also make people face the future positively. This is what an excellent film can finally leave to the audience through its reasonable storytelling. It doesn't have to be sad at the end, but sincerity, hope, kindness, and freedom lie ahead.",8,0,1,3 April 2020

","Freedom is a wonderful thing, and I cannot find an adverb that can be used to deepen its beauty. Although we have lost freedom to a certain extent, we still yearn for freedom.Freedom requires ability. Yes, we need the ability to resist discipline and the system.

Parasite," Parasite
","But the biggest highlight of this movie is the symbolic meaning behind his plot. The family relies on excellent performance skills to mix into a high-income family and become a parasite life. Although the means are despicable and cheating, with deceit,overall performing is immersing rich families. Until the emergence of another parasitic family, the whole movie entered a dark and bizarre plot. The final vicious murder, and finally the plot of concealed communication by the Morse code, made me feel suffocated.",7,0,0,27 March 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," The Silence of the Lambs
","Watching the complete film, I was deeply impressed by Hannibal, played by Hopkins, dark red eyes, graceful and decent manners, citing classics, talking back to back, clean and white prison uniform, with the Savior 's Compassion, but the opposite is an ogre who reads through reality and sees through human nature. I went back to the dormitory and found a lot of background information about cannibalism. An allusion mentioned in a short movie review is very relevant. What is said is that eating people may be related to a primitive sense of power. When a person tries to gain strength, the primitive man kills another strong man, so that he can obtain the strength and wisdom of that strong man. This kind of strength is called Manner in religion. After reading these, I was relieved to the fact that he was eating people. Hannibal, a man with a strong heart comparable to the existence of God, is there really such a perfect person in the world? Perhaps, I have no way of answering this question. Hannibal is just a speculation about the savior. Unlike the savior known as the strong human body, such as Spider-Man and Iron Man, this savior is spiritual and human. Hannibal, this character, in the end, I completely ignored his bloody background. I only remember that he killed the police and deliberately made Jesus die on the cross and wiped his fingers with Stalin's fingers. The scene, the touch of tenderness was the deepest, and his sketch of Stalin's clothes: Stalin was quiet and quiet, holding the lamb in his hands, as holy as the Virgin. Hannibal, in my opinion, is a man with God's cleanliness. Maybe he shouldn't be human, and he is not worthy of such a great existence.",8,0,0,19 March 2020
Lucy," Lucy
","The topic discussed in this movie is about the world after the development of the human brain. According to the current development of humans, Einstein is said to be the highest, with 20%. This data is speculative and cannot be verified. So it gives people more imagination. Many people say that the special effects of this movie are rough, and the discussion of the topics is not deep enough. This is because human imagination has limits. Basically, the special functions that can be used in Hollywood are all used up. And all the imagination of science fiction comes from human observation and longing for unknown things. For example, we envy birds flying, so superhumans can fly, we envy cats can fly over walls, and cat people appear, and we envy invincible The body, and then Iron Man appeared, taking you to appreciate the high-tech of future armor. In fact, after all, it is a kind of psychological compensation for the audience.
As for Super Body, his important meaning is not to present a movie to everyone. The conflicts and conflicts in the movie are far-fetched and there is no need to exist, such as why not kill the blackboard boss, such as why not kill the chase The gang of gangs will then execute their own super brain plan, all this is just to make this movie more like a movie. Everyone who appears in this film is working to continue the development and discussion of the brain for the director.
The old drama bone Morgan Freeman has been telling everyone about the brain story from the beginning, forcibly making up lessons, and in the end did not participate in the important plot of the story, he is the interpreter in the movie, telling you, you do n't understand Come, let me take you to the theater together, and let me explain to you.
So this film can remove all the story attributes, because he does not affect what the director wants to say. The director just shows you a fresh idea and tells you what you can do if it reaches 20%, then 40%, 50%, 80%, 100% ...
So what is 100%? is God? Because everywhere! It's time, because he is everywhere!
So the film conceived us about the human brain, the infinite possibilities of the human brain. It has nothing to do with the story.
This film is a science and education film in a story coat.",7,1,1,27 April 2020

","The hero in the hearts of the people of Scotland, William Wallace, was born in oppression, grew up in oppression, and died in anti-oppression. He seems destined to shoulder the heavy responsibility of opposing oppression and achieving national freedom. The death of his parents planted the seeds of revenge and freedom in William's naive heart. The death of his lover provoked anger in his heart.

Her," Ultimate Loneliness
","The charm of science fiction movies is that no one knows the future, but we have not stopped asking questions again and again. In the process of technological evolution, when the machine can simulate human emotions and even meet the needs of the other party more perfectly than real people, how will her relationship with him develop and change? Perhaps indulging in virtual human-machine love, human communication skills are actually degrading, and humans cannot avoid the ultimate loneliness. Although it has not reached the level of tears, it is still a very moving film. Another form of artificial intelligence is not scary, but it makes people helpless. Perhaps, loneliness is the necessity of life.",8,0,0,28 April 2020
Me Before You," Me before You
","At around 1 hour and 30 minutes, the familiar 'Don't forget about me' sounded, and the desolation and plot in the cloves sound perfectly matched. The choice and torment of the same kind-even if you love deeply, you must let it go, you may face it, even if you experience Completely copied, because the emotions are connected, the music can touch people's hearts and burst into tears. Clark looked out the window, and when he looked at Will, who was asleep, it was also the most beautiful time in the movie.
Me before you, I think it can be translated as before meeting you, after losing you.
Me before you is a different life for the two in the movie, the change of life trajectory may be good or bad, but grateful to meet, grateful for love.
Instead of changing with a perfect ending, it appears real, and there are not so many perfections and dreams in life. Helplessness and impermanence are more normal, and the experience and love in them make the seemingly meaningless life become meaningful, before or after.",7,0,0,23 April 2020
The Proposal," I guessed the ending, but wanted to know the process
","Very interesting setting, a low-key and hard-working rich second generation, an unbeautiful and attractive woman, we all know the ending, but just want to watch this process, and the warmth of the family, they finally came to together.
Although there was a hurry at the end, it took only three days to complete the ending, but the two had been together for three years. The comparison between the mistress of the heroine and the patient treatment of Andrew is a good proof.
The family of the male owner is very cute, this is the family that everyone yearns for. But I also have family members who love me, either dad, mom, or good friends, good brothers. It 's because of the marriage where family and friends are perfect that we love.",7,0,0,11 May 2020
V for Vendetta," V
","As the movie says, under the pressure of horror, horrible people will be cultivated. Terrorists are born with the mission of destroying the horrible world with their own horrific power.
'The artist uses lies to reveal the truth, but politicians use lies to conceal the truth.'
In the film, the government uses a mysterious institution as a glorious shell, and the interior is already dirty and horrible; they control the people through declarations and television media (the most important media in 2005). The emergence of V as a 'terrorist' shattered this hypocritical shell, and the people did not fall into panic because the source of their real fear was suffocating government oppression.
Eve and the police officer accepted this idea and concept while slowly searching for facts. 'Three years later, thought can still change the world.' 'You can't kiss the thought, you can't touch it or hold it, thoughts don't bleed, they don't feel pain, they have no love.' Yes, thought can change the world, it can be inaccessible, but it has no love. However, people have love. During the time when V tested and polished Evey, V passed her a note; it was also the same as when V received the note. The contents of the note give V and Eve the ability to love.
'I'm in love with you. I never thought I could still love someone. This is the best gift you can give me.' This is what V said to Evey. I love you because you love me. This is the whole movie in a depressing gloomy atmosphere, but also gives a warm feeling to the heart.At the end of the movie, under the gorgeous fireworks, many deceased people appeared among the spectators. I understand it as the demise of the old world and the old regime. People who had been persecuted before were reborn as the new world arrived. Perhaps, as an ordinary person, V also stood among them to welcome the new students.",9,0,0,30 March 2020
The Godfather," Godfather
","The plot of the movie is relatively smooth, a story of a gangster fighting, and how the old godfather abdicated and how actor became a new godfather. Although the story is normal, the development is reasonable and smooth. When mentioning the plot, mention Nolan's Inception. His success is because of his plot, the plot is ups and downs, and the brain is a masterpiece. Compared to the story of Inception, the story of The GoIncepti is more real and closer to life.
In the actor's acting skills, Marlon Brando explained the old godfather's insurmountability, deep eyes, deep voice, and elegant movements. Undoubtedly a textbook-like performance.",9,0,0,27 March 2020
