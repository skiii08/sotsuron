Hereditary," Waste of time
",Very disappointed afer reading the previews. It is not so much frightening than bad as the story gets stupider by the minute.The last half hour is a total waste. I don't understand the glowing reviews at all. It cannot compete with Rosemarie's Baby which it quite obviously is trying be an update of.Only decent performance is by Tony Collette but even she drifts into really bad overacting by the end. Nobody in this film behaves halfway rational which drags the score down even further.,2,2,4,14 April 2019
Aquaman," How can anybody give this more than 5 stars?
","To make it short: too long for the story that's told (which is full of holes and straightforward illogical), bad acting especially between the two leads and other than CGI there is nothing memorable that will make you think about the film after 2 weeks. Plus the absolute worst villian ever in a superhero movie. Seriously, if I am the poor guy that had to wear that helmet I would laugh my way off the set.
Seriously go see wonder woman if you want a passable DC movie.",4,3,6,6 January 2019
