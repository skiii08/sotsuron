The Legend of Bagger Vance," Some things can't be learned, they must be remembered
","I am not a big golf fan, but after watching this movie, I have a greater appreciation of what a game like golf can do for the individuals that play it, and what it can do for a small town's moral. This movie is as good to the game of golf, as what the name Tiger Woods has been to this popular sport, in my view.This is the story of Rannulph Junuh, a promising young golfer who loses his swing after he experiences the harrowing frontlines of war. Once considered Savannah's greatest sportsman and favourite celebrity, Junuh had won the heart of the town's prettiest heiress, Adele Invergordon. But when he returned from war he was a defeated man, giving up both golf and Adele for the sake of alcohol. When Junuh is given a chance to redeem himself by competing in a celebrity golf tournament, he must first regain his swing and his self-respect. It will take a miracle, in the form of a mysterious caddy named Bagger Vance, for Junuh to get his game back as well as his life.
The cast of The legend of Bagger Vance is first class. The star performance for me, is that of Will Smith as Vance. Now the movie-going public would think of Smith as only an action man, but in this film he proves that he can take on more diverse, dramatic roles. In fact, I quite like him as the Bagger Vance character myself. Then you have Matt Damon, the young Hollywood actor, who has a great time in the movie world in the last few years. He was terrific as the down and out Junuh. He was also brilliant in the movie that he helped to write, that of Good Will Hunting, alongside fellow young star Ben Affleck and legend actor Robin Williams. To cap the cast of The legend of Bagger Vance off you have the beautiful Charlize Theron, who played the gorgeous and concerned town lady, Adele.  She has had a good career, with some other roles including Devil's Advocate, The Cider House Rules and 15 Minutes to name just a few.The director of The Legend Of Bagger Vance, is the recent Academy award hall of fame recipient, Robert Redford. He has had a good career onscreen, but I never realised how good he was offscreen. He has directed some great movies, with an Oscar for his directing of the movie Ordinary people. I love the small touches he put to this film, the way that the movie was told to the audience via old eyes, but we view through young eyes, was very ingenious. In some movies the time that is trying to be shown is not that accurate, however I feel  Redford got the right look for the time that he was trying to reenact.  In addition to all this, the sport that was being shown off in this movie was given a good light. Making the tournament a do or die battle for the town of Savannah and to see how important it was for the people, shows how great a game Golf can be. Sport is good in the way that it gets people closer, especially in a time of need.So all in all, I can only praise this great movie. It was a funny and a touching film that had a great cast. This movie can help people that feel they are out of luck and are no longer good enough, to have some hope, if they can once again believe in themselves. I guess I can relate to that feeling, as in one time I felt that I was not good enough to be able to do anything. But now I am a person who has learnt that anything is possible, if you give it a try. Be motivated by the one film that can teach you anything.Rating: 9/10 or  4.5 Stars",Null,0,1,29 March 2002
Gremlins," Gremlins is a little bit different to your ordinary movie!
","I was young when I hired this movie classic and admit I was scared out of my wits! But many years on, I have grown to love what it is all about. In fact, I now laugh at what I guess I was so scared off. Gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time.Don't ever get it wet. Keep it away from bright light. And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs...never, ever feed it after midnight. With these instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his new cuddly pet, a gift from his father. But Billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for and the small quite town of Kingston Falls is in for a Christmas they will never forget!  The first point I want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it. It was very original and one that I liked. I enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town, and the way that the Gremlins just take over. At the start of this film, the audience is aware that with the cute pet Gizmo (a Mogwai), comes much responsibility. I love the fact that there are three rules attached. If you break them, then all hell will break lose. It is an interesting concept and one I must say that worked. I feel that there has been some movies which have tried to copy the Gremlins concept which don't even come close. The Critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the Gremlins.The human cast of Gremlins was a pretty good one. The well known person from the Gremlins for me is the gorgeous Phoebe Cates. Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day. I recently saw her very first movie, Fast times at Ridgemont High. That was a one hell of a teenage film. Cates looked stunning in it as well. Playing the lead role of Billy Peltzer was Zach Galligan. Zach has hardly been heard of since the role of Billy in Gremlins (and the sequel). Yet I seem to ask myself the question, why? He was excellent in Gremlins and a good choice as the main character. I guess he has done some other movie which have been flops. This includes the 1994 comedy All Tied Up, starring the stunning Terri Hatcher.It's now time to talk about the real stars' of this show. Yes, those little green monsters. All credit needs to go to puppet makers in the Gremlins. These things' looked so real. Special comment needs to go to the creator of the Stripe' Gremlin. He was an amazing character. I want to say that the character of Gizmo was very restricted. We hardly ever see the whole animal. I liked him much more the second time around. The Gremlins is a movie that has so much happen in a little time. While these creatures remain Mogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome Gremlins they cause disaster after disaster. The scene in the school was quite satirical, with the Gremlin having his revenge on the school teacher. The only criticism of this scene is that we never actually find out what happens to that Gremlin. I guess he eventually meets up with whole group, but how does the viewing audience know this? Then we have the hilarious scene at the Peltzer household. The mother was quite game tackling those gruesome creatures. I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave. When Stripe escapes, he hurts the small town of Kingston Falls. The scene at the YMCA swimming pool was clever. Then when you see all the Gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real. Then you have the pub scene where Kate is trapped serving all these mischievous characters, it was totally wild. Also the scene with the snow plough going through the Futterman's house was crazy and suits the Gremlins totally. By the end we see one of the great pieces of directing, seeing all the Gremlins in the cinema watching quite a tame film in Snow White. Plus the final battle between Billy and Stripe in the Supermarket. It is so clever to see the little Gremlin tackle Billy with a chainsaw and a bow and arrow. Plus we see the best scene with Gizmo here. He is driving a Barbie-doll car, which was cute. I wont describe the end, but I will say that it was quite gut wrenching.Credit must go to the director and producer of Gremlins. Steven Spielberg is a genius and one of the best producers in the business. His other movies which I have loved include E.T., The Goonies, and Jurassic Park. I also enjoyed the directing of Joe Dante. He was very inventive and takes us on a wild roller-coaster ride with the Gremlins. To say that the original Gremlins film is a favourite of mine is an understatement. This movie is full of cuteness, cleverness, mischievousness and intelligence, all rolled into one. I also remember the posters advertising the Gremlins in this country (Australia). It was a Gremlin peeking out of a toilet. When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so. So, if you're air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a Gremlin in your house!Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10.",9,0,1,13 March 2001
Ali," Forget What You Think You Know
","He ' floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee' and the world says he was the 'greatest'. Of course I am talking about Muhammad Ali, the world's most famous boxer. The movie to celebrate his life was an exceptional piece of cinematography. With an outstanding cast and hypnotic story, 'Ali' brings to life the controversial and popular boxer that we all love. This movie can be enjoyed by anyone, whether they like boxing or not.The Champ Is Here! With wit and athletic genius, with defiant rage and inner grace, Muhammad Ali forever changed the American landscape. Fighting all comers, Ali took on the law, conventions, the status quo and the war - as well as the fists in front of him. Ali both ignited and mirrored the conflicts of his time and ours to become one of the most admired fighters in the world.What an unbelievable role, by Hollywood superstar, Will Smith. He was fantastic in the role of Muhammad Ali. The work that he must have had to put into become 'Ali', would have been so grueling. I remember reading that Smith had to go through heavy amounts of boxing and weight training, to feel like a boxer, and then also look at Ali as a youngster from footage, and then become him. That he did, in only the way that Will Smith can. He was so good that the academy saw the role to be worthy of an academy award nomination. It was a shame that he did not win it.The other roles in this film were also of a high quality. I found Jon Voight's role as the outlandish sports commentator, Howard Cosell, to be brilliant. At no stage can you pick that it is him. I am sure that what we see of Cosell, from Voight, is the true man of the time. It was also interesting to see Will Smith's real wife, Jada Pinkett, in the same movie. She was good as one of  Muhammad's love interests.The story to this film was interesting, as it had many fascinating facets to it. I found the way that we see Muhammad's interaction with the many women in his life to be written and portrayed well. I also enjoyed the way that Ali stood up for himself outside of the ring, with a poignant time in the film being when Cassius Clay rejects serving in the US army to fight in the Vietnam war. In addition to the fighting scenes that were interweaved brilliantly, to help balance this film's story. A lot of the praise must be given to the main man behind this film, director Michael Mann. He did an amazing job bringing 'Ali' to life. He was also a producer and a writer, so he had a big role in making 'Ali' the film it was.Also having real boxers appear in this film, made the movie all the more enjoyable, as you believe the fighting is real. In fact the boxing scenes in this film, are of the finest quality. Will Smith put a lot of himself on the line, by really fighting as a boxer. He was up against fighters such as Malick Bowens, Michael Bentt, James Torney, Alfred Cole and Charles Shufford. I am certain that these men could pack a good punch, so Will was very willing to put his health on the line to make this film 'believable'.I must make mention of what a personality Muhammad must have been. He was very opinionated, but also stood up for what he thought was true. I remember one comment about Ali being that he was 'a loud mouth', and that was so true. I mean the way that he must have fired up his opponents before a fight,  by his blind arrogance is truly amazing. Again praise must be given to the way that Will Smith captured Ali's personality, to be really coming 'the greatest'. It is a shame that Muhammad's life has been affected by the horrible 'Parkinson's disease'. Yet I am sure that he is giving a great battle against this.Ali is another film based on a true story, with a role that one performer makes his own. Smith is now in the class of actors such as Jim Carrey who became the crazy Andy Kaufman, Denzel Washington who became Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, the fine role taken on by Academy Award winner Hilary Swank, who became the controversial figure of Teena Brandon in 'Boys Don't Cry' and Julia Roberts, who was Erin Brockovich, in one of the best performances of her career. This role was great from Smith, as it can and will show many people of my generation how great a legend Ali really was and is. This movie gives us all an important lesson. That we can be anything we want, against adversary and for the only person who counts - that being you!CMRS gives 'Ali': 4 (very good film)",Null,32,58,15 September 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Some dreams are meant to come true
","Restored to a better digital quality, ET - the Extra Terrestrial, celebrated it's 20 year anniversary, with a second release. I must admit that I enjoyed the movie a whole lot more this time, considering it was able to viewed in the cinema and that it was much better to watch. ET is a brilliant film and if you can not enjoy it,  than you have not got a movie-loving bone in your body.A group of alien botanists visit earth and one of them is lost and left behind stranded on this planet. A 10-year-old boy, Elliot, finds the alien. Soon the two begin to communicate, and start a different kind of friendship in which E.T learns about life on earth and Elliot learns about some new values for the true meaning of friendship. E.T. wants to go home, but if Elliot helps him, he'll lose a friend...The Story of this film is probably the main reason why I like it so much. ET is a friendly character, though the audience are not shown this  that until we get to meet him much later in the film. However once we do, the story really does take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. In fact it is a sad teary movie. I love the way the audience is made to encourage ET and hope that whatever he wants to do, he gets the chance to do it. While in the long run he is able to make friends with some loving human beings. That is another side of the script I enjoyed, how the humans of the show interact with ET. It was well done and I can only commend the people behind the scenes, which include the script writer Melissa Mathison and the director, Steven Spielberg, who got it just right.The acting in this movie is famous, considering the stars that were in this film way back in 1982. Probably the most renowned  actor would have to be Drew Barrymore, who played Gertie. Boy, she was young in this movie, but she proved how talented she was going to be, and has gone on to do some wonderful work. Movies such as The Wedding Singer, Charlie's Angels, Poison Ivy and the film based on the Steven King novel, Firestarter. I like what Barrymore does onscreen, however I was sadden to see that her off-screen life has taken a turn for the worse, considering her house burnt down and her marriage to fellow actor Tom Green also failed in the last 12 months or so.   Yet there were other cast members that had a much heavier effect in this film. The main star would have to be Henry Thomas, who played Elliot. His role I feel would have made audiences very emotional, as Elliot is a caring character, who is also brave and would do anything for his Alien counterpart. I rate his performance in this film alongside current young star Haley Joel Osment, as the two have the similar style to each other. Then you have the role of older brother Michael, played by Robert MacNaughton, he was great as the smart-alec older brother, however as the circumstances start to become more serious, he becomes a responsible person in the tricky situation. For a 1982 film, ET had some extra-ordinary special effects, and to think that if it was done today, the movie would be all the better. I love all the scenes involving ET in some magical sense, with the bike flying scenes my favourite. There are also some very funny and touching scenes. Other scenes I loved were when Gertie takes ET and teaches him too talk and dresses him up in girlie clothes.  Throw in a bit of good acting from some young people and you have a very healthy film I say. So all in all ET is a great film, with a top cast, good special effects and a story that can only be loved by audiences around the world. I agree with Roger Ebert that ET is the reason why we watch movies, to reflect and too make us feel good about ourselves. I believe this film would have had the same cinema hype that movies like Star Wars, Ghostbusters and the Gremlins would have had. If you are feeling a little down and need to be lifted up, then see ET, the movie that will pull your heart strings and make you feel glad for the viewing experience.Rating: 10/10 or 5 Stars",Null,0,0,8 April 2002
Erin Brockovich," A Real woman. A real story. A real triumph!
","What more can I say about Erin Brockovich, it was superb. In real life she is a truly remarkable woman and on-screen, Roberts really made me believe that she was Brockovich in a way.In my opinion, this is Julia Roberts' best role. Roles in such movies as Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway Bride don't match this one. Erin Brockovich brought out the true talent which movie lovers know Roberts has. She acted it perfectly. Being stubborn, hard-working, aggressive emotional and caring, traits I'm sure the real Brockovich has.
The story of this movie concentrates on  Erin Brockovich, who has 3 kids, divorced twice and a $17,000 debt after she loses her court case after a car accident. So Erin  looks and applies for a heaps of jobs, until she goes back to the lawyer who was representing her in court and begs for a job. After she is finally given a go, Erin searches into a small towns health crisis and brings a billion dollar company to its knees. The case that made Brockovich so famous was about  a processing plant called PG+E  which contaminated the water of a small town called Hinkley. The water supply was contaminated with Hexavalent Chromium, which can cause many terrible health problems, including Headaches, Nose Bleeds, cancers (of numerous kinds),  liver, heart and reproductive failure, organ deterioration and in bad cases death. So Brockovich, with no legal experience took on the case for the people of Hinkley and helped them win. In a way it was David taking on Goliath. I also loved the relationship between Erin and her boss Ed Masry. They treated each other with low regard, but in the end respected each other for who they were. Ed was played by Albert Finney and was well done.One part of the film I can understand people not liking is the relationship between Erin and bikie boyfriend George. It was destined  never to work as Erin was focusing more on her work for the case and not him. Maybe he was an unwanted character, but then again I saw George to be a kind man who helped Erin in her greatest time of need. Then we also see that Erin puts her kids needs behind to help others. Erin loved her kids, but her sense of justice meant her family life had to suffer. There are some memorable quotes in Erin Brockovich, here are a few of my favorites:`How Â‘bout this for a number. 6, is the age of my daughter, 8 is the age of son, 2 is the number of times I have been divorced and 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.' `That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In f.....g ugly shoes.'`They're called boobs, Ed.'`Seeing as how I have no brains or legal expertise, I just went out there and performed sexual favors. Six hundred and thirty-four blow jobs in five days... I'm really quite tired.'`Not personal? That's my work in there. My Sweat, my time away from my kids..... if that's not personal, I don't know what is.'For those who have the facilities to watch DVDs, Erin Brockovich should be at the top of your list, with an impressive amount of special features including a report with Erin Brockovich herself (by the way look out for the real Brockovich in the movie) and half an hour of deleted scenes, which were interesting to see. All in all,  I hated the case and the pain those people had to endure, but I loved the way this true story was bought to the bigscreen. The courage of a single mother who felt so passionately about people who she had no ties with and wanted to see them have a new chance in life is truly inspirational.

Fight Club," Mischief. Mayhem. Soap. Sorry I did not like this film at all!
","While I know this movie made a big fuss on virtually the entire movie world, I am one person whose game enough to admit that he did not like it at all. Yet half way through it I was thinking, yeah this is ok'. However by the end, I was confused and disappointed, as this film took me to places that I could never have imagined. The mundane existence of a product liability evaluator and insomniac, who is addicted to self-help groups, is turned upside down when he meets a sado-masochistic anarchist who is secretly plotting to overthrow civilisation. As their friendship grows, they become increasingly involved in a secret society of 'fight clubs' where men act out their aggressions and violently beat one another to a pulp. In the meantime, the evaluator falls in love with a woman who is also addicted to self-help groups, but is unable to act on his desire for her. Director of Fight Club was David Fincher, who had done some really good movies, such as the Michael Douglas thriller The Game' and the murder mystery, Se7en'. Yet with Fight Club', I found myself getting more frustrated, as the movie continued on. This I believe has to be due to the direction of the movie by Fincher. I mean, what was the last 30 minutes of the movie actually about? I am still unsure, do not want to know, but will say that it did not impress me. However the movie's story did have some good elements. I enjoyed the idea of an underground boxing' club, as was the scummy setting that we see the movie placed in for the majority of the film. But the brutal, ungloved beatings were for me, pretty hard to take, as was some of the violence that went on after that, and as I have mentioned, I did not like (or understand) the end of the movie, which made the film's story seem crazy for me. The idea for the story of this movie was taken from the novel of the same name, by Chuck Palahniuk. While the screenplay for the movie was written by Jim Uhls.  The movie stars a reasonably good cast. Main star, known only as Narrator (Edward Norton) was one character that I found myself in some way liking. He is an angry depressed man, whose is in a frustrating job, but life is about to have a big change. This change is due largely to him meeting up with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Tyler helps narrator out, giving him a place to live. Yet he also gives narrator a look inside the weird and ugly world of the Fight Club'. Tyler states The first rule of Fight Club is - you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is - you DO NOT talk about Fight Club.' While I know that many people found both Norton and Pitt to be great performers, I found some of Pitt's character traits to be really disturbing, especially when he keeps inviting fellow boxers to bash him up', like the scene where he tempts and pushes Narrator to flog him pretty bad. I also feel that Durden's ideas behind the fight club are bit hard to take. Look I preferred Pitt in movies such as Thelma and Louise' and the wonderful movie Interview with the Vampire'.Narrator is also addicted to  support group meetings', going to one every night of the week. This is where narrator meets a bizarre chain-smoking woman called Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). Her character brings in the strange sexual ideas into the movie. It is easy to understand that her character is angered by the men in this movie, who would prefer to bash each other around, then to have sex with her. In a world set in reality, that would be quite unusual. I enjoyed Helena's performance (and movie for that matter) much more, in the 2001 remake of The planet of the Apes'.
I recently had a shot at well known Chicago movie critic, Roger Ebert, for his harsh words on the movie Dead Poets Society'. But while he is entitled to his opinion and I am to mine, I was trying to think of the reasons why I struggled to like Fight club', so I decided to read his opinion on this movie. I have to agree with his conclusion, which states: 'Fight Club' is a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy--the kind of ride where some people puke and others can't wait to get on again'. I have to admit that I am part of the first group, who by the end of this film could not wait for it too finish. I am sure that the majority of you out there were the latter, wanting more and more. I kept looking for the ending titles, so I could end this violent blood-bath of a movie. CMRS gives Fight Club': 1 (Bad Film)",Null,0,2,13 July 2003
Memento," Some memories are best forgotten. You have to appreciate how original a movie Memento' really is!
","Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world. Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia'. Although he can recall details of life before his accident' Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento' is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more. 
Guy Pearce's role in Memento' shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife's killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia', a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny', I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present. Memento's other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano's performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy', as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy'. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard's condition to advantage their own situations.
Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard's wife, Catherine (C.S.I.'s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.Yet in no way do any of the characters in Memento' realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything. Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero', Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, 'Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.'  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento', when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento'. The one which sticks in my mind the most' has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore', snorting smartly that you won't be even able to remember what I have said'.  So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento' the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease' patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane'. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience.

Mississippi Burning," 1964. When America was at war with itself.
","I was never aware of how big an effect such a movement like the KKK' had on America, even the world. But thanks to a movie brought to us by director Alan Parker, called Mississippi Burning', I was not only able to learn about such big events in one of America's big town' histories, I was also able to appreciate how bad it turned' some people in this world. While Mississippi Burning' might have some aspects that will disturb some people, it is a gritty police drama' that I feel cannot and should not be missed.
1964: Three young civil rights workers - two white, one black - disappear on a dark Mississippi back road, sparking off one of the largest FBI manhunts in history. Two FBI agents, with very different backgrounds, join forces to solve this seemingly impossible case, a case that ignited a controversy so bloody, it shocked the world.   Mississippi burning' is a wonderful movie that recreates a time in America's history, a history I am sure that the country would rather forget. Yet I feel it is important that we learn about such historical events, as we can learn from the old times and how they have changed our life. MB's' story was extremely well written by Chris Gerolmo. What I liked most about it, was how game it was in showing the really confronting issues that I am sure were part of Mississippi in 1964'. At no stage does it shrug away from any disturbing issues, including such ideals as the KKK, the media hype in Mississippi and the important investigation that both Anderson and Ward want to solve. But director Alan Parker, brought out the stories great tension particularly well. I also feel it is Parker's unique directing style that allows us, as the audience, to see what is going on in Mississippi burning. Such tensions as the racist's ideals of the KKK, the way the media are consumed by the investigation of the missing civil rights workers and even the different ways both Ward and Anderson do their job, are all very memorable points from the film and this is the good work of Parker. The start and end of the film I feel are Parker's delicate touch as director, beautifully done and will be sketched in my memory for a longtime to come.    Yet the acting talent in the film is also of a great highlight here. The main performers are agents Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Defoe). Both are great in the roles that they played, but both are very different personalities, which cause them problems on the job. This only adds to the movies great tension. I mean it is easy to tell that both officers want to get to the bottom of this important case, but do it in such different ways. One goes by the book, getting in many hundreds of men to crack the case, while the other wants a smaller investigation, walking the town of Mississippi upsetting town folk, all in the aid of justice. I love the chemistry that Hackman and Defoe shared onscreen considering that both are playing opposite characters, as their relationship is vital to the final makeup of the film. Hackman's true acting talents come out here, however before seeing Defoe in MB', I felt that he was an ordinary sort of actor, but in this film he has proved to me he has some acting ability. Yet the supporting cast was also of the highest quality. Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand) is great in her role. She is a person that is cared for by Agent Anderson, which is another great part of the movie's story, and is a pivotal character in the investigation. With Mrs. Pell, you get the feeling that she hates not only her life, but what is going on in Mississippi, with her quote that she sobs to Anderson about hatred, just captivating.
She is married to corrupt cop, Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), who has a smug smile and is not the greatest of policeman. Dourif's character is involved in one of the more tense scenes of the movie, when Anderson threatens him while being in the barber shop, a favourite of mine. Other good members of the supporting cast include Clayton Townley (Stephen Tobolowsky), Frank Bailey (Michael Rooker), who is brought to his knees by Anderson and Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey). Other interesting scenes in Mississippi Burning' include the events that show the three civil rights boys being harassed by the cops, you have all the media hype created by the FBI investigation which was great, and the racial tension created by the KKK and their hatred towards the black people of Mississippi, with the burning of one black family's home, quite disturbing. The motel scene is very dramatic, and shows that these two agents are in a very dangerous situation. The diner scene is another truly remarkable scene to see being played out. It is hard to believe that white and coloured people had such big divisions, like this movie shows.
Look Mississippi Burning' is a repugnant sort of movie at time, and could make you feel rather sick, considering that this movie's story is based on true events, making it difficult watch. However, this film makes me happy, considering that I live in a country that has democracy, an important ingredient in these times of multiculturalism. The music of MB is really thrilling, chilling and dramatic, and makes the movie's story even better. I feel that MB deserves all the praise that it gets, and it is no wonder that it had so many nominations for academy awards, winning one (for its cinematography by Peter Biziou). If you are looking for a really dramatic and entertaining movie then Mississippi Burning' is the movie that I highly recommend for you.CMRS gives Mississippi Burning': 5 (Brilliant Film)",Null,1,1,19 May 2003
Rocky V," He is going back to where it all began. When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to  Go for it!
","When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!Losing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.
This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. The cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.The normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. I found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.Rocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.Rating 3 Stars or 6.5/10",Null,45,56,16 May 2002
Batman Returns," Batman returns in a freakish sequel
","The `Dark Knight' returns, in what I would say was one of the most anticipated sequels in many years. But whether this film holds up to the same expectations than the original is in my view debatable.Gotham City faces two monstrous criminal menaces; the bizarre, sinister Penguin and the slinky, mysterious Catwoman. Can Batman battle two formidable foes at once? Especially when one wants to be mayor and the other is romantically attracted to Gotham's hero? Batman Returns is the follow-up to the first blockbuster, which is a dazzling adventure that will leave you breathless!Once again, we see Michael Keaton get out his costume as Batman/Bruce Wayne. The second Batman allows Batman to have more of the limelight, as the baddies aren't as dominant. Again Keaton is cold, callous and moody' as Batman. He suits the role and in my opinion is the best Batman for the movies. I was disappointed when he could not reprise the role for the later films. The  fighting scenes that Keaton did do in this film weren't bad.
Unfortunately, the baddies in this film probably aren't as good as the first film. Could anyone do any better than Nicholson? I think not. Danny Devito took on the hard role as the Penguin. It must have been difficult to walk, talk and act like that gruesome sort of character. In that way, I feel like applauding Devito. Yet his character wasn't that scary. The audience more pity him for the way his family discard him, more than feel threatened by him. But the role of Catwoman, played by the talented Michelle Pfeiffer, was remarkable. It was just like the comic book version had just leapt to the big screen. I loved it. Her sarcasm, her wit and her charm made Catwoman, someone you could love or hate in an instant. The storyline was interesting when it involved Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne. The chemistry they bought to the screen was fascinating. Then as there alter ego, the relationship got even steamier. My favourite scene with Catwoman would have to be when she walks into a department store, defeats the security guards, then blows it up by placing gas cans into a microwave. To finish the scene she flips out and says `Meow'. Tim Burton returns as the director for Batman 2. I thought he got the Batman character correct the first time around, but this time he wasn't as accurate. The darkness in the film is probably a little over the top and makes the Dark Knight just a little bit too dark, yet the set is a pretty reasonable one. One of Burton's latest films Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp would be just as dark as this. So if you didn't like this movie I would recommend you stay away from Sleepy Hollow as well. I say that it would be an interesting film.  Undoubtedly, the best scene in this film would have to be when the Penguin's army of penguins are unleashed to Gotham Square to blow up the city. But of course Batman interferes and turns the Penguins around. The trainers involved in this scene must be commended on the precision they got every penguin to walk like they were supposed to. This must have taken many months of training to get just right. I enjoyed the second Batman movie. The storyline was ok and it did have some enjoyable scenes and I applaud the role of Catwoman. But this film never had the same impact on me like the first and I guess it was never going to. But, Pat Collins from  WWOR-TV said:-`Batman Returns was Sensational! A funhouse of comic and crazy surprises.'In my view many sequels are only made for the hell of it. The Batman genre (and other superheroes) can be included in that. What do you think?

Finding Nemo," There are 3.7 trillion fish in the ocean, they are looking for just one. You will have never seen fish prepared like this before. 'Finding Nemo' is totally wild dude!
","People all over the world have been falling in love with a little clownfish called 'Nemo'. I have been waiting to see this film for a while and it has not disappointed me. Pixar have proven once again that they are the best when it comes bringing 'animated feature films'. This film shows of many great things, like what it is like to be a fish, life in the sea, what Australians are really like and the famous landmarks of the harbour city of 'Sydney'. But what I think is most important about 'Finding Nemo', is the warm fuzzy feeling a film such as this will leave you with.
Dive into a whole new world of computer-animated fun, fantasy, and heartfelt emotion by following the epic journeys of two 'clownfish' - the overly cautious Marlin and his curious son, Nemo - who become separated in the Great Barrier Reef when Nemo is taken from his ocean home. Despite his fears of the open sea, Marlin embarks on a dangerous trek to find Nemo. Buoyed by the companionship of a friendly-but-forgetful fish named Dory, Marlin finds himself as the unlikely hero of a thrilling journey to rescue his son.Firstly, I want to praise the animators that worked on this movie. They did a remarkable job in creating the world that we find all these sea animals swimming around in. The attention to detail is most noticeable, especially the way they have shown the water, which looked 'real'. The Pixar animators certainly put great detail into the film, and used a vast array of colours, which has to be another of the films major highlights.The script for 'FN' is as classy a script I have ever seen for animated feature film. Not only is it clever, it is very funny and has some strange, but hilarious characters. I believe that the character of Dory was the funniest, one that at least I know I will be able to 'remember'. The movie's underlying themes, which include the importance of family and friends, were also very important. The story for 'FN' was written by Andrew Stanton, while the screen was done by Stanton, Bob Peterson and David Reynolds.
The direction 'FN' took onscreen was another aspect of the film I liked. It must be difficult to direct an 'animated feature film', but the way the directors' did this film, show how it can and should be done. Director Andrew Stanton (with Co-director, lee Unkrich) certainly gave the movie good flow and allowed the audience to enjoy a fine cinematic experience. Stanton's role on the film is truly great, considering he also voiced the totally wild dude, Crush the turtle.With so many characters, I want to talk about the ones that had the biggest impact on me. The main characters include Nemo, the baby 'clownfish', who goes on an extraordinary adventure, Nemo's dad Marlin and Dory, the blue tang fish, with short term memory loss, who has to be up there as one of the great cartoon characters, ever made for a film. I also loved the impact that the three sharks have on the film. Bruce, the great white shark, Anchor, the hammerhead shark and Chum, the pointer shark, could have been (and would be for some littlies) very scary, but in this film were also hilarious. Out of the characters we meet in the fish tank aquarium at the Dentists, the strange exotic Moorish Idol fish Gill, the very amusing 'Bloat', and Nigel, the clumsy pelican, are all very good. In fact the dentist himself is a very important character for reasons that I will let the movie explain.
However these characters would be nothing without the voiceovers that accompany them. The main voices include Albert Brooks, Alexander Gould and Willem Defoe, who all are very good. But the stand out for me is the performance of Ellen DeGenres, who has proven that she totally suits doing voiceovers. I hope DeGenres is casted again in a role like this one. The voiceovers also have a very Australian flavour as well. People like Barry Humphries, Eric Bana, Bruce Spence, Bill Hunter and Geoffrey Rush are all great additions to be hearing. The additional voiceovers also see a very famous Aussie as well. While the voice of cartoon expert Jack Angel appears, we also have the latest 'Gold Logie' winner Rove McManus, being a part of the ocean too.There are many wonderful moments in 'FN'. My favourite has to be when Marlin and Dory stumble across the three 'friendly' sharks. This scene has to be the scariest and the funniest of the film. Then when Marlin and Dory play the 'Jellyfish' game, it is also funny and dangerous at the same time. In fact the whole journey that Nemo's father has to find his son in the film is very entertaining to say the least. Then when Marlin and Dory first meet Nigel, the pelican, it is hard not to laugh at the cries of 'Mate....' by the many pidgins that we see. Also the experiences that Nemo has while trapped in the aquarium at the Dentist surgery, are not only frightening, but very fun and exciting as well, helping Nemo to grow up.
'Finding Nemo' was dedicated to the memory of Glenn McQueen, a man that obliviously had an impact on Pixar animations. While I love all the different aspects of 'Finding Nemo', I am still a bigger fan of 'Monsters, Inc.', but believe me, Finding Nemo is not far behind it, and I cannot wait for the DVD release of this movie. I believe that this movie has the perfect opening, thanks to the viewing of the 1989, first-ever Pixar production 'Knick Knack', that undoubtedly inspired 'Finding Nemo'. While this movie has as perfect and funny conclusion you will see (Note: do not get up before the credits!).  What a joy it was for me to finally see 'Finding Nemo'!CMRS gives 'Finding Nemo': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)",Null,0,1,8 October 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," One Of Them Is Lying. So Is The Other. I have heard many negative comments on this movie, but I do not care, cos I liked it
","It has been a long time since I have genuinely laughed at a movie, but I could not contain my laughter when I was watching the 2003 romantic comedy How to lose a guy in 10 days'. This film is a very refreshing romantic comedy, one that helps keep the genre alive and well. The other great part to this film was the cast, lead very well by Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, and thanks to some great casting, the pair have some truly wonderful talent backing them up. I totally agree with Shawn Edwards' opinion on HTLAGITD' from FOX-TV  A fabulously fresh and totally ENTERTAINING BATTLE OF THE SEXES' I could not have put it better myself.
 As the `How to...' columnist for trendy Composure' Magazine, Andie Anderson agrees to write a first-hand account about what it takes to drive a man out of her lifein exactly 10 days. At the same time, eligible and agency bachelor Benjamin Barry accepts a high stakes bet that he can lure any woman into falling head-over-heals in love with himalso in 10 days. The resulting romantic head-on collision ignites a series of deliriously comic deceptions that prove when it comes to true loveyour heart cannot tell a lie.  The wonderful screenplay is the most impressive aspect of HTLAGITD'. It was both romantic and funny at the same time, which I am sure must have been hard to get right, but the writers Kirsten Buckley, Brian Regan and Burr Steers got it spot on. I am sure they would have had think long and hard about what is was they wanted to show, but they showed it perfectly. The other aspect I liked about the story was how even it was for both the sexes, women get to see their part, and the men can see theirs. It shows how good a story this film has, when the writers can delicately balance it the way they did. The director of HTLAGITD was Donald Petrie (from Miss Congeniality). He did a fine job in showing this quite unusual predicament we see our lead characters in. Petrie also gave the movie a very fun feeling, which many romantic comedies can lack. Another good thing about Petrie's direction, are the many wonderful shots we see around New York that he allows us to see. They make the city look very grand and show it to be a fascinating place to live in. This was achieved thanks to cinematographer John Bailey.         
This takes me to the great cast, which was very very good. Andie Anderson (played by the voluptuous Kate Hudson), was a fun character to see. I cannot remember a movie where I was hypnotised by an actresses look, but Kate had me stunned. Her smile is hard not to like. I love the way she was able to make herself seem like such a dumb blonde, with the many scenarios we see Andie in, just hilarious. The only problem with this character was that she did start to become a bit annoying after a while. The male character in this film was a man called Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey), a man all the girls want, and who the guys want to be like. Matt suited his role well, as the man who is very much a male guinea pig'. The situation he finds himself in is very delicate one, as the girl he is with has many different personalities', a line Ben uses in his defense at one stage. McConaughey and Hudson shared a great onscreen chemistry, with one, making the other look even better.   As I have mentioned the supporting cast for this film was great. Andie's friends include workmates Genie (Anne Parisse) and Michelle (new comedy actress Kathryn Hahn). Hahn has a very funny introduction, as she is the girl that inspires what transpires. Then Michelle plays along with the joke, becoming a some what unorthodox relationship counselor, one of the many funny parts of the film. Another female character I liked was Andie's magazine editor, Lana (Bebe Neuwirth), with real magazine people saying Bebe played her part perfectly.Ben's friends are just as convincing here. Tony (Adam Goldberg) and Thayer (Thomas Lennon) are just as interested in their friend's plight on his conquest, like everyone else in NY. These guys almost seem joined at the hip. I also like Ben's boss, Phillip (Robert Klein) a man who wants Ben to succeed at his bet. We also get to see Ben's very strange, but unique family, with their favourite word, turning out to be a very queer card game. Ben's family has a strong effect on Andie, and they had the same effect on me as well. The music of this film was another thing that helped win me over. The soundtrack was composed by the legendary David Newman, and had a great blend of great old tracks like Let's stay together Al Green and You're so vain' by Carly Simons, with a great new song Weight of the World' Performed by Chantal Kreviazuk.This is a very clever romantic comedy, which shows what disasters can happen when people play around with the strong emotion of love. I am someone who has been a bit of a failure when it comes to dating, but after watching this film, I realise I am not the only person who suffers from the dating blues'. There were many funny in-jokes in this film, that had me in stitches many times and I am sure they will have that affect on you too. HTLAGITD is a good film, and that is no bulls*%t!CMRS gives How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days': 3.5 (Good - Very Good Film)",Null,0,1,7 January 2004
Dead Poets Society," He was their inspiration. He made their lives extraordinary.
","Carpe deium - 'seize the day', is the inspirational message from 1989's, 'Dead Poets Society'. Directed by Australia's Peter Weir, it is a movie that is good for young impressionable teenagers to watch and learn what poetry can do for people, whether they are struggling to write, falling in love or are inspired by someone who has done something in the past that they want to revive all over again. Although, parts of this movie could be called 'clichÃ©d', it is a movie that I will continue to refer to, for a longtime to come.When charismatic English professor John Keating arrives at a strict boys academy, his unconventional teaching methods breathe new life into the curriculum steeped in tradition. With his wit and wisdom, Keating inspires his students to pursue individual passions and make their lives extraordinary. Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society has touched audiences and critics alike with its brilliant acting, uplifting story and superb craftsmanship.What a joy this movie is. Director Peter Weir directed it in such a style that I really liked. It was interesting to learn that Weir was willing to do things a little different, which I feel is ironic, considering that is one of the story's main themes. Weir also sounds like the kind of guy that kept inspiring his cast to be as 'good as they can'. I feel that Weir's improvisations only enhanced the picture all the more.
However, the story of the movie also needs to be applauded. Written by Tom Schulman, who won an academy award for his work, he wrote a really inspirational story from where I viewed it. But it was also much more. It had interesting characters, both young and old, with the Mr. Keating just terrific. Yet the themes of DPS are also important. They include 'seize the day', 'standing up for yourself', 'facing your fears', the traditions of conservatism and that conforming is not the best way to live your life. The movie gives all these aspects good attention, and all are important, especially in the DPS's young lives.The cast of DPS was also well chosen. John Keating (Robin Williams) is a fine teacher, although he does things just a little bit different. Sure he was a rebellious student in his young days, but as an adult, he has a charismatic style and past that helps inspire the main group of boys in the movie. One of my favourite scenes in the movie has to be when Mr. Keating tells all his poetry class to rip out, 'Mr. J. Evans Pritchard's introduction titled 'understanding poetry'. Keating calls it 'excrement'. Then when a passing senior teacher sees the ripping of books going on, he is flabbergastered, thinking that foul play is going on.
I also liked the young members of the cast, who restart the 'Dead Poets Society'. They include Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd (brilliant acted by Ethan Hawke), Knox (Josh Charles), who is infatuated by a pretty girl called Chris (Alexandra Powers), Charlie, aka Nwanda, (Gale Hanson), Richard (Dylan Kussman), Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero) and Pitts (James Waterston). All these boys are different, some funny, some sad, some trying to workout what they are. But via the reinvention of the DPS, they all use the phrase 'seize the day' to change their lives, for their better and/or worse.
Yet some of these characters find it hard to live up to expectations of traditional school or their parents. Neil has a very rocky and difficult relationship with his father (Kurtwood Smith) and goes to drastic measures to be rid of the problem. The way Neil deals with his problems might seem the easy way out, but when a bad situation seems inescapable, desperate people can do desperate things.Then the problems that we see confronting Todd are also important lesson to learn from. The scene which involves Todd getting up in front of the class to recite a poem was terrific and shows how big of an effect Mr. Keating is having on such introverted student. He knows Todd can be a brilliant poet, he just needs the confidence to bring it out. A friend said that it was ironic that Hawke played the role of a struggling writer, considering that in real life he is a writer, having some works published.
The good parts behind the scenes of DPS include the great sets that were used. I especially like the school grounds used for 'Welton Academy', as it gave me the distinct impression that we are introduced into a proud boy's school. Music was also put to good use in DPS, with the playing of bag pipes creating great tension and emotion for the film. I believe it continues on that feel of tradition that accompanies such a school like that of the 'Welton Academy'. The music was composed by Maurice Jarre and sound done by the late Allan Splet.'Dead Poets Society' might not be everyone's idea of a 'good movie', as some will look at it and say 'that has all been done before, in a much better way'. However I am one person whose game enough to say that this is a pretty good movie in all of the aspects I have mentioned. The conclusion to the movie is really powerful in my opinion, and shows to the audience that these boys have respect for their teacher and that they have taken the steps to be able to 'seize the day'. I read Roger Ebert's review for DPS, and felt he was very harsh on the film, and disagree with his 'not enjoyable movie' tag, as it was thoroughly enjoyable from where I viewed it. I first watched 'Dead Poets' at school many years ago, which was the perfect place to do so, as it will make students, like I was, inspired to be whatever they want to be someday. Everyone, please, carpe deium and 'seize the day'.CMRS gives 'Dead Poets Society': 4 (Very Good Film)",Null,0,1,19 May 2003
Chicken Run," Poultry In Motion
","This movie was a sheer joy to watch the first time, so much so that I have watched it many times since. The magic it has, left a great impression on me. The creators of the famous Wallace and Gromit' series have made a real winner, a movie suitable for all ages, I guarantee it!While the chickens on evil Mrs Tweedy's farm dream of a better life, a clever hen named Ginger is hatching plans to fly the coop  for good! The only problem is that chickens can't fly or can't they? Every escape attempt goes fowl until Rocky, a smooth talking All-American rooster, crash lands into the coop. It's hardly poultry in motion when Rocky attempts to teach Ginger and her fine feathered friends to fly but, with teamwork, determination and a little bit o' cluck, the fearless flock plots one last daring attempt in a spectacular bid for freedom!Where do you start with this wonderful movie. Undoubtedly the story is fantastic. The people who thought up the wonderful script for Chicken Run deserve a round of applause, because it was great. A story about a coop of chickens trying to escape from an evil chicken farm was superb. In addition some of the quotes that were said throughout  the film were hilarious, and make me laugh every time I watch it . This leads me to the great performances by the voiceovers in Chicken Run. My favourite character would have to be Rocky the Rhode Island Red' Rooster, and his voice was supplied by Hollywood superstar Mel Gibson. He did such a great job as Rocky, and made me laugh many times. I recently saw Gibson in What women want, and no wonder they used his voice in this film, because Rocky and Gibson have the similar personality and traits. Rocky's entrance cry of Freedommm'  is unforgettable. Yet other character such as chickens Ginger (Julia Sawalia), Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow),  Babs (Jane Horrocks), Mac (Lynn Ferguson), The rats Nick (Timothy Spall) and Fetcher (Phil Daniels) and the Tweedy's (Miranda Richardson and Tony Haygarth) were all done to perfection. In fact, if Rocky was not in the film, then the Rats would be my favourites, with some of the silly things they say and do. Watch the credits right through, because there is an hilarious piece of dialogue between the two of them, which had me in stitches. Yet this movies also deals with some very complex ideologies. Liberals would absolutely love this film for the references to freedom, the individual and being able to do whatever a person wants, or in this case what a chicken wants. The strongest characters with these traits would have to be Rocky and Ginger. Yet Conservatism also appears heavily in Chicken Run. The character of Fowler is very much stuck in his conservative ways, always referring to how it was done in his RAF days, his medals and traditional stories. Moreover, Mr Tweedy states to Mrs Tweedy that they can not give up egg farming, because of his previous generations doing the same tradition. However, socialism also appears in this movie. Socialists believe that people should live in a classless society, with everyone working together. Chicken Run also put this into practices, when the coop attempts the big escape, by working as a team. The directors of Chicken Run, Nick Park and Peter Lord did a great job on Chicken Run, as did all the people behind the scenes. The people who made all the characters for this film did a wonderful job. Making this plasticine, into a real life character amazed me. In addition, learning that that 40 people worked individually on 2.5 seconds of frame work per day for two years, makes this film all the more of an achievement. Hopefully Lord and Park can make more movies like this one, because they did this one to perfection. The soundtrack in this film was also very impressive. The musical tunes made the right impression at the right time, along with some great songs as well. Songs such as  Flip Flop and Fly (Ellis Hall) and The Wanderer (Dion) fitted in nicely. The use of the song Flip Flop and Fly' was excellent.So overall, Chicken Run can only be given praise. All the hard work done to bring to the movie to the big screen is enough in my book. Yet the story, the humour and the great voiceovers are all superb. I have read some comments about Chicken Run, saying that it is just for kids, I disagree whole heartedly.This is the sort of animation film that anyone can enjoy. Try not to be too critical of Chicken Run, instead enjoy the experience, because if you can not enjoy this film then you have no sense of humour in my view. People with DVD access, take a look at one impressive package.Rating: 10/10 or 5 Eggs (it was eggcelent!)",10,1,2,22 December 2001
L.A. Confidential," Everything is suspect Everyone is for sale And nothing is what it seems!
","In my opinion, the media has a lot to answer for in the way our world is today. For the first time we see a movie that allows the public to see how manipulative the media really is and we can be shown that things are not always what they seem. LA Confidential is a movie that is in a league of its own.Three cops, Sergeant Jack Vincennes, Officer Wendell 'Bud' White and Detective Lieutenant Edmund J Exley, a call girl, a mysterious millionaire, a tabloid journalist, and the chief of detectives fuel a labyrinth plot involving a shooting at an all night diner. This is a movie with mystery, ambition, romance and humour. This is a brilliant piece of movie making. I was totally enthralled by the great story this movie had. Based on the book called `LA Confidential', written by James Ellroy, every character had a sort of feel that you could both hate and yet like. The director Curtis Hanson also did a wonderful job with this movie, bringing all the necessary touches it needed.Undoubtedly the cast this film has is first class. The standouts for me, just happen to be home town lads, that being Aussie exports Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. Crowe is a brilliant actor and it is no wonder he has won an academy award, because his role in this film was great and set him up for bigger and better things to come. His character in this movie is unforgettable. Guy Pearce has had a quiet career. I remember him from his role in the Aussie soap Neighbours', but he was also very good in movies like Dating the Enemy, Rules of Engagement and the recent film Memento'. His role as the good cop who gets the job done was terrific. The two roles these men have, while they are different, work together to achieve the same directive, which is to enforce the law. The other cast members that are worth noting include names such as Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito and the gorgeous Kim Basinger. Basinger won the academy award for best supporting actress in this movie and no wonder, with the great performance she gave. Spacey was very witty in his role as the other police sergeant, also showing that he would do what he had to do to get the truth. I enjoyed Spacey in his roles in the two movies, the Negotiator and of course the great film American Beauty. Danny Devito is a big name in Hollywood, not only onscreen, but offscreen. He was terrific as the nosey journalist, who will stop at no length to get a story, and by any means. His role really makes me look twice at any person in the print media, considering what money can buy. The way the media is portrayed in this movie makes me all the more suspicious of what they are really like. With all the Photo shots, the story buying and creation of fake' news, was a true depiction of how the media works in real life. I love how the movie allows us to see each person involved with police, would stand and wait to have the nice photo taken, as if to make a point of what they were doing. I'm sure the media makes more of certain people and events for journalistic purposes.No wonder this film won two academy awards, it was simply brilliant. Our Media is a very seductive and evil thing when you come to think about it. Yes with out it, we would complain that we are not well informed, but I say what is the use of being informed when the story being told is not completely true? This movie just shows how much of a joke the media really is, and that the truth is often the last thing on their minds, instead they will pay create the news. This is a must see movie and one which is going to be added to my collection, but keep that hush hush' would ya! Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10",Null,0,1,12 March 2002
The Terminator," Arnie is cool as the bad guy, in this classic 80's action film!
","It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story, Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However, one company, ORION pictures, the last resort for this movie, loved the premise of a robot running around as a man, trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script, because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.In 2029, giant super computers dominate the planet, hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around, as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car, it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger, originally a body builder, he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator, End Of Days, Total Recall, Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back, due to injury, but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor, who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career, with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn, who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector, Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens, The Rock, Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical, Grease. The director of Terminator, namely James Cameron, did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed, had it rejected that many times, it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it, but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world, with the initials J.C., fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film. There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on, if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with, including the first confrontation with Sarah, in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it, that of Arnie's 'I'll be back', a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.So, what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was, that is too 'eightish', and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance, grab a copy of Terminator on DVD, as it is a great 2 disc set. I must admit the first time I saw it, I did not appreciate Terminator like I do now. Perhaps I found it a tad violent, but that is to be expected of a film that is called Terminator. This movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. However more was to come, a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Arnie was to deliver on his promise of 'I'll be back'!Rating: 4.5 stars or 9/10",Null,117,138,10 February 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Heads will roll. So, close your eyes. Say your prayers. Sleep if you can..........
","Sleepy Hollow comes to us from one Hollywood's more gothic and darker directors, that being Tim Burton. Famous for movies such as Beetlejuice, Batman and Edward Scissorhands, Burton brings an 18th century story to the screen as only he can. It also has much more, with great special effects and a subtly humorous script. Then to round this movie off, it has one of Hollywood's more hunkier guys in the lead role, who I am sure the girls cannot resist, that being Johnny Depp. It is the year 1799 and in the isolated hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, murder most foul has occurred. Three corpses have been found, each killed instantly, all decapitated. Visiting constable, Ichabod Crane, suspects one of the villagers is responsible, but the locals believe the killer is not one of their own and most definitely not of this world.There is a lot to like about this movie. The look of it is truly amazing, as nothing was left to the imagination in creating the town of Sleepy Hollow'. The people who were given the task of recreating the life and times of such a place did a remarkable job in making Sleepy Hollow' seem incredibly creepy. Another highlight was the use of special effects to enhance the story all the more. The character of the headless horseman' and other little bits and pieces, make Sleepy Hollow' an even greater visual experience.With all that being said, Tim Burton put his delicate touches to the film and made it very well. Being hands on' and very relaxed off-screen, Burton would have been great to work for on this film. It is also very obvious that Burton was apart of the film, as the dark, gothic look of the film has to be his idea. In this instance it helps make the film even greater.
The screenplay for the story is quite incredible. Not only is game enough to show a very gory type of villain, it has a hero that is quite eccentric, with all his gadgets, gismos and personality. Then to round it off we have some character that I would call different', but in a very good way. I also like the tongue in check' humour that was placed within the story and the action sequences which give the movie its variety. The Sleepy Hollow' screenplay was very well written by Kevin Yagher.Johnny Depp is the remarkable 1800's character of Ichabod Crane in the movie. Depp recreated the feel of the horror film acting' just nicely. I had to agree with his description of his character from a featurette on the film though. He said that his character on the outside' seemed very masculine and strong, yet on the inside he was like a pubescent girl'. We get to see him many times act like a girl would, fainting, and covering up in a bed, being really scared. I also like how this character makes himself look like such a fool at many intervals, which he does only because he wants to get the job he is working on done. Under Depp is a fine amount of talented actors. These include Katrina (Christina Ricci) who was a fine looking woman in the film. The evil Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) is one character that I was not expecting to be who she was. You have also got to be impressed with how dastardly a character that Hessian Horseman' (Christopher Walken) was. It is ironic that Walken plays a character in this movie, considering that his character in the 1983 movie, The Dead Zone', refers to the Sleepy Hollow story. He looked so evil when had his head attached to his body, a true credit to the make-up department. There are many other fine actors in supporting roles in the film that I really liked, but unfortunately cannot talk about.
There many parts to this movie that I liked. All the scenes which involve the de-heading' of many of Sleepy Hollow's town-folk are gory kind of events, but done in such a way that you just have to like. (The effort behind-the-scenes to make this part of the film is truly amazing!) To start the movie the way Burton did was a nice touch. Yet seeing the Headless Horseman go around on his horse was another part of the film that I find incredibly refreshing, as he is different to what we would normally see in the movies. The Horseman's resting place is another creation I find so original, and makes the movie even more surreal and horrific. Then top the movie off, you have the exciting action sequences which left me breathless. The musical side of Sleepy Hollow was also a highlight and had Tim Burton being reunited with composer Danny Elfman from Batman. He did a fine job in bringing out the movies more thrilling moments, with his orchestral cast which he assembled just wonderful. Sleep hollow has a lot to offer to its viewing audience, as it has something for every kind of taste. Themes such as action, horror, humour (comedy), thriller and drama are all within this movie and are used to great affect. One quote I can remember hearing about the film I feel suits it, that being: `it's really brutal, really physical, a really intense movie.' As you will see I was close to giving this movie 5 on my movie rating system (the CMRS), but there is only one downfall to it, and that is the disturbing references to the supernatural and witchcraft. I found them a bit hard to take, but I guess having a headless horseman' in one of the lead roles, it was inevitable that those themes would be in the movie. Nevertheless, I still find myself in true admiration for a movie that was game enough to do many things, that even I had thought were not possible.

We Were Soldiers," Whether it be man or woman, war hurts in all the bad places.
","When I was asked to see this movie, I was keen, but also cautious, that this might be just another one of those war movie' flicks. Yet to my surprise I really enjoyed what this film had to offer. It shows that no one totally wins in war. I also enjoyed the personal level this film had to it, giving the audience a chance to feel for the men on the battlefield and the women and families, who at anytime might hear some devastating news. We were soldiers' will stir even the most toughened of movie fans, and reduce them near to tears!On 14 November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley of Vietnam, more than 400 troopers from the U.S. 7th Air Cavalry found themselves outnumbered. Nearly 2000 enemy soldiers surrounded them in a small clearing called Landing Zone, and they had to fight like they'd never fought before. This fact-based tale of men under fire and their acts of valour and loyalty to one another is what became the first--and perhaps the worst--major battle of the Vietnam War.The cast of any war film must be extremely proud and conscious of what they are portraying. Having an actor such as Mel Gibson in the leading role, is a perfect example of that. He was brilliant as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, who must have been a truly brilliant war fighter in real life. I found Gibson's character to be very compassionate in situations that would usually require him to be totally merciless, and out for the kill. Gibson was made for this war role, with his other war film the classic, Gallipoli', a truly great film in its own right.Thanks to this film, I have finally seen a decent performance from young actor, Chris Klein. His role had plenty of class and emotion. I enjoyed how he asks, does a good soldier, make you a better father?' I am sure that many fathers must ask that of themselves as they go into battle, a fair evaluation of too. I know I have been critical of Klein before, but if he can do more work like this, than I am confident he will become a better actor. Someone else, who I have been a little unsure of in an acting sense, is Greg Kinnear. He has been in films like Someone like you', which was a great film, and a disappointing role in the farcical movie, Loser'. Yet for me, Kinnear has not done many roles that have stood out to me, such as his role in the classic romantic comedy As Good As It Gets'. That is up until now. His role as a leading chopper pilot in the Vietnam War was terrific. Being a chopper pilot must have been a very demanding, and this role also shows how tense a place war can and must be.   There were plenty of other roles in this film that deserve praise that I have no room to mention. All of the women were great, showing the other worrying' side to the war. The main woman that I want to point out, was the beautiful, Madeline Stowe, who was great as the Colonel Moore's wife. I found her to bring a feeling to this movie, that I felt it needed, but was not too over the top. Then take the role of funny Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, he was played very well by Sam Elliot. His character's very cynical comment towards all the soldiers was humorous to watch in such a tense and high-risk film.The story to We were soldiers', was for me, very satisfying. I enjoyed how we first had the chance to see the build up to being chosen to fight in the war, and then the transition to the battlefield was also brought well to the screen. Yet the best part of this story was how viewers get to see, what I call the other side to war, how it affects the people back home. That whole part had me very interested, and really kept the film alive and entertaining. Of course this film was adapted from the novel of the same name, and whether the story is completely accurate I am not so sure of, but the in the end it did not hamper the story in anyway at all for me. I also must give praise to the work of director, Randal Wallace, who did a very good job in bring this film to our screens. I especially like the end of the film, and the tribute that he gave to the certain soldiers in the Vietnam War. I really was impressed by this section of the film.This film really does give a graphic insight into how bad war must have been. No one wins from war, because the fatality count is just too high for one side to announce we won'. If you are considering watching this film please take note: this film is extremely confronting as it is graphic in picture and emotional in story, (well it was in my case anyhow). To say that I am thankful for not having to fight in war would be an understatement. Yet let me also say that God Bless' every soldier who has taken foot on a battlefield anywhere in the world!CMRS gives We were soldiers: 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)",Null,0,1,5 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Empire falls. A Grand Finale to the greatest movie trilogy of all time.
","Many millions of people love Star Wars, and I am not going to hide the fact, that I am part of that trend. In my opinion, Star Wars (Episodes 4-6) make the greatest movie trilogy of all time. In Episode 6, Return of the Jedi, we see the gripping conclusion to the ultimate movie joyride. So strap yourself in for the ride of your life!After rescuing Han Solo and Princess Leia from certain doom at the hands of crime lord Jabba the Hut, Luke Skywalker revisits Yoda, Jedi Master. For only by completing his Jedi training can he become a true Jedi Knight and defeat Darth Vader and the dark side of the force. Creatures from all over the galaxy rally in attempt to defy the Galactic Empire in rebuilding an even more deadly Death Star.ROTJ is not the best Star Wars film of the trilogy, but it is not a bad film. It tidies up all the loose ends that have been started by the previous two films and continues on the emotion that Empire Strikes Back had. The Screenplay for ROTJ was done by Executive Producer George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan. I love the new characters that were included in this story, as they are fun to watch. I also enjoyed the funny little bits that were added into this Star Wars story, like having a musical section at the start of the film.I was amazed to see that all of the Star Wars trilogy movies have been directed by three different people. But with George Luca's in charge of the Star Wars franchise, any good director could do the film and it would come out ok. In the director's chair for ROTJ, was Richard Marquand, who did an amiable job. He continues on the space fantasy which is concluded in ROTJ.
I have spoken about my feelings towards all the usual characters in the Star Wars trilogy. People like Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the robot droids R2D2 (Kenny Baker) and C3PO (Anthony Daniels). They have all had a great impact on the series, and do what is needed to be done to make ROTJ an enjoyable film.In ROTJ we get to see some brand new characters. For the first time we get the chance to see the Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who in the flesh, is a gruesome looking person. You can see why Darth Vader is so driven to serve the dark side of the force, as the Emperor is totally focused on making his side the strongest in the galaxy.But the best inclusion in this film has to be the fun little creatures called Ewoks, who are never referred to by name in the film. These Ewoks look like a cuddly teddy bear, but are very strong and aggressive little creatures. The funniest part with Ewoks has to be when these creatures mistakenly think C-3PO is some sort of god to them. There was also another interesting character from the rebellion, who was a major space commander. Insect look-a-like Admiral Piett (Kenneth Colley) is a man who is supposed to be taken seriously, but by looking at this person, you could be forgiven for starting to laugh at him as well.
RTOJ has some very enthralling moments in it. The start of RTOJ shows us with Luke at his home planet, where he is out to rescue the ill-fated Han Solo. Here we meet back up with Jabba the Hut, a slimy creepy blob, who is very happy to see Han Solo in the position he is. But the demise of Jabba and his crew is great, as Luke shows himself to be a real Jedi. In fact in this sequence we see two other gruesome creatures, one, a scary monster, who Luke defeats and the other is a creature in a pit that lies in the waiting for his next feed.Other enjoyable sequences are the parts with the Ewoks, as they make the film seem much less serious, a good thing in my view. In this part of the film, we see Luke and his friends trying to destroy a power station for the new death star on the Ewoks planet. Here high speed hover scooters are driven, and although all these scooters seem fake, they only add to the fantasy. Finally the final confrontation between Vader and Skywalker is great, as more sword fighting just gets me more excited. Then for us as the audience to see Darth Vader's head was a true highlight of the film. It is interesting to note: Darth Vader is the first character in movie history to be played by three actors (body by David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones, face by Sebastian Shaw)So who are my favourite Star Wars characters? Well I like almost all of them, but my most compelling characters have to be Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader,    Obi-wan Kenobi, Yoda and the two droids, R-2D2 and C-3PO. All these character creations are some of the best I have seen in a movie.
Every once in a while I have a great experience at a movie. That very experience was captured on me in the whole Star Wars trilogy (episodes 4-6), because people like myself can love these sorts of movies and get lost in them, so much so that we feel like we are part of the fantasy we are seeing played out on the screen. When a movie (or movies) can do this, I feel that they are something very special. Seeing all of the various characters from all of the Star Wars movies (episodes 4-6), has been a great pleasure and privilege for a film freak such as myself. So thank you George Lucas and may the movie forces be with you forever!CMRS gives 'Return of the Jedi: 5 (Brilliant Film)",Null,0,0,11 February 2004
Scary Movie 2," This is not a movie, this is an uninspiring, disgraceful, pointless crappy spiel of wasted film. Trust me, there are better ways to spend your time then watching this garbage.
","I have to say that writing about Scary Movie 2 is a painful experience, but not as painful as actually watching the ridiculous film that we are given by Keenan Ivory Wayan and his crew. To put this movie in perspective, it was supposed to make me laugh, right? I did not laugh once, which shows where it fails for me.So I am not going to deeply analyse this film, just tell you that it is not funny, has virtually no moments of greatness, the performances are pretty poor from all involved (including the Wayan brothers, Anne Faris, Malcolm in the middle star James DeBello, Tori Spelling, in a career destroying role, James Wood and Natasha Lyonne). While the direction of the film lacks any sense and is just one contrived mess in my view.To learn that acting legend Marlon Brando was going to accept a role on this film almost made me faint from shock. Thankfully the great man was not well enough to do so, because if he had have been a part of this terrible conglomeration, I believe it could have cost him more than his health. Scary movie (2000), the very original movie spoof, was a surprise in the cinemas, taking off some of the great horror movies of our time much better and was more to my liking. Yet with that film, I could only enjoy it once as it ran thin on me after that. This is the sort of comedy where you are either going to love it or hate it. I hate it with an absolute vengeance.So my rating? CMRS gives 'Scary Movie 2': 0 Reason? Sorry there is nothing here to really get your hopes up about this film. After turning this film off four times in disgust, the best part about this movie was seeing the closing credits, knowing that it was finally over and I was out my misery.P.S. Now seeing that there is a 'Scary Movie 3' out, I just sit, cringing in silence, hoping that this is the end to these bad movies. If I had one request as a movie-watcher, it would be that I could have those 100 minutes of my life back. I am disappointed that will not be happening. A friend warned me that this would happen. Why, oh why did I not listen to him? I am such an idiot!",Null,8,20,29 December 2004
Alien," Supposedly in space no one can hear you scream'. This film is overrated and just not good enough in my view.
","In reviewing Alien', I want to say that this movie might have been better for me to see, back when it was released in 1979. I only believe this, because for some reason I could not completely get rapped up in it. That is not to say I did not like some of it. However, as soon as part of me was starting too really like it, I had an experience with this film that I found unwholesome and frustrating, especially with the ending, a feeling that I remember I had through another popular movie  Fight Club'. It is a shame, because the idea that Aliens are out there and are scary is totally fascinating to me. The terror begins when the crew of the spaceship, Nostromo' investigates a transmission from a desolate planet and makes a horrifying discovery  a life form that breeds within a human host. Now the crew must not only fight for its survival, but the survival of all mankind.   Director Ridley Scott was and still is praised for giving us one of the great horror/Sci-Fi classics. I was not in awe of this film, however I feel I could have been. Scott's direction is one of the main problems with this film. Firstly, the film is given a pace that for me is far too slow. I would have preferred the film to have a quicker pace which would have increased the tension. The other problem is the way that Ridley did not take full advantage of the Alien' aspect to the film, especially with the ending that we see Ridley present. But the fans really do make a big song and dance about this film and the director is one of the reasons for that.
Yet the story to this film is also guilty of being weak, even underdeveloped. The screenplay was written by Dan O'Bannon, based on the story written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, which does have merits I have mentioned. But the story could have done so much more with the Alien' created. Also whoever devised the ending to this film did a terrible job, as I found it totally unsatisfying, bringing the film down for me. Some of the actors and characters in this film are very good. At the start of the film we see the entire crew of Nostromo' awake. The ship is commanded by Dallas (Tom Skerritt), who cares more for his crew than for the actual space mission. Skerritt is pretty good as this character. Under Dallas is female commander Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who is a real find as female action hero. Ripley has balls', and I get this feeling from Weaver's performance. Ripley believes in following protocol, a big difference to Dallas. Another interesting character is Ash (Ian Holm). With the discovery of this Alien life-form, Ash is genuinely excited instead of scared which is the reaction the rest of the crew give. What the movie reveals about Ash is quite unbelievable, but very interesting. While what happens to scientist Kane (John Hurt) might be a pretty ordinary demise, but another of the film's great moments. 
The rest of the crew (or cast) is not so great. The other female crewmember Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is strange, as she does nothing more on this ship, other than whinge and scream. But more annoying than Lambert, are the two space engineers Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Stanton Brett (Harry Dean). This pair get along very well, suiting each other. These characters brought nothing inventive to the film, and are very frustrating. Seeing all these characters go' was a blessing, rather than upsetting in my view. 
I liked the Alien' effects that were presented here. The Alien creations themselves were wonderfully done by the special effects crew (Carlo Rambaldi and Bernard Lodge) and costume crews (John Mollo, H.R. Giger, and Roger Dicken). Everything from the creation that looks part spider, part female genitalia (which causes some of the great scary moments in the film), up to the actual Alien' we see, which is gruesome, but in its own way very attractive, were fantastic. This is one of my favourite areas of the entire film. To be honest I first watched this film around 5 years ago, and was feeling so scared, I had to fast forward the DVD. Since that time, when I put this film on, I am waiting in anticipation for the movie to give me as much of that scared' reaction as possible, as that is the feeling I desire as I am watching it. But that experience is very limited in this film. So with all these factors, I have to say I am disappointed in Alien' and do not agree that this is a brilliant movie, in fact it is quite the opposite. What a pity!CMRS gives Alien': 1.5 (Bad  Ok Film)",Null,0,3,29 April 2004
Rocky II," The rematch of the century!
","`There is one thing I want you to do for me, win, win!'  These are the words of Rocky's wife Adrian, recovering in hospital. Many movies have defining moments, with this part being no exception. Rocky II gives the audience a chance to see why Rocky Balboa is not just some street fighter, but a true champion. In some ways Rocky II is better than the original, which for me is hard to admit or write.After the controversial first challenge match in which spilt-decision awards the Heavy Weight title to defending champion, Apollo Creed, Rocky Balboa officially retires from boxing. However the Italian Stallion' finds it difficult to get work and coping with his new found notoriety. Apollo is also feeling the pressure as the calls for a rematch increase. Marriage to long time girlfriend, Adrian complicate matters, when she strongly objects to Rocky's return to the ring. He cannot turn away from the only life he has ever known and once again the training begins. When Adrian falls unexpectedly ill, it seems Rocky has lost the will to fight. Upon her recovery, she asks one thing of her husband  that he win. Spurred on by this and with help by Mickey, his trainer and Adrian's brother, Paulie, Rocky gets back into shape and once more enters the ring for the fight of his life a second time!This movie is a great follow up to the original. The cast, which for Rocky II has not changed that much, do it all again. Sylvester Stallone has now taken another added pressure, to just writing the story and starring as the `Italian Stallion', he now directs the film, which is a great effort. I felt the character of Rocky in this film was interesting, as we get to see the side to him that I am sure audiences would have been scared to see, that he is losing that desire to fight. However after the words from his love and most important person in his life, Adrian, he gets the only encouragement he needs. Taking on another aspect of this movie, did in no way, hamper the role of Rocky by Stallone. In fact I believe it improved it.The other cast members were also great. Telia Shire, was magnificent as the faithful wife of our champion, and again proves what a relationship is all about. Then you have the arrogant, but honest trainer Mickey, who tells Rocky to shape up or ship out as there is no room for any doubts. I love his role and perhaps that is the reason why I can say this set of sequels remains of mine favourite today. Rocky's angry opponent, Apollo Creed, is once again portrayed by the wonderful Carl Weathers. He means business this time, and for fans of this film it makes a much better film, as some of the fans of boxing question that the last win by Creed is fake, making him want a rematch, to prove he is a champion. This story was a good follow up to the first film, showing Rocky to be a struggler, was an ingenious piece of writing on Stallone's behalf. He tries to be something else other than a fighter, yet in the end, everything points to Rocky being what he always wants and in some way has to be. In addition to having the rematch with Apollo Creed, making it all the more interesting.
I want to take a moment to reflect on what a brutal sport that boxing is. I mean we know what damage a boxer can do to himself, with head injuries being something they have to live and face once they step out of the ring. In Rocky II, the doctor has recommended' that Balboa stay away from professional fighting, yet Rocky and I am sure real fighters ignore medical advice and take the ring, when in all seriousness that is the worst thing that they could be doing. The finale to this review, I would like to say that to make a good man, he needs a good woman, and a good friend told me that. Women can bring out in men, something that changes them.

"Monsters, Inc."," You won't believe your eye.' after watching this Pixar masterpiece!
","After you have seen Pixar's Monsters, Inc.' two things are apparent about monsters. One is that humans think monsters are scary, and two, is that humans really scare them! I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a cartoon or a movie so much. I know that Pixar has had great success with many animated movies in the past. However, I feel that Monsters Inc.' out-classes such titles as, Toy Story', Shrek' and A Bug's Life' by far. With its funny story, great characters and wonderful voiceovers, Monsters, Inc.' will be a tough act to follow in the world of movie animation. Take a look at the monsters who say We Scare Because We Care'.Monsters, Inc. is the largest scare factory in the monster world. The top kid scarer is James 'Sully' Sullivan, a huge intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant and best friend is Mike Wazowski, a lime green, opinionated, feisty, one-eyed monster. Scaring children isn't such an easy job, monsters believe children are toxic and that direct contact with them would be catastrophic. Inside the factory can be found the factory's crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, the beguiling serpent-haired receptionist Celia and the sarcastic chameleon monster, Randall Boggs, who schemes to replace Sully as Monsters Inc.'s top Scarer. Visiting from the human world is Boo, a tiny girl who turns Mike and Sully's world upside-down.There is so much to like about Monsters, Inc.'. The team from Pixar really give great attention to detail when they bring out an animated feature. I really like the computer animated graphics, as many of these characters to me seem to be real. The many facial expressions these monsters have are just wonderful. They were so funny, that they made me laugh many times. The sounds used in Monsters Inc' were of the finest quality and help to define the monsters and the world they live in. I also like the story that Pixar made for this film. Having doors between the monsters world and ours is clever. Also having the story follow the fortunes of Mike and Sully is good, as it is never dull or boring when it come to those two characters. Add in the what Boo does to the story, I feel it makes for the perfect script. I enjoy how this story ends, as it made me feel very satisfied for watching.The characters that were invented for this film are some of the best I have ever seen. My favourite is the simple, but idiotic eyeball, Mike Wazowski'. Almost every time I saw his eye appear onscreen, he would make me laugh. Mike's best friend, is James Sully' Sullivan, and scaring kids is what he is really good at. Mike and Sully are a great team. There characters show the audience that real friends stick together through thick and thin. The other good characters include Mike's love interest Celia. The nicknames the pair call each other are hilarious. I cannot forget to mention one of the main stars of the show, Boo (Mary Gibbs). She is the little child who manages to make her way inside Monsters, Inc.'. I love her funny cry of Mike-Wazowski'. Yet with the good comes the bad. The meanest monster in Monstropolis' is a snaky chameleon character, called Randal Boggs. He is trying to become the number one scream collector at Monsters, Inc'. Another character not be trusted or liked at Monsters Inc' is Henry J. Waternoose, the CEO of the plant. He is a cross between a crab and spider, and only wants his employees to scare children and make him successful.The voiceovers used in this film were out of this world'. Having stars such as Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, James Coburn as Henry and Steve Buscemi as Randall, were all perfect choices to voice each character. You can actually picture Crystal as Mike, the talkative sidekick and Goodman as Sully, the big cuddly blue Monster, who really does care about everyone. I love Roger Ebert's cheeky comment in reference to Jennifer Tiley's character of Celia, `What she (Celia) sees in him (Mike) is beyond me, although if there is anyone who can figure out how to have sex with a green eyeball, that would be Jennifer Tilly. I can imagine her brassy voice: 'Blink! Blink!'.' 	There are some great scenes in Monsters, Inc'. I like almost every scene with Mike, as he is crazy, funny and stupid. Sully's introduction with Boo is also a highlight, as we all see what a little child can do to the number one scarer'. Then what follows is the funny scene where Mike says the silly line of `This is for the up-coming company play put that thing back where it came from or so help me'. Watch out for the play on the DVD, it is a classic extra feature. Another entertaining sequence in the film is the rollercoaster chase that Mike and Sully have to do, contending with hundreds of conveyor-driven doors to make sure that Boo is safe.
I recently had the chance to compare the other animated film which has been released at the moment, Ice Age'. While I know it has had good reviews from many people, I found to be nowhere near as good as what 'Monsters, Inc.' was or is. Pixar is truly talented at bringing us movies, which are normally thought to be just for children'. However, this movie can be enjoyed by many different groups as its genre suggests, such as the whole family'. I know being a kid helps me for starters, but if you cannot like Mike and the gang' then there is something wrong. I wait in anticipation for what Pixar brings us next. If you are a true movie fan, then do yourself a favour and show that you care' by watching this animated classic.

Bridget Jones's Diary," For anyone who has ever been set up, stood up or felt up
","Hearing about a film coming out of England called `Bridget Jones's Diary', a book coming to the big screen, I was not so sure what to expect. Yet by the time I finished viewing it, I was glad for the experience. Bridget Jones is a character that a woman or a man can relate to, as she is down on her luck in many things in life, but proves that if you give yourself a chance and wait your turn, things will work out ok. 32 year old Bridget smokes too much, drinks too much and has a tendency too say whatever is on her mind. As a new year's resolution she decides it's time to take control of her life  and starts keeping a diary. Now the most provocative, erotic and hysterical book on her bedside table is the one she's writing. With a taste for adventure and an opinion on every subject  from exercise to men to food to sex and everything in between  she's turning the page on a whole new life.The cast of this film were fantastic. Undoubtedly Renee Zellweger deserves a big pat on the back for her role, which was not only funny, but also loveable. Hearing about all the lengths she went to fit the part is also another reason that this role will for me, be unforgettable. She had to endure days of eating pizzas and chocolate bars, anything you can imagine to gain weight for the role of Bridget, which is quite amazing.
Also impressive in their roles in this film were the males stars, which include English heart-throb Hugh Grant. He was great as Bridget's boss and boyfriend, Daniel Cleaver, the one character that you think you can trust, then in one foul swoop, turns out to be the scum bag of the movie. His role is not much different from the one he had in Notting Hill which was a great, though in this film he is character has a lot more ego than the one he had in Notting Hill. Then you have the good guy in the whole film, the character of Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth, who was great. You are never totally sure what to think of Mark in this one. His facial expression throughout the whole film is so plain, that he could be the bad guy or the good guy, for all you know? This film was extremely clever' how it goes into the mind of Bridget Jones, via the audience hearing all the sarcastic comments that she has to say. Comments about `Uncle Geoffrey', who was not her real uncle, Publisher Mr Fitzherbert, who was affectionately known to Bridget as `Mr Titspervert', with Bridget's book launch speech hilarious. Whoever decided to put this side in the movie got it right, as it allows the audience to see what Bridget is thinking about.There is one great soundtrack to this film. With performers which include Geri Halliwell, with the bopping hit `It's raining men', Gabrielle with `Out of reach' Shellby Lynne and Robbie Williams. In addition there are some timeless classic hits include `All by myself', which Bridget performs drunk and depressed, `Respect', `Don't get me wrong' and `Ain't no mountain high enough'.So overall, Bridget Jones's Diary is a film that anyone could sit and watch and take something away from it. Whether it is just a laugh or some advice for real life, the message should come through somehow. There are many funny scenes attached to this movie that I will never forget, such as Bridget dressed as a Bunny Rabbit, going to her relatives party and having two men fighting  over her in the streets of London. So if you want a laugh, take the time to meet Bridget Jones. By the way a warning: reading Bridget's diary might be a little dangerous and adopting her lifestyle could damage your health!Rating: 4.5 stars or 9/10",Null,0,0,27 December 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," I have finally found a teen film that can beat American Pie!
","In the vain of She's All That and Can't Hardly Wait, comes Ten Things I Hate About You. I loved it. The story focuses on Cameron, the new kid at school, who falls for Bianca, the gorgeous girl of his dreams. The only problem for Cameron is that Bianca is forbidden to date unless her ill-tempered, completely un-dateable older sister Kat goes out, too! So to solve his problem, Cameron singles out Patrick, who can match Kat, the mysterious bad boy of the school, with a nasty reputation.Firstly, Australia's Heath Ledger was fantastic in this movie. He played the role of Patrick Verona ( the bad boy at school) perfectly. I look forward to seeing him in more films and if you haven't seen him in The patriot, then you have missed a truly great performance. Katrina Straforti (Kat for short) was played by Julia Stiles and she did every mood swing in the film perfectly. As Pat says to Kat, `You're not as mean as you think you are', there relationship is one of the key factors of the whole movie! While Kat's younger sister Bianca, played by Alex Mac star Larisa Oleynik was great too. She shows the potential of being a big star one day. Finally the movie itself has many twists to it and the title in many ways tells you what the flick is going to be like. So if you are dying to see a good teenage flick with a difference, be like me, go to the video store do yourself a favour and hire `Ten Things I Hate About You!'

"Good Morning, Vietnam"," The wrong man. In the wrong place. At the right time.
","Goooooooood morning, Vietnam', is the catch cry of irreverent, nonconformist Army Radio DJ Adrian Cronauer, and once you have heard it for the first time you know that you are in for a special performance from one of Hollywood's great comedic actors.  Placed in Saigon, in the middle of the Vietnam War, Cronauer has a very unique style of Dee-Jaying, which makes him very popular with the troops, but not so with his officials. This is Robin Williams at his very best, in a role that he was born to do.Imported by the Army for an early a.m. radio show, Adrian Cronauer blasts the formerly staid, sanitised airwaves with a constant barrage of rapid-fire humour and the hottest hits from back home. The G.I.s love him - but the brass is up in arms! Riddled with side-splitting comic bombshells and studded with hot '60s hits, Good Morning Vietnam depicts Cronauer's raucous Saigon adventures amid a world gone mad.I really enjoyed the story of GMV. As I am writing this review, the world is at war, so I feel that a movie like this can help to bring into perspective what war might be like. The story is based around the Vietnam War, with Adrian Cronauer brought into strut his stuff on the air. From the first time we hear Adrian do his radio show, the movie is placed into overdrive, as we get one of the great comedic performances. GMV was directed by Barry Levinson in a really clever way. I love how he shows Cronauer to cause a great commotion during the war, while not shying away from other issues concerning the war. Levinson used the very funny screenplay written by Mitch Markowitz. I love the characters Mitch wrote in the story, and the humour that was placed in the lead character of Cronauer.    
So with all that in prospective, if Robin Williams did not bring the right comedic feel to the movie, it could have gone wrong. But as the good comedian that he is, Williams pulled the role off. He was so funny in front of the microphone, adlibbing his way through all his radio show. When he is not, he is almost as funny, trying to pick up Vietnamese girls of the street, going as far as to be an English teacher to attract one sweet girl called Trinh (Chintara Sukupatana). These scenes are extremely funny, as Cronauer uses a lot of his humour to allow himself to fit into the class. Adrian's help while on the air is Edward Garlick (Forest Whittaker). He rides through all the highs and lows Cronauer has in Vietnam and is strongly influenced by what sort of character Cronauer is. The other character that is helped by Cronauer is another DJ, Marty Lee Dewitz (Robert Wuhl) who is totally in awe of DJ Cronauer who has swept in from places we actually do not know. Yet there are characters here that do not like Adrian, which in turn I feel us as the audience, are not meant to like either. Lt Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) is infuriated by the style of broadcasting that Cronauer has brought to Armed Forces Radio, so much so that he tries his own hand at Cronauer's show. However, he is a terrible replacement, with the troops causing quite a commotion, asking for the irreverent DJ to be reinstated immediately. The other official that Cronauer rubs up the wrong way is Major Philip Dick' Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). He has no time for Adrian's smartass attitude and has contempt for the man, evening commenting that Cronauer's humour is not funny at all'. Yet, at the end of the film, the comment by Cronauer is exactly what you want Dickerson to hear, as he has a really mean attitude problem, as told by his superior, General Taylor (Noble Willington).
There is one surprising character in GMV, that of Trinh's younger brother Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran). For the majority of the film you believe that he is a good character, but as the film comes to a conclusion, and we learn who and what Tuan really is, and you can understand why Cronauer is a little peeved at person that he called friend'. There confrontation is one of the more dramatic and touching moments in the film. There are many other memorable moments in GMV'. I love how we are introduced to Cronauer, as we have no idea what sort of DJ he is or he is going to be. I also like the scene where Edward takes Adrian into the field, to see what a difference he has made to the troops who are serving in the war. Once again we get to see how funny-a-man Cronauer is. I must also make mention of the great soundtrack that was assembled for GMV. With Adrian playing such great rock 'n' roll hits as the Beach Boy's I get around' and Don't worry baby', the Searchers sugar and spice', Wilson Pickett's the midnight hour', James Brown's I got you (I feel good) and Louis Armstrong's classic hit  What a wonderful world'. All these songs make the movie unforgettable and essentially what it is. So I really like this movie, not only for the classic radio scenarios that we are shown, but for how game the movie is in showing the dangers of war. In fact there is one scene in this movie that brings back memories of last October in Bali. I believe this is the good work of Barry Levinson and his team, who must have had a great time on the movie. I just wish I had watched this movie while trying desperately to become a radio DJ, because Adrian Cronauer makes the air waves look a lot of fun.

American Pie," There is something about your first piece!
","While this movie might be a very funny look at the very taboo subject of sex, I feel it is the right time for me to give my opinion on what was a very popular teenage film. This film had a cast that was extremely funny and a story that should and does appeal to many teenagers. However I am going to also throw some ideas to young people, that think sex is just a game or something which has to be dared, pressured or made a pact on in a group to do, to thus gain the greatest human conquests, of getting 'laid', (a term I totally disagree with).In this coming-of-age comedy, a group of friends at the end of their senior year make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. In their outrageous attempts to fulfil this mission, they come to some surprising, hilarious and often touching realisations about themselves, their friendships, their notions of love, romance and their relations with the opposite sex. As the fateful date draws near, the boys wonder who among them will get lucky. More importantly, do they really want to do it at all?This story was very funny the first time I watched it, in a packed cinema. Yet as I have gotten a little older, my feelings on the movie and what it is about have changed quite substantially. Having the four main characters try to find glory with a girl has been done so many times, but then again I can see this film had some sort of originality to it. I did like the direction this film took, under the guidance of the Weitz brothers.The cast this film had, while rather unknown in talent, was extremely good. I enjoyed the role that Jason Biggs took on especially. To think that his character Jim was bagged for almost everything he did, it was even more courageous to act it. I remember in an interview, he said he had no problems doing the 'pie scene'. I am not sure I would have been so calm about it. Jason has gone on to do movies such as the disappointing Loser and a film called 'Boys and Girls'. The other obvious favourite in this film would have to be the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth. She was very good as exchange student Nadia. The scenes she has with Jim are priceless, but alas of course he 'blows' the chance with her.Other members in the cast include the innocent Heather (Mena Suvari). She was a different member of the movie's group who stood out a little bit, and made the right decisions for herself. The better role the Mena has done would have to be in American Beauty, where she was a lot more liberated in what she did and said. Finch was played Eddie Kaye Thomas, and I can relate to the way his character is treated in American Pie. He is the supposed 'brains' of the group, yet outside of the classroom he was made a complete idiot of.The other standout role in this film (if you it can have such a thing?) would have to be that of Stifler (Sean William Scott). He was the bragger of the film, saying he can score with any girl he likes, which in reality is probably true. Why I don't know? Sean has also appeared in other films such as the crazy 'Dude where's my car', which I did not like, 'Road Trip' and in the tense thriller 'Final destination'.Yet we have other roles such as Vicki (Tara Reid) and her onscreen boyfriend Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols). While Jessica (Natasha Lynne), the flute toting Michelle (Allison Hannigan) and Oz (Chris Klein), round out a pretty good cast. Yet the one person who was a little older in this movie, but still very good, was Jim's Dad (the hilarious Eugene Levy). He was so funny, that he could almost be my favourite of the whole film, with his adlibs just great.Yet this film makes a great mockery of something is meant to be so special. If people around the world try to lose their virginity, because others around them have, then I am afraid to say that sex has lost all it sacredness and value. Yet also think about what the consequences are of a sexual relationship. The AIDs virus is a deadly part of our society now, as are other STDs. Then what about unwanted pregnancies? They are common occurrence these days, which is a real problem. I am not so sure that this film worries about issues such as these, instead trading them in for a good laugh instead. Can people see where I am coming from?This film also reminded me a lot of films such as the totally funny 'Mischief', starring the gorgeous Kelly Preston. I remember reading that this film was based a little bit on Mischief. It also felt a bit like 'Fast times at Ridgemont high' and the brilliant 'Breakfast Club'. In that way I say that American Pie was good, yet it also had originality that it could only have.I have heard many people who loved this film, especially young immature teenage boys (who else but the silly looking boys hey?). Yet I met one girl who said that after one hour of viewing this movie she told me that she had to leave the cinema. I am not surprised by this reaction. As a Christian, I feel that sex is a gift that was given to us by God. Yet the general public abuses something so special by making it a very selfish act. We are not making love any longer, but sleeping around to get better names for ourselves. If people can not see that American pie does this to a very big extent, then our younger generation are more naÃ¯ve than I thought!CMRS gives 'American Pie': 4 (Very Good Film)",Null,0,1,28 April 2004
Cast Away," Trying to survive what challenges life throws up to each individual
","In life we all make our mistakes. Some cost us very little, and others cost us a lot. Yet it is what we do about these mistakes that makes a person who and what they are. While it was a different movie to experience, Cast Away gives the viewer an incite into what it is like to try and survive after nearly losing their life, in addition it is  a chance to see what it is like to have to go back to the basics, to see what is needed to have a second chance at living a normal' life again. Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer whose ruled-by-the-clock existence abruptly ends when a harrowing plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island. As Chuck struggles to survive, he finds that his own personal journey has just begun. Cast Away is an extraordinary movie. It goes for almost half the time with no dialogue and only one actor on our screen. Yet the whole film works. The main star is Hollywood legend Tom Hanks who plays the stranded Chuck Noland. He is brilliant, with his role showing us how talented he really is. His on-screen presence made me at times happy and others sad. It would have been very taxing role for Hanks, yet I could not imagine anyone else doing it. In fact Hanks is rather unlucky not winning the academy award for best actor for this film, as he would have been a worthy recipient of the honour.
The other main star of Cast Away and an important friend for Chuck was Wilson. Wilson was just a volleyball, yet the relationship between him and Chuck was just great. This was an ingenious part of the film and one, which I will remember for a long time to come. Another significant part of this film is the delightful Helen Hunt, who plays Chuck's girlfriend Kelly Frears. The scenes that are between Hunt and Hanks are very touching, especially at the end of the film. Cast Away was shot in one of the beautiful parts of our world  that being Fiji. The little island that was used was just beautiful and was the perfect place to shoot this film. All the time and effort spent to set this film up would have been very taxing on all involved, yet the end result was one great movie. Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job on this film, yet it was a shame that he allowed audiences to see far too much of the film in the trailers before the film was released. If anyone was to actually go through what the character Chuck Noland experienced and survive then it would be a real miracle, and I guess there would be stories similar to this. This film is all about being able to go on against all the odds and making it, when everything says that you shouldn't. Cast Away for me had an ending that was adequate, yet I can understand people being left unsatisfied and mystified by it, with several questions being left unanswered. If you want to be left inspired that you can achieve anything, then sit down and get cast away! Rating: 4.5 or 9/10",Null,0,0,21 January 2002
American Beauty," Look Closer
","When we all look at our lives, do we ever think of what people on the outside think of what is going on in the inside? Well that is exactly what the film American Beauty allows us to do, take a look at an ordinary suburban family and see how extraordinary there lives really are. What goes on behind closed doors isn't always what you think.Look closer at forty something ad man Lester Burnham and his status-seeking wife, Carolyn, as their marriage and lives slowly unravel. Lester's wife hates him, his daughter Jane regards him with contempt, and his boss is positioning him for the axe. As Lester decides to make a few changes in his life; the freer he gets, the happier he gets. But Lester is about to learn that the ultimate freedom comes at the ultimate price.American Beauty is a cinema masterpiece. I cannot remember a film that astounded me so much after watching it. The story of this movie is fantastic. To be placed within the hectic family of Burnham's and there neighbourhood was great. I love how this movie was filmed. Being from almost one man's perspective was just wonderful, in addition to the way the character Ricky Fitts uses his video camera is another unique piece of cinematography. The credit for this part of the film has to go to Cinematographer Conrad L Hall, who did a superb Job. Also praise has to be given to British director Sam Mendes, who did a fantastic job bringing American Beauty to our screens. Both these men deserved their Academy awards they were awarded.Then what can you say about the cast of American Beauty. In one word, it was BRILLIANT. The star was of course Kevin Spacey, whose Academy award winning role was outstanding. His role of Lester had many touchy subjects related to it, but he handled it with the greatest amount of class that I have seen from any actor. Spacey is a legendary actor. His on screen wife, Caroline was played by actress Annette Bening who was also very good in her role. I enjoyed her performance in the drama, The siege. The way these two performed together onscreen was just great.The role of Jane, the Burnham's daughter, was played by Thora Birch. She was very good in her role as the ignorant and frustrated daughter. Her onscreen chemistry with Wes Bently, who played Ricky Fitts, was also very good. Then you have the most librated character on the whole film, that of Angela Hayes portrayed by Mena Suvari. Her role was extremely controversial, with the nude scenes that she plays extraordinary. I love the use of rose petals with her character, and the way that both Spacey and Suvari handled there semi-love scenes onscreen. It is a shame that Suvari will no longer be doing these sort scenes since she has had a clause put into her contract.
There are many funny and very unforgettable scenes in this movie. The funniest and most tense of them all, would have to be at the dinner table, when Lester cracks the sh_ts with his family after losing his job. It was a brilliant scene and one that I could imagine might have taken more than one take. There are many personal scenes played by Spacey that I have so much respect for the man as an actor. The other funny scene is in the drive-thru, when Lester catches his wife cheating on him, very funny.This movie is also a great view of how sinful our world really is, that is if you believe in sin. There is many situations that a religious person can say that this is the case with this film. Firstly there is infidelity, then there is reference to and there is murder, homosexuality, hatred and bitterness. This movie really does portray what life really is like.So all in all, American beauty is one exceptional film. It has everything that you could want. It gives a good look at what life is really like. I can relate to this movie, considering my family was not unlike the Burnham's. It was like this between our mother and father, and family for that matter. It was an act for us and there was an act for everyone else. It was sort of fake in a way and it is exactly what American Beauty is trying to say I think. I love the dialogue between Lester and his Neighbour Frank, when they say:`Where's your wife?''Uh, I dunno. Probably out f__king that dorky, prince-of-real-estate guy.'`Your wife is with another man and you don't care?''Nope. Our marriage is just for show. A commercial for how normal we are when we're anything but.'I believe many marriages and family's are just a commercial, but perhaps I am being a little general and biased in my observation. Anyway this film deserves all it accolades that it got and I am going to one day add to my DVD collection. This film is an 'American Beauty', look closer at it by all means.Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10",Null,0,0,12 March 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Same make. Same model. New mission.
","Terminator 2 would have to be one of the world's greatest movie sequels. I actually watched this film before the original, and it really astounded me. I love the way the audience is taken on such a joy ride with this film. The main stars are back for a second time, as is the director, with some new faces that makes this film all the more enjoyable. It is the year 1995, John Connor, the earth's redeemer, is a healthy young rebellious 10-year-old. John's mother, Sarah, is being held captive in a mental institution, against her will. However, John's life is in danger when a new type of Terminator is sent to kill him. However, the same model Cyborg that was sent to kill Sarah over a decade ago is now on a new mission. He is to protect John at any cost. The world's future lies in a machine's hands; can he save the world and John Connor? This film is a standout for me, because of the special effects that it contains. It makes the Terminator films all the more fascinating for the audience. To see a creature being able to mould itself into almost any thing was unbelievable. The credit for this side of T2 must go to the special effects team, who were brilliant at making this all seem so real, when it really isn't. The way we see the evil Terminator just transforms himself into anything he pleases is quite amazing.The cast of Terminator 2 was again, pretty good in my view. I want to first of all talk about the new stars of the series. Firstly we get to see the acting debut of unknown talent Edward Furlong. He was excellent in the role of the world's new savior, John Connor. Edward was also brilliant in the controversial film, American history X, alongside Edward Norton. That film confronted racism, had an extreme amount of violence, but was a great film to watch. The second new face in Terminator 2 was the bad guy, Robert Patrick. He role mind-blowing, in the way that we get to see him run around and then change into any figure he likes. Patrick has had an interesting career, with a short stint in the popular TV series, X-files, with some of his other film credits including Die Hard 2, The Faculty and Striptease.The cast members that returned for a second time were all pretty good in their roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger kept his promise about being back, with an exceptional role as the protective Cyborg in T2. I love the way that both him and Edward Furlong's roles are so close, it actually makes the film a much better film, considering it is not an all out violent action film. Then you have Linda Hamilton, who returns as John Connor's mother, Sarah. In this movie though, Sarah is a different person altogether. She is a psycho, who cannot escape from mental institute. I read one person's opinion on her role, saying that it was almost over the top. I disagree, considering her character needed to change, it would not have suited the films if she were not the tough girl in the second film. Terminator 2, while it is a much better film, because of the time it was made and the budget it would have had, it does in some way resemble the first film. I guess it had to. I am not talking about the storyline, but some scenes that are included in it. The one scene that is similar would have to be the nitrogen truck scene, where the two Terminators do battle. I loved it, but I can understand some viewers not. There other scenes in this movie, which feels like a carbon of the first, but are more paced making them much better. I am talking about such scenes as the motorbike chase when the evil terminator is trying to kill John, not to similar to the first film when the evil terminator is trying to kill Sarah. Then again we do have the special effect scenes that are just amazing, where the evil Cyborg is able to make himself turn into almost anything he pleases. The scene are all outstanding, with the best scenes being the ones where we see him running around the mental hospital, with him in front everyone walking through a metal door. The doctor that did not believe any of Sarah's stories is left dumbfounded by what he sees. These scenes would have taken months of planning, but they were done to perfection.So with all that in mind, I can only praise this terrific sequel. James Cameron has out done himself. He has had a funny career and life for that matter. One of his biggest films was of course Titanic, which I can no longer bear to watch and he had been married five times, with one of his five wives being Terminator star, Linda Hamilton. All that aside he has had a winner with the terminator projects. We are in for a treat as there is to be a Terminator 3 in 2003, which hopefully can be as good as its predecessors.   The people I ask have constantly told me that Terminator 2 is the better of the two films. I cannot disagree with that. With its great special effects and cast nothing will change the public's mind about this movie. Sit back, relax and be blown away by T2: Judgment Day, Hasta la vista, baby!Rating: 4.5 Stars or 9/10",Null,1,1,10 February 2002
Apocalypse Now," This is a groundbreaking masterpiece of a movie.
","Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now' is one of the most controversial movies that our world has been privileged to see. I have heard many rumours about what happened on the set of this film, causing many problems, but I believe that does not distract from how good a movie I think it is. But I warn you, Apocalypse' has a very long and confusing story that might make it hard for you to appreciate what Coppola was trying to show. There have been many war movies made by Hollywood, but none are quite like this.
Nominated for 8 academy awards, Apocalypse Now tracks the journey of Captain Willard, a US Army intelligence officer sent on a hazardous mission up river in Cambodia to terminate with extreme prejudice' an American renegade, a colonel named Kurtz' who has spun out of control (and out of his mind!), in a remote jungle compound. Apocalypse Now was really well made by Francis Ford Coppola (as director, producer and screenwriter). Coppola had many moments in the film where he wanted to say something and that is what he did. I love the way he shot the war scenes in this film, as they were not only very dramatic, but also very funny as well. I am certain that he was trying to deliberately show the irony of war', a real highlight of the film. Helping Coppola write the film's screenplay were Michael Herr and John Millus. They all did a fantastic job, incorporating the mind-boggling story of Hearts of Darkness', by adventurer Joseph Conrad. It is my view that this story, while being hard story to understand, is important for people to learn about. All the writers did with this story was replace the trip up the Congo Marlow has in the HOD' story, with the river trip thorough Cambodia for Captain Willard and his crew. Some people could criticise this movie's story, saying that Coppola used it for his own convenience. However I think it is good to try and learn about an old story, in a modern kind of way, in a story that has undoubtedly affected our world, for many years now.     
This movie shows many characters that have gone mad (or indeed are about too end up that way!). Its main star is Willard (Martin Sheen), the captain that is given the unenviable task of trying to find the ex-army colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). While Sheen was good in certain parts of his role, I must say that I found Willard to be a very mysterious character that lacked in dialogue. For me, this made him very hard to like. A lot has been said about the small role taken on by legendary actor Marlon Brando. He might have been paid one million dollars for the performance, but he does show he was the right person for the job. I believe Brando comes across perfectly as this army colonel, gone insane. When Brando says The horror, the horror', it brought back some fond memories of the HOD' story for me. It is also funny to see the Photojournalist (Dennis Hopper), who is a really strange guy, harassing Willard when he finally finds Kurtz at his jungle hideaway. This character is another man that could be considered crazy', as all his actions signal that to me.The other cast members in the film take a lot less of the limelight in the film, as that is how the story wants them to be. But they still do have an impact at certain times of the movie. At the beginning of the film we meet a few officials that give Willard his mission. One of them is a Colonel (a very young Harrison Ford). Then on the boat that is helping take Willard on his mission through the Cambodian river are Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert Hall), the boat driver, Lance (Sam Bottoms) who has a disturbing death scenes, and Clean (an almost unrecognisable Laurence Fishburne), whose death is much more dignified than that of the chief. When we see the war zone in Vietnam for the first time, we meet a most unusual personality, Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall). The scene with the Kilgore in it at the earlier stage of the movie, is truly great, as we see the war going on around him (with no shirt on mind you), but what is even more amazing is that he tells his officers around him, it is ok to surf, get out there or fight'. Now in any normal war film, that would be the last thing on anyone's mind, let alone an order from a top ranking official.
However, the most disturbing scene in the film happens when the navy boat crew stops, suspicious about the occupants of a Vietnamese boat. The massacre that follows is very hard to watch, but it does show what can happen, when men are trained to fight and kill in war. Willard as Captain shows absolutely no compassion to these people at all.
I am not worried if there are people out there that hate this movie, but I hope you at least gave it a chance before feeling that way. I hope that in some way my review has given you an insight into what the film is about. I must reiterate that this film has an historical story attached to it. If you are a fan of literature, I can only recommend you read the Hearts of darkness' story, but be ready for heavy bit of reading. If this movie gets a bit heavy for you, keep reminding yourself what it is trying to show - Captain Willard and his mission, which is to find this brilliant army colonel that has gone completely mad and kill him. This is a brilliantly made film, with a remarkable story, cast and direction. I can only recommend you that you see it.CMRS gives Apocalypse Now': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)",Null,4,5,8 October 2003
Rocky IV," This is the showdown where East meets West!
","I am sure that when a person loses a friend to death, that it is hard to take. Yet to see them being killed and then to be killed, would have to be almost impossible to tolerate. Rocky IV is not about revenge, when it quite easily could have been. Instead it is a film about Rocky Balboa who fights to right a wrong for his best friend. Rocky IV will make the hair on the back of the neck stand up! Rocky Balboa is pitted against Russian heavyweight challenger, a merciless fighting machine  the best that Soviet science and medicine can create, his name is Ivan Drago, the Russian boxer with the rocket launch punch. Following the death of Apollo Creed in a match against Drago and in a bid to avenge the loss of his friend, Rocky takes up the challenge to fight the newest heavyweight contender. Supported by technologically advanced training methods and based on his past performances, Drago looks certain to claim the crown. Rocky again is the underdog. As Drago goes through his high tech workouts, Rocky is seen slogging through hip deep snow. Training, however, can only take a fighter so far. Drago has the biochemical and physiological makings of a champion, but Rocky has the heartThis movie was very poignant in story and in acting. There are many scenes that really touched me, none more so than when Rocky tells Adrian he has to fight Drago. Rocky is at the bottom of a staircase, with Adrian at the top. She says that he can not win, and that he is playing with death wish. Through all this Rocky ignores his wife's wishes and will fight, to the death if need be. There always seems to be a scene in these films that really standouts. This such a scene.  Yet the death of Apollo Creed was also well shot in Rocky IV. I am still not sure if seeing someone being killed is a good scene or not? The cast of this Rocky was once again very powerful. I want to first of all talk about the mean role taken on by Muscle man, Dolph Lundgren. He was good in this film, though he hardly says a word. His facial expressions are extraordinary, yet I am sure he is made to look as brutal as he is for the movie. He was the perfect man for the role of Ivan Drago.
There is not much that can be faulted about the role and the impact that Sylvester Stallone has in Rocky. Again he had made up a  wonderful script for this film, and undertook a powerful role. I wish we had a real life Rocky, because I am sure that he would be as popular in this world as he is in the movie. Talia Shire was again great in her Role as Adrian. Although she does not have faith that her husband can beat the merciless Russian, she stands behind her man, as only she could. I would love to have a girl like Adrian behind me if I was in trouble. The role of Paulie has always been a questioned one by me. Yet in this Ricky he was great. He showed how good a brother-in law he really is and stood by Rocky all the way. Burt Young has had a long career staring in the recent hit with Hugh Grant, Mickey Blue Eyes. It was sad to see Apollo Creed bow out of the Rocky saga, yet the writing was one the cards for him. He did not know what sort of fighter he was going up against and paid the ultimate price. His showman side, also made him seem too cocky. From where I view it, in the ring you only need to feel confident, but try to contain that emotion, as your opponent, will then not know how to take you. Carl Weathers was a great choice as Apollo Creed.Rocky IV gave viewers a good look at the country of Russia. I am sure that it would be extremely cold in that part of the world, but it was an igneous decision on Stallone's behalf to have Rocky fight in the challengers home country, as the odds of winning were even greater against Balboa, then they were in America. I especially liked the shots viewers get to see in the snowy country side. After the events of September 11 2001, America and the world mourned a tragic event. Yet after watching this movie, I feel that America has a lot to be proud of as a country and can take away that feeling from this movie. Rocky also proves how heart' can mean the difference between winning or losing. Sure it is good to have strength, but without heart, it is no weapon at all. Obviously the Rocky series was beginning to become a little stale' for the fans, yet this movie still had some of the Rocky magic, that started way back in the 1970's.Rating: 3.5 stars or 7/10",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
Face_Off," In order to catch him, he must become him.
","I remember the first time I watched Face/Off, and boy did it blow me away. I have always had a lot respect for John Travolta as an actor, but this movie made me sit up and take notice not only of Travolta, but Nicolas Cage and the director, John Woo. Face/Off is undoubtedly one of Hollywood's greatest action movies ever made.Face/Off Â… the ultimate game of cat and mouse. To avenge the senseless murder of his son, FBI agent Sean Archer undergoes radical new surgery allowing him to switch faces with the comatose terrorist Castor Troy and assume his identity. But when Castor awakes and assumes Sean's identity, the real Sean is thrust into an unimaginable nightmare, fighting not only for his life but also those of his wife and daughter! Well what do you say about this movie? It is a blast. Action from start to finish. I disagree that the storyline is silly, considering the way the audience is taken on such a great ride with both Castor Troy and Sean Archer. I thought the script was very well written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. Then you have the touches put in by director John Woo. Woo is a fine director, with this being one of his best films. His other movies include Broken Arrow,  Hard Target and Blackjack. He also directed a very disappointing sequel, that being Mission: Impossible II. That film was rather boring for the most part and only started to heat up at the end. Anyway Woo did a brilliant job on Face/Off.The main stars are Hollywood legends. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage take on both roles as Sean Archer/Castor Troy. Both make the most of being two different characters. The way they act in this movie, they make you believe that the two have really traded places. It is difficult to say who was the better of the two in this film, because they both did a great job.
Cage has had a great career. Of course winning an Oscar for his terrific role in the film Leaving Los Vegas, in addition to the big hits like The Rock, Con Air, City Of Angels, Gone In Sixty Seconds and The Family Man. These were all great movies. Travolta is probably Hollywood's most well-known actor. A strong member of the church of scientology, he has done some great films as well. These include Grease (who will ever forget that film?), The Look Whose Talking series, the popular Pulp Fiction, which put him back on the movie map, Broken Arrow and his latest hit Swordfish, alongside Hollywood's newest star Hugh Jackman. Travolta has done some bad films, none more bad than the science-fiction movie, Battlefield Earth, which was a real flop.There are some other good cast members in Face/Off. They include Gina Gershon, who plays Castor's partner of sorts, Sasha Hassler. Then you have Joan Allen who plays Sean Archer's wife, Dr Eve Archer. Dominique Swain is good in her role as the rebellious teenage daughter of the Archer's, Jamie. Finally the role of Castor's brother, Pollax Troy, was well performed by Alessandro Nivola. He was great in the movie, Best Laid Plans.There are some powerful scenes in this movie. None more so, than the scene where we see the two arch enemies looking at themselves in the mirror, about to try and shoot each other to death. Then of course you have the surgery scene where we see them actually taking off the character's faces. This scene looks so real, that you would believe the surgery really did take place. The action scenes in Face/Off are all great, with the final boat chase, breathless.It is known that they are starting to perform surgery like what was acted in this movie, for real, which is amazing. I am going to stick my neck out here and say that Face/Off is my favourite film of all-time. Now some people might think that is weird, but this film is terrific. If you like a bit of action, thrown in with a bit of intrigue and suspense then this film is for you. Face/Off is summed up beautifully by Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle who wrote: `In ``Face/Off,'' a principled FBI agent and a psychotic terrorist switch faces. Switching faces means the two actors -- John Travolta and Nicolas Cage -- have to switch roles. But more than switch roles, they switch styles. Travolta adopts Cage's abrupt gestures and crazy laugh; Cage amazingly embodies Travolta's soulfulness'. That is spot on. So if you want to see one great action films of our time, sit back, relax and watch Face/Off.  It's like looking in a mirror. Only... not!Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10",Null,1,2,5 February 2002
Spider-Man," Did this comic book hero come to life? I am not so convinced!
","In my 24 years on this planet, I have seen many comic book heroes that have come to life', within the realms of a movie. I felt that Superman' was brought well to the bigscreen. Then the fuss that was made about the 1989 release of Batman' was needed, as the film deserved its high rating in my view. Then in 2002 we have the big blockbuster of Spiderman. This is one of the most popular comic book heroes. Now he has crawled onto our screens and spun his web, to win over millions of fans around the world.Young New York teenager Peter Parker is a geek. He isn't popular at school, he likes science, and doesn't have many friends. Nothing seems to be going his way until one fateful trip to Osborn technologies changes everything. When Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains super strength, a spider sense', the ability to stick to walls, and organic webspinners. With his newfound powers, he becomes Spider-man, and through a great tragedy learns an important life lesson: With great power, comes great responsibility!To say that Spiderman' the movie was a little disappointing, for me is an understatement. I first of all want to say how much of a let down the script of this movie was. While I will admit that it tried, some of the language used did have the desired effect on me. Then take the love story' that was presented here. Instead of making it a great part of this film, I felt I halted the progress of it, as it made the story jump all over the place. I hope the script of the next Spider-man movie is much better than what the first movie's was.Then take the stars of this show. Tobey McGuire was a good choice as Peter Parker / Spider-man. I found him to be the perfect klutz', as the nerdy Peter Parker, then as he becomes our superhero', the transformation he puts on is excellent. Tobey McGuire is a Spider-man fan, so being the movie lead in this film was great for him. Yet his archenemy, the Green Goblin', was a character that was not human enough for me. He was played by veteran actor William Defoe. This was the crazy character of this film, and while it was trying to be scary in parts, for me it did not have the right effect. Instead, I feel it was taken straight from a comic book. That is not what I feel makes a great baddie'. The people in conjunction with this film should have looked at how well the Batman movie made the Joker' come to life way back in 1989. That is how I like to see the bad guys come to life in comic book movies.Other members of this cast include the stunning Kirsten Dunst. She portrayed the likable Mary Jane Watson. She was a great choice as this character, as I found her to be a bubbly and a very attractive girl. Unfortunately the script did not allow her to be the character that I thought she would be. Perhaps this is a good thing, but I would have liked her to be not jumping from one guy to another, which I can tell you does happen. Add in the good choice of Ben Parker and Aunty May, who were played by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris, who I thought were very good. So was the role of Harry Osborn, acted by James Franco. Harry was another character trying to win over Mary Jane. I hope all these actors return for the next movie. There were certain parts to this film that I did and did not like. For instance I found the costume of our superhero to be such an attractive' outfit. This was adopted well from the comic books. I also enjoyed how our hero spins his web. This is one of the good special effects. Yet I did not like most of spideys' climbing sequences. They seem to be almost comic like', which for me did not satisfy what I hoped they would be. It was as if they were taken straight out of a comic book. This is one area that this movie definitely fell down in. This is where I believe the director of spider-man should have jumped in and made this film a lot more human, as this was his job in my view. Sam Raimi did a fairly good job, but I wished he changed certain aspects of this film, because Spider-man then might have been a great blockbuster'.Look I am sure if I was a young kid presented with watching this movie in the cinema, I would, pardon the pun, jump at the chance. Yet as an adult, I am a lot more critical of movies and need more satisfaction in different cinematic areas. Spider-man was a classic comic book hero, yet for me this movie did nothing to make his legend even greater. Then again this movie works because it gets bums on seats in the cinema, the merchandise to buy is huge, and is a childhood favourite. Yet for me, this film, while it is a blockbuster, I am one critic who would debate whether it deserved that status or not. Get caught in the web of your friendly neighbourhood, Spider-man'.

Die Hard 2," Dying Just Got That Little Harder!
","I have watched many movies where they have had a sequel which left me disappointed and uneasy, but the sequel to the smash, Die Hard, Die Hard 2 (Die Harder) was what think a sequel should be - more of what made the first film so successful. So its all out war for unlucky Police Detective named McClane, in a heart-stopping, jet-propelled journey through excitement and terror.On a snowy Christmas Eve in the nation's capital, a team of terrorist have seized a major international airport, and now holds thousands of holiday travellers hostage. The terrorists, a renegade band of crack military commandos led by murderous rogue officer, have come to rescue a drug lord from justice. They've prepared for every contingency, except one: John McClane, an off-duty cop seized by a feeling of deadly deja vu. The heroic cop not only has to battle terrorists, but also an incompetent airport police chief, the hard headed commander of the army's anti-terrorist squad and a deadly winter snowstorm. The runways are littered with death and destruction, and McClane is in a race against time. His wife is trapped on one of the planes circling somewhere overhead, desperately low on fuel!Die Hard 2 makes Bruce Willis look better and better. The role of John McClane is one filled with the fight for right and to trying to stop the bad guys. Again a lot of the stunts would have been done by Willis considering the professionalism of the man. Running all over an airport in a fierce snowstorm, fighting scenes on the wing of a real 747 jet and trying to save lives he has no attachment to, L.A. cop John McClane puts his body on the line, so justice is served and so did the actor Bruce Willis in my view to bring a great action movie back for a second time. Willis is one of my favourite actors, but I have only started to watch his movies in about the last 2-3 years and what a mistake that has been.   This film has more freedom as it is held at an airport. McClane is like I have said all over the place. The freedom and space this story has makes this film much easier to watch. Another thing which is impressive about Die Hard 2 is the effort to put more thrills in the movie. The snow (which of course is man made) has a major role, so do all the planes making quite a crisis on their hands. Not only do they fight on the wing of a 747, but also fly a real helicopter on the wing of the plane also. The scene where McClane ejects himself from the exploding plane is another favourite scene of mine. Other parts of this movie which stunned me I wont tell you about as it will give too much away, but trust me they are exceptionally done.Again the bad guys have a major role in this one. William Saddler is Colonial Stuart, a heartless leader, who only cares that a drug lord escapes and can get in on all the money making scheme. I loved his role in this. Another face that I remember in Die hard 2 who was a bad guy is Robert Patrick. I loved his role in Terminator 2. But the conflict between the good guys is extremely tense. Especially between McClane and Police Officer Lorenzo played by L.A law star Dennis Franz. It is hard to understand if this character is on the side for good or not. Here comes another analogy on Die Hard 2, do you ever know who is on the side of good or bad? Well for at least three quarters of the film it is unsure. The storywriters need to be commended because the story left me intrigued and when you think you know what is about to happen, the circumstances change. Also having a different director, gave this sequel new prospective. Director Renny Harlin threw his hand into the ring. What a gamble? An unknown director, but to my surprise I say that it worked. His other films worth mentioning include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and Cliffhanger. So overall Die Hard 2 was extremely enjoyable sequel to watch. The story, the characters and the situation are all of a great tension, which I love in a movie. So one cop who is so vulnerable and emotional ends up being the one person who you would most like to have save your life. Like Willis said in an interview Die Hard 2 - Die Harder - it's bigger, badder and louder. I will leave you with one question, the first Die Hard had approximately 20 people die, can you count for me how many perish in this film? It is quite a turn around!Rating: 4/5 or 9/10",9,84,114,6 March 2001
Dirty Dancing," One of the biggest films of the 80's!
","One rainy day, in the year 2000, 13 years after it's release, I sat and watched Dirty Dancing. I am upset that I didn't see it when it was in the cinema and in its popular run with the world. Baby's opening lines are a good place to start my review - 'It was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me Baby, and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.'At a summer camp Baby meets Johnny Castle, who teaches interested vacationers how to dance, and in his off hours dirty dances with other dancers. When Johnny loses his regular dancing partner, Baby volunteers to learn his routine to help him out of a tight spot. As the summer winds down, the dancing pair must come to grips with responsibility, love and each others growing expectations. Undoubtedly, the greatest part of this film are the scenes where we get to see some great dancing. The very first scenes with it in my view where in some way erotic, yet had an infectious feel on me. The dancing is very intense and heavy. It is no wonder they call it 'dirty dancing'. It must have been hard to find the right dancers to perform in this movie, but I feel they did get it right. The main part of the cast must have been able to dance a little too, cause if they couldn't have it would have made the film very erratic, and nowhere near as good as it was. Plus the ending of the film is great, with the two main characters getting up and showing the audience what they do best.The cast of Dirty Dancing was pretty good. Patrick Swayze, who played Johnny proved to me how talented he really was. His on-air relations with Jennifer Grey, and his dancing parts of this film were great. His lead in this is also deserves much praise. Swayze has had an eventful career, starring in Ghost, one of the big films of the 90's, and Black Dog alongside music legend Meatloaf. However, Jennifer Grey is an actress who I had never heard of until this movie, yet I loved her role in this immensely. Her characters struggles in this film were well acted by her, yet by the end she really shows that she can dance too. I have recently seen one of her other films which i think the whole world liked, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and I must admit that wasn't a bad film. However, Grey did not cash in on her success as Baby in Dirty Dancing, because I believe the movie loving public did not get to see enough of her afterwards, which was very disappointing.The one thing I do remember vividly at the time this film was doing well was the main song on the soundtrack, 'I've had the time of my life'. When I heard this in the film itself last year, I really got into it. The musical version of it is great. Yet the soundtrack is full of other great hits like Hungry eyes,  She's Like the Wind (performed by Patrick Swayze) and Overload just to name a few. Everyone I talk to about this movie says 'Hey have you got the soundtrack to that?' It is amazing what effect a movie's soundtrack can have on people and Dirty Dancing's is great soundtrack to have.Finally, the movie's story is what I would call a bit 'mushy', but don't let that distract you from what a great film this is. The brilliant dancing and soundtrack is what I will remember most from this movie. I also like this movie for the fact that it shows some great dancing, which makes me a little jealous, considering that dancing is not one of my strong points. Lastly, let me leave you with this thought. I heard last year that an new version of Dirty Dancing was to be made, with people such as Ricky Martin and Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead roles. I believe that a newer version of this sort of film won't be the same, cause Dirty Dancing, the original, has a certain historical look, that no new film could ever capture the same.

Days of Thunder," Cruise like Thunder', in the ultimate movie for rev-head fanatics!
","I want to come out and say, that I am not the biggest fan of Hollywood star, Tom Cruise. I find him to be an arrogant kind of character onscreen, with some of his movies just bad'. Yet I can understand why people like him, he is a star and does do some great films. Well I still say to people that my favourite Tom Cruise movie is the NASCAR racing hit, Days Of Thunder'. But public opinion is divided as to whether it is a great film or not. Here is what I think.Engines roar and fever pitch of professional racing is alive and well. Meet race car driver Cole Trickle, whose talent and ambition are surpassed only by his burning need to win. Discovered by businessman Tim Daland, Cole is teamed with legendary crew chief and car-builder Harry Hogge to race for the Winston Cup at the Daytona 500. However a fiery crash nearly ends Cole's career and he must turn to beautiful doctor, Claire Lewicki to regain his nerve and the true courage needed to race, to win and to live. 
When it comes to Days Of Thunder', I look at it as a film which can be viewed by either the head or the heart. My head' feels that DOT' is a clichéd and standard Hollywood movie that follows a standard and overused plot. The main star is always playing a hot-headed character that finds it hard to take direction. This movies success has to partly come from what a successful movie Top Gun' was. I have to also ask: are movies that follow the same format good for cinema? My answer is yes and no. Yes, because they bring movie-goers and the bucks in, and can be thought of as a classic. Then the answer could be no, as these films are nothing new and do not make cinema experiences fresh and exciting. Yet what my heart says about DOT' gives quite a different spin on it all together. It is an exciting movie that not only shows the competitive side of racing, but what lengths a race driver will go to be behind the wheel. I also like the relationship that Cole (Cruise) has with his crew chief Harry (Robert Duvall). Then with all Jerry Bruckheimer films, if you have an enjoyable experience, then that will last with you for alongtime to come.
So with all that in prospective, DOT' is a great film in my opinion. The racing sequences are well incorporated into a story about a racer that is pushed, and once he is, you will not like the reaction that you get. Tom Cruise's performance is pretty good. I like how we see him go from being one sort driver to the other. However my favourite character has to be Harry, as Robert Duvall is great in what he says and does. He gets Cole through many races with clever and intelligent moves, that many experienced crew chiefs would not even think of. Other roles that need to be highlighted include Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), who is the driver that brings the best out in Cole, with the pair's competitive streak and friendship just great for the film in my view. The role of Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman) has been praised and criticised by fans. I personally like what she brings to the film, as her character brings great sexual tension to the story and makes Cole realise that everything is not quite right for him in life. Of course it is common knowledge that DOT' was the film that sparked the 11 year relationship for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, which unfortunately fell apart in 2001.DOT' was directed by Ridley Scott's brother, Tony. Tony really brought out the important racing themes well for us all to see. I understand that some people might not have liked the direction Scott took us on, but all the themes are brought out in such a way that I simply enjoyed. Also, the way Scott focused on the many characters in the movie, which was well done from where I see it, as this definition helps to make the movie all the greater.
This has been a challenging review to write as I have tried to be as impartial on the film as I can be. Cole Trickle was right he can do anything in a race car' and this attitude is what I like about Cole. Like other Tom Cruise movies such as Top Gun', The Colour of Money' and Cocktail', Days Of Thunder' does follow a stock standard plot. Yet I am a racing car fan of sorts, and thus, this movie has and will remain memorable for me for many years to come. It also points out to me, that a movie really can be viewed differently by the head and the heart. CMRS gives Days Of Thunder': 4 (Very Good Film)",Null,0,1,10 April 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," This movie was just a big excuse for a sequel. Why did something have to survive'?
","I might be pre-empting the cinema going public around the world here, but I believe most of them would have loved the 1997 sequel to Jurassic Park titled The lost World'. Well there is movie-goer that did not like it that much, and that was ME! This movie loses the appeal that was created in the first movie, has moments where it so over the top that it kills the movie, and lacks the depth of characters that could make me care. Jurassic Park: The Lost World' is living proof that it takes more than a big budget,  a successful director and box office hype, to make a decent movie sequel.
It has been four years since the disaster at Jurassic Park. The individual scientists who had been hired as consultants on the project agreed to remain silent about it. Now something is wrong at second Remote Island of prehistoric inhabitants. Dr. Ian Malcolm and his group are about to find out... something has survived.The special effects in this film are the only saving point for me. Once again the special effect team make the dinosaurs come frighteningly to life, in a way that I really like. These creatures actually cease being special effects and seem real. Back doing the dinosaur special effects in the Lost World are Dennis Muren, Stan Winston and Michael Lantieri. To say that the one reason to watch this film is because of the continuation of the great special effects would be an understatement. Yet the story presented is very corny, perfunctory and does things just because they need to be done. First time around I was convinced that seeing a dinosaur theme park going wrong was entertaining, but in the second part of the story I feel it is a complete waste of time, as it is just not that interesting, in fact it is down right boring. The story is based on Michael Crichton's second novel of the same name, which I have read many people criticise for being a farce. Then back again as screenwriter is David Koepp, whose screenplay has many problems including clichéd characters, boring storylines and bad flat spots. The other problem to the Lost World story is that it did not allow the dinosaurs to be the main stars of the film, which is what the first film did better in my view. Now was Steven Spielberg actually directing this film? From where I viewed it, it did not feel like it. From all my research, I agreed mostly with movie critic Roger Ebert. He said about Steven Spielberg as director of The Lost World, This feels like the kind of sequel a master hands over to an apprentice, and you sense that although much effort was lavished on the special effects, Spielberg's interest in the story was perfunctory.' Now while I am big a fan of Spielberg, I am afraid that I agree with Ebert here. The strong presence that I was expecting from Spielberg is not present here and it brings the film down. 
 I also agree with Ebert about the key weaknesses to the film.  There are too many scenes drawn out and elaborate for the sake of being just that, not good enough in my view. The worst scene in the film has to be where the research trailer is hanging over the cliff, we see a terrifying drop and of course there is a dinosaur attacking our characters to just add to the cliché of it all. This scene is placed into the film, forty-minutes after the most boring of lead-ups I have ever seen.While the last half an hour to the film seemed too much like a typical Hollywood ending, with the film overstaying its welcome. Now while most people would be thrilled by these set-ups, I found them very frustrating in this film, as I believe it did not add anything to the film, although Spielberg and his team wanted the audience to believe it had. Well it did not work on me! The movie stars some famous names. Back for a second dose of dinosaur action is scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Now I had problems with his performance in the first film, but Goldblum here is unconvincing as the dinosaur expert, as his dialogue is delivered in such a quiet and unconvincing way. Malcolm is in a relationship with another dinosaur expert, Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore). Now this character was ok in parts of the film, as she has intimate moments with dinosaurs, which were interesting to see.  Also along for the ride is a wasted character in Malcolm's daughter, Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), who is one of the characters I have referred to as clichéd', as she does nothing that makes her seem that important to the story. However, my favourite character in the film has to be the game hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), whose character is very smart, while being surrounded by people, getting eaten by dinosaurs. When asked about the possibility of working full time with dinosaurs he states I have spent enough time in the company of death'.  This movie had a rival coming out around the same, that being Godzilla', another big budget Hollywood farce in my view. Spielberg I can only imagine looked at this movie as competition, and in a way tried to out stage it before it was released. Now while I think neither movie have had a positive influence on cinema, I think Spielberg should have been more focused on getting his movie right. I mean this film could have been as good as the first, but with so many flaws, I cannot forgive it. It is only lucky that this film got the box success it did, because I firmly believe it could have hurt Spielberg's career, or may have even started the end of it.

Ghostbusters," Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters!
","For it's time, Ghostbusters would have to be a classic. Visiting such realms as the supernatural, is sure not meant to be funny, but this film does stretch that rule a little. Thankfully it does, as it allows those among us (like me), who do not believe in ghost and goblins, to sit back, relax and enjoy the funny antics of these ghost-busting heroes. Although it might be a little dated in the new millennium, 'Ghostbusters' is still one of the 'great comedies of the 1980's' in my view.When the University downsizes the parapsychology department, Doctors Venkman, Stantz and Spengler make the leap from scientists to Ghostbusters, investigators and exterminators of paranormal pests! When the bewitching Dana Barrett discovers her refrigerator has become a portal into the spiritual dimension, our heroes come face to face with an ancient evil force with plans to raise hell in Manhattan.When reviewing a movie, I try to be as fair as I can be. However I feel that by only viewing a movie once, we can not comprehend or appreciate the work that has gone into it, as a lot of work goes into bringing a movie to 'life'. For me that is no more apparent than with this classic hit. The time spent doing the script, special effects, production designs all have their merit and make this movie great. It is not just actors doing their job, as that is only one small part of the movie.Most of 'Ghostbusters' success must be given to director Ivan Reitman. He did a fabulous job directing the Ghostbusters. I am certain that he left no stone unturned when it came to getting this film right and I am so glad he did. What also made this film more unique was that two of its stars wrote one very very good script. I am of course talking about Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis. Their originality and comedy on paper, made watching this film a real joy. It is not often that stars write good scripts, but this time these guys got it right.The cast that this film has was amazing to say the least. The four Ghostbuster characters were all different, which made them great to watch. I love the way that director Reitman summed up the Ghostbusters. He said of the three main guys that, Bill Murray was the 'mouth' or the smart ass of the film, while Dana Barrett says of Dr Venkman, ' you're more like a game-show host' and I have to agree with that, Dan Akroyd was the 'hands', meaning the person who was very hands-on when came to the ghostbusting, and finally Harold Ramis was the 'Brains' or the smartest one of Ghostbusters. Add in the cheery Ernie Hudson, who played Winston Zeddemore, making them the perfect team.However, the Ghostbusters are a little different when it comes to doing their job. They have funny facilities, which only they could invent, a car that is as wild and conspicuous as its owners are, while the tools that they use to trap there supernatural phenomenon are weird and crazy. I love the traps, 'nuclear accelerators' and other bits and pieces they simply refer to as 'toys', when they are anything but that.Then take into consideration the other great roles in this film, as without them this film would not be as good. Sigourney Weaver was very 'spiritual' when came to being the normally delightful Dana Barrett. I really enjoyed the onscreen chemistry between her and Bill Murray. Rick Moranis played the moronic '' as only he can. I always think of him as the man from 'Little shop of horrors', but there is no doubting his acting talents. Add in the very 'unusual' and eccentric Receptionist Janine, who was amusingly portrayed by Annie Potts. I love it when she screams 'we got one'. Yet I still say my favourite character in the Ghostbusters, over the silly Venkman (who is second), is the funny ghost Slimer. While Murray is as insane as the ghosts were in this movie, Slimer steals the show in my view. He is wild, 'slimes' people and makes the Ghostbusters all the funnier. Whoever invented Slimer is a genius!There are some very funny scenes and lines in this movie. I love how we are introduced to the first ghost in the movie, who is part of the library in New York, then the mayhem and chaos we see slimmer cause in the Hotel is classic cinematography. The Venkman line at the end of the scene is priceless as he says 'we came, we saw, we kicked its ass!' Throw in scenes with the monsters that run around New York terrorising people, the unlocking of ghosts by the Environmental Protection jerk and the Marshmallow Man are all hilarious parts to a movie that is full on from start to the finish.
I wish I had been old enough to see the opening of 'Ghostbusters' in the cinema, as I am sure it would have had a huge cinema release. When I remember the Ghostbusters two things come to mind. One is the hypnotic tune 'Ghostbusters' written and performed by Ray Parker Jnr., and two is that my mother and one of her friends said that they banned their children from viewing such rot. I certainly missed out on seeing many great facets of what the Ghostbusters spawned, such as two ingenious cartoons. I sort of understand what they were on about, but I would have preferred being allowed to watch it and then just forget about it. This film has a lot to like about, it is funny, crazy and a little bit different. If you are yet to see what the great fuss is about the 'Ghostbusters', then please do yourself a favour and pick up a copy today. Yes, they are ready to believe you!CMRS gives 'Ghostbusters': 5 (Brilliant Film)",Null,52,76,13 October 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Fall in love, with the stylish musical, Moulin Rouge!
","When I had the chance to see Moulin Rouge, I went into the cinema with no expectations, yet all I had heard was praise for this Australian film. To my delight, I was swept up in what I think will be one of the films of the year. In fact, this was the sort of film I have been hanging out for, for six months.A poet, against his father's wishes, moves to France, the 19th century equivalent of Andy Warhol's Factory. He falls into the world of Toulouse-Lautrec and his entourage, and is drafted to write a nightclub spectacular. In this seedy world of sex, drugs and electricity, he begins a passionate love affair with the club's highest paid star and courtesan.
Firstly, I want to give special praise for the script of Moulin Rouge. It was so spectacular spectacular', and there are so many reasons for this. Well the main reason would have to be the great soundtrack. The old classics, then a mixture of 20th century hits that had a great remix to suit the mood of the film. Then you have the dancing part of the script, which again helped set the music up to have a big impact on the audience. Then the last reason would have to be the very subtle change from the four main themes of Moulin Rouge: Truth, Beauty, Freedom and LOVE. The script also has a two sections to it. One half made me happy, the other made me sad and want to stand and applaud.  The cast of Moulin Rouge, while it might not be world wide known, it will put the Australian talent we have on show to the world. I want to praise the two main characters. Nicole Kidman, has had a rough trot this year, but this has not affected her acting talents. She was fantastic as  the beautiful Satine.  I never realised that Nicole could sing, but what a voice she has. This film will undoubtedly make her a big star in the following months, home and abroad. I look forward to seeing Kidman in future movie roles, because it will take a big role for her not to be known as the Moulin Rouge babe'. Then we have the role of Christian, played by  Ewan McGregor, the new Star Wars' man. While he was good in the Phantom Menace, McGregor showed off his real talents in this one. Again the dancing and singing of this Scottish born actor just amazed me. I felt that McGregor and Kidman had a great on-screen chemistry together. The wrong pairing for that part of Moulin Rouge would have spoilt the film completely.  The other people in the cast of Moulin Rouge, might not be too familiar to people overseas, yet being from Australia, I picked up on them immediately. Richard Boxborough, played the role of the duke and did it very well, plus there was John Leguizamo, Garry MacDonald, Christine Anu, David Wenham and a very special appearance by Australia's favourite girl  Kylie Minogue.
So, with a great cast and wonderful script, Moulin Rouge is a brilliant film for mine. It is very original, a little bit different to your ordinary film, and gives you another view of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The director of Moulin Rogue, Baz Luhrmann, deserves so much praise for this film, because this will put Aussie movies on the map. Finally, I want to leave you with a quote from Moulin Rogue that I will never forget, a reference to the movies main theme  LOVE:`The greatest thing is just to love, and  be loved in return'.Love is a very confusing and difficult emotion to handle, but this quote says it all. Give love and you should receive love. Oh how I wish I knew more of Shakespeare's work, because I am starting appreciate it even more. Count on one thing, I will be adding the DVD and soundtrack of Moulin Rouge to my collections when I have the chance to.  Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10 (Loud Applause!!!)",10,0,1,12 June 2001
Back to the Future Part III," You and Marty 'might not be able to think fourth dimensionally' in the third 'Back To The Future' film.
","'Back To The Future III' finally shows that this most successful and popular movie series has come to a disappointing end. Made back to back with BTTF 2, BTTF 3 loses the magic that the first two movies captured, to its detriment. Marty McFly, the hero of the first two movies is now in a bit of bother as he is left stranded in back in 1955. When he receives an urgent letter from his good friend Doc Brown, Marty is told to leave him alone where he is. Marty is dumbfounded as to what he should do. However, more devastating news is about to be discovered by our junior time traveler.
Fulfilling a long-time fantasy, Doc Brown has decided to live in the old West of the 1880s. But when he is in danger of meeting an untimely end, Marty travels back in time to rescue him. There is just one problem: Doc Brown is smitten by a school teacher Clara Clayton that he can't think straight! Now, it is up to Marty to keep Doc out of trouble, the DeLorean running, and the past, present and future on track so they can all get back to where - and when - they belong!Again the story of BBTF 3 is a highlight to this film. Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale cleverly interweaved love and time in such a sweet and romantic way in all BTTF films. In the first it was Marty's parents, in the second it was Marty's own romance that needed help and the third focuses on Doc Brown and his love at first sight with the beautiful school teacher Clara Clayton. This movie is also placed in the old west of the 1880's, showing Hill Valley in the olden days. While I feel I have seen better western settings, the way the actors went about creating the 1880's feel, seemed accurate enough.
The cast was back once again, to finish off the BTTF story. Michael J. Fox is one great actor. He once more shows why he was the perfect choice as Marty McFly. Marty has been through so much as a character that in no way would his character have been boring to portray. Again Fox had to learn how to do many of the talents that his character has to show off in the old west. Such things as Gun shooting and horse riding are just two of the new editions to the long bow that Fox had to learn. I feel for a guy like Fox who has succumbed to the horrible side effects of Parkinson disease. He has stopped doing full-time acting, which is a great shame.Doc Brown was once again performed grandly by Christopher Lloyd. He is so involved as the Doc, always warning of the dangerous effects that could go wrong if they interfere with the past or the future. Putting on his old west shoes in this movie, Lloyd does a good job in showing that he is not just able to be a wacky 1950s or 80's scientist. The way Doc gets Marty back to the future here is clever and one of the movies high points. The Doc's love interest is the local school teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen) who was again well suited to her role. I have recently seen Steenburgen in the new release movie titled 'Life as a house', a movie that I really enjoyed.
Other cast members include regulars such as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who was another actor who made the transition from the first two movies into the old west beautifully. The rivalry that Tannen and the McFlys have on this film is one of the highlights of the entire series. I love it when 'Mad Dog' says to 'Clint Eastwood', `Nobody calls me 'Mad Dog', especially not some, duded up egg sucking gutter trash!'  Lea Thompson is back as Marty's aging Mother and long lost relative of the west, 'Maggie McFly'. With all of these actors taking on various roles making them incredibly interesting to watch, as you want to know how different they will be next. There is one another character I want to point out to you that I find interesting. Although he only has a minor role, Chester, the palace saloon bartender (Matt Clark) and I, have somethings in common. We share the same name oddly enough, in addition to the fact that I one day want to be a bar tender as well. Is that ironic? I feel it is!Overall the 'Back To The Future' series was and is still a delight to watch, 'time and time again'. The only problem I have with the second and third movie being made back to back, is that they each take a bit away from each other. I would have preferred a small gap between each one, so they could have both been given the attention they deserve. Robert Zemeckis is a great director and I am sure gives most of the credit for his success as a director to the BTTF trilogy. I am another fan of Zemeckis' work. I would love to have gone through the experiences that Marty McFly did with time-travel into the past and the future.  Yet I will always remember what Doc Brown says at the end of this movie `You're future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.' That is good advice that I feel everyone needs to listen and do!CMRS give 'Back To The Future III': 3 (Good Film)",Null,11,26,16 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill is one of the brashest, boldest and bloodiest movies I have ever seen, so look over your shoulder, because........... 'Here comes the bride, with only one thing on her mind, a roaring rampage of re
","It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill: Volume 2, get here, A.S.A.P.CMRS gives 'Kill Bill: Volume 1': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)",Null,109,221,7 January 2004
Mission: Impossible II," In my opinion, this is still one of the worst movies of the new millennium!
","Contains Spoilers!! Mission Impossible 2 is a film that suffered from the pretense that it believed it was a good film. Unfortunately, this moviegoer was tricked into thinking that it would be an 'unreal' film. How wrong I was, as I had a very negative experience, as I found it boring for the most part. I have to ask, why is that Hollywood cannot get the 'Mission Impossible' formula the way I like it?The world's greatest spy, Ethan Hunt is partnering up with the beautiful Nyah Hall to stop renegade agent Sean Ambrose from releasing a new kind of terror on an unsuspecting world. But before the mission is complete they'll traverse the globe and have to choose between everything they love and everything they believe in.I was truly disappointed in the direction that MI2 was given. John Woo (from the brilliant action thriller Face/Off), was the man in charge, and I believe he was the wrong man for this job. He really over did many things in this film. But the most overdone and frustrating part of the film for me, has to be the way Woo just had to keep showing things in slow motion. If Woo had done these shots a few times that would have been ok, but he had to do umpteen times.However Woo got the right look to the film. The shots of the mountain tops, the Aussie landscape which included the outback and of Australian city, Sydney, really did impress me. Woo had cinematographer Jeffery L. Kimball doing this aspect of the movie, and visually I found nothing wrong to the film.The same cannot be said for the script of MI2, which once again was disappointing. The story was the inspiration of Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, different men to the first MI film. However the screenplay writer, Robert Towne was back for a second shot at this story. Unfortunately all these writers got this story totally wrong again. I believe this because of the crazy plot, which involves the silly virus, just not good enough. Then with this as the sole focus of the story, we get another story that becomes very complex, confusing and at times rather boring. Another complaint in this story has to be the character creations, which are pathetic, especially the bad guys, who are not convincing at all.Main character of MI2 is Ethan Hunt (Producer Tom Cruise). As I have mentioned previously, Cruise certainly looks the part in these films, and while he was ok in the role of Hunt this time, I still think he needs more MIF members to help counterbalance the film's spy aspects. Hunt's mentor in the film is Mission Commander Swanbeck (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who was well casted in his small role.The female lead in MI2 is Nyah Hall (the gorgeous Thandie Newton). She is a professional thief recruited to help Hunt on his mission. We learn that Hall used to be romantically involved with a defective agent. Nyah is asked to do a very dangerous job, one that could cost her life. Luther (Ving Rhames) is again an ok character, but he does not have a great affect on me. But a funny new man was Billy Baird (John Polson), who has a very over exaggerated Australian accent, but for some reason I did not mind that.The bad guy here is a man by the name of the Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who is not a nice man at all. He is driven to get his hands on this new deadly virus, and noting will stop him from getting it. Ambrose is a pathetic bad guy, poorly acted by Scott, as he did not get me overawed like a good bad guy can and should do. Ambrose's right hand man is also just as bad. His name is Hugh Stamp (Richard Roxburgh) and knowing that this guy is Australian, he has a terrible accent all the way through this movie.
MI2 has some good sequences and some very bad sequences. I enjoyed the start as it opened the movie up nicely. But after the race course scenes, the film gets lost in a rather boring sequence, where Hunt is trying to get a hold of the deadly virus guns. This scene is bad reminder for me, as it is just like the vault scene in the first MI film.Yet the ending does make up for some of this film's short falls. The bike/car chase is really well shot, but unfortunately John Woo had to overuse the slow mo shots which ruined it for me a little. Then the final confrontation between Hunt and Ambrose was fine, up until a point where see a knife held extremely close to Hunt's eyeball. Now these shots are supposed totally thrill us as the audience, but once again they did not work on me.
I also want to give my opinion on this movie's marketing. I feel that it was crap the way that they made the film look so much cooler and better than actually was, mainly via its trailer. The whole glasses thrown at the screen really did build this film up, but in retrospect, I find it to be totally 'wanky'. I am now very careful not to get the right or wrong impression of a movie via its promotion and or trailer, mainly because of MI2.I have learned that they are doing a Mission Impossible 3 very soon. As big a film as it will be, I will not be seeing it cinema, after the bad and bitter experience I had of watching this film in the cinema. I am unsure if I will ever like a Hollywood inspired 'Mission Impossible' film, because for some reason the powers behind each individual film does not do, what I relate to being in the MI story. I guess time will only tell.

"Girl, Interrupted"," Girl Interrupted is a powerful true story, I highly recommend!
","Set in the turbulent world of the late 60's, this is the searing true story of a young woman who finds herself prescribed a 혩short rest혩 at a renowned mental institution. Rebelling against the head nurse, the physchiatrist, Susan Kaysen chooses to befriend the resident 혩loonies', a group of troubled women. But after almost year of both flirting and struggling with the thin line between normal and crazy, Susanna realizes that to win freedom she must faces the one thing that terrifies her the most - herself.What an unbelievable movie. It shows the audience how crazy the world can get for some people. The lead role by Winona Ryder, was probably the most powerful of her career, as she reenacts the life of Susanna Kaysen. We go on an emotional rollercoaster ride with Susanna from start to finish of the movie. The opening scene of the movie shows Sue with a therapist and he explains that she has a problem. `Four days ago you chased a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of Vodka' and then Sue denies it by saying `I had a headache'. She is then recommended to Claymoores, a mental institution for people with all sorts of problems. Here is where the movie does get entruging. We meet different patients, who Susanna befriends including, Georgina the uncontrollable Liar, Burn victim Polly and the loudest character in the house, Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. No wonder this role won her an academy award, it was truly brilliant. Lisa rebelled, with a nasty, evil and selfish way about her. While Susanna was the exact opposite of Lisa, even though Lisa somehow fascinated her at the sametime. All in all we live through what it is like to live with 혩Crazy people' and how they handle various situations in life. The results can sometimes be happy and others can have lasting affects which hurt and scar you. Other characters to look out for include Whoopi Goldberg as the head nurse and chief psychiatrist played by Vanessa Redgrave. Rating: 5/5 Stars or 10/10",10,0,2,8 October 2000
Mission: Impossible," This is one of the worst movies of the 90's.
","I was a fan of the 80's TV series known as 'Mission Impossible', so I was keenly awaiting the Hollywood movie with the same name, starring Tom Cruise. While I feel it was not a completely bad film, I am a person who was not impressed by most aspects of it, especially in its confusing story. There were also some scenes which I feel were totally 'wanky', bringing this film down for me big time.Ethan Hunt is a secret agent framed for the deaths of his espionage team. Fleeing from government assassins, breaking CIA's most impenetrable vault, clinging to the roof of a speeding bullet train, Hunt races like a burning fuse to stay one step ahead of his pursers.and draw one step closer to discovering the shocking truth.The main offenders in this movie have to be the script writers, who did what I would say was an appalling job with this movie's script. Firstly to kill off so many of the 'mission impossible' team does not work in my opinion, as it makes the team members that are left, seem all the more important. But if they cannot fill the void left by their former partners, then the whole franchise will have problems.Then to make characters come back to life, or change from one side to another just makes the story even more confusing. This leads me to the complex plot of the film. Now usually I love a film that takes the audience a while to work out, but in Mission Impossible, I found this story to be too confusing, which did not allow me to appreciate what it was trying to show. The writers include David Koepp, Steven Zaillian and Robert Towne, with this story loosely based on the television series created by Bruce Geller.The direction of 'Mission Impossible' was taken on by Brian De Palma, who gave us such films as the Untouchables and horror classic 'Carrie'. In general De Palma did an ok job with this film, but the story he was working with did not allow him to bring out the movie's great action, which I believe were missing. However I was not a big fan of the cinematography of this film, done by Stephen H. Burum. I mean the supposed 'great' scenes of the film are not shown in a way that I liked, which made me hate the movie even more.The main star of the MI was its producer. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a man who is placed into a situation that finds is getting more and more precarious as he goes along. As cool as Cruise looks in the part of Hunt, it is my feeling that a different actor could do justice to the role, while at the same time filling the hole that is left by the lack of MI team members.The other cast members are very difficult to work out. The original team include leader Jim 'Mr.' Phelps (Jon Voight), who is a very strange man indeed. Other agents include Claire (Emmanuelle Béart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott-Thomas), Max (Vanessa Redgrave) and Jack Harmon (the unaccredited Emilio Estevez). Something bad has happened to this team, and Hunt has been framed for it.After Hunt lets team boss Kittridge (Henry Czerny), know that he understands what is going, Hunt looks for help from some new team members. The only other agent left is Claire, but now helping Hunt are Luther (Ving Rhames) an ok character, Krieger (Jean Reno) and Frank Barnes (Dale Dye). Yet everything is still not right. Hunt is helping out top government official, Hannah (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), which in turn will help clear his name from all the mess he finds himself in.There are two scenes in this film that I am sure people love, but I truly hate. The first is when Hunt is helped inside an impenetrable vault, when he is trying to get a hold of crucial government documents. Now most people would say that this sequence is 'thrilling', but not for me. I was not moved by it all, as I feel this scene tried to hard to be thrilling, making it quite dull. The other bad scene is the total end of the film, when Hunt is being chased by Mr. Phelps and Krieger on a speeding bullet train with a helicopter. This sequence for me was uneventful, unrealistically shot and clichéd, with the way we see Hunt end up being totally unoriginal in my view. In fact the last 40 minutes of MI are the most boring I have ever seen in a spy film.However there are some areas I do like in the film. Like James Bond, I enjoy many of the various 'spy toys' that make this job seem very fun. Such devices as explosive chewing gum, eyeglasses with built in TV cameras, many agents in different elaborate disguises and the way that laptop computers are used by quoting a certain verse in the bible. I must also admit that I am a big fan of the Mission Impossible theme, which has been great to listen for the best part of 20 years now. The music for this film was done by Danny Elfman, with the original Mission: Impossible theme by Lalo Schifrin.It is ironic that this film was called 'Mission Impossible', because it was rather an 'impossible mission' for me too actually like it, in fact I hated most of it. Mission Impossible is a film that had the potential to be great, but alas it was not. Perhaps if the script writers were more intent on making a film that made a bit of sense and tried not to change the MI idea I could have liked it. But unfortunately they changed it, and by doing so, they have a huge detractor in me.CMRS gives 'Mission Impossible': 1.5 (Bad - Ok Film)",Null,0,1,7 January 2004
Rocky," Get motivated, by a person whose life was a million-to-one shot!
","When you are watching a movie, what are the reason for doing so? Well I say it is for three reasons. One to entertain you, two to make you happy and thirdly (and I say the most important of all) to motivate you. That is what Rocky does, it motivates, and motivates in all aspects of it as well. Rocky is a very down and out sort of character, and film for that matter. I am sure many moviegoers could relate to this character, thus making Rocky the people's' sort of film.Rocky is a Philadelphia club fighter who seems to be going nowhere, but as fate would have it, World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed chooses him to be his next opponent. For Creed, the match is little more than exhibition, but for Rocky it is a shot at the big time. While preparing for the bout under the watchful eye of his trainer Mickey, Rocky romances Adrian, a shy young woman who exposes the tenderness beneath his tough exterior. Their love blossoms as the fight approaches, giving Rocky even more strength and purposes to go the distance' against his brutal adversary.
This film was a tremendous piece of cinematography in my view. Though it won an academy award for best picture at the Oscars, I believe it do so for more reasons than just because of the actual film. Sylvester Stallone has had a somewhat inconsistent career, but with this story, he proved that he had some sort of talent. His script was as powerful a story that I can remember watching. I am glad that we have a movie like this today because if we didn't, I truly believe we would be more the loser for it. Inventing a character such as Rocky Balboa, was ingenious, but then to actually play the lead title was magnificent.As a viewer, I felt that Stallone was somewhat of an inexperienced actor back in 1976, and I am sure he would admit this to be the case. However, I feel that this made the Rocky character all the more endearing and someone who audiences could cheer with all their might for. Since the Rocky franchise, Stallone has done some good and bad work. Probably his other famous character would have to be  Rambo, where again his character steals the limelight, but proves that anything can be done!His onscreen girlfriend, Adrian, was portrayed by Talia Shire. She was a great choice as the shy woman, who helps the hero out and also brings out his soft side. Their onscreen relationship for me was really impressive, as they show people how a real relationship should work. That being the case, the final scene of this Rocky is so pivotal, as it has Rocky and Adrian wanting to be with each other, though most fighters would be more worried about the result of the fight. Rocky's trainer Mickey, was played by legend actor Burgess Meredith. I remember him in the TV series of Batman, as the notorious Penguin. However I feel that his role in Rocky was incredible, showing movie fans how good an actor he is. Rocky's opponent in the ring was Apollo Creed who was performed by Carl Weathers. His character was very cocky and confident, showing that he only wants to fight the `Italian Stallion' for the fun of it. He was in for a horrible shock when he steps into the ring. Weathers has been in movies such as Predator, Little Nicky and Happy Gilmore. One character that I found to be a little peculiar in this movie, was Adrian's brother Paulie, acted by Burt Young. He was a very rude and arrogant person, who takes advantage of his sister and his friend, whether it be for his lifestyle or his pocket. There are many poignant scenes in Rocky, none more so than when Rocky and his trainer Mickey are talking in his apartment. They are both very scared to commit to each other, however when Rocky believes Mickey has left and realises he hasn't, the tough man just retreats back into his bathroom. Many of the scenes that Rocky has with Adrian are fundamental to what happens to Rocky in the ring. I especially love the scene when Rocky makes a move on Adrian. The fight between Apollo and Rocky is also well shot and gives the audience the feeling that they are actually there watching the bout.So, there is not much more I can say about one of the 70's most powerful movies, as it is up there with movies such as Star Wars, Superman American Graffiti, One who flew over the Cuckoo's nest and the scary Jaws. Rocky is a character, that I am sure everyone could relate to, whether it is playing a sport, working in a job or studying at school, as his dedication to being the best he could be is inspirational. The musical score that Rocky has is as powerful as the Italian Stallion' himself, with it being known all over the world. If you can not take something away from this award-winning movie than you are not a true movie lover! Rating: 4.5 Stars or 9.5 out of 10",Null,0,0,16 May 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Cruise. Kidman. Kubrick. Watch this movie with your eyes wide open!
","Whether you like his movies or not, you have to appreciate how different a director Stanley Kubrick really was. In the final movie he ever made, 'Eyes Wide Shut', he pushes the envelope for how much sexual content can be contained in one movie, in addition to what makes a movie that little bit different. This is a movie that has to be seen, with your 'eyes wide open'.Consumed by betrayal and jealousy, wealthy Manhattan doctor Bill Harford's comfortable world is turned topsy-turvy when his wife's lascivious sexual fantasies about another man, lead him into a dangerous underworld of sexual ritualistic obsession. This erotic foray threatens to ruin his marriage -and may even ensnare him in a lurid murder mystery.This movie is a very slow and long experience, and perhaps that is reason why you have to appreciate it so much. In many Hollywood movies, you get a standard formula, that does not do anything that I would call is 'new'. But with this film, you have to take in all of its aspects that it contains, meaning you have to be very patience while watching it.That being said, Kubrick was another of the world's unique directors, in that he would have wanted every shot to be just the way he wanted. This movie is no different, in that you can see Kubrick's perfectionism really coming to the fore. It is as if he was in love with every shot of the movie, which is like another of Hollywood's directors, Quinton Tarantino. Being the movie fan I am, it was a great shame that Kubrick died during the production of this movie, as I am sure he would have had some interesting movies left to do if he was still alive today.Eyes wide shut's story comes from the novel 'traumnovelle' by Arthur Schnitzler. The story itself is very confronting, looking at some challenging issues. The movie then takes that a step further, with the screenplay written by Kubrick and Fredrick Raphael, what I would call 'mind-boggling'. The issues of sex, infidelity, marriage and danger are all painted in such a way that the audience needs to ask the same questions of themselves, with some of us I'm sure not able to confront theses issues. Yet Kubrick plays with the audience making some issues so real, seem as if they are just a joke. The story to this movie is as original as you will see.The stars of the movie are undoubtedly former Hollywood couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. They share a weird, but funny chemistry onscreen, as we get to see how frail a marriage they are in. I have no doubts that this project would have placed a great strain on their 'real' marriage, and was in some way responsible for the demise of their relationship. For Cruise, his role is different, as in almost every shot he looks vulnerable and about to breakdown. The pair go off to a party hosted by Victor Zielger (Sydney Pollack) that starts to show them in situations that could jepardise their marriage. However the best part of the movie comes the night after the party when Alice (Kidman) accuses her husband of cheating on her. She is so stoned, that she is being unreasonable, with Bill (Cruise) almost in tears, unable to defend himself. The shocking confession from Alice then rips Bill's world apart.  What follows will be debated for alongtime to come, as you are not sure what is real, and what is not.'Eyes wide shut' has many fascinating elements, which include the sexual content, with Kubrick not holding back on what he wanted the audience to see. The female form becomes something that is not 'arousing', instead it is just normal. The rating that this movie was given, I am sure hurt it, because of the use of digitally animated sexual characters. Although they are hardly noticeable, the vision that Kubrick would have wanted to show us, would have been tainted it a little. Lights are used to great effect in the movie with the colours of the 'rainbow' so apparent. I believe this is to show off the obvious sexual tone of the movie's story. It is clever to see the rainbow effect in a couple of camera shots. While it is subtle, it can be quite noticeable if you look hard enough.This movie also has an amazing soundtrack. The piano playing in the background for the majority of the movie is so thrilling and chilling that it gives the film great tension and suspense. It builds the story up to be more than what it would have been without music. The standout song from 'Eyes Wide Shut' has to be Chris Issak's hit 'Baby did a bad bad thing', which is one of the highlights of the entire movie for mine.The majority of the film has a 'dreamlike' effect to it, and it is difficult to tell what is in reality and what is not. It asks many questions that I am sure we have to work the answers to ourself (such as did Alice have an affair with the naval officer or was it only ever a fantasy? What actually happened the night Bill went on his sexual exploration? Was it only a dream Bill was having after all? If it was not, can the Harford's marriage really survive, after such turbulent events?) That being said, it has taken three viewings of this film for me to actually like it. It is a film that people will either 'love or hate'. Someone said that Kubrick might have had an incite into the main stars immanent marriage problems, and perhaps he did. Then again we all have problems, but it has how we handle these problems, that predetermines what sort of life we end up having, whether we are a husband, a wife or a child.CMRS gives 'Eyes Wide Shut': 3.5 (Good - Very Good Film)",Null,0,0,6 March 2003
Pulp Fiction," Comment: Pulp: Soft, moist, formless mass of matter, a magazine which is made of poor quality paper and containing sensational stories. Fiction: Invention; invented statement or narrative; prose literature c
","With a cult following around the world, a couple of years ago I thought I better get around to watching Pulp Fiction', and see what all the fuss was about. To my horror, I found this movie too sick and violent for my liking. Then just the other day I gave it a second chance and boy I am glad that I did. Pulp Fiction' is an inside look at a memorable community of criminals. This is one of the more unique pieces of cinema the world has ever seen.Prize-fighter Butch Coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal he's made with the devil. Honey Bunny and Pumpkin are a couple of young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. Meanwhile, two career criminals, Vincent Vega and Jules, go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. While one is asked to baby-sit their boss' dangerously pretty young wife, the other suddenly realises that he must give up his life of crime.
The screenplay written for Pulp Fiction' by Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avery is unusual and interesting at the same time. I like how Quentin made the story be out of chronological order, in addition to the way he cleverly changes the pace of the movie (e.g. from violent-humorous or vice-versa). Then there is also the very subtle use of humour in PF', which is another part of the script l like as well. Tarantino, I have read, used the humour to offset the violence that was about to, or has happened. Yet the script also holds some weird dialogue, for instance when Mia and Vincent are in the Diner, as I felt the first time it was really boring. A second viewing I can appreciate that it is a little different, not like your normal movie lingo. I am not surprised that this screenplay won an academy award, as it was very original. This movie has an all star line up. It resurrected the career of John Travolta who was on a downer before taking on the character of Vincent Vega in PF'. Travolta is good as the bad guy, as I also like his performance in the action hit, Broken Arrow'. Travolta shares an interesting, but bizarre chemistry with Uma Thurman, who plays Mia. The dance sequence the pair does at the burger diner has to go down as one of the great pieces of cinema I have seen. I know I will not forget it for along time to come. Thurman is also part of the movies most distressing scene, when her character accidentally OD's on heroine. What follows is quite unbelievable.
Vincent's mobster sidekick is Jules (Samuel L. Jackson), whose role is so serious that in some circumstances it has to be laughed at.  Jules always misquotes a bible passage, thinking that he has it right to the very word. The verse is Ezekiel 25:17'. I love how the script allows both Travolta and Jackson to make fun of what essentially are dangerous, violent and serious situations. They also share funny dialogue at the beginning of the film, as Vincent asks Jules, do you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with cheese in Paris? A Royale with Cheese.' The mob pair work for Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) who for most of the movie we only see the back of his head.  He is one of the more influential characters in the entire movie.
Then you have the character of Butch (played by action superstar Bruce Willis). He has been asked to throw a fight he is in, but doesn't, with the consequences of that being great. We also learn about the history of a wrist watch that his grandfather had in the war. One of the two great cameo performances in PF' comes from Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), who tells one of the movies funnier moments. The wrist watch is an important item to the movies make-up. The other is a bad guy by the name Jimmie (played by Tarantino himself). Tarantino is one guy who sure is involved when it comes to making a movie!I have to admit that I was not a fan of the contents of Pulp Fiction' when I first watched it. Yet three years on, I can see why many people like what it covers.  The violence (one of the main reason why I did not like it first time) is nowhere as bad I thought, as Tarantino cleverly cuts away to a different camera angle or too a completely different shot all together to make it a little less shocking. Yet it still has the same impact, as you know exactly what has happened.  Sure the bad guys use guns, but again they are used in such a way, that I could approve of them a second time around. There are many other deeper aspects to this movie that I have learnt to see and want too find more about. Early on in 2003 I was away with friends on the beach. At one stage I started drinking a can or two of alcohol. After an hour I was getting really happy, and started to dance like they do at the diner in Pulp Fiction'. Since that night I have wanted to watch the movie and see what I was mimicking. Quentin Tarantino has had what I believe is a positive influence on movies that we watch today. Sure he might push the envelope on what people like, but he also makes movies that are a little bit different, unlike the normal predictable' movie formulas. Tarantino also uses some extraordinary camera angles in Pulp Fiction, just great!  First time around, I would have only given Pulp Fiction a very small rating, however after many viewings, Pulp Fiction has shown me that it is a brilliant film, exceptionally well made by Tarantino.CMRS gives Pulp Fiction': 5 (Brilliant Film)",9,0,2,23 February 2004
Titanic," My only wish for 'the most overrated movie of all-time' is .. would it sink!
","SPOILER ALERT The first time I watched this film it was a highly emotional experience, the second time, ironically, it bored me to 'tears'. I realise that it was one of the biggest movies in cinema history, but after initially 'liking it', I could see through its grandness and see that it had big faults. The consensus of the 'general public' was that the 'titanic' is a great movie, however I am one person who disagrees.One of the world's greatest tragedies, Titanic, the 'unsinkable' ship, a most unimaginable human catastrophe. The untold stories lay in mystery two and a half miles beneath the waves of the North Atlantic. Now, in a 'fictional romantic tale', Jack and Rose meet aboard the ill-fated 'Titanic', but their love gives them hope and courage as their trip aboard Titanic becomes a struggle just to survive.James Cameron certainly had big visions when he accepted the directing role on 'Titanic'. I believe Cameron wanted the 'Titanic' to appeal to a certain audience, perhaps young couples who have just fallen in love, I do not know. But what I do know is that having the love story in this film was unrealistic and boring for that matter. However, I did like how the film showed the events leading up too the ships demise, and the demise itself, as these had great drama and were what I was expecting from Cameron in the director's chair.But the biggest fault in this movie came from its story, which was also written by Cameron. Firstly, I did not like how the story started, having it being told from the point of view of a much older Rose (Gloria Stewart). Instead, I would have rather the story start with all the excitement of seeing the Titanic about to leave the doc. Then to write in a love story, such as the one presented here, was a typical Hollywood move, very corny, and for me, unappreciated. I agree with the people who say that the love story presented here is most disrespectful to the people who lost their lives on board the ship. But would have such a relationship ever have developed on board Titanic? I say 'NO!', because the very experience of being on the Titanic would have been very overpowering for many people. Then again, when the story starts to show the ship in crisis that is when I became 'interested' again, as that I what I wanted to be told via the story.
I will admit that there was some pretty good acting talent on show in the 'Titanic'. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is men that you could call plain lucky or unlucky, which ever way you look at his situation aboard the Titanic. Dawson is an artist, painting many different things. The only reason he is aboard the great ship, is because he won a hand of poker at the local saloon. He is now on the way to America. Little does he know what is about to unfold in his life. On the Titanic he casually glances at a beautiful woman, called Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). While DiCaprio and Winslet are great in their roles, I still find it hard to accept the love story the pair share, as I feel it was only ever there as a device to help sell the movie even more, however it did not work on me.There are other roles I enjoyed in Titanic. Rose's fiancé, Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), was great as the mean and nasty 'bastard.  He believes he can buy what he does not have, and gives Rose a necklace called 'the heart of the ocean', a big focal point to the film. I love when Cal gets angry and aggressive towards other people on the ship, especially Jack. How he escapes from drowning in the cold ocean waters, was very clever indeed. The other character I liked here was Margaret 'Molly' Brown (Kathy Bates). She is tagged as being 'unseekable Molly Brown', with many of the 1st class passengers not liking her at all. Bate's humour was a real highlight for me, as was her help for Jack, and her compassion for the drowning passengers of the Titanic.I also enjoyed the special effects of Titanic, showing the ship, both functioning and in demise, especially the moment where the ship tears itself in half, and start to sink. The sets are also done in a grand way in this film, showing how classy an experience it must have been on the Titanic. The musicals score to Titanic is not bad, as it makes for great drama, tension and emotion. The main song of the soundtrack, 'My heart will go on', sung by Celine Dion, was a big song at the time of this movie's release. However when I hear it these days, I cringe at how bad it really is.
Sure, the 'Titanic' is the highest grossing movie of all-time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Director, but these facts do not change my opinion on how bad I think it is. I feel it is a movie that has suffered 'Hollywooditis', with just too much of the standard movie formula done here 'too sink a ship'. I would have preferred to see a much more low-key movie, focusing more on what it would like to be on such a ship as the 'Titanic', such as when Jack is at the front of the boat, screaming 'I'm the king of the world', as those sections of the movie had me captivated. I cannot say the same for its love story. Also, running at about 3 hours and 10 minutes, it was just a bit too long for my liking. I am amazed at how naïve the passengers were about the indestructibility of the Titanic, saying that it was 'unsinkable', because they were proven too be majorally wrong.CMRS gives 'Titanic': 1.5 (Bad - Ok Film)",Null,2,4,2 August 2003
Rocky III," A Fighter. A Lover. A Legend. The Greatest Challenge.
","Rocky III brings out a lot of raw emotion, in a heartfelt third sequel. This film also proves that some people have times where the motivation to want to do something is impossible to recapture, and that anyone who gets complacent about where he or she is in life will not achieve his or her full potential. However with some encouragement from family and friends, anything and everything is possible. Rocky seems to make me want to bring the best out in myself, when at times I feel like doing the exact opposite.Having defeated heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, Rocky now holds the title and all of the comforts it brings. Gone is the self-doubting, small time boxer  the new Rocky even takes the time to compete in charity events most notably against the mountain of muscle, Hulk Hogan. His perfect world is rocked by a challenge from the obnoxious and taunting Chubber Lang. Rocky does not take the fight seriously  despite his boxing prowess, he lacks raw hunger of his opponent and is defeated. The loss is however is incomparable with the tragedy of the death of his longtime trainer, Mickey. Rocky is taken aback when Apollo Creed offers to train him and win back the heavyweight crown in the comeback of the century'. All Apollo wants in return is a favour', which he will not disclose until after the fight. With Creed's help Rocky again develops the eye of the tiger' and the scene is set for another powerful battle in the ring.The cast of Rocky III was great once again. Taking on the roll of Rocky for a third time was Sylvester Stallone. I have watched the whole serious and his acting ability just gets better and better. His scenes along with Carl Weathers in this movie are really special. I am sure these two would be good friends in real life and I can see why they are. It was the final time we get to see the ever-green Burgess Meredith. His role as Rocky's trainer Mickey ended in this part of the Rocky saga, which for me was a little sad. He was the perfect person for the role of Mickey, as he made you feel as if he was a real boxing trainer. There was also another good role from the now Mrs. Balboa', of course I am talking about Talia Shire. She was such a good choice as Adrian. I am sure a famous actress would have spoiled that part of Rocky.Yet the one surprising part of this cast is a new edition, that being the brutal Mr. T. He made his presence felt onscreen extremely well. I enjoyed how you felt he was so confident, yet he had the fist to back it up. I never got that heavily into The A-Team, but what I can remembering seeing of it was enjoyable. His role in that show was also very heavy, but he was one person you could look forward too seeing on TV. The story of Rocky III was for an enjoyable one. To have our champ up against it, for me made this an interesting premise. Then to thrown in the death of trainer, a very angry opponent, who is sure that he can take out Balboa in two miserly rounds. Then to top it off we have the great rivals, becoming great friends and teaming up to defeat this very nasty opponent. Stallone is a great writer, with the Rocky franchise a joy to watch in my view.Up in till now, I have not mentioned the powerful soundtracks that accompany these great movies. The main theme especially had a powerful impact on me, to the extent, that I wanted to try and achieve something that normally I would say is just too hard to do. The trumpets at the start are just great. Yet the third movie was based around the eye of the tiger'. This was in relation into Rocky get that hunger back to get back into the ring as a real fighter. The eye of the tiger is also a great song that was sung by the group, Survivor. As the movies are made in this series, the music just gets better and better. So Rocky III makes my summation from the first film come true, that Rocky is truly about motivation. Yet it also shows that if you can rekindle the passion, then you can achieve more than you could ever wished for. With its powerful music, great acting and story, I am glad that by 1982 the world had seen 3 movies with the name Rocky' attached to them!Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10",Null,23,32,16 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," J.K. Rowling's best selling novels have cinematically come to life.
","Although I have never read a page of a 'Harry Potter' novel, I looked forward to watching 'The Philosophers Stone'. I feel I have an advantage in that I do not know the complete Harry Potter story, making it quite new' to a viewer like me. This movie also shows me why Harry Potter is so popular with Children, as its story is directed right at that viewing audience. There is also an uncanny comparison to 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone'. Be captivated by the world's most popular mythical character, who has come to life! In a world where wizards, witches and regular folk live in an uneasy co-existence, Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and has special powers. When he is rescued from the abuse of his aunt, uncle and cousin, he is asked to attend the prestigious Hogwarts', school of Wizardry and Witchcraft. There, he meets two best friends, Ron and Hermione, who become his closest allies that have to help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths at the hands of a powerful adversary.I was not sure what to expect when I came to watch the first Harry Potter movie, but after watching I was certainly glad that I did. Its stars are well chosen, whether it be the adult or child actors.  The main man of the show was Daniel Radcliffe, who landed the envious role of Harry Potter. I found him to be a perfect Harry Potter', and a remarkable resemblance to the character that has been written and drawn. Once Harry goes to Hogwarts School, he meets both Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), who become his closest friends. In fact their friendship is one of the highlights of the movie. Having such young actors in those most important performances was quite achievement.The adult stars were also of the finest quality in Harry Potter. The star I recognised the most was Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). He was perfect for his role. He is deceptively good as Snape. Rickman is best remembered in the first Die Hard movie (1988). Harry's headmaster at Hogwarts is Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris). He is most respected at the school and has a long grey beard. Unfortunately Harris died a few months ago. Thankfully he finished his work on the second Harry Potter film. I liked Harry's adult friend Rubeus Hagrid, who saves him from his evil family. He is a funny guy, who helps Harry be the greatest magician he can be. Also look out for the funny cameo performance by John Cleese, who plays the humorous ghost Nearly Headless Nick'.The Philosopher's Stone has some fine scenes and special effects attached to it. I enjoy how we see Harry start to discover the strange world he is about to be involved in. When he gets right into Hogwarts', he is participates in the popular and important sport called Quidditch. The game that we get to see being played out is an impressive special effect. Then you have the three-headed dog, Fluffy, who scares the three young magicians many times. It is a funny character, who is an impressive computer generated image. Yet the best scene for me would have to be the vital Chess game that the children have to play when they are on the search for the mystery behind Harry's parent's death. This also shows what impressive sets had to be designed for Harry Potter. The chess set must have taken along time to complete, but what an achievement it was to see.Director Chris Columbus did a fine job with Harry Potter. I like the direction he took the audience on. It is also quite obvious that Columbus stuck very close to the unique Harry Potter story that has been written in the past, which is another positive for this film. This really is the perfect book to movie adaptation. The screenplay for the Philosopher's stone was written by Steve Klobe. While he had plenty of help by J.K. Rowling's herself, the story felt pretty accurate. The only problem I found with it was that it was a little childish' for my liking. But what can you expect from a story that is directed at children. So with most of the world going Harry Potter' crazy, buying all-sorts of the wizards merchandise, clothes and now the movie, some people have warned me of the dangerous effects that such a story can have on the world's youngsters. Witchcraft can have a bad effect on anyone, yet by having it in the hands of a child, makes it all the worse. I fully understand why some people are very weary towards Harry Potter.  What is of great disappointment to me is the Harry Potter DVD, which was not released in widescreen and seemingly only directed at children. I wish it had an adult and a child section which were separate. I look forward to seeing what the next chapter of this story will be like, as I have heard nothing but praise for the Harry Potter sequel titled the chamber of secrets'. So I have big expectations when I do get around to seeing it.CMRS give Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)",Null,0,0,16 January 2003
A Beautiful Mind," He Saw The World In A Way No One Could Have Imagined.
","To say that battling mental Illness is tough, for me, is an understatement. For just over two years, I have suffered through the highs and lows of depression'. So it was with great anticipation that I watched the new Russell Crowe movie A Beautiful Mind'. Sure it has the Hollywood feel to it, but it is a film that I feel we can all learn from, and realise that any illness, even mental illness, can be overcome, if you really want too.John Nash, a student at Princeton, struggles to think of an original idea that will make him matter to the world. Nash is eccentric, socially awkward, and extremely competitive. Eventually, he finds the inspiration for his innovative and influential work on game theory. He's chosen for a post at MIT, which includes crucial code-breaking work for the US government. There, he meets a beautiful and brilliant student, Alicia. They marry but their happiness is threatened, as Nash, belatedly diagnosed as schizophrenic, descends into madness.Director of ABM' is the very skilled and successful Ron Howard. In this movie he shows just why he is a big Hollywood director toady. I liked how Howard shows Nash's debilitating illness, the timeline of the film, which was different to other movies, showing a similar story and how we meet certain unique characters. Howard was helped out with this film, by best friend and producer Brian Grazer. He placed his fine touches to the film, making it an even better experience to watch. The story for ABM was taken from the novel (of the same name) by Sylvia Nasar. The story for the screen was written by Akiva Goldsman. Although its content has been hotly debated by many people, saying that it might not be as legitimate as the movie actually shows. It is my feeling that this story was cleverly devised by Goldsman, especially the make-believe characters that Nash interacts with, when he becomes extremely ill. This would have been a difficult story to get right', but I think that Goldsman got it spot on. The main role in ABM was that of mathematician mastermind, John Nash (Russell Crowe). This role was quite different than the other roles that Crowe has taken on in the past. In ABM, he is a nervous, weird and mentally ill individual. Crowe's general onscreen demeanor is that of arrogance'. When we first see Crowe he is immediately into character, which gives his performance an even greater impact. This role would have been an extremely demanding one for Crowe, to become not only this brilliant mind, but to show the frightening side to Schizophrenia' and what patience of such an illness has to go through. Crowe also has to be commended for the way he interacts with all the imaginary characters of the film, as it is in his acting that you believe they might be real. This role in ABM shows just why Crowe is a successful Hollywood actor today. But just as good as Crowe in ABM is the character of Alicia Nash (Jennifer Connelly). Her role gave the movie its main emotional avenue, with her love, faithfulness and vulnerability very impacting from where I viewed the movie. Another real' character I liked was Martin Henson (Josh Lucas). The confrontation he has with Nash at the start of the film is very interesting to see. However, Henson's compassion and friendship shown to Nash towards the end of the film is very touching.     I am also a big fan of the roles taken on by the actors, who were imaginary characters in ABM. The three people in question are William Parcher (Ed Harris), Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and Marcee Herman (played very well by the cute Vivian Cardone). Every scene with any and all these performers is terrific to watch, and the movie shows them very well. My favourite scenes are when Nash believes his wife might be killed by Parcher and when Nash is in Henson's school office, trying very hard to ignore Charles. The way the movie shows both of these scenes, both being funny and dramatic, is the very reason I like it so much.                There are other people behind the scenes that need to be highlighted for their work on the movie. The make-up department did a wonderful job in turning many of these young actors into the older people they are at the end of the film. The work done on both Crowe and Connelly was quite remarkable. The music to ABM was well composed by Titanic's' James Horner. The music makes the movie much more dramatic and emotional. In fact at one stage, I felt I was watching the Titanic' all over again. John Nash is a brilliant man, showing that his mathematical skills are very invaluable for the world we live in. Nash is also a very complicated man as his mathematical discoveries are very complex. Although A Beautiful Mind' did win 4 Academy Awards, including best picture and director, I feel it should have won more, including Crowe's performance, which deserved a Best Actor Oscar. People have been quick to praise or criticise the way the movie showed the treatments in combating mental illnesses like Schizophrenia. I think we need to learn more about mental illness, and this movie goes some small to doing that. Having been affected by mental illness in my life, I really do have a soft spot for a film like this. To borrow a phrase I heard to describe this movie  A Beautiful Mind, is a Beautiful Movie!'CMRS gives A Beautiful Mind': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)",Null,0,2,8 October 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," `Dobby Has Come To Warn You Sir.' Not as good as the first Harry Potter' movie, but a decent enough sequel.
","I mentioned in my first Harry Potter' review, that I had big expectations' when I got around to seeing the sequel titled the chamber of secrets.' Having now seen it, and sure it is an entertaining movie, but for me, it did not have the same appeal as the first film had. But if I was ten years old, I am sure that this movie would be a classic, which I am sure the movie world will one day be calling it. I am not sure whether it deserves such praise.   Something Evil Has Returned To Hogwarts! At the start of his second year of an amazing journey into the world of wizardry, cars fly, trees fight back and a mysterious elf comes to warn Harry Potter. This year at Hogwarts, spiders talk, letters scold and Harry's own unsettling ability to speak to snakes turns his friends against him. From duelling clubs to rogue Bludgers, it's a year of adventure and danger when bloody writing on a wall announces: 'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened'. To save Hogwarts will require all of Harry, Ron and Hermione's magical abilities and courage in this spellbinding sequel. Back in the lead role of Harry Potter is young star Daniel Radcliffe. I enjoyed his role in the first movie a little bit more, but he has proven in both movies that he is a fine choice as Harry. Harry is saved from his life of misery with his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling), by his best friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) in an immensely enjoyable escape. The other friend Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also good, although her character has a rather less than appealing affect called petrifying' placed on her when she is trying to help Harry and Ron figure out what is going on at Hogwarts.  
There are also some very new and original characters that have been designed for the sequel of Harry Potter'. The best addition to the Harry Potter cast in my opinion happens to be a computer generated house elf' called Dobby'. He is so funny in what he says and does. It is credit to the creators of this creature, as he looked very human' from where I viewed it. Another of the new characters that I found great joy in watching was the strange ghost called Moaning Myrtle', who was an important person in the make-up of the movie. Of the human members of the cast that were new to the movie, it happens to be one of Hollywood's better known actors. The fraud book writer Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagher) was a character that I found funny, and shows that he is a person that Harry and his friends need to be wary of.
Yet the regular adult members of the cast did not have the same impact as they did in the first movie. People such as headmaster Prof. Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) and Prof. McGonagol (Maggie Smith), were all given minor roles in this movie, which brought the film down, in my opinion. In the first movie, these actors had better defined characters and gave adult viewers of the movie something to be able to take away from it. I cannot say this was evident in the Harry Potter sequel, which was disappointing. It must be mentioned that these actors take a risk by taking on such roles, so it would be better if they had greater roles within the film.   However the story did have some good points to it. The action that was written certainly made for an entertaining story in places. So was the way that the story made the chamber of secrets' seem like a very evil and disturbed place at Hogwarts, especially for Harry. The exciting and scary parts of The chamber of secrets' would have been too much for some youngsters. The movie's screenplay was well adapted once again by screenwriter, Steve Klobe. Also back a second time was director Chris Columbus, who had great success in the first of these movies. While he did an okay job in the sequel, I wish that he had done things a little bit different, like make the adult characters come through a bit better and did certain parts of this film just like the first movie. Which bring me to the scene highlights of The chamber of secrets'. I really enjoyed the scene which involved the three main characters and how they a drink a potion that changes them. This was a funny and original part of the film. With great visual effects, The Chamber of Secrets' had such big moments such as when Harry and Ron are on the run from some menacing looking spiders. Harry's confrontation in the chamber' was also great and well produced by all involved, as was the way that Harry learns the secrets of the chamber. The one scene that I found most disappointing was the Quidditch' match. While this was one of the great highlights of the first movie, it was not so for me in the second, as it was not as action packed like it was in the first movie.    The Harry Potter' movies still makes me wary of how bad witchcraft can be, especially in the hands of youngsters. Harry Potter is also a character that I am sure was created with certain people in mind. I am thinking of youngsters who come from backgrounds like troublemakers', poor kids' and parentless children', as Harry fits under all these categories. He would have to appeal to all of the children who might fit under one or more of these banners.  Look all in all this was a good movie, but nothing that I would call great.

Die Hard," 40 Stories Of Sheer Adventure
","When you talk about action movies, no movie is better to watch than the brutal action of Die hard. When I watched it for the first time, I was literally 'blown away' by the non-stop action that was presented for me. This film also showed me that Bruce Willis has plenty of talent and is a superstar.High above the city of L.A. a team of terrorists have seized a building, taken hostages and declared war. But one man has managed to escape detection...an off-duty cop. He's alone...tired...and the only chance anyone has. New York City  Detective John McClane, newly arrived in Los Angeles to spend Christmas holidays with his estranged wife and family. But as McClane waits for his wife's office party to break-up, terrorists seize control of the building. While the terrorist leader, Hans Gruber and his savage henchman round up hostages, McClane slips away unnoticed. Armed with only a service revolver and his cunning attack, McClane launches his own one-man war. When scripting the role of McClane in this movie it wouldn't have been hard to choose Bruce Willis. It was as if he was made for this role.  Many parts of his character standout for me. His actions to stop the terrorist was gutsy, whether by gun or by fist. Then there is the way he was saving the hostages. It all makes for a pretty courageous sort of man and cop. Willis has had some career, yet I feel if he was a real cop he would act like the McClane character. Watching an interview with Willis he said he could relate to parts of the McClane character. Willis is famous for many movie roles (including Pulp Fiction and The Sixth Sense), which have been big movies for Willis. I also remember Willis in one of his early TV roles, Moonlighting, with the delightful Cybil Shepherd, which I must admit was quite enjoyable to watch.The bad guys were very effectively bought to the bigscreen in this movie. The terrorists leader Hans Gruber, was played by English stage actor Alan Rickman. With that incredible English accent he was castled just right for his role. The other bad guy thug was Alexander Godunov, who also impressed me. Then there are some likeable good guys in this movie. McClane's wife, played by Bonnie Bedella, was a good character. Like her husband, she tries to remain strong in a very volatile situation. Then we have L.A cop Al Powell, acted by Reginald VelJohson. Reginald starred in the TV sitcom Family Matters', which was at times very annoying to watch. But his role was pretty good in Die Hard, the calm cop in the middle of a major crisis.
The story in the first Die Hard was quite clever and well written. I must say that it is an original idea to have one cop try and stop a gang of terrorist in a high rise building, which in my view was terrific. Something else that was interesting was the day that this all took place, Christmas Eve. I must say that it was an original idea and one I liked. The other part of the script which I enjoyed was the sarcasm between McClane and the bad guys. It was cleverly written into the script and perfectly portrayed by the cast. I also enjoyed the special effects in the first Die Hard movie. Using a real 40 story building was quite risky and done just right. A lot of the credit for this needs to go to special effects man Richard Edlands. One other man who needs credit for making this movie as enjoyable as it was, is director John McTiernan. He really did have a great cast and would have had a good time just seeing all this movie unfold in front of him. In my view he didn't interfere too much, yet would have also wanted the movie to come out just the way he wanted. He has directed some impressive films such as Predator and The Hunt For Red October.One part of Die Hard I didn't appreciate was the foul language which was spoken. I'm not talking about swearing in our culture today, but something much worse in my view - Blasphemy. The McClane character was taking the lord's name in vain almost every time he opened his mouth. Now the blame has to land with the script writers here. I was offended by this bad language. God's name is sacred and it baffles me why we hear so much profanity in movies when it is so unnecessary. The language in movies in my view needs to be looked at more closely. This movie was made 13 years ago and like all the big blockbusters in today's video stores, I wished I had seen this Hollywood classic in the cinema. The only saving grace for me is that I own Die Hard on DVD. I don't recommend Die Hard, the original, if you are claustrophobic, as this movie remains in one place, yet this made the film even more interesting for me. A cracking thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense. If you haven't seen Die Hard watch it and get captivated by one of the great action flicks of our time.

Die Hard with a Vengeance," Think Fast. Look Alive...
","After seeing two of these films, I thought that the third could not be any better than the first two. It was an original theme, with a great story and cast. But somehow they did it again, Die Hard with a vengeance is one the great action movies of our time. This is one of the biggest heart-stoppers that you will ever see.Detective John McClane has seen his share of bad days, but this time, Simon says McClane is going to have a really bad day. A man calling himself 'Simon' begins a reign of terror in the streets of New York: he threatens to detonate bombs around the city unless McClane and his accomplice cooperate in a game of 'Simon Says'. McClane has a bad hangover and a bad attitude, and isn't in the mood for games, especially this one. Reprising the role as Police Detective John McClane is Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis. I love this character, because he has no care for the consequences for his actions, but does care that innocent people can be hurt or killed because of him. To help of set the insane character of McClane is the talented Samuel L. Jackson. He stars as Zeus Carver and I must admit that these characters were great to watch. The tension between McClane and Carver was another aspect to this movie that made it so fascinating. While they are trying to save the day, they question each others preferences towards one another. Yet in the end they accept each other for who they really are and become good mates. Some of the dialogue between those guys was very funny. Samuel L Jackson has had a fair career starring in some impressive films such as Deep Blue Sea, Star Wars, The Negotiator, Rules Of Engagement and lately Unbreakable.When Simon says, McClane does. The main bad guy in this Die Hard is Jeremy Irons. Again I loved this character because of his accent it was great to listen to, especially in the scenes where Simon calls up and barks out his instructions. Bruce Willis said that getting Jeremy Irons as a Bad Guy' was great for this film and I tend to agree with him. His character also plays a huge part in this movie to why it was so different and captivating for me. McClane and Zeus are sent on a wild goose chase all over New York City and have many different riddles and games to play and solve, with many of them having a do or die consequences attached. The credit for this in part needs to go to director of Die Hard, the original, and back in Die Hard 3, John McTiernan. He has a great sense of the unknown and brings it to the screen just nicely. I must also say that the storywriters did a fine job in Die Hard With A Vengeance. The games and the revenge parts of the script were cleverly written.So, I must admit that Die Hard With A Vengeance is my favourite of the Die Hard films, if not one of my favourite films of all-time. Bruce Willis is one actor I will be looking out for. I want to finally say that this movie is full of sarcasm. Now it mightn't be that friendly to hear, but makes for interesting viewing. With it, it delivers great tension and at times some funny humour. I heard on the grapevine last year (2000) that Die Hard 4 was to be made, if it is I hope it can be as breathtaking as it's predecessors. The description by Clark Forbes of the Melbourne Sunday Herald Sun says it all about Die Hard 3:<ul><li>'The best car chases since BULLIT, a better subway crash than SPEED, bigger blasts than any LETHAL WEAPON...the hardest toughest one of all.'</li></ul>Yippy Kay Aye, Movie Lovers!Rating 4.5 Stars or 9.5/10",10,0,0,6 March 2001
Back to the Future Part II," The past and the future could be in jeopardy. Watching this sequel is fun and gives many reason why interfering with time is not such a good idea.
","Although it is not as good as the original movie in my view, the sequel Back To The Future II' is a movie that fans of the genre will always enjoy. What is fun about this movie is how totally crazy that the whole idea behind it really was. However it is also interesting to once again visit the classic story that the two Bobs have been made famous for writing. There are other interesting aspects to this film, but if I tell you too much too soon, we might do some irreparable damage to the space time continuum'.Brace yourself  as the most spectacular history-altering adventure of all time continues. Marty and Doc Brown have barely recovered from their first time-travelling adventure when they launch themselves once more into the space time continuum. But this time around, their history-tweaking antics in the year 2015 create a frightful, alternate 1985 Hill Valley where bully Biff Tannen is rich, powerful and Marty's Dad! Now, their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 all over again. But can Doc and Marty patch up the past without igniting a universe-shredding time paradox?
What is most impressive about the second of the BTTF films is the story that was thought up by Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale. Many sequels are entirely different sorts of movies, but in this one, the writing pair have cashed in on what was successful in the first and cleverly integrated that into the second. If I was to tell you what the main parts to the story were, it would get both of us very confused. Another remarkable part to this movie is the way the future is presented here. The movie partly takes place in 2015, so I am sure back in the 1980s, the ideas of what the future would be like in the new millennium were quite outrageous. Yet for a film such as this they are the perfect ideas to present. Of the changes to Marty's home town Hill Valley in 2015, they include vehicles which can fly through the sky and kids who have skateboards that operate as hovercrafts'. In fact the movies special effect highlights include all of the scenes with these hovercrafts', with Marty evading a bad gang in the centre of Hill Valley. Marty and Doc Brown (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) are back in very entertaining roles. Fox takes on more than the role of 17 year old Marty McFly from 1985. He is also his son Marty Jnr., the older Marty (the father of the family) and his daughter Marlene. Fox commented that the process of being the many different characters was an arduous task, but one that makes the whole BTTF experience worth it. Yet the standout role in BTTF 2 has to be Lloyd, who as the Doc has many headaches when he goes from the future, the present and the past. He is breathless as he flies about trying to repair the damage that is caused to the space time continuum'. Many times I had to laugh as the Doc is rambling on about what chaos has been caused by the latest disaster.There are other reprising roles that are most noteworthy in BTTF 2. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is back, as is his older version in the year 2015, along with his grandson Griff, who is as much a butthead' as his grandfather was at his age. In fact going back to see Biff as a billionaire and a teenager was even more enjoyable this time around, as he is the tough guy that Marty McFly does not like. There is also Marty's mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), who is very old in 2015 and placed into a horrible life when the present is ruined by her son. I feel that she was a great choice for this role and I am glad she came back. A new actor to the cast is Karate Kid and Leaving Las Vegas star Elizabeth Shue, who is Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer. Her role in the movie is funny as she is taken on a ride that will show her future.
Being behind the scenes of this movie must have been a nightmare, as you would not have known where you were from one day to the next. Perhaps that is the reason that this movie would have been so much fun to work on. I like what this movie points out about the past and the future. It shows you can go into the future and straighten out what little idiosyncrasy that you or your family might have. But it also shows what damage can be caused to the present, when one mistake is made. Back To The Future II' might not be as classy as the original movie, but what it lacks it in originality, it makes up with in comedy and humour.  With that in mind, fans of the series would have to be happy with a most satisfying of sequels.CMRS gives Back To The Future II': 4 (Very Good Film)",Null,1,2,16 January 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Brilliant. Cunning. Psychotic. In his mind lies the clue to a ruthless killer. Clarice Starling. FBI. Brilliant. Vulnerable. Alone. She must trust him to stop the killer.
","There are moments in Silence of the Lambs' that are truly wonderful to watch. Yet there are others that are evil, gruesome and disgusting, that many people would have to turn a blind eye to. In that sense, it makes this film very unique, as it compels you to watch what you normally would not. Also, in my time of watching movies I have not seen a more evil and dastardly character than that of the now famous Hannibal, the Cannibal'.
A psychopath killer known as Buffalo Bill' is kidnapping young women across the Midwest. Believing it takes one to know one, the FBI sends Agent Clarice Starling to interview a demented prisoner who may provide psychological insight into the killer's action. The prisoner is psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant murderous cannibal who will only help Starling if she will feed his morbid curiosity with details about her own complicated life. The twisted relationship forces Starling not only to confront her psychological demons, but leads her face to face with a demented heinous killer, an incarnation so powerful, that she may not have the courage  or strength  to stop him!It is no wonder that Silence of the Lambs received five academy awards. Of great highlight to me was the cast, which was brilliant. Anthony Hopkins performance as the brilliant mad man', Hannibal Lecter, was truly astonishing. He played the mentally disturbed doctor to perfection. I love how we see the close shots of Lector's eyes, as they look full of intrigue and mischief. Hannibal is a clever man, and shows the audience this many times. I like the chemistry that Hopkins shares with fellow actress Jodie Foster. Her performance as Clarice was exceptional. I like how we see the character of Clarice being someone who is very vulnerable (she refer to her childhood and the lambs screaming'), a woman who is trapped very much in a man's world, then having her be the heroine, to be of great significance to the entire story. I am sure 10 years ago, it would have been rare to find a woman be the hero/rescuer in a movie story.  The rest of the supporting cast include many fine performances. The role of James 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb (Ted Levine) was great. I enjoy how we see that he has a very weird sense of reality and that he could be thought of as a transsexual. This role caused quite a lot of commotion in America with Gay activists and I can see why it would do that. You also have the role of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), Clarice's boss. He gives Clarice the difficult tasks of talking to Lecter, so she can solve the case surrounding Buffalo Bill'. Add in the minor role of Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), who was good in the role of the woman in distress and in need of rescuing.The director of Silence of the Lambs', Jonathon Demme, captures many elements to the story which I feel were crucial. Such themes as the woman alienated in a man's world', Hannibal's evil character and the way Buffalo Bill' entices then kills his female victims are done in the correct way, making the movie feel so right. Silence's screenplay, comes from the book Silence of the Lambs' written by author Thomas Harris. With such an involved plot, it is no wonder that it was to be made into a movie. The person who made Silence's screenplay so good was Ted Talley, making Harris' characters really come to lifeThe cinematographer for Silence was Tak Fujimoto, who had some difficult tasks in this film. I like the way he made Hannibal look, as the camera is hooked on Lecter's eyes for the most part, adding to the thrill and suspense. Add in the way he showed Buffalo Bill to be a quite a queer character, fascinated in bugs and the like was exceptionally good. This leads me on to what extraordinary scenes Silence of the lambs' had. Gory and violent ones, such as when Hannibal escapes from prison and when we see what sort of an animal, Buffalo Bill' really is. I also enjoyed watching all the interaction with Clarice and Hannibal at the prison cell(s), as these scenes really bring out what the book had intended these characters to be like. In concluding, I was not scared as I thought I would be by Silence of the Lambs', but more captivated by how good a psycho-thriller this movie really was. Then again, I have realised I am nowhere near as shook up by violence as an adult, than I was when I was youngster. I am sure if I had seen it back in 1991, I would have been a lot more scared. I was interested to find out that Michelle Pfeiffer rejected the role of Clarice' and Gene Hackman the role of director in Silence of the Lambs', as they thought the story was just too violent for their liking, which is understandable. Silence of the Lambs' also proves to me what a dangerous area Psychiatry can be. I have been monitored by such a doctor, respect what he has to say and trust him. I am unsure how the Psychiatric profession would feel towards Hannibal Lecter and the movies that he is portrayed in. All in all this is one of the great movies of the 1990's'.CMRS gives Silence of the Lambs': 4 (Very Good Film)P.S.Finally, I want to mention how silly John Sammy' Newman can be on the AFL footy show in Australia. One night on the show he was wheeled out like Hannibal is in Silence of the Lambs'. A member from the audience was asked to take his mask off. Once they did, he lashed out of his costume and scared the wits out of them. Just hilarious. For this moviegoer, it was his first taste of what Hannibal Lecter' was going to be like.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
Signs," It's Not Like They Didn't Warn Us. This film is up there with Shyamalan's other masterpiece - The Sixth Sense'.
","M. Night Shyamalan's Signs', is a brilliantly crafted movie, showing just why he is a successful director in Hollywood today. All of Shyamalan's movies have evoked a lot of discussion as to whether they are good or bad for the public that see them, with that decision up for you to decide. In this great thriller of 2002, something is not quite right in the world, signs that something might change our world for ever. Aliens have always been in our thoughts for many years now, but do they really exist?
The Hess family live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. One morning they wake to find a 500 foot crop circle in their backyard. Graham Hess and his family are told extra-terrestrials are responsible for the sign in their field. They watch, with growing dread, at the news of crop circles being found all over the world. Signs is the emotional story of one family on one farm as they encounter the terrifying last moments of life as the world is being invaded. Get ready for a close encounter of the scared kind...What do you immediately think of when you hear such phrases as crop circles', little green men' or beings from another planet'?. All of these could be construed as signs' that something is out there. That was the feeling I got from watching this film. Signs' was written, produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who is brilliant at making one new movie experience after another. He puts all the pieces together quite deliberately, but so carefully at the same time, that I feel it is difficult not appreciate each movie experience we get with him. 
The film's story has many elements that make it great. Its emotion is so clear that you have to be affected by it, as does the tension, which is as thrilling as I have seen in a movie in a long time. The other clever tools used in this movie, include the way Shyamalan shows us these scary looking aliens, with the confrontations between Graham and the alien at the vet's house and between Merrill and the alien in the Hess living room, unforgettable to say the least. Furthermore, the use of news broadcasts is another clever device, which gives the movie even more tension, especially the broadcast showing a sighting at a children's birthday party. Shyamalan also created some great characters for the movie. Sure, there might not be many people in the film, but the people that you meet are quite remarkable.     The main character in Signs' is Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a priest that has lost his faith, for reasons that I will let the movie explain. For me, it seems ironic that the main character in the movie is a priest, as they, like all believers of God, are continuing to look for signs that show us why we believe in God in the first place. Graham even admits that these events might be the end of the world'. Gibson shows himself to be a character full of emotion, sorrow and anger. We discover that local vet, Ray Reddy (M. Night. Shyamalan), has caused a lot of the problems for the town's priest. Living with Graham are his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Morgan is smart kid, knowing a lot of the ideas surrounding other life-forms', while Bo is constantly paranoid by the drinking of water. In fact Bo is a character that shows signs are appearing that things are not quite right in the world. They all live on a corn and wheat farm where they have discovered the possibility of extra-terrestrials having visited them at their part of the earth.
All these actors have to be commended for their performances, as they continue on the feeling that Shyamalan wanted us to feel, a very eerie, depressive and sometimes scary experience. The performances by Culkin and Breslin are truly great. Both show that they can handle themselves in a complex story, only enhancing what sort of movie that we have. Credit in this area also has to go to Shyamalan, as his choices for these roles were crucial to the final make-up of the movie. Also, the way this man can direct young actors is an outstanding talent that I hope continues.
A lot of the film is very silent, another deliberate ploy by the director to set his audience up in different way. Roger Ebert said in his review of Signs - I cannot think of a movie where silence is scarier and inaction is more disturbing'. Many movies that we see, feel they need heaps of noise and action going on, but not here. The sounds (or lack of them), makes Signs' an even better movie experience. But the times that the movie does require noise, we get it through its powerful soundtrack, the perfect feeling. The score for Signs' was composed by John Newton Howard. I first watched Signs' with a friend who was quite adamant about his opinion of the movie. His words were I did not like Signs', it is a film that builds-up to nothing'. Now while my friend is entitled to his opinion, I have to say I disagree wholeheartedly with him about that. What he has described is essentially what Signs' is all about. The true revelation of the film for me is not only how it ends, but what it shows and what we experience through out. Shyamalan has made a film that only he could, because he can. In a time where Hollywood is quite predictable with its movie-making, along comes a guy that breaks all the rules, for all the right reasons. Signs' is a movie that I can only describe as one in a million', a film where its build-up is the pay off. For that strange reason, I am a big fan.   CMRS gives Signs':  5 (Brilliant Film)",Null,0,2,8 October 2003
Speed," On this bus ride, sit down, shut up and get ready for rush hour!'
","I know many action movie fans would say that Speed' is one of the best action films around, and I am not going to argue that its not. However, I feel that this movie is so much more. It has an intriguing and thrilling story, great stunts and special effects, characters which are genuinely concerned for each other and a first time-director who gets everything just right'. After watching Speed,' its audience can also be assured of two things. One, is making sure that their next bus ride is not booby-trapped, and two, that they are in for the movie ride of their lives'.Jack Traven and Harry Temple are a part of the L.A.P.D. SWAT team who help to rescue a group of executives trapped in a sabotaged elevator. The saboteur is not pleased with what Jack and his cop associates have done. So in retaliation, he sends Jack on a wild goose chase, to help diffuse a bomb which he has planted on a down-town L.A. bus. But until he does, Jack and passenger Annie Porter must keep the bus speeding through the streets of Los Angeles at more than 50 miles per hour or the bomb will explode.I know that this is hard to believe, but Keanu Reeves is really really good in this movie. As Jack, Reeves gives a performance, whereby you feel for him in almost every aspect of his character's plight, whether it is because of his job, his friends or the many people that he is trying to save on the runaway bus. The onscreen chemistry that he shares with co-star Sandra Bullock is another impressive side to Speed'. Annie (Bullock) is a passenger who is forced to drive the bus, after the driver is accidentally shot by another passenger. Bullock is so entertaining in her role, that I feel she steals the limelight from Reeves in the many shots the pair share on the bus. I also believe it would be more difficult for anyone to drive a bus like Annie has to, but that is all part of the fun.
The menacing character of Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is another delight of this movie. Hopper plays a mean and nasty bad guy, hell-bent on getting what he wants. In speed, he is a former cop with a grudge and will go to any lengths to get what he feel he deserves. The cat and mouse game that Hopper's character has is of great satisfaction for me. I also like how Payne says to Jack, `nothing tricky now. You know I'm on top of you! DO NOT attempt to grow a brain!' He is always holding the right cards. Hopper is hard to top as bad guy in any Hollywood picture.However Speed' is great for other reasons besides the great cast. This film was the first-time directing experience for cinematographer, Jan De Bont. From where I see it Jan got it right on the money. Speed has great action, stunts and a feel that you would believe a director would have needed many years of experience to get right. Yet Jan got Speed' at the right pace for the entire film. At no stage were the viewers of this film given a chance to settle down, as we are always presented with situations that were not only dangerous, but seemingly out of control. This is due mainly to the good work of De Bont. He has worked as a cinematographer on movies such as Total Recall', Die Hard' and Basic Instinct', showing us how good those skills really are. I like Graham Yost's screenplay for Speed'.  He added many elements, which help keep the viewer's attention all the way through. The main story is on the bus and the many difficulties that it has to go through. I also enjoyed the start and ending to the film as this keeps the pace of the story even, and very much in the balance as to whether the good guys or bad guys will win. Then you have the many action scenes that are incorporated into Speed' by stunt coordinator, Gary Hymes. All of the bus scenes are well executed, with the jump scene exceptional. I also like the subway chase and the elevator drop, as they all look and felt believable. Having a movie with a name such as Speed', it would be fair to assume that it will have a fast pace and action stunts that will blow you away', which indeed it does. Yet with big names such as Hopper, Reeves and Bullock, Speed' was never going to fail. However, I feel most of the credit for its success must sit with Jan De Bont, whose choice as director was a big gamble that paid off. Finally, I want to mention what a big flop that Speed 2: Cruise Control' was. If there was ever a sequel that should never have been made, it has to be Speed 2. So if you are looking for an exhilarating cinematic joyride, then you can not go past watching Speed'.CMRS gives Speed': 5 (Brilliant Film)",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
The Matrix," The future will not be user friendly
","With dazzling special effects, great cast and intriguing story, 1999's 'The matrix' is a fantastic movie, with a huge following around the world. This film has started a number of movies to follow the similar sorts of formula, some succeeding and some not. However, the Matrix is a film that many people keep returning too, saying that it is what they expect, when it comes to special effects. Who I am to disagree?Reality: That world is a hoax, an elaborate deception spun by all-powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us. Whoa. Mind-warp stunts. Techno-slammin visuals. Mega-kick action. Morpheus and Neo (the 'one') lead the fight to free humankind in The Matrix, the see-and-see-again cyberthriller written and directed by the Wachowski brothers. The story sears, the special effects stake out new moviemaking territory. The 'Matrix' rocks!Now I am one person who believes that special effects are only one small part of a movie, but when they enhance it, like they do in this film, then they are very special. There are so many scenes in the film that show the use of special effects, however I unsure which is the best one. Scenes such as the introduction into the world of the Matrix, the way Neo learns that he has special powers, the weapons that appear in one section of the film, the famous fighting scenes of Neo towards the end of film, where he dodges bullets are all memorable. But I am not going to say one is better than the other, as all are terrific.There are some fine actors taking on challenging roles in the Matrix. I have been a critic of main star Neo (Keanu Reeves), but in this film he suits the genre and is a fine looking man when finally gets used to the virtual-reality world of the Matrix. The supporting cast includes the Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), who makes the whole transition of the Matrix for Neo be as gentle as possible. I love the kung fu scene both Reeves and Fishburne share at about the halfway mark of the movie. The female member of the cast is a girl, who seems anything but a girl, that of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). She has complete admiration for Neo, realising that he is in for big things.Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) is one character that I am sure we are not able to distinguish as being either good or bad. Both Moss and Pantoliano were a part of 2000's fantastic movie, 'Memento'. Yet we do get to see the baddies which are part of the Matrix. Agent Smith (Australia's Hugo Weaving), is a real revelation as the 'bad guy' of the Matrix. His confrontation at the end of the movie with Neo is a big highlight of the film from my prospective.
The way the stunts were incorporated into the Matrix was terrific. This area of the movie must have taken along-time to organise, and is a great achievement by the actors, stunt doubles and the people working 'behind the scenes'. The costumes designed for the Matrix were also amazing. I love the slick black costumes that Neo, Morpheus and Trinity wear, while the bad agents all looked impressive in their suits. The great glasses worn by everyone in the film were also terrific, and made all these characters in the Matrix look 'cool'.The director/writers of the Matrix were the Wachowski brothers, who did a fine job in bringing through the other important aspects of the film, not only the great special effects. I believe they made the story genuinely interesting, via the screenplay, with the script having obvious religious reference through the entire film. They also allowed us to be introduced to the world of the Matrix extremely well. Their placement of a 'green tinge' to almost every scene in the movie is another small, but quite extraordinary feature.Look I am a fan of this movie, for all of its aspects, not just the special effects. But I can understand a person not being a fan of the Matrix, as they would expect a lot more of movie, than just great special effects. A detractor could say that the Matrix only has that feature. The matrix is such a positive movie for the Australian movie making industry, showing that special things can be done in this country. It was also great to see the locations of Sydney in the film. The Matrix DVD is one of the great DVDs going around, with heaps of special features unlocking the secrets of the film. I must also make mention of another movie like the Matrix, that of the David Cronenberg's masterpiece 'eXistenZ'. If it was not for this film, I have no doubt that 'eXistenZ' would be an even greater movie than it is. So with the two Matrix sequels coming up 'back to back' in 2003, here will be three films that I feel will go down as a part of 'cinema history'.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Movies don't come any better than this!
","Star Wars  Episode IV  a new hope, would have to be one of the world's most popular movies, withstanding the test of time and coming up against some great competition. This might be a video-game that has come to life, but what is the problem with that, it was a well made movie, considering it was done way back in 1977. Luke Skywalker, an impulsive but goodhearted young man receives a distressing message from Princess Leia in one of his androids, R2-D2, which sends him out to find Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi, a mysterious old hermit with incredible powers. On his journey, Luke is aided by the roguish, sarcastic mercenary Han Solo and his towering furry sidekick Chewbacca, as they run into a host of perilous situations while trying to rescue the princess, and the entire galaxy from the fearsome character of the eternally frightful Darth Vader.This movie has some terrific scenes in it. I think the best scene would have to be the Light saver fighting between Obi-wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, which was an exciting scene. However there are other scenes, including the ship fighting between the Rebels and the Dark side, which are great, as is the destruction of the Death Star. In addition all the amazing creatures that are used in this movie make it all the better and more enjoyable.The cast of Star Wars is first class. Luke Skywalker is played the now famous Mark Hamill. He was a refreshing young actor in this role and he only gets better and better in the following movies. The role of Princess Leia was portrayed by the beautiful Carrie Fisher. I enjoyed her minor role in the comedy film HEARTbreakers. Han Solo is a very aggressive character and is well acted by movie legend Harrison Ford. He was excellent in the movies that sort of off-set stars wars, that being the Indiana Jones series. Obiwan Kenobi was a performed by Alec Guinness. I enjoyed his small role, with his character having much knowledge and experience to pass on to a young Luke Skywalker. The mechanical side of Star wars is a very enjoyable part of this film. R2D2 and C3PO are very simple characters, yet they also have a very complex side. I love how the audience can laugh at the antics of the two droids, but can also be hoping that the two can help save the day. The evil character of Darth Vader was also great, with the heavy breathing evil leader an obvious favourite for some die hard Star Wars fans. I must also mention the good work of composer John Williams. His impressive musical composition for Star Wars is very well known and helps make it all the more memorable. It is easy to see why he went on to compose for movies like Superman, ET  The Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, Stepmom and the scary theme for 'Jaws'. I feel he made the score for this movie just right.So with all that in mind, Star Wars is one of the great movies of our time, I can not praise it enough. With many films and TV shows trying to cash on its success, it still beats them hands down. I am not sure whether this film is the best of the trilogy, but not to matter, it is still a great opportunity to sit down, relax and enjoy a sciencefiction classic.May the force be with youCMRS gives 'Star Wars: A New Hope': 5 (Brilliant Film)",Null,0,0,18 April 2002
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Drink From Me And Live Forever.
","Having learned a little bit about what might be like to be a vampire(through my readings, and in a fictitious sense), finally I have had the chance to see what the movie Interview with the vampire' was like. As I kept watching it, I found myself liking it more and more. It had a very intelligent story, a great cast and gory scenes where human blood was the main menu for our blood-thirsty characters. Vampires might be complex people, but in this movie they are also intriguing and fascinating creatures.The undead are among us and livelier than ever, in this spellbinding screen adaptation of Anne Rice's best seller. Louis is lured by the charismatic vampire Lestat into the immortality of the damned, then tormented by an unalterable fact of vampire life: to survive, he must kill. Interview with the Vampire offers enough thrills, shocks and fiendish fun to last a lifetime... and beyond. What a sheer delight it was to watch this movie. Now you might find that comment a little bit hard to understand, considering the topic that the movie is covering, but I found myself really consumed by the story of the film. Based on Anne Rice's best selling novel, the story is brought extremely well to the screen by the screenwriter, director, cinematographer, and the actors. Director Neil Jordan did a fine job in creating an eerie kind of existence for the vampires in the movie and also does justice to an incredible story.The screenplay was written by Anne Rice, and I am certain that she would have put all the vital aspects of her book within the screenplay. The part I love about the story the most, is the way the we get it told by one of the main characters, Louis Pointe du lac, as he is being interviewed by a reporter (Christian Slater). It is also interesting to see a vampire story that shows how important it is that these people really need a family to feel happy, not unlike us mortals, is it?The cast of this film is also of the finest quality. Tom Cruise proves why he is such a great actor in his role of Lestat de Lioncourt. He is a really impressive vampire, with his character's subtle humour a real highlight. Lestat makes a vampire out of Louis Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who is as equally as good as Cruise. I really like how his character shows that he is extremely uncomfortable in the immortal phase of being a vampire'. The way Pitt tells the story was really interesting. I am glad I have found roles that Cruise and Pitt were good in, as I have had mixed feelings towards both of them as actors in the past. Their performances in this film have in some way vindicated themselves to me.Yet the actor that was the best from my prospective is the very young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). She is a real revelation as the old vampire that never ages. I mean however young Dunst was when she played this role (12 I have heard), she did a remarkable job in such a complex role. She reminds very much of what Haley Joel Osment was like in The Sixth Sense'. Having had a mixed opinion about her career in the last 12 months or so, it is great to see that she got it off to a good start. I also liked the vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas), and although he had a small role, he was still very affective.The people behind the scenes of IWTV' also need to be commended. The make-up department, headed by Stan Winston (with Michelle Burke) did a remarkable job with the actors playing vampires in the film. Cruise, Pitt and Dunst all were enhanced by make-up, which made them look all so wicked and evil. The cinematographer, Philippe Rousselot and production designer, Dante Ferretti, both did amazing jobs in this film. The look of the story being retold was terrific, as it had the feel of something like Sleepy Hollow'. This was due mainly to the way the camera looked at the many things, especially the way these vampires act in the world with normal humans, and how depressing it could be, to be a vampire.I really am kicking myself, considering that this movie was made 9 years ago, and I have only watched it now, which is almost criminal. I believe that Anne Rice's book Interview with the vampire' would have to be a great read and I might try and get around to reading it, as I do have one of my own vampire novel, that was a really good read. I especially like the conclusion to this movie, as it is not only satisfying, but surprising as well. The main reason for watching this film was so I could get to see 2002's big hit Queen of the Damned', a film that is once again based on Anne Rice's story and looks into the extraordinary world of vampires. I have seen QOTD', and to tell you the truth, it was a terrible movie, nothing like this one. It is well done to all involved with this film and it has become part of my growing movie collection.CMRS gives Interview with the vampire': 5 (Brilliant Film)",10,1,2,13 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The saga continues. This is the best Star Wars movie in the trilogy.
","After 23 years, and now available to watch in 'Special Edition', the way it supposed to be, George Luca's 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best Star Wars film of the trilogy. I believe this because it has great thrills and tension, and some very funny and humorous moments. But best of all, this part of the Star Wars epic continues on the fantasy that I loved to escape as a child, and I still can now as an adult.The battle to save the galaxy from the evil Empire rages on as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca face attack by the Imperial forces While Han and Leia escape, Luke sets off to Dagobah in search of Jedi Master, Yoda. Only with the Jedi Master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the force beckons him into a life or death duel with the fearsome Darth Vader.The screenplay to this part in the Star Wars puzzle was very good indeed. It was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. The best aspect of the screenplay has to be the raw emotion that it presents. Not many Sci-fi movies can boast having this in their story, but ESB has.It does so through, the relationship of Luke and Yoda, Han and Leia's and through Luke and Darth Vader's confrontation. Yet the story also encapsulates some very funny humour, between Han Solo and Princess Leia, and R2D2 and C3PO. These characters are very funny for the best part of the film. Yet the battle between the Good and Dark sides of the force, continues to make the story very entertaining. Both Leigh and Lawrence do justice to the story that Lucas had created for ESB.Although George Lucas was only the executive producer of ESB, you can still fill the Lucas presence on the film. Director of ESB was a man by the name of Irvin Kershener. I have learnt that this film helped to keep his career on track. I love the way that Irvin made this movie seem like such a thrilling joyride, an area that a fan like me, believes all these films need to be successful. He also allowed us to see very closely what each individual battle was like and gave insight into most confrontations or relationships. It was a very balanced and professional performance from Kershener.In this part of the Star Wars story, Luke Skywalker (performed well by Mark Hamill) is a young space fighter, who believes with no doubt that he will be a Jedi. To be sure, Luke travels to meet with Yoda, Jedi master (Frank Oz). The way that we see Luke and Yoda, during Luke's training to prove that he is a Jedi, is a very touching moment in the entire film. Yoda is a creature that was created by Oz and Lucas, to seem 'real' and that is what I feel he was. Movie critic Roger Ebert said that 'Yoda may actually give the best performance in the movie', and I totally agree.The other good characters include Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the robot droids R2D2 (Kenny Baker) and C3PO (Anthony Daniels). Han and Leia, continue to say that they are not in love with each other, when everything points to that being the case. Their characters have a great amount of sexual tension and innuendo, a real highlight for me. However supposed friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) betrays Han and his friends, handing them over to the dark side of the force.Yet the continuation of the humorous droids is still as funny as ever in my view. R2D2 is a feisty little robot, who can do breathtaking things. But by looking at him, you would think he just another useless piece of space. He has a constant companion in C3PO, who always seems pretty reserved and tentative when he sees R2D2 doing something dangerous. Most of the responses from C3PO are classic.The dark side of the force still has a great effect on me, when I come to watching this film. The powerful person on the force is Darth Vader (body by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). Vader in this film shows how cruel, evil, harsh, hateful and driven he is. There are many moments where generals and commanders fail Vader, with the consequence of this not that pleasant. Vader is also another of my all-time favourite Star Wars characters.There are many moments I liked in ESB. The start of the film is wonderful, as we see Luke in major trouble with a scary ice monster. Then Luke and the rebellion have a grand battle with the enemy, which I still find to be entertaining. Then when the battle turns to open space, it is just as exciting, as I start to feel like I want to be in a space ship and give all I have got, to defend the honour of good side of the force. Finally the conclusion of the film is terrific. Firstly, we see Han Solo given a rather unpleasant and creepy demise that certainly upsets Chewy. Then the finale, with Luke battling Vader was marvelous, as we learn through the battle that not all is as Luke seems.In closing, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is one of the great sci-fi movies we have seen. Star Wars may have started it, but ESB certainly continues it in a very great and grand way.  This film also gets me very emotional, which just goes to show how passionate I am about these films. With these films now given to us in Special Edition, the way they were supposed to be, it is a great treat for all the fans. This is one of the best movie sequels the world has had the privilege to see and no-one will change mind about that.

Braveheart," His passion captivated a woman. His courage inspired a country. His heart defied a king. This is Mel Gibson's brilliant epic movie.
","Mel Gibson's Braveheart', is a movie that I feel inspired by every time I watch it. William Wallace certainly was a man that was driven by all sorts of emotions, a man who loved the women in his life, was forced in the end to fight for country, but did it in a grand style and was never intimidated by his enemy, that being the English, his only goal, for Scottish FREEDOM!' Braveheart is a rich, emotionally charged historical epic filled with passion, betrayal and courage, one that is too savour.Braveheart is the sweeping saga about Scotland's brutal battle for impendence in the 13th century. When William Wallace's wife is ravaged and murdered by English troops, his quest for revenge quickly turns into an impassioned fight for his country. Tales of Wallace's bravery inspire every commoner to take arms against the English and escalate their crusade into a full scale war. Firstly I want to praise Mel Gibson for the work he put into making this movie. His vision as director was first-class and gave the movie a grandness' that it deserved. It is also a great achievement for Gibson to star in the movie, playing the integral character of Wallace, a difficult role. For his direction of Braveheart, Mel won the 1995 academy award for best director. Under Gibson was Academy Award winning cinematographer John Toll, who certainly gave Braveheart' the right look onscreen. The camera shots of the open plans, were just fantastic, and made the Scottish land look green, lush and rugged. The one that one that sticks in my mind the most, has to be the moment in the film which shows William Wallace climbing to the top of a mountain, what we see as this unfolds, really did stun me, but in a good way. The story contains characters that I am unsure are fact or fiction. But whatever they are, were very convincing onscreen. William Wallace, aka Braveheart' (Gibson) is a man that is shook up as a child by the disturbing visions he sees happens to his people, especially his father Malcolm Wallace (Sean Lawlor). We see quite quickly that Wallace as a man, was born to fight, with a dead eye' when it comes to throwing with any sort of stone. Gibson is terrific in his role here, playing it with grandeur, flamboyance, style and slight humour that suits the film. Braveheart' also looks intense, with the blue paint draped across his face. Yet Wallace did not want to fight. He marries his childhood love, the beautiful Murron (Catherine McCormack) that he weds in secret. However there life together would be cut short by the warriors of the king of England, who capture, violate and kill Murron for not submitting to their desires. This death was hard for me to watch, but without it, we would not have the rest of the film. The small role that McCormack plays in the film is vital, as she softens the brutalness of war onscreen.     After this event, Wallace is filled with raged and turns on all the English troops. Helping Wallace was his friend Hamish (Brendan Gleeson), a brute of a guy that is the size of two warriors, who never at any stage, takes a backward steps in the war. While Robert the Bruce (Angus McFadyen) is a very interesting character, a guy who you think you know, but then surprises you.
On the English side, the enemy that Wallace wants to defeat, is King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan), or longshanks' as he is referred to. He is a very aggressive type of king, when in a fit of rage throws a friend of the Prince of Wales (Peter Hanly), out a high rise window, as he has no time to listen to this inferior sort of person. McGoohan is a nasty king and does not like what Wallace is achieving by the war. His son is a weakling, so afraid of what he is seeing take place. The Prince was arranged in marriage to a French woman, for political reasons. Her name is Princess Isabella (Sophie Marceau) a beautiful woman, who is used to try and bribe Wallace to stop the war. He immediately picks up that she is attracted to him. The Princess hates her husband, but is truly in love with Wallace. When Wallace is close to death, the Princess tries to help him handle the ordeal. Marceau is great in this role as she is nice to look at and convincing in her role. I love all the battle scenes in Braveheart', as they are filmed in a big and bold way by Gibson. That is not to say they are easy to watch. The first battle at death of Braveheart's wife is tough to watch. Yet there were times I was laughing (unintentionally) as the English were frightened for their lives at the sight of Braveheart' and his men. The major war scenes are great, but also leave nothing to the imagination, as we see arrows, swords and axes wounding and killing many men on both sides. 
The music to Braveheart was another important element, as it gave the correct Scottish feel to the film. The composer on Braveheart was James Horner, whose music gives the film true emotion when it needs it. The bagpipes are used in a very effective way here especially.Mel Gibson is currently in the spotlight with his movie The Passion of The Christ'. I felt I would prepare myself for that movie by going back and watching this film and I am glad that I did. The resemblance that this film has with the story of Jesus is amazing. Braveheart' is the ultimate Hollywood movie experience, a most powerful film, made by a man with a passion, about a man with an intense passion, who was willing enough to sacrifice himself in order that his country could have freedom. What a sacrifice it was too! CMRS gives Braveheart': 5 (Brilliant Film)",Null,0,2,29 April 2004
Back to the Future," What if ... you could travel through time? Well now you can, when you watch this timeless movie ride back into the past and the future!
","I am sure at one stage or another that your parents would have said to you `I was young once to you know!' Yet for some reason we all find it hard to believe that our parents were once teenagers. In the 1985 classic 'Back To The Future', young Marty McFly gets the chance to experience what time travel is, how different his home town is in the '50s and also what his parents were like as teenagers.The year is 1985 - but not for long. Because teenager Marty McFly is about to be blasted back to 1955 aboard the plutonium powered DeLorean created by eccentric genius Doctor Emmett Brown. But when Marty accidentally keeps his parents-to-be from falling in love, it triggers a time shattering chain reaction that could vapourise his future - and leave him in the past! Now, Marty's only hope is to change history - before the clock runs out on his one-in-a-million chance to get himself Back To The Future!This film is incredibly clever in what it portrays. Its story is unique, original and different to the common time travel theme. The story for BTTF was written by Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis. Bob Gale one day wondered if he would have been friends with his father as a teenager, when he was a teenager. With that in mind the pair went about writing a script that had the element within it. Their comedic touch was exceptional, yet this story has many elements that make it very complex. The change that had to happen when Marty goes from 1985 back to 1955 is of major importance to the story or the whole project would have been a failure. It is no wonder that both men got an academy award nomination for their most intelligent script.Bob Zemeckis was coming off his success of 'Romancing the Stone' (1984) when he took on directing BTTF. His grand vision for this project made it the great success that it still remains today.  It was of great significance that Bob had Steven Spielberg as Executive Producer of BTTF. I am not surprised, as this movie would have been right up his alley. Spielberg had a busy time in the summer of '85 when BTTF was released, with another of his productions being released at the same time including the classic kids adventure, 'The Goonies'.The cast for this film was well chosen and acted. Michael J. Fox had a big work load when he took on the role of Marty McFly, as he was simultaneously doing the TV show 'Family Ties' as well. He was working days lasting 18 -20 hours. Taking that into consideration, it is the most professional performance from Fox. His character takes on so much, but Fox's performance is flawless. Fox also showed how versatile an actor he really was, learning how to use a skate board and showing off his guitar skills as well. Then there was Christopher Lloyd who was perfect as the nutty professor Doc Brown. Lloyd had a two dimensional role in BTTF which was entertaining to say the least. Marty is warned by his nemesis school teacher Mr. Strickland (James Tolkin) to stay away from the good Doctor, as he is 'Dangerous, a nutcase and will get him into big trouble'. This warning turns out to be so true.Other notable cast members include Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and George McFly (Crispin Glover) who play Marty's wacky parents. There roles called for them to be transformed into older people via the use of make-up. I like what they did for the movie, as their performances had to be different for each new part to the film. Marty's siblings include Dave (Superman star Marc McClure) and Linda (Wendie Jo Sperber), while Marty has a gorgeous girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells). I also like the bad characters in BTTF. They include people such as Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is a mean guy for the majority of the film, and picks on poor George McFly. It is fascinating to see George's son stick up for himself against a much younger Biff.  One of Biff's sidekicks happens to be a guy named Match (Billy Zane). In fact, this was Billy's first ever movie role. Bigger things were going to come for him in the future. Ironic?The idea of time travel must have been a difficult to bring to life on a production such as this. Zemeckis toyed with the idea that a refrigerator could be used as the transporter through time, but he was afraid that young children might try and hop in their own fridge and get trapped. So he decided to use a car, which was a good choice. Having it be as unique a car as the DeLorean was excellent, as the car has funny doors and looks some-what futuristic. This movie is also clever in the way that it shows what an experience time-travel might be like. What can happen to your transportation and the way you are transported, are captured beautifully in BTTF.This film is a lot of fun that the whole family can enjoy, whether it is Mum, Dad or the kids. I am not sure what genre to call it, perhaps a 'teen, family, sci-fi, coming of age, adventure story'. It is also a movie that gives hope to its viewers. I believe it is saying 'what has happened in the past or right now, might not happen in the future', which is a good a message for the many different people that watch it.  This movie has an incredibly good soundtrack (with Huey Lewis and the News smash hit - 'Power of love') and if you have access to DVDs, take a look at the 'Back To The Future' trilogy DVD, as it is one impressive pack.CMRS gives 'Back To The Future': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)",Null,0,1,16 January 2003
Jurassic Park," Spielberg and his team have made one fearsome and mesmerising movie.
","When I was told about the greatness of the 'dinosaurs' as a young child back in primary school, I had a complete fasciation with some of God's most powerful creatures. Dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus Rex have their own strange and unique characteristics which make them so interesting to learn about. So when I heard that Hollywood was making a movie on Dinosaurs titled 'Jurassic Park', I was truly excited. This film gives life back to creatures I wish I could have seen in the flesh.One of mankind's most thrilling fantasies has come true, an astonishing technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA has been discovered. With this discovery we get 'Jurassic Park', a remote island theme park, with actual living dinosaurs. The only problem is, it is about to turn deadly as five people, including two palaeontologists, must battle to survive among these prehistoric predators.Steven Spielberg has made a film full of terror and scary creatures. I like how the film opens, as it gives us as the audience a chance to see what it is that man has created, and that it might not be the best investment to be involved with. The only problem I have with Spielberg's vision for 'Jurassic park' is the ending. Learning that he thought it up, I feel is a little corny and is too easy an escape for our characters, considering what they have escaped from before all this. Yet Spielberg did a great job in giving us a look at the wonder and/or scariness of the dinosaurs, as I believe I was moved almost every time I saw a scene with a dinosaur.
This was definitely helped by the team that created these dinosaurs for Spielberg. The special effects are terrific, as the dinosaurs seem real and alive in this film. In the last few weeks I have seen films from a similar time as Jurassic Park, and the special effects were appalling. Now they were going to either make or break this film. Thankfully they were good enough to make this film. The dinosaur special effects were very well done by Stan Winston, Dennis Muren, Phill Tippett and Michael Lanteri.The screen play was the inspiration of novelist Michael Crichton and David Koepp (from MI and MI2). The story to the film is taken from Crichton's novel on the same material. Although some of the character creations for the screenplay might be a little weak, the story is very interesting to see asit unfolds, as the dinosaurs get into a very powerful position.
At the forefront of the movie are palaeontologists and dinosaur experts Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Fern). They are convinced to come and evaluate a new 'family centric' park with living dinosaurs. The owner of the park is millionaire Dr. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). The pair are initially overawed by what they see at the park. Neill and Fern are good in what they bring to the film, with Neill the standout, bringing a calmness and sensibility to his character, which keeps everybody from breaking down in many crisis situations.Attenborough's character could have been better, as it is very strange how he reacts to the situation that he sees 'Jurassic park' in. The two young grandchildren of Hammond, Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) are very good, as they make us feel emotion for their many dangerous situations we see them in.Yet the rest of the cast cannot get the same credit. Firstly you have a mathematician along for the joy ride here, his name is Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is only ever placed in the screenplay for some funny and some stupid lines. Then Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is one of the computer experts, in charge of running Jurassic Park's main working centre. Now unfortunately Knight is not a good character here, as his storyline lacks in sense and does not add to the film, although it could have. If he got away with what he stole it would have been very interesting.
The film has some very memorable moments. When the character's meet the many different dinosaurs, they truly have a sense of grandeur and amazement. The running herd of dinosaurs are wonderful, as they are very alive and it would be a dream to meet such a flock of animals. All the moments with T-Rex are terrifying, such as when the park shuts down and the two kids are attacked in their vehicle. The lawyer in the car makes a rather selfish and crazy choice. The kids also have a fascinating sequence, where they play hide and seek with two smaller dinosaurs in the park's kitchen.The musical score to Jurassic Park is another of the film's highlights. Composed by the greatest movie composer ever, John Williams, the score gives the movie an awesome feel when it requires it. Then in an instant changes a scene to make the film seem terrifying. When a musical score does this to a film, it is hard not to be affected, as I know I was.Steven Spielberg has been involved with some very impressive movie creatures, such as the scary shark 'Jaws', the very unique alien 'E.T', and of course the gruesome little buggers known as 'Gremlins', creatures that love to cause havoc. Now Spielberg has tinkered with Dinosaurs, awesome creatures that are very violent and destructive.Jurassic Park is a film that only confirms in my mind that dinosaurs are not meant to be played around with and shows what happens when man starts to play God. He soon realises that it is an area that he has no right to deal with. I like this film as I was entertained by the story, love the historical ideas that are presented by the dinosaurs and how man should only remember what Dinosaurs were like, as living with them in today's world could be catastrophic.
