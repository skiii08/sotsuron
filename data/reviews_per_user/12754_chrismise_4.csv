Blade Runner 2049," How to ruim a great original
","Everything that the original was, this sequel isn't. 
Great visuals? Not close. 
Great casting? No, it lacks the strong characters from first movie. And good actors, Harrison Ford and the girl from San Junipero are the only exception. Ryan Boring is meh. Jared Leto, no thanks. 
Intelligent dialogs? No. 
Great Soundtrack? No, not here.
Plus this movie is extreme SEXIST. I guess the high score is only because of all the unecessary female nudity, only explanation.",2,3,6,4 May 2018
Sucker Punch," Underrated
","The Directors Cut version reveal much more details about the story. Dont know why they didnt made to the final cut cause was important to the understanding of the whole story. The idea dance to escape realitty, with kick ass imaginary fights is amazing. Strong female characters plus the super hot Oscar Issac.",10,2,4,17 February 2018
The Shape of Water," Amelie Poulain meets Avatar
","This movie steal too many elements from Amelie Poulain: protagonist, mood, colors even that painter friend that help her. The monster on the plot fails to deliver at least something unique. If it was a black protagonist it would made more sense in the context and bring an interesting change",4,5,21,13 February 2018
Annihilation," Weird sci fi(in a good way)
","My considerations about the casting. Natalia and Oscar are amazing, but together i fell no chemistry between then. And his tattoo is really bad designed, like a tribal from 90.Now, the plot. Annihilation is a surreal sci fi, it ends with lots of questions( and i've been told that the books are any better) But for me works great, weird possibilities that got me really scaried and regret watch if alone at night.It begin a bit slow, i almost give up. but one they enter the shimmer it gets more interesting.I think its not the true vision of alex, maybe the studio interfere to much because Ex Machina is so much better, but still worth it.",7,3,7,13 March 2018
