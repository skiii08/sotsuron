The Lobster," The Lobster - Movie Review
","Loner Leader: 'We dance alone. That's why we only play electronic music'.The Lobster takes place in a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.The Lobster is a film that's both strange and completely bizarre, but rather brilliant as well. It's one of those movies that's so different with it's story and visuals that it's quite intriguing to watch. The cinematography was tremendous and the movie isn't predicable, as many times it takes a different turn for the best. Yorgos Lanthimos knows what he's doing and I can tell what he was going for when it came to the self aware moments. Every choice Lanthimos made in this movie when it came to the acting was done on purpose, as it fitted well in this unusual world that these people lived in. The movie isn't not for everyone (or just like every movie I like), but hey, everyone is different.",9,2,8,9 February 2016
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not as good as Catching Fire.
","Remember Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, were nothing really exciting happens in that movie, and the movie has a slow paste run time and they try to save the all the exciting and awesome parts in part 2, and now we got Mockingjay and I can happily say that Mockingjay is a little better than Deathly Hallows Part 1, but it does lack of the two parter thing and this movie is not near from perfect.Mockingjay Part 1 continues the story has Katniss Everdeen along with Peeta Mellark, and a handful of other survivors, have successfully escaped the Quarterquell thanks to helps from Haymitch Abernathy and former game master Plutarch Heavensbee. But escaping is just the start, as Katniss finds herself having to embrace the symbol she has become to the people of Panem - a symbol of rebellion against President Snow and the autocratic Capitol. I was really looking forward to Mockingjay, because I thought the squeal (Catching Fire) was a big improvement and just overall a better movie then the first one. The trailer to Mockingjay won me over by it's excellent tone and it's brilliant shots, and I was actually counting down the days for the movie release, but now after seeing the film I got to say.... I'm a bit disappointing. Now let me get something out there, I don't hate this movie, I just think it's really disappointing for and please don't hate me for this.Let's start off with the good things in this movie: Jennifer Lawrence was just flawless in this movie and now every time I see her in interviews or new movies I straight away like her as a person and as a actress. Rest of the cast did good as well. The movie had that Apocalypse settings to it and it suited the tone of the film and I'm just happy they got that right.Now for the things that did not work at all and came off messy: The fact that this is a two parter really spoils the film for me, because without giving away anything, but basically this movie is just a set up for the next film and sometimes movies can pull that off, but when the the second part comes out not a lot really of people won't be talking about part 1 anymore, just like Harry Potter and I know I keep bring up Potter a lot but it's really hard not to.The movies pasting is like watching a snail starting walking to point A to point B, that's the movies paste right there. The movie really wants me to care about the character's and the character's may not be boring, but there not really that interesting to me. Overall Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 feels less then a stand alone film, but more of a cash grab and I hate saying that because I really wanted to like this and I trying my damn best, but I'm sorry for letting you all down but this movie was a disappointing to me and saying that sucks.",5,6,18,26 November 2014
John Wick," Awesome movie
","Three things you shouldn't do to a bad-ass:1. Ruining his life 2. Kill he's family 3. Push him till he snapsThe story is about ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him.When I first heard the news that this movie was getting made and the face that two directors that never directed anything before I thought it was going to be a load of crap, but it turns out I was wrong and this movie is awesome.Keanu Reeves is simple at his best here, even if he's not the greatest actor on the planet, he does try every role and in this movie he does. The directors of the film David Leitch and Chad Stahelski both do a excellent and fantastic job of directing this movie and I found out that these two are actually stunt men. The villain was good, the action scenes were shot perfectly. Towards the end of the movie felt a bit cliché for me. You know in every action movie that the main hero is facing off the main bad guy and they shouting out one liners at each other, you know what I mean and that to me felt like the writer's got lazy half way through.John Wick has to be the biggest surprise for me with it's intelligent writing and nail biting action scenes.",7,12,29,12 November 2014
Chinatown," No wonder this movie is a classic
","Ida Sessions: 'Are you alone?'J.J. Gittes: 'Isn't everybody?'The story to Chinatown is about a private detective, Jake Gittes, hired to investigate an adultery case, stumbles on the plot of a murder involving incest and the privatization of water through state and municipal corruption, land use and real estate. If he doesn't drop the case at once he faces threats of legal action, but he pursues it anyway, slowly uncovering a vast conspiracy.Some people may not know but I got a lot of things to do and those things are reviewing 8 Movies, three TV shows and two video games so basically that's why I'm a bit behind of the new releases. Then and now I have to take a little break or a day off from doing this because well I can be a bit tried of doing this, but I still have fun reviewing and I'm extremely proud to be talking about the great classics and the new films, TV shows and games that come out. Speaking of cult classics, Chinatown was on top of my list to watch next, because I heard nothing but amazing things about this movie and after watching it I can agree that this movie was outstanding.Jack Nicholson is now known as the single best actor of all time just like Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and in this movie his talent dose shine in this movie. He played his so well that I actually didn't fully hate him because in the movie his character is kind of a A-hole but I didn't hate him, if a different director took the director chair and directed the movie differently then maybe I would have dislike him. Jack Nicholson did probably his 4th best performance that I've seen from him.The movie is filled with lines that I won't lie but the lines have stuck with me after the movie was over and I got to give the writers credit for that. The music in this movie has that smooth jazzy beat to it and that totally fitted the movie so well. The cinematography in this movie was shot beautifully and just perfection with it's open and normal shots.For problems I don't really have any problems to be honest. I didn't find a single thing that I dislike or bothered me, no wonder it's classic.",10,0,1,1 March 2015
Fury," Wardaddy: 'Best job I ever had!'
","If war every had a face it will be ugly.The story is about a battled-hardened sergeant, Wardaddy, commands a Sherman tank and five-man crew, aiming for the heart of Germany despite being out-manned, out-gunned and fielding a rookie recruit.Fury is a movie that shows what it needs to show, not like other war movies and that is it shows the brutal and hard things in war and how it effect's people, because Fury in opinion is the war film that get's it right just like Saving private Ryan and I'm not even joking.The good things in the movie: The sound in this movie when the bombs are going off or they are having a shoot out scene, it sounds so real and so in your hears loud I got to give the guy who did the sound in this movie a thumps up for that. Brad Pitt in this movie played the broken but still caring Wardaddy, you can see all the pain and stress in his eyes as he has been through wars that will scar a person for life. Logan Lerman did a good job ass well. He was great in this movie better than those Percy Jackson films. But they is this one actor in this movie that I've got to say that this is best performance yet, and that is Shia LaBeouf, yes he may went crazy last year and early this year, but in this movie he did a fantastic job.The bad things in this movie: The character's in this at times can be likable, but at times they not. Towards the end of the movie I started not to care about them because in other scenes their where acting like bullies and ass-holes, and I know they been through a lot of hard times with war and losing people and stuff, but this is a war drama and when these character's are in danger in the battlefield I want them to die, that's a bad sign When a viewer like me want the main character's to die.But overall Fury is the most realist, brutal and hard hitting war drama that I've since Saving Private Ryan.",7,4,10,31 October 2014
12 Angry Men," Such a classic film.
","The power of movie dialogue really makes this movie a true classic.The story to 12 Angry Men is one man on a jury stands alone in a case in which most are initially convinced one way but one by one may be convinced another way.12 men in one room just talking about one murder case and them sharing they opinions if the person that may have committed murder is guilty or not, now many things here could have went wrong, you got to have the best writer, the best director and the best actors to make this movie work and it payed off so well and I think this is cinema's greatest risk of doing something new with the story, giving it a twist and a edge and 12 Angry Men paid off brilliantly.The acting from every singe actor in this movie all do realistic, believable, funny and serious performance's and they all add a lot of weight and drama to their character's. I wish I can bring up every single actors name in this cast but I'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and I can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but I can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure Oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. Nicely done fellas.Sidney Lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing I've seen from this guy. He really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.The characters in the movie (The Twelve Angry Men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. As a viewer myself I got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.For problems with the movie: I don't have any.Overall 12 Angry Men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. You haven't seen 12 Angry Men then I say go see it, it's worth your time.",10,0,1,22 May 2015
The Babadook," Better than Annabelle.
","Finally a good horror film with no annoying jump scares.When a disturbing storybook called 'The Babadook' turns up at their house, Samuel is convinced that the Babadook is the creature he's been dreaming about. His hallucinations spiral out of control, he becomes more unpredictable and violent. Amelia, genuinely frightened by her son's behavior, is forced to medicate him.They are so many bad horror films out there right now that I'm pretty tired and sick of seeing, but The Babadook is not like those films. This horror movie did something that Annabelle or Ouija couldn't do, and that is try to be original and scary.Babadook is a movie that got under my skin if I got to be honest. The chilling and uneasy atmosphere and it's sense of fear that this movie truly nails it for me and not like most horror films today that lost that sense fear and just allow on lazy Jump scars. The acting in this movie was so real and so top notch that I got to say that Essie Davis did excellent in this movie, even the little kid did good.The other thing that this movie get's right is the fact it says 'F'ck jump scares', and tries to scary the viewing auditions and not be throwing loud sounds to make some people jump a little bit, no it goes for the good old fashioned method of a good horror film and that is showing frighting images that will stick in your mind until the movie is over.My only problems with this movie is it's slow at the beginning and the ending to the movie was a bit ridiculous if I got to say.But overall The Babadook is more than you're cliché monster movie, it focus on doubt's and depression which made the movie even scary, because if you got doubt's and depression running throw your head and meanwhile there might be something out there after you and your kid then it can mess with your mind and cause terror.",7,10,22,4 November 2014
The Danish Girl," The Danish Girl - Movie Review
","Nice try Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hooper. I know for a fact that the two of you wanted a second Oscar so badly, so you made this movie, but this isn't fooling anyone.The Danish Girl is about a Danish artist, depicted her husband, Einer, as a female in one of her paintings. As the painting gains attention, Einer begins to transform as well - becoming more and more feminine until Einer becomes Lili Elbe - and becomes the first person to receive a male-to-female sex reassignment surgery. While Gerda is supportive, she comes to realize this change will prove a challenging ordeal to their relationship - even more so when Hans Axgil, an art dealer and old friend of Einer, comes into her life.Oscar bait movies like this really makes my skin crawl, because this movie literally ticks off ways of getting that Oscar and it's quite shocking how noticeable it is here. I really liked The King's Speech, I mean it's not for everyone but I thought it was a great movie and I couldn't wait to watch Tom Hooper's next film. Oh Hooper, what happened? I didn't care for Les Misérables and I sure didn't care for this movie. The Danish Girl sadly fails to deliver and everything feels so force. The emotions, the art and the story itself falls completely flat.What the hell happened to Tom Hooper? after he won that Oscar he really lost his touch. There's hidden greatness in this movie and Hooper could have easily taken a different path to make this movie great, but he doesn't do that here, but he intend plays it safe and makes everything feel so force with emotions that there's no emotional attachment. There were some well directed scenes in the movie and it is well shot, but I felt like the movie was missing something and that's me actually caring about whats going on. The movie itself wants me to care about whats going on with the characters, but the only one I really cared about or felt bad about is Alicia Vikander character. I miss the old Tom Hooper.Now I've got nothing against Eddie Redmayne as I think he's a talented guy, but he seriously needs to pick better roles in the future. He was absolutely awful in Jupiter Ascending and he sure wasn't good here. He's performance in this movie is what I call 'pretentious' and 'by the books Oscar bait'. The emotions were there but I just didn't feel it and how the execution could have been better. A role like this is not a easy challenge and this must have been tough for Eddie, I mean in recent interviews, he has said that the role has personally changed his way of seeing things with genders and trans gender people. He took a risk but it sadly didn't come together as promised. I swear, if Eddie Redmayne gets a second Oscar for this movie, I will be mad.Alicia Vikander was hands down the stand out of this movie. As I said before, I cared for her more than Redmayne character and that's saying a lot. Shes been not-stop impressing me this year and I can't wait to see more of her in future movies. She was brilliant in this movie as I really felt her struggle and her dealing to whats going on in her life is truly heartbreaking. She was without a doubt the best part of this movie and she did an magnificent performance.The cinematography was good, the style of the movie was neat, the score was pretty solid and that's really it.Overall The Danish Girl isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. This movies purpose of existing is just to win awards and nothing else.",5,6,14,26 December 2015
127 Hours," Scooby- Doo where are you?
","Aron Ralston: 'I'm in pretty deep dodo here.'The story is about a mountain climber becomes trapped under a boulder in a remote area near Moab, Utah, he must resort to extreme measures in order to survive.Danny Boyle once again proves that he is a fantastic director in this movie. The way he shots and show the trouble that are main character goes through, it's truly great. The cinematography in this movie took the wind out of me it's that brilliant. This is James Franco best role I've seen him. He made me care about his character and he almost made my cry a little a bit. My only nick picks with the film are the goofy scenes with the Scooby-Doo scene. I'm sorry but that scene came out of no where and lost the serious of the movie for me, and I no his seeing things because his losing a lot of blood and he's in a tight space, but still you can't help to ask 'What the hell was all that about?'. 127 hours is a excellent film with mind blowing camera work and one of the best directing I've seen since Spielberg.",9,0,1,24 October 2014
The Great Dictator," Let us all unite!
","The Great Dictator is about a poor barber is confused with the great Nazi dictator and is sent into his place, unknown to the dictator. When I look at comedy's today I see good work and overall a good comedy. But it will never be like Charles Chaplin the great dictator. This movie mixers comedy and drama together so perfectly nothing can top it. The globe scene, the train scene and the speech at the end which made me cry because how true it is and how much we need it to make the world a better place. Overall the great dictator is outstanding movie with a great story and a brilliant speech. Quote from Dictator of Tomania: 'I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!",10,3,5,28 September 2014
Spotlight," Spotlight - Movie Review
","Mitchell Garabedian: 'If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it'.Spotlight is about a Boston Globe investigates the local Catholic Archdiocese and uncovers secrets long buried - a massive cover-up of child molestation that shakes the foundations of the Catholic church to its coreSpotlight is a tremendous piece of film making that will make you go completely speechless with some of the scenes in this movie. Michael Keaton, Brian d'Arcy James and Rachel McAdams all gave superb performances, as it was both convincing and realistic with their reactions. But Mark Ruffalo was absolutely phenomenal in this movie and he stole the show. The director of this movie (Tom McCarthy) did the Adam Sandler film 'The Cobbler'. Now, let that sink in for a minute.",9,1,2,25 January 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," Anime never been seen before.
","This is going to be the strangers and the most weirdest thing I'm about to say but I wish Totoro was real so I can sleep one it's fury tummy, it just looks so comfortable.The story is about two young girls who find that their new country home is in a mystical forest inhabited by a menagerie of mystical creatures called Totoros. They befriend O Totoro, the biggest and eldest Totoro, who is also the king of the forest. As their girls' mother lies sick in the hospital, O Totoro brings the sisters on a magical adventure but also helps them to understand the realities of life. My Neighbor Totoro (or Tonari no Totoro ) is a anime film with: No scary monsters, no villains, no evil adults and not like the other three act structure, and that could surprise a lot of people who are expecting the same third act in animated movie. This movie was beyond loved for being the best animated film ever made and that's from die hard fans of Hayao Miyazaki and moviegoers everywhere, and I can see easily see why, because this movie in opinion is one of the most griping, beautiful and the most stunning anime that actually give me butterflies deep inside of movie, and that's rare for me.This may sound over the top or over doing it but I don't Hayao Miyazaki is a god of anime and storytelling to the big screen. I only seen some of Miyzaki films but after watching spirited Away and this movie I want to more of this guys work, I found out that Hayao Miyazaki last film was The Wind Rises which I need to watch sooner or late, but it's a same to hear that, but the good things must come to a end. I absolutely loved the animation in this film, I mean how can put it into words without messing up my words. It's better to watch and experience the creative animation standing out from any other animated films, and just let the wonderful character's that are fully of joy and life can easily win you over by the first sentence.For problems... I don't have any, yeah no problems with this film. I was glued in by the world that Miyazaki created. I was locked in from start till the very end.Overall My Neighbor Totoro is different and the film doesn't shy away from that, it's a brilliant film and it's more then a kids film even adults can dig this movie.",10,0,1,12 December 2014
Youth," Youth - Movie Review
","'Youth' is a visual beauty of a film, that's basically show and don't tell. This is the definition of art, with it's gorgeous cinematography and how the film explores love, humanity, wisdom and pain in it's main story. Michael Caine, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano and Harvey Keitel all give terrific performances.The movie dose have some pacing issues, as I felt like some scenes dragged out a little bit, but I'm not sure if that's done on purpose or by mistake since this movie is out of it's mind when it comes to it's style of film making. Some people may think that this movie is too pretentious (some of the reviews I've seen), but I didn't think it was and it didn't bother me that much.I highly recommend seeing 'Youth' if you like movies that are very dreamlike and focuses on it's visuals.",8,4,8,31 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight - Movie Review
","Major Marquis Warren: 'Move a little strange, you're gonna get a bullet. Not a warning, not a question...A bullet!'.The story is about a blizzards strands together a group of bounty hunters and ne'er-do-wells in a Wyoming cabin. But the small group is about to face a trail of betrayal and deception - and survival is certainly not guaranteed.So I've finally got a chance to watch The Hateful Eight and I thought it was great. Mr. Tarantino has done it again everyone and while I don't think it's he's best one (In my opinion) but I would be lying to myself and to you if I didn't say I was entertained. Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors working today and he hasn't lost his touch yet, because he's directing in this movie was both stylish and old school. What Tarantino dose so brilliantly well in his movies is not only the dialogue or the character's, but the influences from other movies that he loves, because he is one of the biggest movie buffs I've ever seen. In The Hateful Eight, Tarantino takes movies like: The Thing, Murder on the Orient Express and Clue, all in one movie but with a gory twist. Even with the trouble of making this movie (mostly the script being leaked online), Tarantino still manages to pull off one heck of a movie with top notch directing. There's a lot of big name actors in this movie and every single one of them shine in their roles. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins and Tim Roth were all phenomenal, but Samuel L. Jackson was freaking outstanding and completely stole the show. Now after thinking about it, every single character in this movie is a horrible person and just imagine how hard it would have been for any writer to make us find enjoyment in theses character's, but that's what Quentin Tarantino is always best at doing. Another thing that's worth bringing up is the score for this movie, as it's more than good, it's fantastic. Ennio Morricone is the master of music composers and he's score for this movie was freaking magnificent. After the movie was over I was humming the score, it was that good. I hope he wins Best Original Score at the Oscars, because he deserves it. The cinematography was amazing (whenever they're not in a room), it was engaging and the movie did grow on me after awhile. Now for the flaws: The character logic towards the end of the movie didn't really make that much sense to me, as it really detached from what the movie perfectly set up at the beginning, but that's just me.When Zoe Bell character says that Auckland is New Zealand's biggest city. Auckland didn't become New Zealand's largest city until the 1900s, surpassing Dunedin. There's many other historical errors in this movie.Overall The Hateful Eight is everything that you wanted in a Quentin Tarantino film. The dialogue was engaging, all of the performances were amazing and the score was just perfect.",8,4,13,4 February 2016
Black Mass," Depp was great, but the movie was blah
","Never spill the family secret.The story is about Whitey Bulger, brother of a state senator and the most infamous criminal in South Boston. Childhood friend John Connolly would become a leading figure in Boston's FBI office while Bulger become a figurehead in the Irish mob. When they connected, Connolly convinced Bulger to help take down the Italian mafia - but as things spiral out of control, Bulger finds himself as part of the FBI's Most Wanted.Ever since the first teaser trailer for Black Mass came out, I knew for a fact that Johnny Depp was back to his old roots and finally playing a character that wasn't Jack Sparrow. It looked gritty, sharp, brutal and totally refreshing to see Depp in this type of role. I was hyped as sh*t to see this movie and I couldn't wait to watch Johnny Depp's performance as Whitey Bulger.After finally seeing the movie I can say that Black Mass as a film was alright, but Johnny Depp's performance in this movie was freaking fantastic and he stole the whole show.The positives: This has to be Johnny Depp's best performance in years. I can best describe he's performance as darkly comical, frighting and really uncomfortable at times. That's the power and the weight Depp brought to this performance and he absolutely pulled it off. I'm so happy to see Johnny Depp giving a good performance that wasn't anything like Transcendence or The Lone Ranger. The cinematography in this movie was beautifully shot and the camera work used in the film was just stunning. Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton and Kevin Bacon gave a great performance in the movie.Now for the problems: The movie itself felt pretty empty and very hollow to me. There wasn't anything to latch on to since the movie doesn't have a protagonist or a character that you can relate to. Everyone is a villain.The dialogue in the movie wasn't that interesting and it was very hard for me to latch on. These a lot of police investigation in this movie that was actually documented and to me it wasn't very interesting and I wish that the movie focused a little more on Depp's character.Overall Black Mass has amazing cinematography, a great performance from Depp and good directing. But it isn't something that I'll be watching again anytime soon, because I can't see myself watching this movie again.",6,4,7,4 October 2015
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad - Movie Review
","Hey DC, are you trying to f**k this up on purpose? Seriously! What the hell is going on over there. 'Suicide Squad' was your chance to redeem yourself from the last critical failures. This movie should have been the one that saved DC and get it back on it's feet, but I guess not. I wanted this to be good or at least surprise me. There are some pros and plenty of cons in this. So lets kick it off. Will Smith and Viola Davis are easily the best parts of this movie. Smith brings the humility to his character and Davis brings the fear. Will Smith is the only character in this group that has any characterization as we get to know more about his past. Will Smith is basically playing Will Smith, but he was still good as the character. To be honest, I thought Voila Davis was more of a real threat then the actual threat itself. Margot Robbie was pretty good as Harley Quinn, but wasn't the show stealer as I thought she would be. She did a great job capturing the character and there was little peaks of humility as well. Her accent dose keep changing in a few scenes, but I can easily look pass that. I was one of those people who was against Jared Leto new look as the Joker. I know he's trying a different take on the character, but with all the stupid tattoo's all over him with the word 'damaged' on his forehead and the gangster grill teeth just wasn't the Joker. But I give Leto this, it's a bold move to take on the character after Ledger's unforgettable performance. I was being a bit too harsh at the time and Leto is a very method actor, so what's there's nothing to complain with the casting (besides the new look). After seeing the movie, Leto doesn't do a bad job as the Joker. He doesn't have that much screen time and every time he's on it screen, he kinda chews up the scenery. He was enjoyable to watch and I will make a full judgment when we have a movie where he has more screen time. Coming to think of it, The Joker should have been the main villain of the movie and not Enchantress (I'll get to her in a minute). Oh and I can't be the only one who thinks he looks like some manic you'll see in a Purge movie. Cara Delevingne not only gives the worst performance in the movie, but also the most laughable one as well. I mean, what is up with that hip moves and twirling her arms around? It's like the director gave up. Enchantress is right up there with Dr. Doom from 'Fant4stic' as the worst villain in comic book movie. Enchantress is the basic villain who wants to shoot a giant blue lazier in the sky to destroy the world. Oh and please stop it with the blue lazier thing, it's in every comic book movie now and it's so stupid. Here's my question: Why would you sent these crazy and dangerous people on a mission to stop Enchantress. Yeah I really hope that doesn't back fire at all. I mean sure, send a guy who calls himself Captain Boomerang who's an insane person that throws boomerangs that never comes back to him to save us from giant portals from other worlds. Is it because they are expendable? It would have made a lot more sense if Wonder Women or The Flash or just anyone with god like powers to go on this mission. This really is a suicide mission. The rest of the Squad members were pretty forgettable and just didn't do anything. Katana was just kinda there. Slipknot is in it for a few minutes. Killer Croc just stands around going 'mmmm' or 'yeah', they didn't do anything with that character. The third act was this gigantic action scene that takes place in the city and the scene itself was just a mess. It was so muddled together and the editing was so poor that it sadly did remind me of 'Fant4stic' climax. Some of the music choices didn't really fit well during a couple of scenes. It felt out of place and was only thrown at the last minute to make it a little light at heart. This is because of the heavy criticism for 'Batman V Superman' for being too dark. I think DC biggest problem is that they are literally rushing the movies out just to catch up with Marvel. Take your time DC. But of course, many will be angry that I said that and will go to terrifying lengths to defend it. Fan boys seem to choose to deny any flaws from these movies and praise it for it's non-existing efforts. I'm not a DC hater. I'm not a Marvel fan boy. I only want a freaking good movie, is that hard to ask for. Just because it tried something new doesn't always mean it will bring great results. Everyone has an opinion, that's a no-brainier. Agree or disagree, just please don't act like a cry baby when some has a different opinion to you. Overall rating: 'Suicide Squad' was a huge disappointment in a lackluster year for summer movies. The more I think about this, the more I hate it.",4,3,6,7 August 2016
Interstellar," Do not go gentle into that good night.
","Dr. Brand: 'Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light'.The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A space odyssey was his all time favorite film and he wanted to do a small tribute to his work in Nolan's next film, and then comes Interstellar a movie that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience.I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me. The visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since well 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won a Oscar for that.Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie, it's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it. My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's with a interesting story line that will keep you interested.",9,1,5,9 November 2014
American Sniper," Powerfully Intense.
","A film that's been nominated for best picture at the Oscars and also has a lot of controversy behind it, that's a lot to take in for a movie studio.American Sniper tell the story of Chris Kyle played by Bradley Cooper. Chris was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. But there was much more to this true American hero than his skill with a rifle. U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms. His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and, as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname 'Legend.' However, his reputation is also growing behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head and making him a prime target of insurgents. Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, becoming emblematic of the SEAL creed to 'leave no man behind.' But upon returning home, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.I remember a time where Clint Eastwood use to make pretty damn good movies. Unforgiven, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino and Mystic River. All these movie right there are one of his best, but for the last couple of years he's been making some bad or really boring movies that forgot about. Until American Sniper came out and at last his back on track of what made him good in the first place, because American Sniper is a great movie.Bradley Cooper in this movie dose a Oscar worthy performance and...wait a minute, his nominated for one. Now that's what I like to see. Cooper really played Chris Kyle so well that I think this is my favorite performance from him, because he got all the stress, all the hard work to protect his family & country and war itself effecting you from the people you killed, and Bradley Cooper got the character right and showed that he was only human.The directing from Client Eastwood was nothing but great. With his other films (And I'm talking about the bad ones) his movie always have this slow paste feel to them making it uninteresting, but with this it's always going and it never slows down. I'm not talking about the action that makes the movie more quick past, no I'm talking about the movie characters and it's sense of atmosphere of intense and quick reaction and that got my interested from start till finish, and that's brilliant film making by Client Eastwood.Now for the controversy of this movie: 2014 was the year for controversy and yet it's pretty pointless to start a controversy for this movie over a American hero who may have do some wrong things, but who hasn't in a war zone. The people who started the controversy is only advertising the movie more, I mean just look at the The Interview and how much people sawed that by all the controversy and almost the start of World War 3. The controversy for this movie is by Chris Kyle actions towards Muslims and how the movie adversest him has a perfect war hero, and that's just ridiculous to get all bitchy about. Chris Kyle probably did some bad things in the battlefield but he also did some good things that saved many solders lives. To those who's criticizing Chris is only adverting the movie more and everybody is going to watch the movie and you going to get a lot of hate for saying that.Now for problems: The films editing seem to past some important scenes in the movie and I'm not going to say what scenes I mean if I do then I must spoil some scenes. And that's it for problems.American Sniper is a excellent war movie that shows how brutal war is and how it can effect on people.",6,6,17,25 January 2015
Ant-Man," A solid superhero movie
","Scott Lang/Ant-Man: 'Hello. I'm Ant-Man. Haven't you heard of me? No, you wouldn't have heard of me'.The story to Ant-Man is about Scott Lang who has worked alongside his friend and mentor Dr. Hank Pym but has never truly asserted himself. Now, armed with a suit that shrinks him in size but greatly increases his strength, Lang, now dubbed Ant-Man, will have to find the hero inside himself in order to pull off a heist that may very well be the key to saving the world.The tiny superhero himself Ant-Man was originally going to be directed by the comedy genius himself Edgar Wright. Everyone and I do mean everyone was hyped about his next upcoming movie since this is the same guy who brought us such films as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. But one day we all got the sad news that Edgar left the protect due to Marvel and him not agreeing on each other. It was so disappointing because I wonder what the movie would be like if Edgar Wright directed it. The movie was originally going to come out in 2014 but got pushed to 2015 due to that big delay. Now after seeing the movie I was surprised of how fun it was and how it was a solid movie even with the behind the scenes problems it all payed well. Since Edgar was out we got another director that stepped in and that's Peyton Reed who did such movies like: Yes Man, The Break-up and Down with Love. I was a bit worried but at the same time a bit interested of what Peyton Reed will do with Edgar Wright source material and after seeing the movie I can safely say that Peyton Reed did a great job directing this movie. He directed the action scenes and the whole movie pretty well since he never directed action movies before and this is he's first time and he did it good. Nicely done Peyton Reed.I never thought that Paul Rudd would be great playing superhero character when he was cast as Ant-Man, but Paul Rudd absolutely nailed it as Ant-Man as he had the charm, the right set of humor to balance his character nicely and he was the perfect actor for this comedic character like Ant-Man.The humor in the movie are the basic Marvel humor that you always see in there movies. Edgar Wright also wrote the movie and at times I can tell what jokes and humor was his, but some other writers change a lot of the script (That's what I heard) adding some of the Avengers characters in the movie and at the end credit scene which Edgar didn't want and I can see why. Now it is good to see one or even more of The Avengers in another Marvel movie just for a little cameo but you know why they there to only set up the future Marvel movies and that's it really. That's just want it is really just a set up for the next movie and not let it be a good stand alone movie without other Avengers coming reminding you about the future Marvel movies. But that's just me. It's funny how I kept bringing up Edger Wright in this review, but what can say the guy is awesome. The action scenes in the movie are just so stunning to watch. The action was excellently shot and when the character Ant-Man shrinks to ant size and takes down loads of enemies it was just awesome to watch it and it was a very creative action scene. The CGI in this movie really helped those action scenes or just the scenes where he's in ant size and everything around him is a size of a giant. Those scenes in the movie are worth the price of seeing. I also love how this movie brought up the one thing that people always say 'Why don't they just call The Avengers'. In this movie they explain that it only takes a small person to do this small mission so you really don't need The Avengers to do this one small mission. I just love how the movie brought that up as it's saying shut the f**k up to those who are complaining about that. Evangeline Lilly, Micheal Douglas, Michael Peña and the rest of the cast all did great in the movie as they were funny and truly enjoyable to watch.Now for the problems: The villain of the movie Yellow Jacket played by Corey Stoll was a pretty weak villain and was kind of a cartoon villain at times. I think Corey Stoll is a great actor and I mean he was good in House of Cards and Midnight in Paris, but here he was the cliché I'm evil to do bad things to people and to are my character. He wasn't awful in the movie but he wasn't such a good villain. Most of the character's in the movie felt like plot device like Scott's daughter in the movie as I could tell for a mile away what she's going to do later on in the movie and it happened as I expected.Overall Ant-Man is another Marvel movie that turned out great just like Guardians. I like how Marvel are taking unknown comics that people never heard of and making them into big hits and everybody loving falling in love with them. Ant-Man was a lot of fun to watch and I actually like Ant-Man a little more than Age of Ultron, yeah I went there. Never again can anybody doubt Marvel for they next upcoming unknown project as you all known your going to eat it up and love it as always. Ant-Man is worth checking out.",6,1,9,23 July 2015
Bridget Jones's Diary," Cheerful comedy entertainment.
","Bridget Jones: 'Now, I'll go home and... DE-bunny'.The story is about a post-feminist, thirty-something British woman who has a penchant for alcoholic binges, smoking, and an inability to control her weight. While trying to keep these things in check and also deal with her job in publishing, she visits her parents for a Christmas party. They try to set her up with Mark (Colin Firth), the visiting son of one of their neighbors.This movie could have fell flat on it's face by it's cliché story about a women that needs a man in her life, normally I hate those movies but this one I like, because the movie itself knows what it is and tries to be something new and clever with it's story and it's main heroine, and that's what made this movie worked. The writing in this movie took all the same story that has be recycled over and over again and made something good out of it, taking away the stuff that we seen before and putting something new and clever. This has to be Renée Zellweger best role that she was in. Playing the cheeky, caring and witty person that she is. The rest of the cast Colin Firth, Hugh Grant and Jim Broadbent did a great job in they roles. My only nick pick with the movie is the ending for me. It's not a terrible ending but it could have been better.",7,0,0,11 October 2014
Notting Hill," A enjoyable Romance movie
","Anna Scott: 'Here sit down. Have some tea, these lots to see'.Notting Hill is about an unassuming, unimportant bookstore owner in Notting Hill becomes friends with Anna Scott, the world's most-loved actress. But as friendship turns to romance, the fame and attention, not to mention an American actor, threaten to destroy their relationship.Okay I have to be honest here but Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts never stood out to me in they movies. I don't think they terrible actors or anything like that, it's just that they performance in they movies I never thought it was groundbreaking or pure greatness, just okay and nothing else. And now both of them are in Notting Hill and I can positively say that I thought both did pretty good in this movie.The chemistry between Grant and Roberts was sweet and well written. Yeah it was cliché and I could predict what was going to happen next and normally I hate it when I could predict the relationship and all the drama in a romance movie, but in this it didn't really bother me that much. Because of the great acting and good character development that stopped me from hating the movie completely.I actually was surprised how much I laughed during this movie. The side characters or the supporting characters to those people would like to say, but anywhere the side characters were pretty damn funny and give a lot of funny lines. Rhys Ifans in this movie was the true comic relief of this movie. He stole every scene he was in. For problems there only are some: Has I said before about the romance cliché thing and how Grant and Roberts chemistry stopped me hating this, well towards the end of the movie it went so cliché I won't lie I rolled me eyes. The scene that stuck out to be the stick in the mood cliché is towards the end were Grant and Roberts have this big fall out and you see them feel sad and they missing each other but they don't want to admit it, but one of them finds out that he or she was wrong and goes chasing after the girl or men of he or shes dream. That right there is the biggest cliché that still been used today and I don't know why that cliché has to be the worst. Notting Hill overall may turn people off by the has I said before those annoying cliché but let's put that a side and look at the movie fully. The movie has some good chemistry and good acting. This isn't like any other romance movie out there, and what I mean is that this movie didn't make me mad and that's so rare for me.",6,0,1,23 January 2015
Nightcrawler," Steady hands!
","Lou Bloom:'Steady hands, steady hands'.The story is about a young man, desperate for work, stumbles upon the seedy underworld of L.A.'s crime journalism. The break-neck pace is all about being the first on the scene - murder, accidents, fires, mayhem - and selling the gratuitous footage to the local news stations. But the better he gets, the more likely he is going to become the next story.I heard so many great things about Nightcrawler. The critics said the same like, 'It's a flawless peace of entertainment' or 'One of the best movie of the year'.- So I was looking forward to the movie by hearing all the good buzz from it, and after seeing it I can say that this movie is flawless.Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performance he ever did in his career. He lost a lot of weight for this role and I can say it pays off so well. I love how he makes his character so creepy, but so interesting to watch on screen. I swear to god if he doesn't get a Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie, I will be angry and disappointed at the Oscars, because when I watch a movie and don't see the actor, just the character that right they is talent.The director of this movie (Dan Gilroy) and he was only a screenwriter for most of his career and this movie is his first time directing and my god his he brilliant. Dan Gilroy but a lot of effort in this movie and I heard that the director of the movie actually met some people who do these things that people call 'Nightcrawling', and to me that shows that this guy should make more films in future, because he's the kind of director that movie need.The writing in this movie is some of the best writing I've seen since Boyhood, I mean every sentence in this movie glues me in it's story and character's. The move itself has that dark, uneasy and hash look to it, but that's life. The shots were good, the other cast member's were great as well.But as I said in my Interstellar and The Guest review, the movie isn't going to get the perfect rating of four out of four star's, but the movie is still brilliant.",7,1,3,23 November 2014
The Revenant," The Revenant - Movie Review
","'My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands'.The Revenant is set in the 1820s, in the uncharted wilderness of America, Hugh Glass set out with a hunting party on an expedition. Glass was mauled by a bear and left for dead but through sheer will and to get back to his family, Glass survived - but that wasn't the only thing on his mind as he set out to payback the men who left him behind.I remember last year around January time when I saw the two images for The Revenant, with Leo holding a Kentucky Flintlock Rifle looking like he's not playing around. Just by those two images caught my interest. I then found out it was directed by the magnificent Alejandro González Iñárritu who did the Oscar wining 'Birdman' (A movie that I personal loved). The Revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015, as I was looking forward to this movie more than Star Wars, and yes I said it. And after finally seeing the movie myself, I can safely say that I was not disappointed. The Revenant is one of the most stunning, brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience I've ever had. The movie isn't for everyone, but I loved it.Alejandro González Iñárritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite director working today, because he's such an old school director when it comes to storytelling by the use of art. There's been a lot of drama happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake could lose a lot of day light for a scene (It was shot in natural lighting). One of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily Iñárritu said no to the idea by stating, 'If we ended up in green screen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of sh*t.' And after seeing the movie I gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what the studio says. Yes there are some CGI scenes, but the way that the animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is handled incredibly well. This is one of the best directed I've seen in 2015 and I know Iñárritu already won an Oscar already, but I hope he wins another one for this, because never before have I seen a revenge tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent.I respect Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if this doesn't get him an Oscar, nothing will. He's performance in this movie is what a call ''a silent performance'', because Leo barley has that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is in a different language (Which Leo has said it was tricky to learn the language). DiCaprio has proved time and time again that he's more than the pretty face actor, but in this movie I only saw Hugh Glass, not DiCaprio. That's my biggest praise I have to give to Leo as he had to deliver all the emotions, the pain, the tortured soul that Hugh Glass was and it's all through his face and eyes, and trust me when I say this but it's not easy as you think. We are so use to seeing Leo as the angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie I thought he was fantastic, as he played the man who lost everything and the tortured soul that Hugh was as a person was. With very little lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so far his best. I really hope Leo gets an Oscar for this.Tom Hardy also gave an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. I've heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (Or just in everything that he's in really). Sometimes I didn't understand what he said but most of the time I did. But all that a side, I still think he was fantastic in the movie. He really added a lot to his character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. I'm not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but I hope he dose.I'm running out of things to say about Emmanuel Lubezki breathtaking cinematography. The camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a character of it's own is seriously impressive. Lubezki captures nature on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. The people running the Oscars should just give Lubezki his third Oscar right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home.Now for the flaws and there's not that many for me: Some of the character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much senses to me, and that's really it.Overall The Revenant is one of most intense, stunning, brutal movies I've seen in 2015. The score is haunting, the editing was top notch and that bear attack scene was just terrifying, I mean how the hell did they do that?. I don't know about you, but I honestly can't stop thinking about this movie. It's one of those movies that sticks with you after it's over and it isn't going away anytime soon.",10,0,6,11 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Bridge of Spies - Movie Review
","James Donovan: 'Aren't you worried?'Rudolf Abel: 'Would it help?'Bridge of Spies takes place during the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.So I finally just watch Bridge of Spies and it was pretty damn good. Steven Spielberg once again made a great movie, and just like I said about Ridley Scott about how great it is that we still can go to the cinema today and see a new movie directed by an icon.Steven Spielberg is the type of director you never know what you're going to get and I'm talking about the type of film making he uses. Spielberg will always make a well directed movie even when some of his movies are not great or something you'll never watch again, it will still be well directed. Steven Spielberg's directing in Bridge of Spies was absolutely superb, because every scene is so perfectly crafted and Spielberg knows when to cut to a emotional reaction with the characters. These a couple of scenes in this movie that I didn't notice was all in one long wide take with no breaks, and that's because I was so locked in on what was going on with the characters and the scene itself. Spielberg brilliance is still present today as he's masterful style of film making is still alive today. If you love that kind of film making that's so masterful, perfect and old school, then Bridge of Spies might be the movie for you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen this year.Tom Hanks is one of the most lovable and respected actors of are times, as in every role he dose, he never disappoints. This is he's fourth collaboration with Spielberg after: Catch Me If You Can, Saving Private Ryan and The Terminal, and in Bridge of Spies Hanks once again deliverers a magnificent and believable performance. This is an Oscar worthy performance as he made his character so relatable, funny and very likable. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene in this movie where Tom Hanks character (James Donovan) gets followed by this unknown figure and at one point Donovan goes to sit at this restaurant to confront this man and the scene itself is just amazing, because Donovan knocks this guy to the ground with no action, just dialogue. Tom Hanks was amazing in this movie.Another performance that blow me away was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. I have seen this actor before in the hit TV show 'Wolf Hall', and he was great in that show, but he impressed the hell out of me in this movie, because Mark Rylance was absolutely fantastic. This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and I hope he dose, because it would be a huge sub if he doesn't get nominated. Mark Rylance was fan-freaking-tastic in this movie.The cinematography was excellent, the score was great, the dialogue is outstanding and the story was really good.Now for the problems: These a couple of scenes around the second act that wasn't that interesting to me.If you don't like talky movies then you may not enjoy Bridge of Spies, because this whole movie is nothing but talking and I know some people may not find that enjoyable. I'm the kind of person who likes dialogue driven movies and that's why I enjoyed this movie, because of the movies excellent dialogue and I how locked in I was while watching it, but I know it's not going to be for everyone and if you think this movie is boring because it's a talky movie then that's fine.Overall Bridge of Spies isn't Spielberg's greatest movie compared to his other ones, but it is a well crafted movie with excellent performances, fantastic directing and great writing. Bridge of Spies is the best Cold War thriller I've ever seen.",8,1,3,15 November 2015
Being John Malkovich," Being something that you're not
","Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman never seem to shy away from going weird but amazing.The story is about a skillful puppeteer finds the perfect puppet when he discovers a portal in his new office on a 'half' floor. It leads him literally into the brain of John Malkovich. He and his discoverer try make a living off of others interests while his wife becomes jealous.Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze are the two people that can take a weird and strange story and make it amazingly well made and as a viewer you some how correct to it with no reason to it. I don't think I ever came across a bad movie from these genius of directing and writing and Being John Malkovich is another great film from them, they never disappoint me.The one thing that I loved about this movie is how self aware it is. It knows it's weird with some of the scenes that will kind of question yourself for watching it but not in a horrible way more like 'I'm I weirdo for understanding this and also enjoying it?', something like. The film has a sense of humor to itself and knows it' ridiculous but it goes along with it and man is it funny.The director from Spike Jonze once again dose an amazing job directing this movie. He mix the humor, weird scenes and the fantasy element to it which perfectly came together so well and smoothly. Spike Jonze is fantastic director and in this he really dose shine with his talent of presenting story telling. The writing in this movie is probably hands down the best writing I've seen in a while. The way they pulled off this crazy story line and make it comedy gold is truly genius and worth bringing up because it's not a easy thing to do as it seems impossible for some writers out there and Kaufman makes it look easy.The acting from everyone was excellent. John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz all three did brilliant in their roles. John Malkovich pretty much playing himself in this movie did a funny performance as himself has he get's taken over by pretty much everyone. I would pay good money to see John Malkovich been given the script for the first time to this movie while he knows nothing about it yet and him reading it and seeing his face has it probably went into WTF mode, but he said yes anywhere because the movie is about him and he give a outstanding performance.For problems I don't really have any to be honest. I couldn't really find anything that I thought wasn't right. Well overall Being John Malkovich is smart, weirdly amazing movie with a fantastic script and outstanding directing.",10,0,2,27 March 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Rogue Nation was a solid movie
","'Looks like the mission just got impossible'. - Quote by Ben Stiller.The story in Rogue Nation is about Ethan Hunt and his team face their biggest and most dangerous threat yet (Would you believe it) The Syndicate, an international rogue group that are as skilled as they are deadly - and their number one goal is to eliminate the IMF.Before I talk about Rogue Nation here is all my thoughts on the previous Mission Impossible movies. The first movie in my opinion was decent and a lot of hard work went into that film, I mean you look at the behind the scenes of the first movie people really worked they ass of on that movie and to me it paid off nicely. I give the first movie a strong 3/5 star's.Mission Impossible 2 was pretty terrible to be honest. I felt like I was watching a different movie because to me I didn't feel like the first movie or even a Mission Impossible movie. I'm giving Mission Impossible 2 a 2/5 star's.Mission Impossible 3 really got things back on track after the messy MI 2. Philip Seymour Hoffman was a great villain and JJ. Abrams did a good job directing the action scenes and the whole movie. I'm giving the third one a 3½ / 5 star's.Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol was pretty good. The actions scenes and the characters are the highlight of the movie. My only problem with the movie is that the villain was a bit weak and wasn't really that menacing. Overall I'm giving Ghost Protocol movie a solid 4/5 star's.And now for Rogue Nation and it was a very enjoyable movie and I liked it a little more than Ghost Protocol.I was a bit worried but at the same time interesting on what Christopher McQuarrie will bring to a franchise like this, because this is the same guy who directed Jack Reacher and I though that movie was okay but nothing special. Brad Bird was originally suppose to direct this movie but dropped out because he wanted to direct Tomorrowland and then Christopher McQuarrie stepped in. After seeing the movie I'm so happy to say that Christopher McQuarrie did a great job directing this movie as he added a lot to this movie when it comes to action and it's characters. McQuarrie really gave the actions scenes a feeling of rush and the action never got stale after wards like some action movies do after awhile. Nicely done Christopher McQuarrie.It's crazy how Tom Cruise is 50 years old and he's doing all of his own stunts for his fans and keep it real and not over use CGI. He was great in this movie like in everyone movie Tom Cruise was in. You can tell by his face that he's in the zone when he dose these stunts that could kill him or hurt him really bad. Tom Cruise nailed the humor, he nailed the action scenes and he nailed the role.Many people and myself had no idea who Rebecca Ferguson was before Rogue Nation. She was in last years Hercules with Dwayne Johnson that nobody remembered and I already forgotten that movie already. Rebecca Ferguson was so good in this movie that she is going places after this because of how good she was. In this movie she was like the female Liam Neeson from Taken because it's the whole 'I'm going to kill you in one blow' kind of character. Rebecca and Cruise worked together perfectly and she nailed the role of a strong female character.Simon Pegg was great in this movie playing Benji. It's surprising that not a lot of people give him credit in this movie as his known best at comedy but he's also a great action actor star as well, he proved that in Ghost protocol, Rogue Nation and Hot Fuzz.The rest of the cast like: Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner and Alec Baldwin all did great in this movie.The one thing that the Mission Impossible movies doesn't do very well is it's villain. Philip Seymour Hoffman was the only good villain in Mission Impossible series but the rest of villains have been weak and pretty forgettable. But the villain in Rogue Nation has a lot of motivation and he's the kind of villain that you understand where is coming from. Sean Harris dose a great performance as this chilling character but it wasn't an incredible villain but still better than the one we got in the other movies.Now for the problems: The movie itself isn't flawless as these some scenes in the movie that the pacing dragged a little bit and when the characters have conversations about the gadgets and stuff it wasn't that interesting as Ghost Protocol did it better, because Ghost Protocol was a straight up action movie filled with humor and entertaining characters and when they have conversations about gadgets it was interesting and creative.Overall Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation isn't only just a good action movie it's a good movie on it's own. The movie took elements from the first movie and Ghost Protocol and puts it together in this movie which made it a very entertaining movie.",8,3,6,2 August 2015
The Exorcist," One of the most notoriously frightening films ever made
","The Demon: 'Your mother sucks c''ks in hell!'.The film is about a little girl is possessed by a demon. Can the Catholic church save her.This movie is pure creepy and pure gross. That image of the demon that you see not a lot, that face is just so freaky and it makes me jump every time I see it. The movie left a scary and a chilling in me after I finished watching it. The movie has its problems like the film at times does slow down a little bit. But overall The Exorcist is a horror movie that sticks with you after it's over. Leaving a uneasy feeling on you that a lot of people had back in 70's.",9,2,3,5 December 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War - Movie Review
","Even friends can be your biggest enemies.Captain America: Civil War is behind 'Iron Man', 'Winter Soldier', and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' of being the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Or MCU for short). The movie has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. I don't know about you, but the Captain America series are the only movies in the MCU that actually get better with it's squeals. The action, the effect's, the humor, the characters, and it's stunt work has improved from the first movie.What this movie dose so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes Sony studios look lousy. He was excellent in the role and I would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than Maguire and Garfield (In my opinion). I can't wait to see more of him in 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' that's out next year.Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was pretty damn awesome as Black Panther. Boseman can basically play anything and I'm not kidding you when I say that, as he played Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and now Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman has some crazy talent and him as Black Panther was spot on casting. I'm looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018.If you thought the stunt work in 'Winter Soldier' was outstanding, then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie, as it was just....INCREDIBLE! All the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for this for doing the impossible.Now for the problems: Daniel BrÃ¼hl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was pretty forgettable. That came across a bit too harsh didn't it? It really sucks for me to say that, because Daniel BrÃ¼hl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie that's either good or bad. He wasn't awful or anything like that, it's just that I didn't find him treating at all.Martin Freeman is a great actor and I'm glad he's getting more meaty roles, but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes, I know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie. At times the movie itself completely forgets about him, so every time he popped back up on screen I was like 'Oh, Martin Freeman is in this movie, I totally forgot about that'. But that's just me.The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to- hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.Overall: 'Captain America: Civil War' lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on it's own. Marvel is having a great track record thus far- with the box office success, great reviews, and many upcoming spin offs. Civil War is most likely going to win every fan boys heart and it's not hard to see why.",6,3,7,4 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," The Conjuring 2 - Movie Review
","There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, And they all lived together in a little crooked house.The Conjuring 2 is one of those rare squeals that wasn't terrible, but rather good. The squeal did a lot of things better than first film in terms of character's, the twist and the unpleasant atmosphere. But it's kinda rare that we get a squeal that's just as solid as it's predecessor with plenty of surprises under it's sleeve.I have no idea how James Wan dose it. I seriously don't know how he manages to take the things that I usually can't stand in today's horror and somehow turn it into gold. That's why The Conjuring movies always stand out from the rest of the paranormal demonic movies, because movies like 'The Conjuring' actually have an atmosphere and characters with depth. Even the jump scars are effective and used at appropriate times. James Wan is the only director I can think of that I trust when it comes to directing horror movies, as he understands the genre well. Wan does it again here with tension that builds and the good old sense of death. The acting from everyone was pretty damn solid. Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Frances O'Connor were all great in the movie. Even the littler girl (Madison Wolfe) was really good, as she actually looked terrified and it was a very convincing performance, even for a child actor in a horror movie. What really surprised me about 'The Conjuring 2' is that I actually did care for the character's. I mean, compared to some horror flicks that are somewhat similar to this, but with the character's that are forgettable and so boring to watch on screen. Luckily this movie had character's with emotional weight to them. The camera work, the score and the cinematography are the highlights of this film. It also takes it's time and uses different ways to scare or spook you. It may not impress a lot of people, but I do admire the film markers for taking a risk like that. Enfield haunting case has been a hot topic for years now with people debating if it's a hoax or not. And while the 'based on a true story' may be bullsh*t (or just any movie that uses that headline for attention), I'm just so use to it now that it's getting numb. A lot people complained that this was too Hollywood or it was not accurate to the original story. I have seen plenty of documentary's and stories about the Enfield haunting case, and it's so BORING. I literally found nothing interesting about it and all the evidence for the paranormal haunting seemed a bit fake. I'm so glad this movie wasn't accurate to the original case that may or may not be real. The film markers took something with it and told a different story with events that's very loosely based on an actual case. The problems that I had with this movie (which is not a lot) is the use of CG for scenes involving the Crooked Man. It took me out of the movie and it kinda took away the terror from the Crooked Man character that Wan beautifully created. And yes, Javier Botet (who is about 6' 6¾) plays the Crooked Man, but the CG is so noticeable when he starts jumping around or growing tall to scare the little girl that he's haunting. I think practical effect's would have been so much better and scarier.Overall rating: The Conjuring 2 is a solid squeal that's way better then the avenge horror squeal. It takes your expectations and turns it completely around.",8,0,2,30 June 2016
Gone with the Wind," Frankly, I do give a damn
","Rhett Butler: 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn'. I love that line.The story is about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) plans to marry 'mealy mouthed' Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks.Just like I said in my Chinatown review about checking out beloved classic like well Chinatown and some other movies as well. I have decided to take a break from the new movies that I couldn't give a crap about and I have no interest in them but as a reviewer myself that I force myself to do because that's how much I care about you all, your the reader reading this, before I got zone likes, but now I got you all and I'm very to be alive to review probably the best I've seen since...well since I'm been doing this.This is my first time ever that I've seen Vivien Leigh in and I know it's not the last, because she give such a Oscar worthy performance and- oh wait she already won a Oscar for this movie and for once the Oscars got it right. Vivien Leigh give such a excellent performance and she played the spoiled brat that at the first I hated and then later on her character completely changed and for incredible reason that are both hash but just how life works, and she nailed that perfectly.Now what the Oscars didn't get right is not letting Clark Gable take home gold for his outstanding performance in this movie. Hands down the best character in this whole movie was Rhett Butler, he had the best lines, every time he was on screen I was glued to it and he has a sick sense of humor that most people have, even me.The cinematography in this movie....wow just wow, that's what I call a beautiful sunset in every scene to end the day. There never was a scene in this movie that I thought it didn't look impressive, even with the scenes of civil war at least it looked good and I know that's not a nice thing to say but hey when a movie looks good it's best to be brought up.The director of the movie Victor Fleming who did The Wizard of Oz in the same year as this, and he directed the movie with skill and passion and it really dose show.Now for problems: ................I don't have any.Overall Gone With the Wind is a three hour perfection of art that isn't you bloated stick in the mood Hollywood film, not with this movie, at least I can look at this and actually call it an Oscar wining cult classic.",10,6,10,3 March 2015
Foxcatcher," The American dream slowly turning Grey
","Calling Steve Carell character (John du Pont) creepy is me being to nice. This guy is just chilling, unsettling, disturbing and can't stand to watch sometimes. The film Foxcatcher is Based on the true story of Mark and Dave Schultz - brothers and Olympic championship wrestlers, who found themselves involved with John du Pont - their sponsor and eccentric multimillionaire. This relationship would eventually lead down a path to murder.Foxcatcher had a lot of hype not because of the director or the other actors like Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. The hype was for the comedy star Steve Carell has he takes a different performance from his usual comedy performance and how unnoticeable he is in this movie. There was a lot of Oscar Buzz about Carell performance for months after months about it and after seeing the film I can see why being are raving over this but I think it's a little bit to over hyped.This movie may have stepped up Steve Carell career as not just a goofy comedy star but a serious actor as well, because in this movie his disturbingly and disgusting to the point were I forgot Steve Carell was playing this character.Mark Ruffalo gives a great performance in this movie as he always do, because even when he's in a bad film he still gives it his all and in this he dose.Probably the most over looked performance in this movie is actually Channing Tatum. I remember back in the day where Tatum was a bad actor and the movies that he was in you know these stupid comedy's that flopped at the box office, yeah those movies, but in this movie he gives a Oscar worthy performance that got so over looked that I'm actually shocked about. Tatum is good actor and I this he did brilliant. Bennett Miller has proved himself to be a brilliant film maker when it comes to drama or Biographical films, and his previous films Capote, Moneyball and now this film totally shows his brilliant's in that. In this film Miller shows when the American dream of wining and being the best can turn Grey and really dark. He directed this movie with slick and passion and you really felt that in this movie.The make-up in the movie was pretty well done. Now I don't normally bring up this in my reviews but in this movie every actor in this movie has make-up on, and it didn't look rubber like Cloud atlas make-up was.For problems I have some like: The movie can be very slow at times now don't get me wrong I like slow paste movies because it's building up to something big, but in this movie they are scenes were it could have been cut out. The senses were you supposed to feel sad or shocked to kind of felt hollow for me.Overall Foxcatcher is a good time first watch film and what I mean is the film is good but I don't want to watch it again. Why would I re-watch a film that make me feel disturbed deep inside, I'm sorry I just can't... still a good movie.",7,3,9,29 December 2014
It Follows," Art house horror
","You ejaculate it follows, if you seen the movie you would understand that.The story is about a 19-year-old, should be spending Autumn worrying about school, boys and spending week-ends at the lake. But after a seemingly innocent sexual experience she finds herself unable to shake the feeling that something is stalking her. As strange visions begin to plague her, she turns to her friends to help escape this horror - if she can.It Follows was a horror movie that I've been waiting for a while now. As I'm speaking right now this movie is rated 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and critics have been calling this 'The scariest movie of all time', says some movie magazine. The movie was getting hyped up and I wanted to see what was all the fuss about and after seeing the movie I can say that It Follows isn't the scariest movie of all time, but it's still a great horror movie with a lot to like from it (even the soundtrack).The director of this movie David Robert Mitchell is unknown directed to me as I haven't seen any of his Previous movies and It Follows is basically the first movie I've seen from him and a great one. David Robert Mitchell directed the movie unsettling and beautiful at the same time adding the art house look and feel to a horror movie which made the tone of the movie creepy and haunting with a throw back of classic horror nostalgic. I will be keeping my eye out for his next movie because David did a excellent job directing and crafting a horror nostalgia, work one David Robert Mitchell.I remembered seeing Maika Monroe in last year's movie The Guest and now she's in It Follows and she delivered a great and stunning performance. In my opinion I think this is the movie that she really stands out from being good to outstanding. Now this isn't a spoiler to the movie but the scene I'm about to talk about involves Maika Monroe acting and why she was brilliant in this movie and that's when she first encounters the first follower and it's a old creepy looking women that start's walking towards her and the scene itself is very terrifying, Maika Monroe looked like she was scared and confused of what's going on and to be honest that's the face I will pull if so one started following me with that creepy look on their faces. Maika Monroe was pure outstanding in this movie and I can't wait to see more of her talent in the late future.The soundtrack to this movie is hands down some of the best horror soundtrack of the year, it's right up there with The Guest and other movies like Drive and Under The Skin. It's got a nostalgia of horror to it and a big tribute to John Carpenter's movies. I listened to the soundtrack more times then I excepted, that's how amazing this masterpiece of horror music should be done.The movie's tone is what made the movie more effective to me as the movie doesn't have loud stupid jump scars or any cliché annoying characters to bring the movie down, no the movie allows on it's setting, it's atmosphere and the performances to make the movie effective or you like to call it frighting. Don't go into this movie expecting a popcorn horror flick with all the clichés you can check off the list in your head, the movie isn't like that has it's different then most horror movies.Now for the problems: I already talked about how amazing Maika Monroe acting was in the movie but the other actors who played her friends wasn't all that good I mean if you have to compare it to Maika Monroe performance to these they didn't do so great. These a scene in the movie were one of them get's shot in the leg by accident and oh my god they reaction to getting shot was freaking dreadful and such bad acting it took me out of the movie a little bit, but luckily Maika Monroe was on screen most of the time in that scene so she pretty much saved it.Don't worry I won't spoil the ending for you but let just say that the movie doesn't end on a good note, it just kind of ends just like that. It was like the season finale to The Sopranos it just ends like that and I'm there all like 'Was that it?'.Overall It Follows is a great horror movie and I like how different and original it is. Is the movie over hyped? well yeah since critics are false advertising it saying it's the best thing that every happened and people are excepting to be scared out of their minds over this movie and leaving disappointed, well the movie didn't scary me but it left me thinking and it did have it's chilling and creepy moments that got under my skin a lot of times. If you haven't seen the movie yet go check it out but please don't go in thinking it's going to be scariest movie every made, just expect a good horror movie that's clever and unsettling.",7,62,125,6 May 2015
Beasts of No Nation," Beasts of No Nation - Movie Review
","Agu: 'I saw terrible things... and I did terrible things. So if I'm talking to you, it will make me sad and it will make you too sad. In this life... I just want to be happy in this life. If I'm telling this to you... you will think that... I am some sort of beast... or devil. I am all of these things... but I also having mother... father... brother and sister once. They loved me'.The story is about a young child in an unnamed African country learns to become a soldier under the tutelage of a Commandant.Beasts of No Nation is shocking, powerful, heartbreaking and scary to watch sometimes. Cary Fukunaga brilliantly directed this movie and he's also the same director of the first season of True Detective (Just in case you didn't know). Idris Elba delivers a menacing performance that's one of his best. Abraham Attah stole the show for me, I mean he was so freaking brilliant in this movie and he deserves an Oscar nomination (In my opinion). The movie is shocking and very real with some of the scenes, which I liked, because it never hold anything back and not once tried the Hollywood way of getting out of danger. Movies like this are great examples of film making.Now for the flaws: I liked this movie, but I honestly can't see myself watching it again. It's one of those movies that you think it's good and well made but never again will you see yourself re- watching it. But that's just me and who knows, you may have watched more than once.Overall Beasts of No Nation is a chilling and depressing war drama that really gets to you. The performances, the visuals and the shocking scenes in this movie are unforgettable.",8,3,5,3 December 2015
Gone Girl," David Fincher is a true master class of directing.
","Amy Dunne: 'This man might honestly,truly kill me'. The story is about Nick Dunne, as he finds out his wife has gone missing. As increasing police and media pressure mount, the facade of a loving and blissful union crumbles and amidst the lies and behavior of Nick, the question remains - did he kill her?I have to say that David Fincher is a true master class of directing, because Gone girl is one of the best films of this year. Ben Affleck was perfect for this role, because Ben Affleck through out his career had a lot of hate from the media and the critics that mostly slammed him in every role that he was in. And that's why he was outstanding in this movie. Rosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.What this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining they lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly. My only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character. Now let me just say that Neil Patrick Harris wasn't terrible in the movie, but his character to me slowed the film down for me. Overall Gone Girl is a fantastic film and it's the movie to see.",9,0,10,12 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," The origins of the great genius.
","Stephen Hawking: 'There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. However bad life may seem, while there is'.The movie tells the origins of the great genius today Stephen Hawking. He falls deeply in love with fellow Cambridge student Jane Wilde. Once a healthy, active young man, Hawking received an earth- shattering diagnosis at 21 years of age. With Jane fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen embarks on his most ambitious scientific work, studying the very thing he now has precious little of - time. Together, they defy impossible odds, breaking new ground in medicine and science, and achieving more than they could ever have dreamed.I have seen many actors in the past taking on roles where their play people based on real life with have a serious disease or a disability which involves a lot of training to get the body movement and the speaking spot on, many actors nailed that and so dose Eddie Redmayne.Theory of Everything is a movie that get's straight to the point and doesn't waste your time with scenes that could have felt unneeded or filler like the TV show The Walking Dead dose all the time.Eddie Redmayne did the most spectacular, flawlessly brilliant performance I've seen in him in... well in small roles really, this is his actually big role and I hear some Oscar buzz about his performance and I wouldn't be surprise if he get's nominated because he was fantastic in this movie. He got the look, the movement and the speaking like Hawking.If I had to compare the score to this movie it would be The King's Speech, you know the piano music that so relaxing and peaceful to listen to. Music like that for some strange reason makes my feel more life inside of me, and the people who did the music I give them two thumbs up for that.But what the movie dose lack on is that they didn't really sell the fact that Hawking is a genius, and we know that he is but in this movie everybody didn't really seem all that filled with his mind blowing work, everybody was all like 'Yeah great job man, that's some good stuff'. but really they should be losing their sh't over how smart Hawking was.Theory of Everything is a well made Biography movie with fantastic performers from Eddie and Felicity, excellent directing and a pretty nice score.",6,1,2,17 December 2014
Room," Room - Movie Review
","Ma: 'You're gonna love it'.Jack: 'What?'.Ma: 'The world'.Room tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they finally get out.Since the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.Brie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about 'Short Term 12' and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.Lenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film 'Frank', which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.The first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.Jacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in 'The Smurfs 2' which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.Now for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.The movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, 'Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book', well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take '12 Years a Slave' as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself 'Wow, that was truly awful'. Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.Overall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion.",6,9,20,28 February 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Apocalypse - Movie Review
","Apocalypse: 'You follow blind leaders.'While X-Men: Apocalypse isn't quite as strong as 'Days of Future Past', with the storytelling and it's twist & turns, but it's still a solid entry in the saga. I have to admit, I was surprisingly entertained with this movie which I didn't expect going in, since I wasn't expecting much with this movie. I had more fun with this than 'Civil War', and yes, I just said that and I'm not taking it back. The movie has it's flaws but at least I never bored watching the movie.James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and all of the other supporting cast were all great in their roles. I felt the emotion, the depth and the unexpected humor from the characters. Now when I think about it, all of the X-men characters in this and the past movies feel like actual characters to really care for. The movies themselves feel like actual movies and not just superhero films.Oscar Isaac is such a terrific actor and I will always look forward to his next movie. In this film, Isaac plays Apocalypse (main villain of the film) and he was a pretty decent villain. He was very menacing with his own presence that actually made him quite treating, even tho he's motivates of destroying the world has been done before many times with other villains. Apocalypse isn't terrible or a weak villain as many critics have said, but I wouldn't rank him as the best one. I mean give Oscar Isaac a break, he had to act in all that make-up on him and he did the best he could, so there's that.Some of the CGI in the film was very noticeable in a few scenes. But the effect's are not like that all the time, as there are many cool effect's in the film that did make me go 'wow'.The movie dose take awhile to get going and I don't mean it was slow or anything like that, but I couldn't really care for what's going on in the first 30 minutes. But as the movie went along it started to get going and each scene was better as it went along.Overall: X-men: Apocalypse is a very entertaining superhero movie that has it's pros and cons. I was surprised of how much I enjoyed this movie and how engaging I was. Oh, and Quick Sliver once again steals the show with an amazing slow motion sequence that easily tops 'Days of Future Past' slow mo scene. I can already tell a lot of people are going to be mixed with this movie after seeing the audience reaction (so far), but that's just opinions.P.S. The film itself is much better then what the critics are making it out to be. Maybe it's because of the endless amount of superhero movies that are coming every week now. 'Civil War' is still being fresh in peoples heads. I mean the movie literally came out a few weeks ago.",5,6,16,23 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Enjoyable film.
","We've always known that Spider-Man's most important battle has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This movie is not as good as the first because most of the villains are just there just to push the plot along. The visual effect's in the movie are okay and the green goblin was just wasted in the movie and that was just a shame. The movie wants you to feel for Jamie Foxx character Electro but the movie fails at trying to make us feel for this guy, why can't there have a scene like in the Lego movie when are main hero has to talk to the villain with one of beautiful and the most touching scene is when he tells the villain that he is amazing person and he can do amazing things without being evil. It may not be as good as the first but it's still enjoyable to watch.",3,1,7,10 October 2014
Ex Machina," Well driven movie
","You see Chappie you could have been like Ex Machina with it's clever storytelling and interesting character's but no you have to run off with the gangs and become a A-hole didn't you Chappie, such a disappointment. I'm sorry I got to get that out there.The story is about a programmer at an internet-search giant, wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company's brilliant and reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test-charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan's latest experiment in artificial intelligence.Every review for Ex Machina has been amazing, I haven't came across a review that gived it a negative score and everyone is calling the movie 'An original storytelling movie with a deep message about A.I'. I got pumped up for the movie because the movie looked great, it had a solid looking cast and the score for the movie was pure brilliant because I actually listened to the soundtrack to this movie before I even seen the movie. After seeing the movie I can say that Ex Machina is a smart original story that's totally different from other Sci-Fi monster films.Alex Garland the director of this movie, and this is pretty much my first movie that I've seen directed by him and I can say that Garland really brought a lot to this movie and that's the true real life look on A.I, I mean he did wrote the movie as well so he had full control of the movie and he can do whatever he wanted for the story and he's vision he had for the movie, because I seen Alex Garland in interviews online and he talked about how much he gived it he's all and got whatever vision he had out there, and it worked. Alex Garland directed the movie outstandingly well done as he got the tone and the realism to it that made the movie great for me.Alicia Vinkander who plays Ava (The robot) and Alicia did more then a great performance, she did outstanding in this movie. I believed every scene that she's in was a full life robot because she didn't do the cliché robot voice or the lifeless face and the boring body movement, no she add a lot to her character and that's Ava trying to be human and acting and also doing actives like people will do. But she's also sneaky and can easily convince you that she's a gentle soft heart that although out the movie she will fill you with lies or the truth depends what mood she's in, and Alicia Vinkander delivered a brilliant performance to this role and she knocked it out of the park.Oscar Isaac is also in this movie and he's also brilliant in this as well. Oscar Isaac has been impressing me recently with his acting in his past performance and in this movie he once again brings it to he's all, because he did great playing this cool lay back genius who created life and he takes it like a joke and I think that's why I liked his character a lot more then I expected. Oscar Isaac you did awesome in the movie, well done you fantastic actor.The movie's tone was also spot on as it kind of gives you a uncomfortable feeling inside of you as the unsolved secrets slowly start's to be unsolved. The writing was great and the cinematography was beautiful to look at.Now for problem: The one person I haven't brought up during this review is Domhnall Gleeson and he's not terrible in the movie, actually he was good in the movie but his character was a bit dull and flat to watch. I didn't really care about he's character that much because the movie to me didn't really development him that much to care about.The movie is very slow at times and I wouldn't say the movie is for everyone as I have talked to some people who have seen the movie and they pretty came out and say that they didn't like the movie. But hey you can't win everyone over even when a movie is ten times better then other most films out there but some people overlook that.Overall Ex Machina is a great storytelling A.I movie with a strong hidden message about people pushing technology to far over the edge that it will soon kill us and becoming us.",7,3,6,19 May 2015
Patton," Patton is the best biography I've seen in years
","George S. Patton Jr.: 'The above quotes are all erroneous, and grievously so, except for the very first!'The story is about a hard nosed controversial general is shown in this WW 2 movie about how to win battles and look good doing it.Movies back in the 70's was the dark age of films. Graphic, brutal, dark and took many chance's with it's shocking scenes that left many people cold and speechless. Until one late night when this movie came on TV and I only heard a couple of things about it but nothing much. So I was there acting all cocking thinking 'Oh classic movie eh? well blow my mind classic movie', then I started to watch and I really got into it, to the point where I understand why people raving this has a classic and this movie was a lot different then the other 70's movies at the time. It's a World War film with some amazingly well shot scenes of the battlefield and the horrifying impact that everybody had to go through.George C. Scott was just terrific in this movie playing George S. Patton. I didn't see George C. Scott in this role, I just saw the real guy in front of me and he completely disappeared in this role and became the real thing, and that's just top notch to me.The cinematography in this movie looks like it took a long time to get the perfect shot and needed the right timing, and for that I give the cinematography team respect for actually trying to get the right shot. The directing and the writing has well was pretty stellar and freaking well done.For problems I only have one and that is: The movies paste can drag a little and... really that's it. Overall Patton is a brilliant war film with excellent acting and outstanding cinematography.",9,0,0,3 January 2015
Big Hero 6," Baymax: 'Hello, I am Baymax'.
","Baymax has to be the most adorable and coolest Disney character I've seen in a while.The story is about San Fransokyo being under attack - but robotics expert Hiro Hamada, with his robot Baymax, will team up with some reluctant, novice crime fighters in order to save the city. Just like every year Disney always brings out films that are mostly good or adorable, and a long comes Big Hero 6 and this movie is on the level of adorable, but not that close to brilliant. The animation in this movie was so colorful and so gorgeous to look at that my eyes couldn't get enough of it. The character's were funny and pretty awesome, even Baymax which has to be the most adorable and the most lovable character I've seen on the big screen. The action scenes were really well shot and enjoyable to watch. The ending to this movie dragged a little bit for me. If they ended the movie about a couple minutes ago I could have given it a bigger rating, but the ending kept going and felt like it went on and on. Big Hero 6 is a entertaining movie with beautiful animation and a solid story line.",6,1,15,16 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," I am Groot
","Rocket Raccoon: 'Oh... yeah'. In the far reaches of space American pilot, Peter Quill, must team up with a ragtag group of misfits after he incurs the wrath of the dreaded Ronan after stealing an orb. Okay this has to be Marvels funniest movie yet. The visuals effect's in the film looked amazing and the movie made me laugh a lot. Rocket Raccoon is the best character in this movie, he was so awesome and Bradley Cooper did a great job voice the bad-ass raccoon, and the soundtrack in the movie was not only good but so amazing to listen. But they are some problems in the movie like the start I thought dragged a little bit and the villain in the movie I thought was weak just like Thor the dark world villain.",7,1,4,28 September 2014
The Imitation Game," What a extraordinary man Alan was
","Alan Turing: 'I like solving problems, Commander. And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world.'The Imitation Game is about a true life story of the English cryptanalyst, mathematician and logician Alan Turing. During WWII the Turing led a group of code breakers at a top secret facility in Bletchley Park during the darkest days of the war in order to crack the German's Enigma code.Well it's settled, British films have completely change for the usual stick in the mood, low budget film. Oscar season after Oscar season, British films always make the nominations for Best Picture or Best Actor. Of course this movie got the big nominations and I so glad this got a lot of nominations from the Oscars, because this movie was pretty incredible.Now we have seen Cumberbatch in pretty much everything now: Sc-Fi, TV shows, animated films, drama, comedy, action and good god this guy is everywhere. Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie almost brought me into tears with his excellent performance as Alan Turning. Benedict is always good at playing these smart-ass genius that's always higher than anyone else, well in this it's a lot different. Yeah he starts off a bit unlikable how he shows off that he's the smart guy in the room, but after a while it changes and I actually felt sorry for this guy when you get to know his past and his secret that he tries to hind for all of his life. Benedict Cumberbatch played this guy so beautifully well that I think this is by far his best performances in his career.Keira Knightley has well dose a brilliant job playing her character in this film. Now I'm going to get some hate for this but I never liked Keira Knightley has a actress. She never locked on to me and she never won me over. I don't think She's a awful actress or anything like that I just never got into her as a actress, but in this film she dose do good as a supporting character that's really important to the story. Good work Knightley.The film is directed spot on and this is the first Morten Tyldum film that I've watched from him, yeah he did some other films in the past but I never going to watch them (Just being honest) He got the drama right, he got the relationship between Benedict and Knightley right and I think this director is going to go off and do some (I'm predicting here) some fantastic work of movies in the future.The writing has well is the soul of this movie. The director is the heart of the film, the actors are the veins of this movie. The writing to me perfectly got the main character pain and deep inside torture of he his secret of being gay and you know back then he would be sent to prison for that, so you really feel the hard work on not just solving the Enigma code but to hind who he truly is.For issues I haven't really got much to be honest. But is this a film that I will watch again and again, no not really. You may watch this loads of times more than me but to me this isn't a re-watchable film to me.But Overall The Imitation Game is brilliantly well done film with fantastic performances and a good story.",6,3,8,19 January 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A great start to the summer movie season
","Ultron: 'There are no strings on me!'.The story to The Avengers: Age of Ultron is about Tony Stark jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth's Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, are put to the ultimate test as they battle to save the planet from destruction at the hands of the villainous Ultron.You had no idea how excited I was for Age of Ultron even after the chilling and dark looking teaser trailer we got back in October last year. The teaser trailer looked really dark and so dead serious and I know that's a thing with Marvel films today that they making they own films look dark and gritty but it's comedy, I have no idea why they do that but anywhere I was hooked. The villain Ultron was another reason for me to get excited for the movie as 'There are no strings on me', thing I never thought it would be so creepy. After seeing the movie I can say that Age of Ultron is a great start to summer movies and a lot of fun to watch.Joss Whedon had spoken out saying 'This was the hardest movie he ever worked on', and I clearly see the effort and hard work put into this movie. Joss had a lot of things in his hands while making this movie and that's it's characters, story, action and it's brilliant sense of humor, and it payed off well. Joss Whedon did a great job directing this movie as he put in enough energy and to entertain everyone.James Spader as the villain Ultron is pretty much what I already expected for the most part but these a lot of surprises to his character like his sense of humor and how self aware he is about everything around him and I think it worked and fitted him very well. James Spader pretty much dose Raymond 'Red' Reddington from The Blacklist and I'm not saying that in a negative way but more of a good thing. Marvel isn't doing such a great job with villains and I'm not talking about Loki I mean in Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy all have weak villains but Ultron was awesome and I'm happy his character wasn't like the other villains in those three movies I just named. Great work James Spader.The visual effect's were pretty damn good, the Avengers themselves are once again brilliant as we remember them.Now for problems: Black Widow and Bruce Banner or Hulk have a love triangle in this movie and it really doesn't work at all. They chemistry wasn't there and there was no build up to it, I would like to see Captain American or Haweye have relationship with her as she as better chemistry with those two, it would have made more sense since she's been with Captain America and Haweye more times than Banner.I feel that the movie didn't really set up the Civil War story in the next Marvel movie with Iron Man and Captain America against each other. I know a couple of times those two would get into a little fight but they quickly shake it off and moved on, it's a small little nick pick I have and I know it wouldn't effect everyone else but I just saying the Civil War story should have been set up a little bit.Overall The Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great start to the summer movie season. I had a great time watching this movie, I never got bored, all the characters had they screen time and it was funny and entertaining, the villain I thought was great and the action scenes was very enjoyable.",5,1,7,25 April 2015
Everest," Dat mountain
","Never again will I look at a mountain the same way after seeing this movie.The story is about a group of climbers tackling Mt. Everest must fight to survive after a devastating snow storm leaves them stranded. The film is based on a true story of the 1996 Mount Everest Disaster.So I've just seen Everest and it was pretty good. What I thought the movie did a great job is making me care for the characters and I also liked how I felt like I was 29 or however thousand feet high on this mountain with the characters.The cast in this movie is freaking huge and every single one of them and yes even Sam Worthington was great in this movie. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were both absolutely phenomenal in this film and easily the biggest stand out of the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal was great too and I was quite surprised that he wasn't the main character as me and everyone else thought he was, because I watched the movie not knowing too much about the real life disaster itself and I actually thought that Gyllenhaal was the main star at the first, but he wasn't.There was never a point in the film that I can say that was bored, I mean at the beginning of the movie it's just these guys camping for a month getting ready to climb the mountain and you would think that will be boring right? nope, not here as the performances, the characters and every detail about climbing Everest kept me interested and locked on.The score is another thing that was great in the movie, and so was the cinematography that was just flat out gorgeous and truly breathtaking to watch.Now for the problems: The movie did feel a little bit too long and yes I know it's two hours long, but at some point I did felt like it went a little bit over in parts. The movie did have some pasting issues in some parts and that's really it for problems.Overall Everest isn't a movie that I'll call 'great' but I can say that I enjoyed watching the movie and it's worth seeing.",6,0,0,26 September 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Space Odyssey - Movie Review
","LIFF30 2016 #5'Daisy.'So I just saw '2001' at a film festival and it was kinda incredible. Why do I feel like I just ticked off my bucket list of things to die before you die. I've been waiting a long time to watch this on the big screen. I already seen the movie about 3 or 4 years ago, but my memory of the film isn't that strong. So when I was picking what movies I wanted to see at (LIFF), and this was on the list, as the festival also shows classic movies.Re-watching this movie was quite the experience. Nothing like a massive screen and loud speakers blasting off beautiful music while drifting in space. From the dawn of man till the end of human life. The cycle repeats.But seriously, what can I honestly say about '2001' that hasn't been said already. It's one of the greatest Sci-Fi films of all time. It's groundbreaking and pure genius. Even at the slower pace parts, I was still engaged. After it was over, I was contemplating on it.For a 1968 film, it's visual effects still hold up today and looks way more convincing than today. Well, there was a couple of effects that was noticeable, but the rest (which is mostly practical) still looks amazing. The 'Star Gate' sequence is one example of a trippy and a breathtaking effect that it owned Kubrick an Oscar.Every shot in this movie is like something you would hang up on your wall. Kubrick has been known for being a perfectionist of his work. This is a work of an artist that doesn't just get praised for how much he dose, but how little. Three years of making this - you can get easily attached to your work that after awhile you find the hidden beauty of the story. Do it 40 or 127 times until you get what you want and exactly how you wanted. A similar method that Chaplin use for 'City Lights'. But it isn't just images that kept me attention and I don't think Stanley was intending on that. There's plenty of scenes that goes on forever, not for spectacle, but more of use to inhabit everything that's going on.It also helps that music in this is so beautiful, but very eerie at the right moments. I can take the monolith on the moon scene as a great example of the bone chilling music. It may be scary for some, because of 'Requiem for Soprano' playing in the background, but I kinda see like this:Man discovers a 4 million year old structure buried under the surface of the moon. Perfect angles and a disturbingly flawless complexion. imagine if this event actually occurred in reality and you were sitting in front of your TV when a breaking news bulletin interrupts your program. Just imagine the weight of the emotions you feel. There is no explanation for how this structure could even exist. its impossible! It will be the most reality-shattering event in the history of the world.It's one of my favorite scenes of all time, because the scene alone perfectly captures that feeling. No explanation. No answers. No reason.Overall: Films like 'Space Odyssey' is why I love movies. Extraordinary and beautiful work of art. '2001' isn't just a classic for it's effects or the show stealer Hal9000, but how it wants to inspire and enlarge us. A space voyage that evokes questions and kept the audience in awe for 48 years.",10,2,4,18 November 2016
Frank," The weird and the wonderful
","This has to be the most oddest, touching and funniest movie that I have seen this year. The movie is about a keyboardist looking for his big break joins an eclectic pop band fronted by the mysterious Frank - the lead-singer who never removes his paper mâché head. This is by far my favorite movie of 2014. The acting in the movie was freaking fantastic, the writing was well written and it was new and refreshing, not like other movie these days. The main character of the film Frank played by Michael Fassbender, and I have to say frank is the most interesting character in this whole film. The other characters in the film are interesting to but I think frank is most interesting to me.A movie that is new and refreshing, not like other movie these days",6,0,1,5 December 2014
Selma," David Oyelowo + Luther King = Oscar worthy
","Martin Luther King, Jr.: 'When will we be free? Soon and very soon. Because you shall reap what you saw. When will we be free? Soon'.Selma tells the story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. The epic march from Selma to Montgomery culminated in President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most significant victories for the civil rights movement. Director Ava DuVernays SELMA tells the real story of how the revered leader and visionary Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) and his brothers and sisters in the movement prompted change that forever altered history.Poor Selma, being shut out from the Oscars and BAFTA awards for acting and directing (Which deserves some nominations for god sake) but to be honest I thought this was going to be a Oscar bait film, you know like The Butler or Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, because I had no idea that this movie existed until award season stared and that's when I had that thought of Oscar bait, but after seeing the film myself I can say no it's not a Oscar bait film. It's actually a pretty good movie.What really surprise me is how much films David Oyelowo has been in 2014, I didn't take much notice but now I have and I was extremely shocked how he got overlooked by the Academy and the BAFTA, because his performance in this movie is by the best I've seen this year. I didn't just see David Oyelowo being Oyelowo, no I only saw Martin Luther King and nothing else. I can see that David Oyelowo had strong passion for this role that he put everything in it and he absolutely nailed it. David you may not got a Oscar nomination for you outstanding performance but you won everyone over with your acting and you got a bright future a head of you buddy. Great work David.Ava DuVernay who to me is a unknown directed. I haven't seen the other work that she did so I can't really say, but after watching Selma I know straight away that we got a good one here, because she directed this movie with has much care as possible and effort to show how bad it was back then and she did it so well her that getting snubbed at the Oscars for directing is crime in my eyes.The one thing that makes Selma a truly great movie is the fact that the movie isn't all inspiring or beautifully touching like most Holly Wood cliché Oscar bait movies, no the director smartly takes a different turn for the best and just show what really happened and try not to make it all inspiring and make Martian look like a god like person and all that other stuff that's been done to death now. Selma steps away from that and shows the mistakes that this guy did because let's not forget that Martian Luther Kings was only human, just a guy who's not perfect of what he did and I hate it when Holly Wood takes a real life person and make him perfect and a god to everybody's eyes and when you look up the person in real life you start to see these other stories where he made mistakes then and there and you find out that the movie isn't being truthfully to the real life person, but in this movie Selma takes that cliché and say 'Sorry but that dose not happen. Go away Holly Wood'. Now for problems: Martin Luther Kings was the only interesting and the one person I cared about in this movie, but the other character's I didn't really give a fuss about them. I know I should but really I don't, I don't even remember they names at all. You may find them interesting but I didn't.Selma overall isn't just a Oscar bait or too Hollywood movie. The movie has outstanding performances from David Oyelowo, great directing from Ava DuVernay and a movie that I hope get's viewers attention in the late future.",8,1,4,1 February 2015
Eyes Wide Shut," Do there love each other or do there not?
","This was Stanley Kubrick last film and boy didn't he end with a bang. The story is about a New York doctor takes a trip to a seedy, decadent and dark part of life after his wife admits she almost cheated on him. When this movie first came out most of the viewing auditions thought to themselves 'What the hell was all that about?'. Even I thought that at the first, until I sawed it again for the second time and got a lot out of it not like the first time viewing it. The cinematography in this movie was so haunting and so clean till the point where I couldn't get my eyes of the screen. The acting from Tome Cruise and Nicole Kidman wasn't just great but freaking fantastic. The writing in this film was some of the best writing I've seen in years.The directing in this movie from the masterpiece of film making himself Mr. Kubrick. Every shot and every scene sucked me in with it's chilling and uneasy tone, and Kubrick nailed it once again. Now for the problems: The movie does slow down at times and some scenes could have been cut out ... and that's it really.Eyes Wide Shut is a fantastic peace of work that shouldn't be viewed for only first time, but many times to get the message the movie is trying to get out.",9,0,0,25 October 2014
Sicario," Unsettling, intense and brutal
","Alejandro: 'You will not survive here, you are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves'.The story in Sicario is about an idealistic FBI agent is paired up with a consultant with a checkered past, she will have to learn the hard way that combating the new war on drugs sometimes means getting your hands dirty.Sicario was my most anticipated movie of 2015, just because of the director, the cast and the magnificent cinematographer Roger Deakins was involved in making this movie. Denis Villeneuve has been non- stop impressing me recently with movies like: Enemy and Prisoners, so I was really looking forward to seeing Sicario and boy let me tell you that Denis Villeneuve did it again, because Sicario is one of the most intense and shocking film I've seen this year. Denis Villeneuve made another fantastic movie that's unsettling and brutal. The directing, cinematography and the performances from Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro were fantastic.",9,0,3,26 October 2015
The Witch," The VVitcth - Movie Review
","I hate Morden day audience when it comes to horror.I saw 'The VVitch'' back in early March and I thought it was decent, but I didn't understand what all the fuss was all about. Yeah, it looked nice and it had a chilling atmosphere but that's the only thing I got from it. Well, to be fair, I think I was the only one that I liked this movie compared to my friends and family, as they thought the movie was terrible. I liked the movie but I thought it was kind of slow, I was a bit confused at times and the movie didn't stick with me after it was done. If I was reviewing this back in March, I would probably give this movie a 3/5.But after re-watching the film, I actually liked it even more and there was a lot of things that I can't believe I missed on my first viewing. I don't know how to explain it, but I had this uncomfortable feeling from watching this that I never experience the first time. This is a horror movie that exceeds in film making, it's freaky score and it's gloomy atmosphere that really made this film a true horror.This is a great psychological horror film that can really get under the your skin. I started to notice little details that really made this movie freaking scary when you understand the meaning of it. This doesn't have any stupid jump scars that deflates tension or just any horror movie tropes that we've seen million times already, but that's nowhere to be seen in the ''The VVitch''.THANK GOODNESS!Oh and the cinematography is this movie is just flawless. I'm starting to notice a trend in indie horror movies today - With the shots being perfectly set up and the very little use of light that really adds to the atmosphere to this film.Thank you Robert Eggers for your brilliant direction and movie.",8,0,2,11 June 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary's Baby - Movie Review
","Rosemary's Baby is a work of sheer brilliance that left me in complete awe. The music, the direction, the cast, and the atmosphere is everything that some modern horror should take notes on.Roman Polanski is a master of his craft and he perfectly builds up the tension in every scene that makes the mystery even more engaging, as you the audience get interested in what's going on like Mia Farrow character. Speaking of Mia Farrow, shes pretty damn amazing in this and one of her best performance I've seen from her. The same goes to the rest of the cast, especially John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon.The movie is a slow burn, but the pay off is satisfying and I always like that in movies when everything adds up to the end. You Know what, I'm kinda disappointed that I didn't watch this sooner, but thankfully I did, even at this time.Happy Halloween everyone.",9,1,3,31 October 2016
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs - Movie Review
","So I've finally got a chance to watch 'Steve Jobs' over the weekend and I thought it was pretty good. Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet both gave a terrific performance, as the chemistry between the two was convincing and enjoyable to watch. The writing and the directing is this movies biggest strength, because the movie is non- stop talking and that's what this movie really is, and I know this isn't going to be for everyone, but for me, I was engaged all the way through and I honestly can't recall being bored while watching the movie. My biggest praise that I have for this movie has to go to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin, because filming and writing a movie like this isn't easy (trust me). The problems I have for the movie are very small and many people wouldn't be bothered by this, but this is just me. The little kid actor in the movie (Who plays Steve Jobs young daughter) she wasn't bad, as I thought she did alright for the most part, but there were a few times when I noticed some slip ups. But that's just a mini problem and the rest of the performances from everyone was great.Overall Steve Jobs is a well made film with clever writing, outstanding acting and directing. It's a shame that this movie was pulled from many theaters because nobody wanted to see it. Jem and the Holograms and Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, both sh*t movies that managed to stay in cinemas, but this movie didn't.",7,0,1,24 January 2016
Downfall," My review of Downfall
","So this movie didn't win a Oscar for Bruno Ganz spectacular performance or didn't win for best foreign language film, man f**k the Oscars.The movie is about a group of young women to Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Eastern Prussia. They are candidates for the post of personal secretary to the Fuehrer. Among them is 22-year-old Traudl Junge, a fresh-faced girl from Munich. Traudl is chosen for the job and she is overcome with joy at the thought of serving beside her Fuehrer. BERLIN, APRIL 20, 1945: Hitler has retreated to a bunker system under the German Chancellery. Traudl Junge is asleep in her room, deep beneath the ground. She is awakened by tremors from artillery fire. The enemy is getting closer. Charting the last 10 days of Hitler's life, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to his suicide on April 30th, the film uses multiple characters to show the chaos of a country coming apart at the seams, from Hitler's henchman under the streets of Berlin, to the soldiers and civilians fighting and dying as the Soviet Army ravaged the city above.You know that video on YouTube 'Hitler reactions to this', and a lot of people may not know where that scene came from and it's this movie when it's during Hitler couple of minute rant and putting those reaction videos to the side this is a great scene if you can get pass that. I thought about bringing that up just in cause you didn't know.I what to start off this review by saying that Bruno Ganz gives one of the best performance of 2004 and probably my favorite performance of all time. Bruno Ganz got Hitler spot on and he delivered a masterpiece of acting. What Bruno Ganz did so well is add a little human to Hitler as you can see his struggle and I know we what to see him fail because his a horrible person but as horrible as he his he's struggle to win a battle that he started and it quickly going down hill slowly breaks him, at one point you slowly see him losing it and Bruno Ganz powerful performance that creates are powerful moment that we can feel a little bit of it. Amazing performance Bruno Ganz.The directing in this movie is what works the best as the director shows every detail of Hitler's upcoming fate. I forgive Oliver Hirschbiegel for directing the epic fail that was Diana the film as he made a better historical drama.For problems with the movie these not a lot to be honest, you can say it's kind of a snail paste at times with the pasting but that's really it for problems.Overall DownFall is excellent movie with amazing acting, great writing and directing and a brilliant historical drama.",10,2,5,2 May 2015
Whiplash," Gripping and also inspiring then most films
","Terence Fletcher: 'There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job'.Whiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.Okay let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven't seen Birdman yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014.J.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in he's career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn't feel like he was reading from the script then act it out, no, I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was real and not fake. I didn't see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher. Now let's talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven't seen the film yet, well his like Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket. He has the best lines, when his on screen your locked on and his also like the kind of person that would be somebody's worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn't just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn't flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say 'You did a good job', and yes I did use the words 'you did a great job', n my past reviews but now I'm never going to use it ever again after this movie.Miles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it's truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough, and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.The directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle directed this movie and written it and man did he do it with style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it. This movie also had probably the best finale that I've seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn't dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I'm kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliché that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like 'You will clap at the end', but you don't, or 'You will feel inspired after the film', and I you don't. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It's message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn't just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie. For problems: The movie had it slow parts and that's it really.Whiplash is a movie that everybody should see. This isn't just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character's have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get's over shadowed by something you don't want to do and this movie get's it right. So go and see if you have the chance.",10,0,3,6 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Best movie of 2013
","If Leonardo DiCaprio does not a Oscar for he's role in this movie then they is going to be a rant.The film is about a Wall Street stockbroker lives the high life with his likewise wealthy buddies - but the net is closing in around him. But even as the feds close in on one of the largest securities fraud cases in the corporate banking world, he refuses to cooperate in any way.This is one of the best films of 2013, the acting, the directing was superb with out no words. Martin Scorsese is the best director out they just all of he's movies are one of the best and his other movies never let me down well my by gang's of new York. This movie is three hours and it feels like 1 hour because the movie goes by so fast that I didn't know the movie was almost finish and some people out they like news reporters and critics are saying that this movie is way to over the top and I got to say what movie Did they watch because I did not think it was over the top or silly. this movie will get a 4/4 star's 'Brilliant movie'.",9,1,4,5 October 2014
American Gangster," Denzel the Gangster.
","Dominic Cattano: 'Success. It?s got enemies. You can be successful and have enemies or you can be unsuccessful and have friends'.The story is about Frank Lucas, the quiet driver to one of the inner city's leading black crime bosses. But when his boss suddenly dies, Frank exploits the opening in the power structure to build his own empire and create his own version of the American Dream. Through ingenuity and a strict business ethic, he comes to rule the inner- city drug trade, flooding the streets with a purer product at a better price.They always comes a time in movies were I mostly get sucked in by the character's or story, and American Gangster does both right, because this is a flawless movie with spellbinding acting and brilliant directing.Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe both were absolutely outstanding in this movie. They both give a remember-able performance that gived their career a step up like never before. They both great actors who got talent all over them every time his one the screen.The director of this movie 'Ridley Scott', which now his new films have been mostly okay or straight up boring and bad which sucks saying that because I know he can directed good movies just look at Gladiator, Blade Runner and Alien. But his directing in this movie was top notch brilliant and skillful with his shots and camera work.The story is interesting, the performance are top notch and the movie has pretty damn good soundtrack that I couldn't get out of my head.My only problems with the movie is the movie itself does slow down at parts for me. I'm I the only one thinks that this movie is perfect for Martian Scorsese to directed, as he is the master of film making and Gangster movies, but let's not forget that Ridley Scott did good job of what he had with this movie.",8,1,2,17 November 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," 'I can't believe all this is behind us.'
","Time to say goodbye to middle earth for the last time.The story is about Dwarven party led by Thorin Oakenshield finally reclaims their kingdom of Erebor, the vast treasure draws out now only the wrath of Smaug but also the army of men and elves, who want the fortune for their own.Let me give you a quick feed back of the other two films then to this one. A unexpected Journey I thought was pretty amazing... when I first sawed it, after a couple of watchers later it's not as amazing as the first time, but I still enjoyed it even with the problems showing. Desolation of smaug in my opinion was way better and way more fun and better film paste then Unexpected Journey, and Smaug as the villain was icing on the cake. Now we got Battle of the Five Armies and I can conform that the movie is actually pretty good and it's a solid finale to The Hobbit series.Peter Jackson directs this movie in a way that middle earth feels like a real pace that we can go to anytime we want and I got to give him that. Jackson clearly adores middle earth as he really doesn't want it to end and I can see why, it probably makes him feel at home directing these movies and sometimes leaving you home behind sucks.The visual effect's at times looked really good and once again this movie had that shiny mix with grey color with the character's Armour and the background of beautiful New Zealand. But I like the Lord of the Rings effect's a little better, why you may ask. because the effect's in that movie still holds up today but that's just me... maybe.The all the cast members did a outstanding job, Ian Mckellen will always be Gandalf because his the best, Martian Freeman did a fantastic job playing Bilbo Baggins and to be honest I like Bilbo Baggins more then frodo in my opinion.My biggest problems with the film is some of the visual effect's in the movie looks very noticeable and I had the same problem with the other two films. The love story between Kili (The Dwarf) and Tauriel (The Elf), I didn't find their romance plot to really needed for the film and when something bad happens to the two of them I just sitting thinking 'Well stuff happens'.Overall The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies is a solid final to the Hobbit series with some problems there and then. Good action scenes, good performances and a brutal fight scenes.",6,6,14,12 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman in my eyes is a perfect film
","Riggan: I'm nothing. I'm not even here.The story to Birdman is about an wash up actor (Michael Keaton) - famous for portraying an iconic superhero - as he struggles to mount a Broadway play. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career, and himself.Okay in my review of Whiplash I bought this movie up mid way through the review just to give a heads up of when I'm going to watch it, because Birdman was my most hyped film of 2014. But just like every time I really wanted to see a film so baldy I have to wait for a while until I finally get a chance to watch it, story of my life really. But anywhere I was really looking forward to this movie ever since September, and now finally seeing the film I can safely say that Birdman is one of the best movie of 2014.I always know that Micheal Keaton was the kind of movie star that will pick any random movie role just because... well he what's to be important and still show to everyone that he still got it, I guess?. Like early last year now he was in two movies that were pretty blah, and that was The Robocop remake and the film Need for Speed, and those films just made Keaton look like he was just cashing it in just for the sake of it. Until when I watched this movie and seeing Micheal Keaton's performance and thinking to myself 'Wait is Keaton giving probably his best performance I've ever seen in my life? I think he is', because Keaton in this movie pretty much pulls of the best performance I've seen him in his all career. His character in this movie is like a wash up actor who had everything like love from the critics, his fans. Yeah he still dose have that Keaton thing that he always dose in his previous movies, but the scenes where he plays his character (Which is himself if you really look at his character in this movie) but anywhere he still gives a strong and believable performance that at times give me flashbacks of the good old days where he still had roots and felt like he isn't just cashing it in. I hear a lot of Oscar buzz about his performance in this movie, and I wouldn't be surprise if he wins because he totally deserves it. Excellent work Keaton.Edward Norton is this movie pretty much plays a familiar character to himself has the hard to work with actor that at times doesn't follow the lines that he was given or even the direction he was told. We already know that Norton is a fantastic actor in his previous work, but in this movie his performance could be descried has stellar and insanely good.Emma Stone is this movie and of course like most of the actors I named of so far of who outstanding they were in this movie and well you can already guess what I'm going to say next. Emma Stone acting in this movie was just terrific and marvellous to watch in this movie and it's good to see a real break out performance from her more than the lay back ones in her other movies. Nice one Emma. The other cast in the movie like Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis both did good as well.The movie is shot to look like it's all one shot take and my mind was just blown away by that fact. There where screens were I said to myself 'Oh my god is it one shot?', well I can already imagine the stress, hard work and how many takes they had to do to get it, and boy did it pay off nicely, because I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I dared myself to look away from the beautiful cinematography and the impressive editing used in the film.The movie has a brilliant message about film critics today that doesn't feel like it's in your face message that you normally get in movies. There is a scene in this movie and it's not a spoiler by the way, but I really need to get this out the way first. So anywhere Micheal Keaton character just starts having a rant over this theater critic who is going to give a bad review to his play when she hasn't even seen it or seen any of the premieres. He talks about how she only users big words that nobody will say in person and shes to lazy to come up what she really thinks about it so she users big words just to fill in the sentence. This movie probably has the best rant in movie history and Keaton in that scene shows how good of a actor that he is.For problems in the movie... I really don't have any to be honest.I loved this movie and yes I'm coming out be saying that. This isn't just the best movie of the year and such, no this is just flawless film making right here. Birdman and Whiplash are the two films I will highly recommend to people because those two films are my favorite films of 2014.",10,7,15,9 January 2015
The Queen," God save the Queen.
","The Queen: 'A good walk and fresh air sorts everything out'.The film takes place after the death of Princess Diana. The Queen of England refuses to make a supportive statement about the Princess, while Prince Charles and Tony Blair try to diffuse the situation and bring royalty back to popularity. Stephen Frears the director of this movie did a remarkable job bleeding in the footage and the reaction of this dreadful event, because you can feel what these people are going through and even the Queen herself went through a lot things in this crisis. Helen Mirren as the Queen, and am being honest about this but she gives the best performances that I've ever seen in her career. She played the part so well and so brilliant that through out the film I wasn't watching Helen Mirrern trying to be the Queen, I was watching the Queen herself on the the big screen, that's how outstanding she was. Michael Sheen, James Cromwell and the rest of the cast did a great jobs in they roles. The directing and the story in the film is simply spellbinding with every single detail added.",7,1,1,10 October 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," Atrociously bad
","Fifty Shades of Grey more like Fifty Shades of Abuse.The story is about a literature student, interviews the wealthy, intimidating Christian Grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man. Grey is likewise drawn to Ana - but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms. Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect.Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a cliché now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking 'That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of sh't makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away'. And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought.Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell.Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a ass-hole and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back.The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad.Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I hated it, I hated it. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it.",2,9,19,15 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens - Movie Review
","'Chewie, we're home'. The Force Awakens is a continuation of the 'Star Wars' saga, balance returns to the Force as the First Order, emerging from the ashes of the Empire, clashes with the Resistance, which includes scrappy newcomers as well as heroes from the former Rebel Alliance. It's been awhile since we've seen a Star Wars movie hit theaters and the last one wasn't that great. Fans today are still not over what George Lucas did. Then the news came out about a 7th film in one of the biggest and most iconic franchise of all time, but that only made fans more worried. Everyone had doubts over J.J. Abrams directing a new Star Wars movie, because Star Wars is one of the BIGGEST movies ever and fans seriously don't want another Phantom Menace on their hands, but after seeing the movie I can safely say that J.J. Abrams nailed it. J.J. Abrams broke his back making this movie, I mean taking on a project like this is a big deal. Abrams himself is a fan of the original Star Wars movies and while watching this movie I could tell. He put everything in this movie and it absolutely paid off. I can't imagine anyone else directing this movie and I think it's a perfect idea for a Star Wars fan (like Abrams) to direct the movie, because he knows his roots better than Lucas. Abrams really listened to fans and this isn't the first time a director did that, I mean with J.J. Abrams wanting to make a good Star Wars movie, he wants to get everything nailed down perfectly and the best way he could do that is by listening to what people what. Abrams did fantastic job directing this movie as he added a mix of A New Hope, the old school film making and a little bit of a Star Trek feel to it. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega play new character's in the Star Wars saga and both of them are unknown stars to some people. Both of them deliver a great performance and their characters were enjoyable to watch. The characters themselves are interesting, you care for them and you have a little glimpse of their back story that makes you want to know more about them. All the characters in the movie are great and I'm talking about the old and new characters. Now lets talk about the villain 'Kylo Ken' played by Adam Driver. This might honestly be the most fleshed out, human and understandable villain we've had since Vader, now I'm not saying he's the next Vader or he's up up there with Vader, but he is a menacing villain that's quite frightening at times. He's not the type of villain that's just evil or tries to have a clear motivation that's done poorly in other movies, but here (Without spoiling everything) is more than that. He was a great villain and just his presence can make anyone go silent. I loved the use of the CGI in this movie. Abrams went back to original way of filming things and that's blending the CGI into the background that this universe is set in, and it's execution was beautiful. Now when I think about it, the whole movie is one big 'f**k you' to George Lucas and how this movie avoids the things that we hated in the prequels (two of them is the use of CGI and Jar Jar). To those wondering if Luke Skywalker is in the movie and again without giving much away, yes, he is. Now for the flaws: A lot of people have said that The Force Awakens is basically a remake of A New Hope and I do agree on that. Some might have no problem with that and that's fine be me, but there were some call backs that felt a bit force (No pun intended). I already talked about how amazing the visual effect's look, but some effect's were a bit noticeable. I think some of the noticeable effect's were some of the CGI character's. But all that a side, the rest of the effect's was really good. Overall The Force Awakens is a great Star Wars movie and it feels good saying that. It's way way better than the prequels and Return of the Jedi. It's absolutely worth seeing. P.S. Here is something for those people who are going to spoil this movie for others. 'Those attempting to spoil Star Wars for others, know that it's the most attention you'll likely receive in life'. - Quote by Chris Stuckmann",7,6,18,22 December 2015
Unbroken," A well made film, with some broken parts in it
","If I Can Take It, I Can Make It. True words of wisdom right they.Unbroken is a true story about a Olympian and war hero Louis 'Louie' Zamperini played by (Jack O'Connell) who, along with two other crewmen, survived in a raft for 47 days after a near-fatal plane crash in WWII-only to be caught by the Japanese Navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp.Unbroken is directed by the Oscar wining actress Angelina Jolie, and this isn't the first she directed a film, yeah she directed one Documentary I think and she also did a film called 'In the Land of Blood and Honey', and what I heard these two films she did (Even the Documentary) was slammed and hated by everyone. I haven't really seen those two films (And I never will) but now she directs Unbroken and I can safely say that this movie was... okay. Not amazing. Not bad, just a simple okay. I know it's not very inspiring words 'it's Okay', but I being really honest here. If you ask me in person what I thought of this movie, I will say 'It's okay'. The Good: 2014 was the year for amazing cinematography and this movie has some gorgeous Cinematography. It's the same guy who did the Cinematography for Skyfall and this guy knows he to make my eyes melt every time I watch a film and his doing the Cinematography. There was many times where I said to myself 'How the hell did there get that shot', I know they used CG for some parts but for the parts that they didn't was CG was truly Oscar worthy Cinematography. Jack O'Connell is a true rising star so far in his career. In this movie he deliverers a fantastic and heart hitting performance and I like the fact that he showed all the pain, sadness and tiredness in his eyes in this movie, that made me feel sorry for this guy. Jack O'Connell played Louis Zamperinin so terrifically well that I wonder what else he's doing next after this because I what to see this guy in other films.Now let's talk about Angelina Jolie taking the directors chair. I know for a fact that Jolie had full respect for Louis. I sawed it photos and interviews, how she looked up to this man has her inspiration, and she directed this movie pretty good if I must say. She didn't directed this movie in a way that it feels to much like a Hollywood cash grab, no I can look at this movie and call it a war film and that's that. Unbroken to me might be a step up from Jolie directing career. I would love to see more from her directing skills and I bet she got a lot of hate and that must be really hard for her, but Louis Zamperinin once said 'Never give up. No matter what'.Now for the problems: Louis Zamperinin is a inspiring person who has been through hell most of his life and the fact that this guy kept going is truly remarkable, but in this movie he was just came off as a tough son of a b*tch and not really inspiring in a way that Louis was. The Prison camp in this movie wasn't really all that effective at all. Japanese prison in real life back then was a lot brutal and effectively shocking, but in this it wasn't and it would be more powerful if Louis stood out from the rest and became a leader to those jailed soldiers. Overall Unbroken may have a lot of problems with it's pasting and slow scenes, but the movie has good directing, terrific performance from Jack O'Connell and beautifully Cinematography.",6,0,1,11 January 2015
Godzilla," 'Let them fight'.
","The story is about a a gigantic beast looking to wreak havoc on mankind - and he may not be alone. This movie has one of the best visual effect's of the year by far, The fight scenes at the end are so epic and amazing I also cried with joy. And some critics have said the characters are boring but I didn't mind them. My favorite scene has to be the sky driving part and yeah I know it only lasted only 2 minutes but the music was scary and chilling and the cinematography was beautiful to look at. Godzilla looked awesome in the movie and the final fight at the end was so bad-ass and so much better then pacific Rim fight scenes. Godzilla's roar in this movie was loud and scary. a lot of people said Godzilla didn't do anything in this movie and I didn't know what there where talking about, Godzilla walked around a couple of times and kicked ass at the end.",7,18,34,10 October 2014
Deadpool," Deadpool - Movie Review
","Deadpool: 'From the studio that inexplicably sewed his f**king mouth shut the first time, comes... me!'.One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humor) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it's an A+ like Chris Stuckmann rated it or a masterpiece of all comic book movies, but did I have fun watching this movie? ABSOLUTELY. It's a film that fans wanted and got. I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and that's make the character of Deadpool he's own. He was terrific has the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it. The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated R and not some water down PG- 13 movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated PG-13, then you really don't know the character at all. I'm taking to you Grace Randolph. Just because some little eight year old boy (who probably doesn't know who Deadpool really is), whats to see the movie, but can't because he's not old enough to see it, doesn't mean it should be changed to a PG-13 for someone who doesn't even know the character of Deadpool. These fans have waited 7 or 8 years for this character to be done right, so this little boys mother should teach him some patience. Now for the flaws: How much better would this movie be if it had visual comedy. I mean Edge Wright should seriously do a Marvel movie, because I know for a fact that he will make the best Marvel movie ever when it comes to it's comedy, pasting and execution (something that Age of Ultron couldn't do). I highly recommend seeing Every Frame and Printing video on 'How to do Visual comedy', because Tony Zhou knows some much about movies better then I do. But that's what I felt was missing in this movie and I know this is Tim Millers first big film (And an impressive one as well), but I'm just saying that it would be really brilliant if there was visual comedy in a movie with Deadpool. While I did think the writing was great, but some of the jokes in the movie I didn't find that funny. And no, it's not because I didn't get it or I didn't understand the reference, because all of the jokes and reference in this movie I understood clearly, it's just that I didn't find some of it funny.Overall Deadpool is a fresh, entertaining comic book movie that it's hard for any comic book lover not to like this movie. You bet I'll be seeing the squeal when it comes out since I know it's in good hands.",6,2,9,18 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman is simple awesome
","So Fifty shades of F***ing Sh*t top this movie at the box office where 50 shades got everything wrong and there's nothing good about it, but Kingsman got a lot of good things to talk about so at the end of the day Kingsman win.The story is about a street-wise punk with a set of fast hands (and a faster mouth), finds himself recruited by an underground spy agency. If he can pass their test, he will be one of the new initiated into their ranks - just a threat from a twisted tech genius threatens the world.Every since the first trailer for this movie came out I already known that this movie was going to be great because Matthew Vaughn directing it and that guy knows how to make a well made film that reminds everyone what good movies are, and that's why these no surprise that this movie was awesome.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a like tribute to good spy films that seem to be serious or not very well made these day, yeah they where cheesy and goof but that's what we remember best from them and this movie was the perfect tribute to that, and a perfect tribute that everybody isn't going to see because everybody is going to see 50 Shades of Rubbish, I just lose faith in humility after that.Matthew Vaughn to me is a director who knows how to direct good action scenes and knows how to entertain the audience, and with this movie he directed this with style and a enough effort to make a bad-ass film, even when his movies mostly flop at the box office it will have a cult following and Kingsman will have a cult following. Nice work Matthew Vaughn.Jack Davenport who is a new star and this is his first big role his every been in and my god was he great in this movie. This is my first time I ever seen this guy act and let me tell you this guy has a bright future a head for him.Now at the first I didn't really thought that Colin Firth kicking ass would work, but after seeing the movie I was wrong..dead wrong. Every time Colin Firth was in a action scenes I bought it because I heard in a article that he did all of his stunts and I got to say he pulled it of brilliantly. His character Harry Hart was the best character in the whole film and every time his on screen he stole the whole film for me.Samuel L. Jackson has the villain was just spot on brilliant, I mean talking about a villain that was fun and freaking hilarious. But at the first I wasn't very sure about the way he talked in the film, he talked like Adam Snadler from WaterBoy, but after a while I got use to it and it worked for his character. These days I feel that Samuel L. Jackson is just filling it in with his new movies, but in this I actually sawed him playing and caring about his character and he knocked it out of the park.This movie probably has one of the best action scene I've seen since...I'm not kidding you here but The Matrix, and that's the Church scene. May god way do I even begin with this, the scene itself was fast paste but I still could see what was going on and that action scene was shot beautifully well and it showed what action should be filmed. So watch when you see the film look out for the Church scene it will not disappoint.Now for problems and I only have some: I got to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie I didn't really get sucked in into the movie that much, but as the movie went along I finally got into it.Overall Kingsman is a movie that deserves more attraction, skip 50 Shade of Whatever and see this movie, trust me this movie is more well made than 50 shades.",7,3,11,21 February 2015
Minions," Good for kids and for the family, but not for me
","My face while watching this movie (-_-)The story is about the origins of the Minions, the little, yellow creatures have always attached themselves to the most ambitious, powerful super villain with one mission - serve them with all their might. But when the masters are killed, the Minions find themselves without a purpose and thus go into a self-imposed exile. After years, the Minions finally return and in the 60's attends a super villain conference where they hope to find a new master - and the first female super villain Scarlett Overkill seems to be the obvious choice.Who the hell doesn't love those little yellow one eye or two eye minions. They made Despicable Me one and two watchable and stole the show for us. Minions have become a fan favorite and everybody couldn't get enough of them and now they got they very own stand alone movie starring them of course. I was looking forward to this movie, I mean the trailers looked funny and yes the real reason is for Minions. I thought a full feature movie starring them would be a blast to watch as in the Despicable Me movies they are good with they slap stick humor. Now after seeing the movie I'm a bit disappointed of what we got.The movies animation is stunning as always. Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment never seem to disappoint me when it comes to animation and the little details with the model for the characters or just stuff in the background, they always look great and well made. I bet they animation will still look fantastic in the late future. The Minions themselves are once again enjoyable to watch. They humor and slap stick are just the same in Despicable Me movies put I got a issue with the slap stick in the movie as the movie is focus on the Minions and they do they normal slap stick humor and it dose get a bit old and kind of stale after a while. In the Despicable Me movies the Minions only have a small screen time when it comes to they slap stick humor and it's funny all the time, but a full feature movie of all that got kind of old to me. It's was the same thing over and over again to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. You may like the slap stick humor for a full feature movie, but for me it got old really quick.Sandra Bullock as the villain of the movie was decent enough, but nothing really special. It wasn't terrible or anything amazing, it was on the level of okay. Sandra Bullock is a great actress and even when she's in a bad or okay movie she normally dose a great job in the movie and here she did the best she could and I give her that. Not one of her best but it's decent enough to let it pass.This is a good movie for kids and for the whole family. It's cute, it's bright, colorful and enjoyable and I can see why some people may enjoy it. You may think I got a cold heart for giving this movie a rating like this and your right.Overall this isn't a bad movie and yes you may look at the rating and straight away think it's awful, but really it's not bad but it's nowhere near good. I was looking forward to this movie as I thought this may be this years second best animated movie, but to me it sadly fell flat. But hey, who knows you may like it and yes I do say that a lot but it's true. I get lots of people who have seen my review and gone to see the movie and came back with a different opinion compared to my own. If you disagree with me that's fine, but at the end of the day I'm sticking of what I said.",5,7,13,29 June 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," A fantastic Drama peace
","Ethan Coen and Joel Coen has to be two masterclass director's and writers in movie media, and I said that back in my older reviews of these two.The story to Inside Llewyn Davis is about a trip through New York's folk music scene in the 1960s as a singer-songwriter does his best to make it through these times.Every time the Coen brothers release a new movie I always expect something great from them as they other films never let me down and always top my exception. With Inside Llewyn Davis it's a road trip film with little comedy this and there, and once again the Coen brothers showed off how talent they truly are, because this movie is freaking fantastic.I have to be honest here but I didn't know who Oscar Isaac was before watching this movie. I couple of times I heard someone brought up his name but that's it really, didn't know who he was so when I watched this movie my first thought when I saw his acting and singing was 'I want to see him in more films', because this guy is just brilliant and I'm a bit disappointing of myself for not seeing his other films in the past. His character can come off a bit of a douche at times but he played the role so well and breath so much life into it that I actually liked him, all because of Oscar Isaac.The directing and the writing by the Coen brothers and do I need say more, I'm running out of things to say about this two masters of filmmakers. The movie is was written really well and once again I'm can't find anything else to say of what I ready said before in my other past reviews. The songs in this movie are probably some of the best music I've heard in a while and it was really catcher as well.I love the way this film looks, you know that bright, clean looking and gorgeous to look at cinematography that stands out. The cinematography in this movie is just utterly spectacular. every shot looks like it took forever to get the perfect shot and a lot of hard work went into this to get, but the people who did the cinematography in this movie pulled it off perfectly and no wonder they got a Oscar nomination for it.My only small little nick pick with the film is the John Goodman character (Roland Turner) Now don't get me wrong I like John Goodman has a actor and as a person , but I didn't feel like he fitted in the film, that might just be me but his character just kind of show up and then goes and never brought up again. Overall Inside Llewyn Davis is a fanatic drama peace with a lot of amazing things to experience in this film.",9,0,2,21 December 2014
Spectre," Spectre - Movie Review
","Mr. White: 'You are a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr Bond'.The story in Spectre is about a cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation. While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre.So I've just seen 'Spectre' a few days ago and it was pretty good. It wasn't as fantastic as Casino Royale or Skyfall, but it's nowhere near Quantum of Solace. This was my most anticipated movie of 2015 and it didn't disappoint.Sam Mendes returns as director and once again he impresses me with the type of film making he uses in this film, because when the first sentence started and he uses the one take shot again I was impressed. Mendes uses the same film making from Skyfall in this movie and it's great. Nicely done Sam Mendes. What I notice straight away when the movie started is it's homages and references from previous Bond films. This is a nice touch and it never felt force like some movies. It was fitting and it blended well into the film.Daniel Craig once again nails it as Bond and in my personal opinion, I think he's the best Bond we've ever had. All through out the Bond films, Craig isn't just the good looking martini drinking lady's man, Craig really puts a lot into his character that made him much different to the other Bonds that we had. Making Bond a human being who feels pain and loss really adds to the character as we can relate to him better. I don't know if Daniel Craig would return as Bond (As I speak) but I hope he dose, because Daniel Craig is magnificent as James Bond.The one thing that I was really looking forward to seeing is Christoph Waltz as the villain, because if you haven't see him in Inglorious Bastards then do yourself a favor and watch it, because he played such an amazing villain in that film. When I first heard the news about Waltz playing a Bond villain I was like 'Yes, that's perfect. Can't wait to see it'. And after seeing the movie and he's performance I can say that Waltz did a terrific performance as this menacing villain. He's not one of the best Bond villains of all time like: Le Chiffre, Francisco Scaramanga, Auric Goldfinger or Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Yes, I know that Waltz character is basically Ernst Stavro Blofeld in this film, but he never tried to fully copy him in anywhere as he tried to do something new with the material that was given to him. Christoph Waltz did a great performance as the villain.Léa Seydoux was also great in this movie. She played a strong female character that can kick some ass at times. Still better than the female characters in the Roger Moore movies, I mean the female characters in those movie were complete tools that needed a man to save them all the time. I'm so glad we've moved on from that. Now Sam Smith's 'Writing on the Wall', was a song that I wasn't such a big off at the first. I don't know, I guess I was so use to the other Bond themes that we usually get in every film. But I must say that I actually like the song and the intro that we got in this film. The song really did fit well into this movie and the intro was pretty good as well. The action was good, rest of the cast were great, the cinematography was excellent and the movie is 148 minutes long and it never felt long to me. Now for the problems: There were some scenes in this movie that felt a bit rushed and one of those scenes was the ending. Dave Bautista was awesome in the movie, but I do wish there was more of him. Some of the actions scenes were a bit lackluster at times.Overall Spectre is an enjoyable Bond flick with some little miss steps. This movie could have been just as great as Skyfall, but I still think Skyfall and Casino Royale are better movies if I have to compare it to Spectre. I highly recommend seeing Spectre, but please don't go in expecting it to be better than Skyfall or Casino Royale.",6,10,30,29 October 2015
Joy," Joy - Movie Review
","Joy: 'We got here from hard work, patience, and humility. Don't think the world owes you anything because the world owes you nothing'.The story is about a Long Island single mother who had to fight every inch of the way when she came up with the Miracle Mop - a self- wringing design that turned her into one of the most successful entrepreneurs in America.So I've just seen David O. Russell's new film 'Joy' and it was pretty disappointing. This is coming from a guy who wanted this movie to be brilliant and it was on my most anticipated movie of December, but it sadly didn't live up to that exceptions.You had no idea how much I wanted 'Joy' to be a great movie and also how I wanted it to be David O. Russell's best film, because while I wasn't a big fan of American Hustle (after re-watching a few times) but I thought this movie will bring him back to his old roots, because I've notice he picks style over substance in his last movie (Silver Linings Playbook isn't one of them). The story in the movie seemed to be laid back for David O. Russell, so he doesn't go too carried away with the style he presents in his movies. And there are a few good shots, creative camera work in some scenes, and that's really it. He dose nothing to the story that made it exciting or even interesting. I like David O. Russell as a director, I really do, but this guy is pretty far away from flawless.Jennifer Lawrence performance was the one thing that wasn't disappointing. She did a great and strong performance in this movie, but her Long Island accent was a bit off at times and you may think that the actually person herself that Lawrence is playing (Joy Mangano) sounds like that, well I did my research and let me tell you no, she doesn't. But all that side, she did a solid performance and she was the only likable character in this movie. Great work Lawrence.The story itself isn't that interesting coming to think of it. Just reading the story of what the movie is about isn't that engaging, but I thought with a huge cast like this, David O. Russell behind the camera and the trailers made it look promising, because maybe these more to this story that we don't know about, but in the movie stuff happens and are main character is going through hell...oh and these the unlikable characters in Joys life. This story is loosely based on Joy Mangano life.I didn't give a single crap about any of the character in this movie and that's this movie biggest flaw. All of characters (expect Joy) feels like movie characters and every time their say something it wasn't convincing and didn't feel real. Not once did I feel attached to any of these characters. Theses a lot of characters in this movie played by big name actors, but I just wished it was written and executed better.The first half of the movie didn't really know what it wanted to be. It was very scatted as it goes back and forward showing what Joys family life was like. All of that is trying to do some character development or just to flesh out her character, but I wish those flashbacks had a purpose in the rest of the story, as I felt it was thrown in there.Overall 'Joy' isn't a bad movie, I mean Jennifer Lawrence basically saves this movie from getting a much lower rating from me. The movie looked good, it was well shot at times and even when I didn't like the characters in the movie, I still thought the actors where good. I wanted to like this movie but sadly, it was a mess.",5,4,11,29 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge - Movie Review
","LIFF30 2016 #3'In peace, sons bury their fathers. In war, fathers bury their sons'.Hacksaw Ridge may seem like another Oscar bait 'true story' biopic that we get every couple of years. The trailers didn't help at all, as it made the film look corny and very award bait. But guys trust on this, it's nothing like that. There's nothing glamorous about this. When it was over, I left was speechless. This is such a great movie.Say what you want about Mel Gibson controversial past and behavior, but I think we must judge the art, not the artist. This guy is an excellent director and a great actor. And you have no idea how glad I am seeing Mel back, as he is the most talented man in Hollywood right now. The most impressive part of Mel's directing in this movie (besides the battle scenes), is he's decision of an old version approach to the film making. The movie literally looks and feels like it was made around the 50's. Also how Gibson would let actors deliver the emotion of what their feeling and it could meant a lot of things that isn't just terrified. It could be happy, regret, or just thinking of home. And I got all of that. Andrew Garfield is an actor that's been non-stop blowing me away recently. And he gives one hell of performance as Desmond Doss. I would say it's one of his best since 'The Social Network'. Even in the battle scenes I thought he was brilliant, as he had this scared, tired, but brave look to him. He's accent in the film I thought worked pretty well and wasn't distracting like I thought it would. The chemistry between Garfield and Teresa Palmer was so charming and sweet that it didn't came of too corny. Hugo Weaving plays Desmond father in the movie and he was outstanding. Such a powerful and emotional heavy performance. Weaving is the type of actor that deserves so much respect. I mean, we all know him as Agent Smith, V, Megatron, Elrond, and Red Skull. But for him to give a small supporting performance as the alcoholic father who's dealing with conflicted within was quite moving. Vince Vaughn was so good in this movie that I wish he would come back for dramatic roles, as I really did brought his performance in this. The comedic one lines were pure gold and it was very 'Full Metal Jacket'. But he isn't like that the whole movie. When he's serious in the movie, it actually works and doesn't feel out of place for the rest of the tone. Now the battle scenes in the movie...wow, it's pretty rough and disturbing. It's right up there with 'Saving Private Ryan' for graphic and shocking depictions. What I always love in these type of War films is the loud sound, actors, and the camera work, which this movie nails at. I've heard some people say that the movie glorify's it's violence despite the theme of the movie being against violence. I honestly think these people have really missed the point here. All the battle scenes are depicted more as this horrible event than a flawless victory. After the movie was over, everyone in the cinema started clapping. The last time that happened was when in saw 'Up' back in 2009. While I never saw the point of clapping or booing at a movie, but for this occasion, I'll let it Slide. The ending was a very nice touch and pretty heartfelt to honor the soldiers that fought in the war. It was deserved. I haven't got a lot of issues with the movie. But if had to pick, I would probably say that Sam Worthington Australia accent kept slipping in and out in a few scenes. And don't get me wrong, Worthington isn't bad in the movie, but he was pretty good. The same can go to some of cast (as most of them are Australia), but I can easily look past it as the actual performances were all great. Overall rating: 'Hacksaw Ridge' is not perfect, but it positives really do weigh out it's flaws. It's the best War movie I've seen in awhile in terms of it's execution and pay off.",7,4,8,14 November 2016
The Martian," The Martian is absolutely worth checking out
","Mark Watney: 'F**k you Mars'.The story is about astronaut Mark Watney is separated from his party following a fierce storm and left behind after being presumed dead. But he has survived and with few supplies, he will have to rely on his own ingenuity to survive and figure out a way to Earth that he is still alive.You can slap Ridley Scott's name on anything and everyone (including me) will go see it. It's so awesome that you still can go to the cinema today and see a new film directed by the guy who brought us Alien, now that's freaking awesome. But Ridley can be a hit or miss with the movies that he's releasing recently such as: Robin Hood, The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings, but Prometheus (In my opinion) was pretty good and I know a lot of people may not like that movie and that's okay if you didn't like it, but I did. When I first heard about The Martian being directed by Ridley Scott, I was exciting but nervous at the same time, because as I said before about Ridley being a mix bag recently. But I kept a positive and open mind, I mean this might be the film that Ridley Scott finally went back to he's roots from the good old days. After seeing The Martian on my first viewing I liked it, but I wasn't amazed by it. It's not until the movie actually started to grow on me as I thought about it more and more, and now after thinking about it for awhile now, I can safely say that The Martian is a great movie. Ridley Scott's back everyone.Matt Damon plays Mark Watney brilliantly in this movie and this might actually be the best performance I've seen from Damon. He's hilarious, always positive and never gives up even when a lot of things don't go quite as planned, he always finds away. I also love how Damon's character can crack a joke there and then even when he's in this horrible situation; and to me it made he's character more relatable and likable. This is Matt Damon finest work as he was terrific in this movie.Ridley Scott's directing in this movie was absolutely magnificent and this has to be one of he's best films in years. The movie isn't all hilarious as there were some real suspenseful scenes in this movie, but what I thought was so brilliantly well done is that Ridley Scott mixed the humor and the suspense perfectly together. Nicely done Ridley. The rest of cast: Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ekiofor were all freaking great in this movie. Everyone in this movie was great.The writing has to be the biggest strength in this whole movie, because it was clever, funny, never lost me attention and it had a fantastic sense of humor to itself. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly as I felt that The Martian needed this type of tone. Now for the problems: My only flaw in this movie is this 25 minute sequence where it cuts back to earth with the NASA crew talking about different ways of bringing Mark back, but the stuff on Mars was more interesting. I'm not saying it was bad as the earth stuff scene was handled well and it was very well acted, but I was more interested on the stuff that was happening on Mars with Damon's character. Overall The Martian is absolutely worth checking out. This is Ridley Scott's and Matt Damon's best work in years. It's beautifully shot, well acted and a entertaining movie.",6,10,22,7 October 2015
Furious 7," Team is the new family
","For PaulFurious 7 follows the death of his brother at the hands of Dominic Toretto and his eclectic crew, the cold, calculated Ian Shaw vows vengeance - and no one is safe from his reach.I think we all know what to expect from the Fast and the Furious films by now. Yeah they stupid and the law of physics dose not exist in these movies, but the movies are so enjoyable when it comes to it's action and it's extremely cheesy one liners that all the law of physics stuff will fly pass your head just like that. Now here is the 7th movie in the franchises would you believe it well I wouldn't and who better to director it than the man who usual dose horror films James Wan, and him taking the directing chair was a nice move to do.Now the one thing I was a bit worried about is how Jame Wan was going to handle the action in the movie but then I remembered he did Death Sentence and got a little interested. After seeing the movie I can say it pulled off perfectly as the action scenes looked net and well put together when it came to the big action scenes.The cast and crew all return and some of them are not the greatest actors on the plant like Dwayne Johnson and many more, but just like Arnold Schwarzenegger you know they not the greatest but you like seeing them on the big screen because they always seem to be so likable that your happy to see them anywhere.Jason Statham as the villain is basically Jason Statham acting all tough and mean for the movie.Now early I brought up that the laws of physics dose exist in this movie, well for this movie this is the perfect time to bring up turning your brain off and enjoy what's on screen and I know it's hard for so people to do that (Like myself) but if you want to get through this movie without questing everything with characters getting into car crashes and walking out of it fine without a mark on them, just saying.Now during filming of this movie the late great Paul Walker sadly passed way due to a car crash. Now Paul isn't my top pick for best actors but I really do respect the guy and I heard nothing but great things about him of how nice he is and always seem like his in a good mood. It must have been really hard for the cast to continue after his death with all of them know him so well. Vin Diesel spoke out of how hard it was for him and for him to break down in front of everybody in a movie premiere about his best friend or brother he likes to call it that is no longer with us, Imagine that for a moment and let that sink in.The movie dose do a tribute at the end and I won't lie it almost brought a tear in my eye because it was just perfect and so moving that it was a good send off to Paul Walker. So from me to you Paul farewell.For problems with the movie are very basically to be honest with the dialogue and some of the quick shot editing that everybody can spot straight away from problems, but at the end of the day this is like a 90's action movie with the cheese and goofiness with a little salt of heart to it.",6,0,17,8 April 2015
The Godfather," Such a freaking classic.
","Don Vito Corleone: 'You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?'. The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is.",10,6,10,10 October 2014
