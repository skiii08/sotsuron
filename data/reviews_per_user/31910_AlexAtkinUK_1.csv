It," Lacks the subtly of the mini-series and the comedy is badly misplaced
","What made the mini-series great was it relied mostly on your own imagination to drive the horror, the visuals were very subtle and you were never quite sure what happened to the kids until the end.This re-make throws all that away in favour of very graphical horror, something you can see it almost any other horror movie out there.The comedy is also really awkward and feels extremely misplaced in a story that is supposed to be deathly serious.",3,2,4,11 October 2017
