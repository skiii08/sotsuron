Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious!
","I missed the first advance screening last month, so I was sure to be first in line for the second advance screening!! Anyway, this film perfectly blends a scripted story with Borat's unscripted encounters to be a film that is definitely the funniest (and most offensive) movie of the year. A great 'road trip' movie, imagine 'Up in Smoke' meets 'Jackass'. Any fan of Sascha Cohen will definitely be pleased, and unsuspecting viewers will watch this movie with their jaws wide open.I'm not even sure which scenes were scripted and which ones were real? Does anybody else out there know?",10,156,326,9 May 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Very disappointing (if you compare it to the stage version)
","As one of my favorite musicals, I was looking forward to finally seeing ST on the big screen. Maybe my expectations were too high, but the movie fell flat for me. The music and direction were top-notch, but in the end it all falls on the title character -- in essence, Johnny Depp is no Sweeney Todd. With not much of a singing voice (he song-spoke many of his numbers), I kept thinking he was Jack Sparrow as a barber. Not much range for the man, I'm afraid.Of course, the biggest abonimation is the omission of the title track for the show!!! Yes... the song 'Tale of Sweeney Todd' is not in 'Sweeney Todd'! How would you like to see 'The Sound of Music' without the title track??? Ugh!!!I'd be interested in hearing from 'first-time viewers' of the story, but as for a self-avowed ST fan, I found the film version very disappointing.",4,10,82,13 December 2007
Dodgeball," Dumb and stupid 'guy humor'.... but hilarious!!!
","Okay, it's not 'art', but 'Dodgeball' was consistently funny and kept me giggling throughout. Vaughn's dead-pan to Stiller's over-the-top bully was fantastic. Yes it followed the traditional 'sports underdog' formula but it made fun of the formula as it was going along, so you knew they were in on the joke too.This is probably not a date-movie, and I would probably suggest sneaking in a beer (if you can), but I was laughing from beginning to end, and it was good light-hearted summer entertainment without computer-generated super-heroes or villains. Check it out!By the way, be sure to stay until the end of the credits for an 'extra feature' from Ben Stiller... very funny!!!! :)",9,0,0,18 June 2004
