The Avengers," Great movie
","'Marvels The Avengers' sounded like a movie that I would just not be in to because of the fact that it has to do with a bunch of superheroes but all in to one movie. To be honest, that is just not my kind of movie. Once it was announced in our class that we would be watching it I was not excited at all, all I thought was that I was really going to be bored and just want to sleep the whole time, but that was not the case. The movie really was intriguing and really snatched your attention right up.The fact that Joss Whedon was able to put all of the superhero movies that everybody knows and loves all in to one movie and make it all fall into place without changing any of the characters in anyways was really a great thing. The movie also was just not an ordinary action filled movie with the same old action that all those types of movies carry; it had so much more and was so much more advanced in every single way. The graphics, the special effects, the fighting scenes, and every little detail was so precise and on target. Nothing ever let me down in this movie that I thought should change or be different. All in all now when it comes down to this type of movie I know I will not judge it just because of the fact that it is an action filled movie that comes from comic books because who knows, it could be really good just like 'The Avengers' was.The only bad review that I would give the movie is that in the beginning it was a little hard to follow. Especially if you are person watching it for the first time and don't really follow all of the other movies that are put in to it. My only advice would be in the beginning to show who the characters are and what they were all about so some of the viewers watching the movie for the first time can follow a little easier and not have to take the time to figure out what exactly is happening and who the people are that are playing the characters like Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and etc. At first in the movie I didn't know what actor was playing the Hulk so that really confused me. Over all, this movie was a really great action packed movie that portrayed to be a really good attention grabber.",10,1,4,18 November 2012
