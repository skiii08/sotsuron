The New World," Y-a-w-n-n-n
","If you want a REAL soporific movie, go see Terrence Malick's latest. He has this obsession with photographing water and sky, preferably against the sunlight, so the color is washed out, i.e. bad Technicolor. He's also got the clich√© beloved by arty cinematographers: the gigantic moon, bigger than you or I will ever see it, unless we launch into outer space . Whether it's Guadacanal or ole' Virginy, Malick lets his camera drift on and on. He must figure he's creating a significant pastorale reading of history, but in effect it's plain boring. It would help us viewers if the dialog were louder than the musical track. I suspect that Malick distrusts speech and would feel more comfortable making silents. The music track borrow shamelessly from Wagner's Rhine music from his 'Ring'. Appropriately, it never resolves itself into exciting drama the way Wagner wrote it.",5,2,6,20 January 2006
Mission: Impossible III," What's a nice Catholic Church like you doing in a film like this?
","Maggie O attends a 'do' at the Vatican half-undressed in a dress that's slit down the side. Pahleezee! In real life she'd never slither past the Swiss Guard, let alone the papal staff, which makes women tourists cover their arms.When the Tom Cruise character checks in to fly to Singapore, he's disguised as a hippie. How did he pass through security without his hippie photo I.D.?Unless you like car crashes and explosions, the film is utterly flimsy and unbelievable. The only part I half-way enjoyed was the mayhem on the bridge. Apparently because the TC character is always on the run, he only whispers his dialog.",3,2,5,10 May 2006
Alexander," B-O-R-I-N-G
","I saw this turkey on Thanksgiving. And it occurred to me that whereas millions of dollars and a cast of millions can generate a lousy film, the best film of this year has, in effect, only two characters in it -- 'Before Sunrise'. Stone's film also revived a memory of another Alexander treatment, the one with Richard Burton as the Macedonian conqueror. It wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but I do recall one scene that was better than any in Stone's version: Burton's Alexander had his soldiers intermarry with the women in the countries they conquered. The camera panned down through the two files of grooms and brides, showing us in one shot how Alexander planted Greek culture throughout the Middle East.",Null,1,3,25 November 2004
