The Blair Witch Project," CRAZYNESS!!!!
","My buddy (name withheld for commercial reasons) brought this movie to our house for us to watch. We had no idea what we were about to embark on. All he told us was that it was a documentary on witches. Needless to say that was the least of what he could have told us. This movie scared me sooooo bad, that my heart was beating faster than it ever has. I can't stop thinking about the damn thing. I would advise anyone who wants a good (and real)  scare to watch it. They did such a good job with this movie that we all thought it was real and were some-what bitter for watching it. I couldn't sleep until I found out the story (real/fake) behind it. That just goes to show you what an awesome movie this was. It better win some presigious awards.",Null,1,2,27 May 1999
