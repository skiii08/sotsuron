Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Neither Jar-Jar or the movie were as bad as I was led to believe
","I enjoyed this movie very much.  It is not as bad as many have said. Jar-Jar is not as annoying as the hype.  Darth Maul was not defeated too easily, a guy got killed doing it.  It was exciting with good special effects and plot.  I look forward to the next episodes.",Null,0,0,7 June 1999
Cube," People who liked this move, get a life!
","This movie would have been worth watching if we had been given an explanation of what the cube was, why it was there, why its inhabitants were put there, etc.  Without closure this film has no value, and only a closet sadist would be satisfied with the end.",Null,0,1,19 April 1999
