Requiem for a Dream," Amazing
","Just watched it about 2 hours ago. I think this one is gonna take a while to heal. Was watching it with my father, we didn't say nothing at all while watching it, glued to our seats. It bumped up my heart for about 5 minutes at the climax. The way they edited this film really helps out to shock the audience. That jump from one shot to another, with no smooth change, with that freaking awful music, the lights going on and out, the different shots they make, just amazingly well done. Just loved it. Really got the point of the movie i think, and i would recommend it to anyone who is willing to be shocked and to have a great bad time.",10,1,2,16 January 2005
Million Dollar Baby," why this move sucks (spoilers???)
","Well, i might have better reasons for this picture not winning any of those awards.The plot its sol linear, so boringly American, like all clich√©s movies they sell like hot bread, but suddenly, Mr. Eastwood decides to give it an European movie look, by doing treating in such a lame way with euthanasia, a subject so much worked out in movies like Mar Adentro by Alejandro amenabar, and Les invasions barbares (barbarian invasions) that really lets this boring and senseless movie in the street.this is just not the way you treat a subject like euthanasia. I think i enjoyed Eastwood a lot more in his wild wild west movies, that 'trying' to act like a serious man, with that rock face he has, that looks really stupid, even for an ex boxer, his character",Null,3,9,21 March 2005
