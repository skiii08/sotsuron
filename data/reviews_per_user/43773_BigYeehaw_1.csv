10 Cloverfield Lane," Just skip the last 10 minutes.
","Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets in a car accident and wakes up in a strange room. This room is part of Howard's (John Goodman) bunker. He tells her that he found the car wreck and took her with him to his bunker. In there with them is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who fought his way into the bunker and now he lives there as well.And that's about it, 3 people living in bunker, really minimalistic but it works really well! We see things through the perspective of Michelle so we know as much as her. There are a lot of questions that need answering like 'Who are these people?' and 'Are we really unable to go to the surface?'. A lot of tension is created through the behaviour of Howard, he might seem like a nice guy but you can't help to feel a bit uneasy when he's on screen. So Michelle and Emmett plan to escape.Until this point, the movie is very good but following their escape, it goes down the drain completely. So Michelle escapes and it turns out that nothing really happened to the earth so Howard just kidnapped them and made up a story so they wouldn't leave. This is where the movie should've ended in my opinion, a great ending! But oh no, it continues.It ends with Michelle fighting of aliens because they had to spend their 15 million budget on something right? So it ends with her destroying some alien spaceship and driving off into the distance.I really enjoyed this movie up until the ending so I would suggest just skipping it. It could've been a 9 but I'll just have to give 10 Cloverfield Lane a 7.",7,1,2,15 May 2019
