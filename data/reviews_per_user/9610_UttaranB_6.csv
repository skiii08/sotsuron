Despicable Me 2," One of those Rare Sequels...
","This film is definitely one of the best films of the year, if not THE BEST!!! Right from the word go, it captures your imagination and by the end it captures your heart also...ACTION: Superb.COMEDY: Couldn't be better.CREATIVITY: Not as much as in the first film but still more than enough for a memorable watch.DULL MOMENTS: NONE!!The film, however, does not quite relate to its title, but that does not distract you from all the fun feast throughout.Hats off to all the cast and crew members for pulling off one of those rare sequels that outclass their predecessors!",8,10,19,9 July 2013
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," An epic biopic
","A wonderful cinematic recreation of history!Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra knows just how much to add of each ingredient - drama, comedy, and of course the true story of the legendary Flying Sikh - to keep this within the realms of a film and yet transcend the boundaries of movie-making. He makes you realize the struggles and the horror Milkha Singh had to overcome in his journey to become what he is today. He makes you feel for Milkha Singh like a fellow human being, a man with feelings and flaws of his own. He makes you root for the man to succeed and celebrate with him when he does.And of course, Mehra's portrayal of Milkha Singh probably wouldn't have been half as believable if it weren't for Farhan Akhtar's outstanding performance. Maybe his character was in reel, but his perspiration was definitely real. 10/10!",10,2,3,19 August 2013
Man of Steel," Not just another 'Superman' movie, but something better...
","'Man of Steel' has opened to largely positive reviews and it is certainly a compelling enough watch. Like in The Dark Knight trilogy, where Nolan added shades to Bruce Wayne to make him a 'Dark Knight' and not simply a 'Batman', here also director Zack Snyder uplifts Clark Kent to become a 'Man of Steel', not simply a 'Superman' who flies the skies and is often confused with a bird or a plane.The movie beautifully showcases Clark Kent's journey from being an under-confident young lad who felt every bit an outcast as he perhaps actually was to becoming a beacon of hope for all - the one they eventually call the SUPERMAN.Henry Cavill has given a brilliant performance as the Man of Steel and has really made the character his own. Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Michael Shannon and all the other casts have also played their individual roles perfectly.However, the movies is lacking logic at some points and may have done better with less-drawn action sequences. But overall it manages to get through the story it tries to tell quite nicely and for that I give it 7/10.It is certainly worth a watch!!",7,1,1,23 June 2013
Inside Out," Funny, Poignant and Emotionally Fulfilling
","I went with high hopes to this film after having watched the magic and beauty of 'Up' created by the same team. And I wasn't disappointed.The entire concept of an alternate reality within the brain is a stroke of marvelous creativity, and the way the story turned and twisted around unexpected corners made the watch engaging and fulfilling. This is a story that dazzles with its onset, evolves with its progress and leaves a feeling of warmth with its conclusion.Throughout the storytelling there is a sense of innocence that makes the characters all the more likable. The complexities of the human psyche have been boiled down to five principle emotions who begin as simple one-dimensional characters and mature by experiencing loss and achievement in their own individual ways - which is the true essence of growing up.All in all, this is a story well thought out and equally well presented, making this a complete film and easily one of the best from Pixar so far.",10,10,38,30 June 2015
Inception," A Real 'Inception'
","It takes a highly creative mind to consistently keep thinking out- of-the-box. It takes a compelling story-teller to make you comprehend those thoughts. And it takes a lot of hard-work, dedication and perseverance to convert that story to reel. Put it all together and you have a gist of what went into creating 'Inception'. And the results speak for themselves!A seamless, 'many-layered' film, 'Inception' is on one hand a dazzling extravaganza of Science and Technology and on the other, an emotional drama, with the internal conflicts of the lead characters threading through the scenes and binding the entire plot together.This film is no exception to Nolan's unique ability of non-linear story-telling, and it takes a little getting used to. However, once you have an idea of what's going on, you cannot help but marvel at the grandeur and brilliance of it all.Leonardo DiCaprio excelled as the highly-talented but incapacitated mastermind of the group. Ellen Page was right up to the mark playing the young, fresh and at times irritatingly inquisitive 'newbie' of the group. Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's on-screen chemistry was fun to watch. Marion Cotillard and Cilian Murphy had more or less one-dimensional roles to play and they played them okay.Overall, 'Inception' is definitely worth watching, and then watching again, and again. It will make you ponder deeper about the realms of the human mind in all senses of the phrase. True to its name, this is a real 'inception' of Nolan's and has the power to change the way we think.",10,0,1,11 November 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," A Beautifully Portrayed Saga of Life
","This is not just a film. This is not just a work of art that transcends the black and white of human outlook to caste, justice and freedom and paints the human soul in all its true colors. This is not just life set in motion that takes us through it all - jealousy, hopelessness, irony, tragedy, monotony, inspiration, perseverance, success, and the unending miracle that is life itself. This is all of these and more.'The Shawshank Redemption' is as much about the story it tells as about the way it tells it. We have to really immerse ourselves to understand and share the protagonist's exuberance of redemption that is the principal focal point of the entire film. And the slow and steady unfolding of events in an apparent idyllic manner makes it very easy for us viewers to get engrossed into this wonderfully threaded, emotionally rich story.All the actors in the film were in perfect tune with one another. Never for once did any of them give an impression that this is a work of fiction and not a true incident captured on camera in real time. Tim Robbins is easily the finest of the cast, portraying the initially deranged, subsequently fearful and tentative, and ultimately the emancipated Andy Dufresne with total compulsion. Morgan Freeman is equally captivating as the wise and ever-supportive 'Red' Redding, with his wry indifference to the sufferings of life, which finally gives way plain and raw happiness at his own emancipation.This is a film that makes us appreciate the beauty and subtlety of life, soothes our soul, gives us hope and inspires us to keep trying till we reach our own 'redemption' - our own freedom from the failures that bind us to the success that we always crave. This is film of life, for life, and a film to live by.",10,0,0,11 November 2014
