Skyfall," Bond is back
","Some people thought Daniel Craig was too much like Bourne and the Bond style film had been abandoned. If you were worried about that fear not - Bond is back.The film has great stunts & thrills - you'll see this in the long opening sequence. Bond is not burdened with gadgets and still has lots of energy.Ignore the plot credibility (not as far fetched as some plots like Moonraker) and usual level of general film fiction where it comes to computing.All the characters are great, from the MI6 team members to the villain (Silva) who acts like a traditional Bond villain. It is very easy to provide details and reveal the plot - the way the trailer was edited means it has not given too much away.This film will provide thrills & you will laugh more than you did with Craig's last two films.Classic Bond is back and it was a joy to see it, if you are a Bond enthusiast there are lots of treats in store.",9,433,838,23 October 2012
