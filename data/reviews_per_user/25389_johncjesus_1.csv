The Incredible Hulk," Good film?
","It was a good film. I really enjoyed watching it. Not as good as I was expecting but was a good time spent looking at the big screen. With all the good actors and actresses that made into this flick its impossible not to say its a quality film. One more time Edward Norton is a success acting. Very good.Well I'm giving only 7 because I think there are too many scenes which reminded me of other movies (King Kong as an example). And also, there was already another Hulk film out there (with Eric Bana) which was a bit more faithful to the Marvel stories (big jumps and story). http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286716/. Hulk wasn't as good as this one, but it is 5 years older which means that technology for special effects wasn't as evolved as today's.The film had a good story progressing from good to excellent. Have to say that the Brazilian bits were a bit confusing. I am Portuguese and the Brazilian seemed a bit artificial or even dubbed. Weird.I really enjoyed the end. Was very good and opens the story for a quite good sequel. Is it worth the money to go and watch it? Definitely.Overall was a very good film.",7,2,4,23 June 2008
