Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Just Awful!
","I was BORED TO TEARS watching this movie. The entire movie felt like watching The Architect's speech from Matrix Reloaded on repeat. I left seriously let down, as did many of the people I talked to after the movie was over while we were walking out of the theater. I walked into the movie theater, sat down in the front, and slunk all the way back in my chair and got ready to watch the movie. Only one scene in the whole movie made me sit up. One section of the movie looked, felt, and sounded like it was ripped DIRECTLY from the pages of an old, terrible Kung-Fu movie. Complete with an old super powerful fool who hates Americans, women, and blondes (yet agrees to train The Bride, who is all three), has an obscene infatuation with stroking his 5 foot beard, and can do the same 'jump and balance myself on the sword on one foot' trick that Chow-Yun Fat did in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. That sequence was terribly boring, much like the rest of the film.",1,3,7,20 November 2006
Iron Man 2," BEST ADAPTATION EVER! Long live the new king!
","Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 2 is the best comic adaptation movie ever made. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. Now, the sequel advances as well if not better than the previous great 'number 2's' in history. Spider-Man 2, X2 and TDK all took the second films of the franchise to new heights. Iron Man 2 does the same and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 2 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle was certainly an upgrade. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. It utilizes great dialogue that's witty, perfect use of humor yet again, advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best sequel of the decade. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. Long live the new king! What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can you say that about?",10,6,20,30 April 2010
The Prestige," Cast wasted... It's remarkably uninteresting
","The perfect example of a great cast wasted. It's a remarkably uninteresting movie in which the 'surprise' ending was pitifully easy to spot. The fact that the ending was obvious is secondary to the fact that each of the main characters were extremely unlikable individuals. What a waste of talent.The film is a pale shadow of the source material. The director tries to misdirect the viewer with an intricate flashback structure that begins at a trial, before time-traveling through the lives of the magicians as young men. The magicians fall in love with various women while escalating their nasty attempts to expose, outdo and injure each other.Their obsession to obtain each other's trade secrets and become the most esteemed illusionist becomes dull and falls somewhere on the scale between weird science and bad science, this plot development adds another layer of nonsense to the drama. There's no real magic here. For more likable characters and better sleight-of-hand storytelling, see The Illusionist.",2,8,22,7 November 2006
Iron Man," Remarkable Film. Oscar Level Performances and FX.
","First off, I have to mention that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark. He portrays the perfect combination of suave and selfishness, energy and ungoverned gluttony, troubled spirit and a soul seeking redemption. It's clear that Downey has brought everything to the part.Sure, this is science fiction but the believability and realism are off the charts. Tony Stark isn't a mutant or a ninja or nothing silly has happened to him. Stark isn't a cheesy, tights wearing superhero. It's great that he can't jump into a phone booth and be on his cheesy way. He's a flawed man but he's anything but ordinary. From origin through design to testing and then gaining expert usage, every step of the way is believable and incredibly interesting. All of the amazing effects are grounded in realism. I know they built the armor in real life and that worked remarkably well. It wasn't all a CG mishmash. You could tell that they sent up real fighter planes and filmed them. They looked like the aerial cinematography for Top Gun or a well choreographed air show and all of it plays out in a stunning fashion. There was a realism to the bumpiness of the camera and the results of actually shooting at those tremendous heights shined through. Using practical effects and a practical suit of armor paid off big-time. Even if, for some strange reason, you watch the film trying to nitpick, I seriously doubt anyone will be able to tell the difference between a CG shot and a practical shot. The suit of armor develops a personality of its own. It grows from a crude infant in to something awesome. It adjusts flaps during flight (again making it appear to be more then a feasible concept); it communicates and allows us to see Tony's POV. There are so many great details that I truly believe this movie is made for repeat viewing.",10,4,10,5 May 2008
