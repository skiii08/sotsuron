The Incredible Hulk," Second To the Classic TV Series, This Is THE Hulk Movie To Go See!!
","When it comes to the Incredible Hulk, I am and will always love the classic TV series the best. But now, I've seen the second best Hulk interpretation ever made!! Oddly enough, I wound up seeing it three times this weekend. I just couldn't get enough of it.The 2003 Ang Lee film was a total abomination (pardon the pun)and it would be similar to, 'What if somebody attempted to do a lower budget Superman movie a few years before Christopher Reeve, Richard Donner, and the Salkinds got involved?' That movie was a joke that was not funny at all. The Incredible Hulk was a brilliant collaboration and this time, both the director and the star are both Hulk fans of both the comics and the TV series. Louis Leterrier was an ideal choice for a director. Edward Norton made an excellent Bruce Banner. He looked a little like Bill Bixby, but only a little bit whereas he mostly represents the comic book Banner far better than the poorly miscast Eric Bana of the 2003 film. The retold origin was far better than the plot of the previous film and was only restricted to one part early on in the film so that it's not rehashed. Liv Tyler made a decent Betty Ross and she was much more loving and understanding than Jennifer Connelly was, but in terms of beauty, I am more partial to Connelly myself. Add the grey hair and the mustache, and William Hurt executed his performance as General Thunderbolt Ross. The only thing I liked in the 2003 film was the casting of Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliot as Betty and her father, the General, so I could go either way with the Ross's.This Hulk movie has many things the previous attempt did not. For one thing, it has some humor in it while the other film was too dark, brooding, and serious. And this film had good length while the other one was too long. That is one agreement that I'm glad Marvel won. Sorry Ed. And most of all, we had a real villain along with a colossal fight for the Hulk. Tim Roth was great as Emil Blonsky and his Abomination was a true menace and a frightening one as well. Best of all, this Incredible Hulk movie has many nods to the classic TV series. Lou Ferrigno has a better cameo role and he was the voice of the Hulk. There is a brief cameo of the late Bill Bixby seen on a TV set while Bruce Banner is channel surfing. And what I'm surprised no one has mentioned yet, there is also a nod to the late Jack Colvin's character in that there is a character named Jack McGee found somewhere in this movie. You need to see the movie for yourself to see these nods. The Hulk himself is CGI of course, and to some, that is probably a big letdown, but this time, the Hulk looks far better and he doesn't grow when he gets angrier, plus he looks more like his comic book counterpart. One more thing, the musical score was outstanding!! Craig Armstrong's score sounded like real Hulk music as opposed to Danny Elfman's 2003 score, which sounded a little too Asian and martial arts type of music. But the intro theme of this new movie is really captivating. For my final evaluation. If you want to see a Hulk movie that is truly good in every way and will capture the interest of both TV series and comics fans, the Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton is THE movie to see and completely discard the Ang Lee film of 2003. I give this movie 2 thumbs up!!",10,5,8,17 June 2008
Batman Returns," Mediocre Sequel That Got Too Carried Away
","I saw this movie on opening night and would start my junior year in college that fall. I initially loved this movie when it first came out and saw it twice in theaters. However, I don't particularly like it as much as I did when it was released. Why? I'll explain all that shortly. First, here's what I do love and still love about Batman Returns. 1: Michael Keaton reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He did an excellent job. 2: Catwoman: Michelle Pheiffer was superb in the role and she not only stole the movie, I felt she was the best thing about Batman Returns altogether. Selina Kyle, the costume, and the attitude and her relationship with Batman both in and out of costume. 3: The Penguin's mutated look and nothing more. Nuff said. 4: Wayne Manor and the Batcave. The only two sets I really liked. 5: Michael Gough as Alfred. 6: As I said before, Batman and Catwoman's relationship as foes and in regular clothes, we see Bruce pursue Selina, unlike the first film where Vicki pursued Bruce. Plus, the reference to Vicki from the last movie gave it a nice touch of continuity.Okay, here's why I don't give Batman returns the high praise given by many. The four Batfilms of the 80's and 90's share a common link when it came to the directors. To me, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher both did good on their first films, but got too carried away with their own visions in their second go around, only Schumacher was worse about it.But yes. I feel that Tim Burton got too carried away with his vision in Batman Returns.1: Gotham City did NOT look like Gotham City. I absolutely refuse to believe that set for downtown Gotham was actually Gotham Square. The Zoo where the Penguin's hideout looked like something of a hybrid of the Nightmare Before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands. 2: The Penguin. While I like Danny DiVito as an actor and the mutant bird man look, the Penguin's storyline was totally disgusting to me. The Penguin was portrayed as an ugly character who was a product of circumstances he could not control (his deformity at birth) I hated his storyline. After watching the Penguin on Batman: The Animated Series, I kept thinking, gee, why couldn't they have done that in Batman Returns? I liked it better when the Penguin is highly intelligent and considers himself a member of Gotham's elite. 3: The Red Triangle Circus Gang. What a sick filthy joke! I really hate these guys with a fierce bloody passion. They made the Penguin look even worse. I would have preferred real underworld thugs in comparison. Tim Burton got too carried away with this part. 4: Christopher Walken as Max Shreck. I liked the concept of the evil businessman, but Shreck's look just did not fit into the Batman universe for me. I'd have rather seen somebody like Rupert Thorne over Shreck any day. 5: I know that Dark Knight fans prefer Batman Returns over the Schumacher films, but I am one of those fans who like the Dynamic Duo, so I am a Robin fan and the fact that he was excluded from this film is one reason I don't care for it as much, even though he had been given a much better costume in the comics. But then again, there was talk about Robin being a street guy played by Marlon Wayans. So I guess I am grateful that Robin wasn't included just for the sake of not messing up a popular character.Overall, I still enjoy watching Batman Returns and I love Danny Elfman's musical score on the soundtrack, but the film got way too Tim Burton-ish for me. Batman and Catwoman really made this movie, even though Batman is once again upstaged by the villains. But to be honest, I like Batman Forever over this installment. Batman Returns to me, is mediocre at best.",4,26,41,20 June 2005
Batman Begins," The Best Batman Movie of all time is finally here!!!
","This is my first post after joining the IMDb. And what better way than to start with my favorite Super Hero. Last night, I attended the opening night showing of Batman Begins. I came out of that theater in total awe and I am totally and completely amazed. They have finally made what has got to be the best Batman movie ever as well as the most real interpretation. I have to agree with Christopher Nolan's goal about making this movie turn out the way the first Superman movie of 1978 did and they executed it to the fullest. A true origin movie of Batman. This movie has a very high caliber cast. Christian Bale is an unknown to me since I've never seen the Psycho movies at all. Other than that, you had an excellent, well known cast for support and villains. If Christopher Reeve could make you believe that a man could fly, then Christian Bale will make you believe that a man with a tortured soul whose driven to fight crime after the deaths of his parents could establish an identity as a Caped and Cowled Vigilante. And for once, his is not upstaged by the villains. Katie Holmes was great as Rachel, though she still looks like a teenager. Although they've never found a tall, thin, bald English man with a thin mustache for Alfred, Michael Caine is superb in the role and you can definitely believe him in the part of Alfred Pennyworth, manservant and surrogate father figure. Gary Oldman was perfect as James Gordon. He literally looked like the character with the hair, mustache, and glasses. They finally found the right looking Gordon. No one's ever done that before. For the villains, Cillian Murphy was excellent as the Scarecrow. The costume totally took me by surprise, especially the mask, but like Wayne and Gordon, Murphy literally looked like Jonathan Crane. He seemed born for the part. I also liked Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. I can't think of anybody better for the role and I was amazed to find that Rutger Howard as Richard Earle was the same guy who played the killer in the Hitcher. I've never heard of Ken Wantanabe, so I can't comment on Ras Al Ghul, but I will say I liked that Ras was part of this first movie. In the 1989 movie, I asked myself 'Where Was Robin?' In this movie, I'm asking myself, 'Where's Talia?' Ras's daughter? And the Lazarus Pit? And Ubu? I could imagine if they had been included, a tempting romance for Bruce and the consistent use of the word 'Infidel!' by Ubu. Oh well, I was glad to see Ras himself. The musical score was superb and Gotham City for once, looked like the real Gotham City, not that twisted Nightmare Before Christmas Tim Burton look, nor the Neon lit weird Gotham Vegas style of Joel Schumacher's but the real Gotham City and it's inspirations of New York City!! Last but not least, I love the new musical score and I already can't wait to get the soundtrack. Though I was puzzled that there was no main title, whereas the theme is heard throughout the movie. I only hated one thing. The new Batmobile. I just can't accept is as a tank like vehicle. My favorite Batmobile will be the one from the two Tim Burton films. Overall, I give Batman Begins the the perfect rating and my comment that this is how it should have been made in 1989. 2 Thumbs Up!!!!",10,8,12,16 June 2005
The Dark Knight," Definitively THE best Batman Movie Ever Made. Definitely Oscar Worthy!!!
","And I thought Batman Begins was the best. It is rare that a sequel or follow up movie is better than its predecessor. But Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale have pulled it off. I've never before attended a midnight sneak showing of a movie, but when I read that it was an anticipated sellout, I decided not to wait until opening day. Good thing too. The Dark Knight is a true masterpiece. It is not only the best comic book adapted movie. It is not only the best crime drama movie. It is not only the best psychodrama movie. It is not only the best Batman movie. IT IS ALL THESE CATEGORIES ALTOGETHER!! I am personally convinced that the Dark Knight surpasses any comic book movie ever made in its history. The entire cast gave stand alone performances in their perspective roles. The cinematography was superb and you can't beat the musical score composed by the same two geniuses who scored Batman Begins. Unlike the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher movies, Gotham City looks like a real city, especially since they filmed in Chicago. Burton's Gotham looked too dark Beetejuice Edward Scissorhands fantasy and Schumacher's Gotham looked too neon gay. Gotham City needs to look real and not like some fantasy set and Nolan pulled it off! Christian Bale really pulls off both sides of the cowl as Batman and Bruce Wayne. It's great to see Michael Caine, Gary Oldsman, and Morgan Freeman back in their roles as Alfred, Gordon, and Lucius Fox. The best casting choice they made was casting Maggie Gyllenhal as Rachel Dawes since I felt she was more believable in the role than Katie Holmes ever was. When I saw Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, I realized that I saw him in a movie called Thank You for Smoking. The studio did wise not to reveal his appearance as Two Face. As to how, when, and where it happens, you will just have to see the movie for yourself. Thank you WB for keeping the secret guarded. But Eckhart really executes the role of the White Knight who eventually falls. Now saving the best for last. The late great Heath Ledger. While I was not really familiar with his work, he really and truly stole the show as the Joker and he did it without upstaging Batman like what happened in the Keaton/Nicholson movie. Ledger really vanished into the role of the Joker. He literally lived and breathed the part and his Joker is more of a frightening, terrorizing menace than any of the past incarnations. And he lives by no rules whatsoever. Now don't get me wrong. Caesar Romero will be remembered for the camp version, Jack Nicholson has the best Joker look and played the comical killer and Mark Hammill gave the best standout performance as the voice of the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series. But Heath Ledger's Joker will make you either forget the other versions or at least make you put the others on the back burner. In my personal opinion, Heath Ledger truly deserves the honor of a posthumous Oscar Nomination. Whether or not there is a third Batman movie done by Nolan and Bale is neutral for me. I would certainly enjoy it and I hope it eventually happens, but at the same time, I feel this is the best and I would hate to see a lesser quality movie to follow this one. Any future Batman movies, whether they bring in Robin, The Penguin, Catwoman, or any number of other villains, other heroes or supportive players should be done by another director and starring actor who will continue the franchise in the Nolan/Bale style. While I love both Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk both, I am convinced the Dark Knight is bar none THE BEST SUPER HERO MOVIE OF 2008 IF NOT EVER MADE!!! Perfect!! Two Thumbs Up!!!",10,8,17,29 July 2008
