Moneyball," Wonderful movie
","On recommendation from a friend, I recently saw Moneyball and thought the movie was quite great. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and though a lot of people already know the plot the movie made it come to life. The cast was great and specifically Jonah Hill, who usually does a great job in comedies, should get nominated for best supporting actor in it. It is nice to see him make a switch to a non-comedic role and I am sure this will greatly help his acting career.This is one of those rare movies that everyone should like, whether they are sports fans or not. The story is so interesting that it could not have been made up and the original author of the book was well represented in the screenplay. I read some commentary that this might not be as big as The Blind Side overseas because a lot of people aren't in love with baseball, but I think this appeals to all people even if they are not a fan.Overall, I think Sorkin did a wonderful job with the movie and picked a perfect cast-he has definitely been on a roll lately. Although I saw a matin√©e, I would have even liked it had I paid full price for my tickets. So, enjoy... :-)",Null,63,82,4 October 2011
Man on Fire," Awesome Movie
","Although this movie came out a number of years ago, I think it is definitely underplayed relative to the quality of it. I hadn't seen Man on Fire in years until recently, and I have got to tell you that it is literally one of the better movies I have ever seen. I was shocked by the ratings this site gave the movie in relation to how great I thought the plot was. The acting is great as is the story line so I am not sure what people didn't like about it. It is definitely not a movie kids should watch, but any adult who hasn't seen this yet is doing themselves a great disservice. Even the ending is unpredictable and good, what more do you want?",Null,0,2,23 March 2011
The Blind Side," Wonderful movie
","I had not seen this movie in a long time, and I saw it on television last night. It is an incredible story and very well done movie. I think Sandra Bullock is great in it, as is the rest of the cast. You really felt like you were watching the actual family while tuning into the movie thanks largely to Bullock's performance. While I was watching it this time, I searched around online to see how much of it is true and it is surprisingly accurate. Some of the subjects quibble with some of the details, but less than in most true stories. The family is all still very close today in fact, which put a smile on my face.I just think the story is so fantastic and inspirational that it is worth everyone watching, children or adult. The story of how the family helped Oher and at the same time Oher united the entire family is touching to say the least.",Null,1,2,15 June 2014
