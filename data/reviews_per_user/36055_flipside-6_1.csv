United 93," Extremely powerful Film
","This movie was shot in raw true-to-life format. Acting is very realistic full of powerful scenes - but not over dramatized. The actors do a great job, it's more like watching a home video of actual events then a major motion picture. Throughout the second half of the movie you will find yourself holding back tears as well as feelings of great pride and empowerment. The only part of this movie that I really had issue with was the cinematography. The camera constantly jiggles and moves about throughout many parts of the film - war correspondent style. While I understand it's purpose I think film makers have to be very careful with this as it can leave you with strained eyes and even motion sickness inside the theater (as was the case with myself and my viewing companion). For this reason I think it may be best to see United 93 on DVD instead.",8,0,2,8 May 2006
