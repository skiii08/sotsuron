First Man," BORING!!!
","I never thought a film about an astronaut and the space program could be such a boring downer but here it is. Also, I've had my doubts about Ryan Gosling's acting abilities and this film did not help. Wish I could make a million dollars sitting in front of a camera and expressing no emotion film after film after film.Don't waste your time with this one.",2,3,5,30 April 2019
