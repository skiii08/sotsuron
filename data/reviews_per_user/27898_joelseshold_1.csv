Skyfall," Don't believe the hype!!!!! This is not the Bond your looking for!!!!!
","I was so excited to watch this film last night, that I endured a hot sweaty cinema full of annoying people. What did I do that for? Well i'm not too sure myself. I was so upset with the whole film. Daniel Craig I feel does act well in this film but is severely let down by the script and directing. If your looking for a good action film with a little bit of a story that doesn't quite make sense but your there more for the action then its OK! If your going to watch it with the expectation (as I had, thanks to all the hype of radio and TV (DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE)) that 'Bond is back' and all that Jazz; expect to be disappointed!The opening scene with the chase was good, but it felt like it should've been further into the film. You start off too deep into a scene that then turns out to be almost pointless. Bond is supposed to be trying to recover something for MI6 and ends up not doing anything close to it. Forgive me but isn't the format for all bond films something/someone taken/killed, MI6 gets annoyed, sends bond, all ends up well due to bond. This film goes along the lines of something taken, MI6 annoyed, bond comes back and doesn't recover the stolen item. This basically means that Bond Isn't Bond!!!!The film in general is too comical, there are far too many references to other films. If they had been referencing bond films then maybe I could understand but they weren't!!! I also have a bone to pick with the new Q. He's pointless and stupid in this film!!!! Q has never been like this in any of the previous bonds. He's been clever witty and game for almost anything whilst at the same time giving bond incredible gadgets and the usual 'I'd like it back in one piece please this time Bond!' This new Q is atrocious. Far too young, doesn't fit the profile of a Q and completely lacks the pizazz of the original or even John Cleese when he played it.I also don't see why this film had to be so unnecessarily long. It was far too long. If I were the editor I would've cut the film down by about 30-40 mins.The bond villain isn't one of the usual crew from spectre etc but also hasn't got too much of a story himself. Where are the bond girls??? This has got to be the first film without what I would call a proper bond girl. I mean come on!!! There are rules to follow when creating a new bond film and this one seems to break or ignore them all. All in all I'm highly disappointed that this was made let alone that I paid money to see this. I would recommend that You don't!!!!!",2,32,66,28 October 2012
