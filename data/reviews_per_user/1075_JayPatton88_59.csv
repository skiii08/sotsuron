The Lobster," Never heard of this film
","Watched it and loved it! Strange, Bizarre, Weird all in placed in a film in a enjoyable way to watch for the viewers!",9,0,1,6 December 2019
Blade Runner 2049," They made a remake or a sequel
","I loved the first one, this one I could not keep up, was wondering if their was a tie in to the older film with Harrison Ford ? There was; but not enough for me to make me enjoy this bomb. Give me the 'Blade Runner' and a younger, main star Harrison Ford made some three and a half decades before this one. Many say the first is always better than the sequel. I still don't know if this was a sequel or just a modern 'Blade Runner' but like what be I will take the older one. Not drinking on this film, I pass.",6,3,6,18 November 2017
Alien 3," Good
",A good movie in the Alien franchise series of movies but the third as usual in a movie with sequels not as good as the first two by far,6,0,1,21 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow

It," The remake
",Usually not a fan of remakes but this did Stephen King's 'It' titled book justice like its predecessor.,7,0,1,25 April 2020
Lone Survivor," Horrible
","I am a combat vet (OIF 2004-2005) totally unrealistic, absurd and ridiculous a waste of time to watch, don't bother.",3,2,10,15 November 2019
Inglourious Basterds," The Title
","Insulting word in title, but an even more insulting for potential viewer! Watched 15 minutes,15 to many and the DVD box should say not for children or anyone else. This film would make a nice interrogation device forcing your capture to cave in and tell you every bit of Intel the prisoner knows about the forces their own side! If you can watch the entire stink bomb burn after watching. If you are like me destroy the DVD after five minutes viewing. Have never been a fan of Quinton Tarintino's spaghetti war comedy movies and after 5 minutes of watching I have even less respect for the director. Certainly not to be acclaimed for any award, but worth target shooting",1,2,9,19 January 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," IMO the best Star Wars Movie since episode lv
","Grew up a star wars kid, age 45 , saw revenge of the Sith in a base in Iraq. I thought Rogue One was awesome. One of the first movies were i left happy even though the ending had a twist with the main characters in the film. I thought Felicity Jones was fantastic and the only Jedi in the movie was a great character!",9,3,4,13 July 2018
Alien: Resurrection," A pickup

World War Z," World War Z

Deadpool 2," Wow
","This was a stinker, I could not even watch the whole movie",3,1,3,14 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor has a brother
","Utterly horrible film! As bad as the predecessors ? ( I know of the first one, it was just as atrocious. ) People are feeling the back of their heads and grabbing for their wallets leaving the theatre on this doozy as they will feel like they have been mugged. Save yourself from being strong arm mugged, tell the kids to wait until it comes out on DVD and as bad as it was it will be released for DVD sales soon and don't let the theatre's rob you.",3,7,16,18 November 2017
Hotel Rwanda," A movie about the Genocide in Rawanda by the Hutu's against the Tutsi's, a true story
","Don Cheadle perhaps did the best job of his acting career. With Joaquin Phonex playing a minor role and Gary Busse playing a supporting actor. Based on a true story, and a great film to watch. It has moments of regularity , combined with terror and a bit of comedy to have a film based on true events directed and acting gave the viewer a real sense of what went Down in Rawanda, during the countries genocide & civil war. If you like films based on real people and real events this movie is a must see.The movie does a great job of portraying a real man in Rawanda who helped both Hutu and Tutsi's alike, often putting his own life on the line for others. A very heroic man, portrayed by Cheadle who did the best acting job of his career! I give it 9 stars! Check it out if you have not seen it! The movie is a must see for those interested in movies inspired by real events and the people's actions during a real event!",10,1,1,12 January 2017

We Were Soldiers," About landing zone X-Ray
","A true story of the US Army's new air Calvary unit improvised before the US fully committed to the Conflict in Vietnam. Not a big Mel Gibson fan, but I thought this was his best movie to date",7,1,1,15 November 2019
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," In the year 2019
",Still a great film to watch. I think this is one of Stanley Kubrick's best films even to this day. Mixing real life possible events with a flare of comedy!,9,3,4,14 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Well after two a letdown was due
","This was my least favorite 'Star Wars' film of the first three out out, ( episodes IV - VI ) but I bumped it up one notch when series I - III came out!",6,3,5,14 November 2019

Full Metal Jacket," Compared to the movie 'Platoon'
","This movie does not stand a chance. Another movie about the conflict in Vietnam, but the plot and cast falls far short of my expectations because I watched the film 'Platoon' first. Unlike 'Platoon' , which I watch to this day, I watched this film once, and will never watch it again as I feel it's not worth my time.",6,1,5,19 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Stranded
","Overseas first Star Wars I missed in a theatre ( South America ) been over a year since in states. Saw 'R.O.S.' ( book three of prequel in Iraq at the theatre of Camp Anaconda,2005 OIF / PMC )
A generation of youth affected by the first two Star Wars Movies followed by adding to the Star Wars generation with following movies. I loved the first in 1977 in a Theatre , 'Empire' was epic, and the others were all enjoyable I will leave it to that.
I felt After 'Empire' it got worse and worse per movie though not in order, and imo I felt a movie as Epic as 'Star Wars'then 'Empire' deserved an explosive three movie ending after the poor three series prequels.
I did not feel any explosion out of any since watching 'Empire' until 'Rouge One' ( a Star Wars story though it tied in directly to episode lV ( movie one ) the other Star Wars story 'Solo' stunk, we smelled leaving the theater.
From the Great and exciting Beginning of 'Star Wars' and 'Empire' to the dull pathetic last 7 movies in the 9 movie series.
This Star Wars had awesome cinematography, special effects, that's expected, the bad acting from nobody actors accrued the last three movies expected,Bad Directing JJ Abrams, the pathetic ending to a Epic 9 movie series affecting a generation, Ashamed. Disney you ruined Star Wars.
Death to a series and generation of people's fascination with a nostalgic series spanning decades",4,14,23,16 April 2020

",If Caesar had been allowed to stay at his home? I Thought Franco and Lithgow did great jobs taking on this film,9,1,1,11 November 2019
City of God," Surprising
","I caught this film on Starz one Monday morning, it is excellent for a foreign film. Based on a true story; shows the life of the impoverished in Brazil circa the early 1980's. No one could place a genre on this film as it covers action,crime and history. Have seen it multiple times since, a strong nine out front f ten and a film I can watch again and again! Great film!",9,1,1,18 November 2017
2012," Not great

Stalingrad," Very factual Movie
","Those poor German Soldiers of Army 6, caught in a pocket and not allowed permission for a breakout. 250,000 + German troops in pocket, less than 10,000 returned to Germany from those barbaric Russians. I hate Ivan to this day",10,1,3,14 November 2019
American Made," The early 1980's
","Loved this film. I believe based on a true story as their was some litigation about the character Tom Cruise played, but you did not want to get up and go get a Coca Cola. Not a dull moment in this one, with enough comedy to accompany the action. Sorry drama fans, this movie although surely dramatic for the man the main character is based on. This movie is action, laughs , fun and makes you remember those early 1980's. I thought it was novel the way the movie was brought along in acts giving a timeline to what was happening when in the film.",10,4,8,18 November 2017
Downfall," Better than 'The Bunker'
","Way better than the early 80's film the Bunker starring Anthony Hopkins, no disrespect to Hopkins as an actor, this movie was far more credible",9,2,2,14 November 2019
The Last King of Scotland," Idi Amin
","I learned about self proclaimed general Idi Amin writing a paper back when in university. From historical context I think it is 1/2 accurate.
I have seen Forrest Whitaker in other films, but I thought he threw himself into studying Amin and personally think this film is Whitaker's best acting job on his resume.",9,1,2,4 November 2019
It Chapter Two," I don't recall
","The first 'It' made for television;Had and 'It Chapter two'? I enjoyed the remake and enjoyed the sequel to the remake immensely.

Prometheus," The best movie in the Alien series of Movies

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Saw it in the theaters at age 5

",This was my favorite film in the 'Star Wars' series until 'Rouge One' came out. Still a film I can watch to this day and enjoy,10,1,2,14 November 2019
13 Hours," As a former PMC
","This movie hit home. Every PMC who signs every contract knows they have no US military support. A PMC or grouping of PMC's is on their own. Only a President can order US military action on a foreign nation without the Senate and House Approval. Had President Obama sent in a military for for support or even ordered air support for those PMC's would have made a single handed de-facto declaration of war against Libya, which at the time out armed forces were engaged in military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Adding a third conflict with another Arab state would have over extended US armed forces resources to one region, complicating a difficult situation already happening. I am glad most of those PMC's made it home alive to their families and did exactly what their contract states, solved the situation by themselves. Great movie ,but brought up horrible memories for me. With the facts I presented keep those facts in mind when sitting down to watch this movie or watch it again. ( Once was enough for me. ) Great directing and acting, pretty close to factual. Watch it or rewatch it with the facts I presented in mind and the movie will make a whole lot more sense to the viewer.",8,20,26,18 November 2019
Valkyrie," Great Film
","One of Tom Cruise's best films on his resume, pretty accurate as far as facts, had drama and action! A good movie to watch on a cold chilly night",9,1,1,15 November 2019

","I love the acting of Micheal Fassbender, he followed up 'Prometheus' in 'Covenant' with another excellent acting job presenting a duality of the Artificial life forms present in most of the 'Alien' series of movies by R.Scott",8,2,4,11 November 2019
