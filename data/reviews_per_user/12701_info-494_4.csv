The Ring," very good, if you like ghost stories
","Wow, I went along just because my friend practically forced me to. This is a ghost story. It's based on the lamest urban legend of all. Somehow, they kinda managed to make something kinda' cool out of it.Summary: excellent flick to go with your girl or date, she will grab you. If she doesn't, then she doesn't like ya!",Null,0,0,19 February 2003
28 Days Later...," No more
","Well, that's it. After seeing 'Shallow Graves' and 'Trainspotting', I had sworn loyalty to director Danny Boyle. But after 'The Beach', 'A Life Less Ordinary' and '28 days later', I'm cutting off. '28 days later' is a tribute to the classic '(night, dawn, day)of the dead' series, plus a bit of 'The Omega Man'. It fails. The characters all behave erratically. I understand that one underlying theme in Danny Boyle's movies is how a group of people start out as having one type of relationship, and then changing *gradually* into another completely different thing. But in this case the changes are sudden, with practically no explanation, unbelievable. Another thing going against it is the weird digital/video resolution chosen for the film, plus the over used shaky scene recourse. ACK! Add to that some large plot-holes. Say what you may about the 'night of the dead' series, but the storyline was impeccable. (once you buy the living-dead premise, of course)I can't think of a nice thing to say about this movie... err...the 'father' gave a decent performance, err.. and the psycho sergeant was mildly intriguing, but mainly because the other characters were so awful.",Null,0,0,25 November 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Not bad
","Just saw this movie. Russell Crowe has finally convinced me he is a very good actor. The movie itself didn't rock my world, but it did change my view of mental illness. I have been told by various doctors that schizophrenia patients really suffer and act just what the movie portrays. Towards the end the movie tries to pull out cheap tears by cliche devices. (and succeeds I'm afraid).",7,0,1,2 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," 161 minutes = not for kids
","Too long man. Apparently, they tried to follow the book faithfully. In my opinion, that is a mistake. A movie is a movie and a book is a book. It was apparent to me that they bent themselves backwards to try to get all the plot in, and that broke the film. The acting is great, and the special effects and all the visuals in general are amazing. But... Harry Potter is supposed to be something bubbly and sparkly, not some convoluted epic crusade, like Lord of the Rings. Two hours and forty minutes!!  PLEASE !",5,0,1,9 December 2002
