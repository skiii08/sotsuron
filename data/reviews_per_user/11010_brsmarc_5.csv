Black Swan," The Black Swan in the Emperors New Clothes
","First off, some explanation of my two star rating. Since one star is the bottom and there are certainly films worse than this one, it's important to have some perspective on ones framework.Now, the film. When I was asked my reaction to the film after viewing it my response was - 'well that's 2 hours and 28 minutes out of my life I'll never get back'.The positive reviews here can only go into one of few categories: Ignorant Misguided or The result of 'peer and public perception' pressure.Perhaps the logic in choosing to create a filmed version of Tchaikovsky's classic ballet was something like a) how hard can that be? and b) it'll be 'artsy' enough for non- artistic Hollywood Oscar voters.Mix in some viewers who wouldn't know a piece of art I'd it bite them in the rear and Voila! 'Academy greatness'.But extract out the burden of 'Academy worthiness' and this still doesn't stand the test of mediocrity. Why?First off, it is crushed by the weight of it's own self importance. I have to think long and hard to recall a film that screamed out ' look at me! Look at how important I am! I'm symbolic, profound AND I'm about something artful' then look at the less than subtle clues about the character and it's satellite persons hovering around it. As 'events' just think of the first few scenes and what happens.Event one- she dreams of Swan Lake, and wakes up in her 'all too precious bedroom' that is covered in butterfly wallpaper ( hmm, wait a tic, don't butterflies go through a metamorphosis??? Yes, yes I believe they do.... Pool Hugh, I'll bet that 'means' something for our character -but what???!!!)Event two: we see her on the subway dressed in white (because the good guy always wears white) and she catches a reflection (stick with me, she 'lookimg through a glass' - get it, 'looking glass' )of another dancer dressed in (wait for it) Black. Again, I think this means something here.Event three- she's getting ready for rehearsal and we hear (this is what we call exposition) they are going to be replacing the 'old guard' grand dame lead ballerina (don't tell me, I'm wondering who might be chosen... No seriously, I have NO IDEA- well maybe a small idea).Taken together these events along with her 'I'm wound tighter than a Swiss watch and more scared of my shadow than a balloon is of a porcupine' and it's nearly impossible to understand how this got out of post production without some major editing (maybe there WAS major editing- how scary is that thought?). This is movie whose legacy will be relegated in ten years to midnight madness showings with it on double bill of cult classics like Showgirls and Rocky Horror Picture show.If you're a Natalie Portman fan like I am, watch 'Closer' in which she is captivating and showcases her skills along with Clive Owen, Jude Law and, yes even Julia Roberts.If you want to save yourself 2 1/2 hours rent this, watch the first 15 minutes cut to the last scene when she kills herself because the only ti e the word perfect will be connected to this film is in the final word of the movie when her last gasp of life is saying 'perfect' - oh please...gag me with a spoon.",2,3,6,1 May 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinite jest, infinite mess - SPOILERS
","WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket. The 'deeper' interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating. This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the 'soul infinity stone'. Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys 'fighting argument' (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or 'who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, 'Yuck, this is disgusting'But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of 'ultimate hero fantasy' that makes you feel like 'lets simplify'.",3,23,45,23 May 2018
Coco," The king has no clothes!
","To say this was an unbearable movie would be an exaggeration. It was bearable, bearly, for about 35 minutes.Its an embarrassment to see this is associated with Pixar. I can only imagine they were for ed to put their name on it to collect royalities.It reeks of Disney and their predictable, overly saccachrine sentiments, with an incipid story, one dimensional characters and a mismoshnof ideas about themes and subplots.As a triumph of style over substance and a nod to ersatz cultural enlightenment this is a film that can't even justify the evidence of its exostence. Visually it is a mess and a kind of over stimulated version of a little childs video game. It is devoid of humor, genuine humanist expression and superficial smattering of the Day of the Dead celebration. The characters are so flat that both 'alive' or dead they're boring.To compare this to typical landmark, groundbreaking Pixar movies calls into question wondering exactly what people were watching during Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, etc these early films took the legendary work of early Disney animation artists and elevated it to an entirely different place.they are layered, broadly appealling, entertaining and had a touch of social context and commentary. Truly wonderful movies that deliver viewing upon viewing.The horses are out of the pen at this point but Honestly - what the hell werevthese positive reviewers watching!!??",1,14,76,7 May 2018
Casino Royale," May contain spoilers - Ever watch Poker for 2 1/2 hours?
","So what are the commonalities between CR 2006 and CR 1967...well the comparisons are easy to see. In each there was 'no one' playing Bond, neither one was funny and each was a meandering, spoof of a Classic iconic movie formula. The James Bond themes and prototypical characters and plot lines are so heavily ingrained in our culture that many people who have never seen a Bond film 'know' the Bond elements. The girls, the gadgets, the fast cars, the uber-villains, the self effacing humor and none too subtle sexual (and blatantly sexist) innuendo manifest in the names of many of the female characters.So why would someone want to 'kill the goose that laid the golden egg'?.One can only wonder what committee was formed to create, cast, write, market and produce this generally very unsatisfying, overly complex and essentially boring storyline.As a life long Bond fan I can easily put this movie pretty near the bottom of Bond movies that didn't work out. Not counting the disappointment from the anticipation of seeing 'how Bond became Bond' - punctuated with the pathetic and melodramatic movie's last line, 'Bond...James Bond' - I found myself confused by the thematic, visual and plot elements which seemed to be telling the 'Bond Story' forward and backward at the same time. The whole notion, set up in the beginning of the film when we see Bond earning his 007 status with his 2nd kill, that this is the beginning of what we now know as the Bond legend is contradicted with all sorts of contemporary visual, metaphorical and technical elements ( a shot of the recently built Atlantis hotel in the Bahamas, the EXTENSIVE use of MODERN cell phone (which are entirely critical to the storyline), the 'wink, wink - nudge, nudge' allusion to female sexist names - when he tells Eva Green's character 'Vesper Lynd' that her cover name on assignment is 'Stephanie Broadchest') all add to the backdrop of the big showdown between Bond and his nemesis Le Chiffre ('The Figure') in their 'spine tingling' Texas hold 'em high stakes card game. Are you kidding? Bond playing Texas hold 'em poker. Until this film I never knew I could watch a game of Poker for two and a half hours - (yawn) how exciting.Presumably, this was because of the huge appeal of this game to today's modern audience and the obvious conclusion that Bond would have preferred it to every other damn games of chance he played in ALL the other Bond films.I'm hoping in the next one that Bond has a big adventure with Le Figure in anticipation of the big deadly lawn mowing competition...then I can watch grass grow for two hours (unless the producers decide to set another running time record).On the positive side (yes there were positives), I was please to see the restrained and graphically creative retro-styling of the opening titles. Giving the opening a very 60's Peter Maxish (sort of) feel and loved the flashbacks in the beginning of Bond's first kill shot in somewhat grainy black and white and inter-cut with the dark, somber and foreboding lead up to his 2nd kill (which earned him his 007 status).It was also intriguing to see a young Bond go 'off the map' and reek havoc in a guerrilla base with some fantastic low tech chases and high wire stunts and fighting. It was a refreshing and yet perfectly logical 'opening fight/escape' that Bond became known for. It was also great to see the female characters being more substantial and real and not simply the 'same old' stereotypes (since his legend was far from established at this point). It also made sense that a young Bond would stumble and not necessarily be able to smoothly get around every situation. And finally, the locales and cinematography was great...not too slick and shiny and just a bit 'old school'.'M' / Judi Densch was, of course, fantastic as usual but were it not for her it would have seemed like: 'hey who the hell stole James Bond and replaced it with all these unknown actors'. No Moneypenny, No Q, and a Felix Leiter whose lines made him seem more like: 'if I say I work for the CIA then you need to believe me, please' and Daniel Craig showed the acting range of a cardboard cutout, I would have been happier if they just put up a 8x10 glossy of Pierce Brosnan whenever it was time to see Craig.In short, set your expectations low and be ready to spend a lot of time watching Poker",4,20,36,13 December 2006
The Social Network," Bumper sticker philosophies
","While it's never satisfying to write a review about heightened expectations not realized, it's good to see a lot of realists pointing out the obvious mediocrity and short comings of this movie. The schematic of this movie is pretty damn straight and simple. College boy loses girl, college boy attacks said girl. College boy is alienated by 'those of means' at Harvard (really, I never saw that one coming). College boy gets back at the snobby rich spoiled kids (granted there are 'lots' of kids who row crew and have fabulously rich parents, just no one I know). College boy starts up website that taps into the social angst and uncertainty of hormonally active college kids. Brilliant college boy makes a ton of money 'just because' and then tries to get girl back. He fails.There - Just saved a bunch of people $10 bucks and two hours time. General replies:'Sorkin's script is brilliant'...really, where's that? 'Great directing from Fincher'..uh huh...in what way? 'Mezrich draws on many sources' - Yes a complete story, expect for the fact that he made up entire scenes and never spoke to the subject of the film and main protagonist. Other than that, yes complete.Disappointments for Sorkin, Fincher and Mezrich. Better luck next time.Best moment of the film (by far) Severan's 'rushing' for a Finals club and 'feeding his chicken, chicken' dumb (think about it, for a Harvard kid) but DAMN funny.",Null,7,10,11 October 2010
