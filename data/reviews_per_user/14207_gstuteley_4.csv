Skyfall," Great Action Movie
","At 2 hours 23 minutes, this is a long film - but it did not feel like it. It starts off with a frenetic shoot out, car, motor bike, train chase that sees the destruction of dozens of cars, wagons, stalls, bikes and even a train carriage! I did not time it, but it probably lasted 10 minutes or more. It is in about 4 segments, each of which could almost make a film in its own right: Bonds chases assassin who steals list of secret agents; Bond goes after the former secret agent (Silva) turned rogue assassin; Silva wreaks havoc on London, trying to get at M; Silva goes after M in Scotland.The film is about two main themes: Revenge and Relevance Revenge: The rogue assassin, Silva is a former British agent, who believes (with some justification) that M sold him out. He has concocted an elaborate plan to gain his revenge on her. How plausible this plan is could be challenged - it seems to depend upon a lot of chance things coming together in a somewhat unlikely fashion. Relevance: M is under attack from the Government about whether she is competent, on the one hand and whether there is even a need for her department on the other. Likewise, Bond is under pressure to demonstrate whether his skills are still relevant, on the one hand and whether his body is still up to the job ('it's a young man's job') on the other. Is it a good film? Well, let's suspend belief, because Bond films are not really meant to be plausible. There is plenty of breath-taking action, some snappy dialogue, some good acting, a bit more character development than the usual Bond film and some pretty wild imagining. The 143 minutes goes very quickly and I did not want it to end. So I would give it the 'thumbs up'. Really exciting and absorbing film and possibly the best Bond film to date.",9,1,6,14 December 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tense story in brown rooms
","The critics were certainly correct about the tense atmosphere and the rather morose feeling engendered by the drab, brown, smoke-filled rooms that feature so much in this film. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy evoked the atmosphere of my youth to a degree, probably more so than the TV adaptation. It is apparently set in the 1970s although I took the drab colours as being more indicative of the 50s. The acting is uniformly good from a stellar cast and the story gradually unfolds with the director maintaining a felling of tension throughout. It is a good yarn well told. However, there were a few things that I did find a little bit disappointing:<ul><li>The dull brown settings which were so interesting to start with, became rather tedious after a while. I am, not convinced that everything was brown in the 70s.</li></ul><ul><li>After over 2 hours, I really did not feel that I knew any of the main characters (even Smiley) other than at a very superficial level.</li></ul>-The frequent use of flashbacks was rather disorientating and I am not convinced that some of them added anything to the storytelling.I was initially worried about seeing Gary Oldman in the George Smiley role, so brilliantly portrayed by Sir Alec Guiness in the TV series. It turned out that Oldman was well up to the task and made a very credible Smiley. Was it as good as the TV series? Possibly not, but then the TV series had the advantage of having 3 times as long to develop the themes and characters. But it was a creditable effort.",8,1,2,15 December 2012
Les Misérables," Brilliant reworking for the big screen
","LES MISERABLES 150113This is a film on an epic scale! The plot-line is simple enough. Jean Valjean was young and desperate when he committed a petty crime. Nineteen years of brutal punishment at the hands of a god-fearing but heartless officer not only fail to reform him, but leave him wanting to hit out at his fellows. An act of great human kindness from a gentle priest is enough to turn his life round and he spends the rest of his life trying to live a good life and help his fellow man. A series of coincidences that might make even Dickens blush help or hinder his progress.The staging of this film is fantastic, with realistic images of early 19th century France recreated in and around 21st century London (e.g. Greenwich Naval College) and the studio. The soundtrack is impressive (I had a blocked ear and was still nearly deafened) with thrilling chorals and concussive gun and canon fire. The acting was pretty impressive, although you really ended up focusing on the two Oscar nominees. I first came across Hugh Jackman in 'X-Men' and thought at the time that was more than just an 'action hero'. Here, Jackman really makes you believe in his character: his gaunt appearance at the start is startling and you can feel the primal brooding menace of the unreformed Valjean. His tortured metamorphosis into kindly agent of good is also realistically portrayed. He is equally convincing as the gaunt convict and the esteemed Mayor. It is award-winning stuff indeed. And his voice - what a revelation! This guy can sing. At first, I was not sure, but when he really let rip, it was not only heartfelt, but beautiful. Likewise Anne Hathaway: she can certainly sing and has a lovely rich and powerful voice. She is only on screen for about 20 minutes, but in that short time manages to deliver a performance of rare quality. She communicates perfectly to the audience, a naïve, gentle, kind person being overwhelmed and crushed by events and an uncaring society.Let's not forget the other players. Russell Crowe is suitably determined and case-hardened as the 'righteous' Javert. His voice is a fairly strong baritone and he copes pretty well. Eddie Redmayne is engaging as the young Marius and has a sweet tenor voice. Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) is fair with delicate complexion and sings sweetly, whilst Samantha Barks (Eponine) is dark and rustic with a much more earthy (but richer) voice). Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter provide the comic relief as the pantomime villains, the Thenardiers. How does this rank with the stage musical? It is very difficult to compare. This was deliberately NOT an attempt to create 'the film of the stage musical'. It was an attempt to create a film that was based on the stage musical. It might sound like splitting hairs, but the difference is huge. For a stage musical, you are there to hear the beautiful songs and voices. For an action film, you want great action, great acting, great sets, great continuity and this brilliant film achieves all these, with a little sacrifice of vocal excellence. So - better or worse? I am going to duck out and say 'different'!",9,4,7,16 January 2013
Prometheus," Confusing but fun
","The visual effects and the 3-D are pretty impressive. The idea behind the plot is quite interesting - a discovery leading to the attempt to find a super-intelligent alien race that created humans. The action is furious and gory and continuous. The stars of the show are the robot and the female lead - both are good and retain the interest. The intelligent aliens don't figure much in the story really (except for providing an opening for a sequel), but as creators of the human race, they are reasonably similar to humans - but bigger. Now for the downsides. The idea of humans being planted on Earth by supremely intelligent alien beings is as old as the hills - it has appeared in several sci-fi stories, including Quatermass and the Pit (1967), (although in that case the aliens themselves were wasp-like). The story seems to borrow a lot from Alien (another of Scott's films):<ul><li>The mindless alien bugs behave in a similar way to the aliens in Alien,melting spacesuits, burrowing into human bodies, turning them into hybrid creatures; </li></ul><ul><li>The female lead proves to be the toughest fighter;</li></ul><ul><li>There is a humanoid cyberman that leaks white fluid when damaged; </li></ul><ul><li>The organisation that is funding the mission has an ulterior motive that could compromise the crew. </li></ul>The plot does not bear too much scrutiny. The actions of the crew in dangerous situations seem ridiculous (e.g. a geologist trying to stroke a reptilian creature without any knowledge of its demeanour or weaponry). The robot 'spikes' one of the team's drink with an extract of alien DNA - for no apparent reason and then tries to force the female lead to give birth to an alien hybrid, again for no apparent reason. So it was rather confused or confusing. On the face of it. the downsides appear much larger than the positives. But on the whole it is a really enjoyable film that kept up the interest right up to the end - and the visual effects are stunning.",8,1,4,15 December 2012
