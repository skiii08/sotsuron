Blade Runner 2049," Only visuals and marketing
","Good start of movie that offers impression of a interesting action film.After 45 minutes of watching I can see that there comes boredom and lack of mystery or any other interesting thing about it.Good actors, beautiful visuals, but since when we started rate movies just upon that?It's just not captivating, not at all.I rarely rate a movie with 1/10, but this one seriously made my day.It also convinced me for the first time to make a movie review, to share the fact that it made me so disgusted.",1,5,8,21 January 2018
