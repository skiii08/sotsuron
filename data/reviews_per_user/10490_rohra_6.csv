The Ring," Very good story line loved it
","The Ring franchise left me wanting more when I finished watching all of them. Samara Morgan is such an iconic character that I fully understand, from researching her background. She is just a misunderstood little girl that no one understands. As for me, I do understand her. I feel very bad for her because her family treated her like an animal. I have watched the cursed videotape and as soon as 7 days came along, nothing happened. Just creepy stuff here and there but, nothing serious. I am still alive and well. But the end could be good",8,1,1,31 March 2020

Insidious," One time watch average movie
","I've just watched 2 of the insidious movies and I have to say I'm pretty satisfied. There were some boring part but it's worth your time they put each movie together like it's a puzzle. All the movies are connected, there some parts of the movies that might seem confusing at time but hey arent most horror movies confusing one time or another lol. Either way those movies are definitely worth watching if you like horror and evil spirits",6,0,0,1 April 2020
