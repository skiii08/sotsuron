Black Swan," good art is NOT EQUAL to good movie
","I honestly didn't like this movie, it made me feel claustrophobic, annoyed and somehow,disgusted. Now thats probably what the director was aiming at, to deliver a nightmarish sensation to the viewer. now if that is the case, that makes it a good piece of art because it strikes and shakes the audience.However, having said that, I think movies must be entertaining, enjoyable, and this was not the case for me.Its like the clockwork orange, everyone says is a masterpiece, but in reality its a disgusting movie with horrible characters you can't relate to.good pieces of art, but HORRIBLE movies!",3,2,4,15 August 2011
Pi," Boredom to the power of pi!
","I consider my self a little bit of a geek, so a movie about pi sounded really interesting for me, but it was a mayor let down.I thought this movie was going to be challenging and really make you think and awe about the power of math or something like that!but instead it was just a long sequence of tedious scenes of this depressive maniac and his obsessions.as others have said in their comments, this is not a movie about math, its about the twisted psychology of a perturbed man; for this, and some really long, flat and boring scenes, and the fact that you cant care less about the character, I give this movie a 2sorry but its just not entertaining",Null,1,2,11 September 2011
