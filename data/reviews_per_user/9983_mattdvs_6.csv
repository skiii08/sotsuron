Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A satisfying conclusion to the epic
","Tarantino makes his return to the talky action movie genre with the second part in his Kill Bill epic.  The first, naturally titled Kill Bill Volume 1, followed the Bride, a former assassin played by Uma Thurman, as she exacted bloody revenge on her former colleagues.  All we learn in the first movie is that on her wedding day, while pregnant, Bill, the Bride's boss, and his gang of DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) ambushed the wedding and massacred everyone.  They presumed to have killed the Bride, but they failed and instead left her in a coma for four years.  After waking up and teaching her muscles to move again, she begins her rampage to kill all those who wronged her.  The first movie concludes with the Bride killing the two bottom-tier assassins in the squad along with sixty-something bodyguards. At the end of Volume 1, we learn that he baby survived and, unbeknownst to her, was taken in by Bill and raised as his daughter.  We didn't know who any of the characters were, why they wanted to kill the Bride, or really anything at all about Bill, the charismatic leader of the gang.  Volume 1 was a hyper-kinetic action movie that only really took pause once, to explain how the Bride got her samurai sword.  It was a great film, but felt pretty superficial compared to any of Tarantino's others, in that one of his trademarks is the intimacy the audience feels with the characters.  The two volumes were supposed to come out as one movie, but as shooting went on, Tarantino and Miramax realized they were gonna have a four hour action movie on their hands, and so they decided to cut it into two more manageable chunks.  After watching Volume 2, it's hard to believe that Kill Bill was ever supposed to be anything but.If Volume 1 was supposed to just introduce us to the story and then watch the characters kill each other, Volume 2 explains all the whys.  Volume 1 was all action; Volume 2 is all talking.  This isn't meant to be a bad thing, however.  By the end of Volume 1, we wanted to know why we saw what we just saw.  In Volume 2, Tarantino explains it to us.  This serves to make us more connected with the characters.  We really care who lives and who dies.  And, the greatest thing about Volume 2 is by the end, even though we know what a heartless, murdering ba****d Bill is, we kinda like him.  We don't even like him in that villain-loving way, where we want to see him get his comeuppance.  We honestly like him and kinda wanna see him and the Bride (later revealed to be named Beatrix Kiddo) end up to raising their daughter together.  Obviously, as you can probably tell by the title, this doesn't happen.  No spoiler warning necessary there.This is quite a feat for Tarantino to pull off, given everything that we've seen before the end and knowing full well Bill and his cronies did everything to kill the Bride in several heinous ways.  This is what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 a fantastic movie.  By making us wait to have our questions answered, our sympathies change and change again throughout the story.  Yes, it's a talky movie, as every Tarantino movie up until Volume 1 was, but the dialogue is largely interesting and only serves to give every character some form of dimension.  Don't go into it expecting more of the same ultraviolence and gore as we saw in the first one, but rather with the attitude of trying to find out why all the ultraviolence and gore was necessary.My ratings (out of ****):Volume 1 Writing             *** Acting             **** Direction          ***1/2 Action                 **** Overall             ***1/2 Volume 2 Writing            **** Acting              **** Direction          **** Action              ***1/2 Overall             **** Entire epic Overall             ****",8,1,3,20 April 2004

Troy," Lather, Rinse, Repeat
","Ancient Greece was a very tidy place, or at least that's what the makers of Troy would have us believe. In the scenes following battles, Brad Pitt and his band of Greek soldiers look as pretty and well-kept as any shampoo commercial extras. They're chiseled bodies are clean-shaven, scar-free, and completely devoid of any of the dirt, blood, or other debris that would usually occupy a person after a battle. Not very realistic, don't ya think?That's what I thought too. There's no way that, following a bloody battle where heads, arms, legs, and other appendages get lopped off in the most grotesque ways, soldiers could come off the battlefield as clean as this. In fact, out of all the characters in Troy, only evil generals Agamemnon and Menelaus, played by Brian Cox (X-men 2, L.I.E.) and Brendan Gleeson (Braveheart, 28 Days Later, Gangs of New York) look as hairy and dirty as one would imagine their characters would. Troy, ineptly directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Air Force One, In the Line of Fire, The Perfect Storm), comes off as a film that doesn't know quite what it wants to be. Does it want to have the quiet personal notes mixed in with the one-on-one carnage of the much-superior Gladiator, or is it striving for the grand CG battles of Lord of the Rings? This dichotomy of aspirations causes it to fall short on both accounts. In its pursuit of being the ultimate battle-carnage-swords-and-sandals epic, the audience is left with nothing but comparisons to better films. This is not to say Troy doesn't have its moments of awe mixed in with the mediocrity. The sets are great, the costumes are appropriately realistic, and several of the CG shots look amazing, albeit strangely out of focus in some instances. Also, the performances of Cox, Gleeson, Eric Bana as Hector, and Sean Bean as Odysseus are so good that I wish the entire film had been about them. The scenes where they're on screen have such a gravity to them that their characters almost pull us away from the been-there-done-that feel of the rest of the movie. I think this could be because none of them are in the same realm, publicity-wise, as Brad Pitt. Their characters are made more believable by the fact that we don't know as much about their personal lives as we do Pitt's. In fact, I would have to say the casting of Brad Pitt is one of the biggest problems with this film.Now, before I commence trashing his performance in Troy, let me say that I generally regard him as one of my favorite actors; when he picks the right roles, that is. In Fight Club, Ocean's Eleven, Se7en, 12 Monkeys, and others, he shows he's not just a pretty face, and that he has some definite acting chops. The problem is that he's so visible a superstar that we don't buy him in the least as Achilles. I understand that being the son of a goddess would probably make Achilles a pretty attractive dude, but he is still a warrior. He would still have battle scars, still get dirty, and (gasp!), his hair wouldn't always look like he just walked out of a Pantene commercial. Pitt's performance isn't bad per-se, just average. His fight scenes are nifty, if a little over-choreographed, and his hairless body shows off every muscle to perfection (not to mention his ass, which we get to see a few times too many). Pitt's line delivery is a little shaky, though. His lines are generally delivered with a growl that makes him sound about as menacing as my grandmother with laryngitis. Of course, I can't pin all the blame for his performance on him, since he isn't really given all that much to work with. The script, written by David Benioff (The 25th Hour), is at best summer movie cheese and at worst, a blatant rip-off of Gladiator ('Are you not entertained?' has now been changed to, 'Is there no one else?'), with none of the latter's originality or transcendent philosophizing. Another major problem with this film is in an area one generally only notices when it's obviously good or obviously bad, the score. Star Wars, Schindler's List, Gladiator, and Lord of the Rings are prime examples of how an epic movie can be made even more epic in scope by having powerful music behind it. Even Titanic had a score so powerful that I'll cop to humming it for days afterward. Unfortunately, Troy has a musical score that is only memorable for being trite, lazy, redundant, and just plain bad. Noticeably bad. Resoundingly bad. Listening to Troy is like playing a cinema version of name that tune; one can immediately pick out melodic lines ripped directly from Braveheart, Gladiator, Stargate, and Enemy at the Gates. James Horner, apart from composing Troy, is generally one of the more dependable composers scoring for films today, even composing scores for Titanic, Braveheart, and Enemy at the Gates, and winning a few Oscars in the process. This is part of the problem with his compositions in Troy. His previous works are so recognizable that it's obvious when he's ripping himself off. An interesting point to mention is that Horner wasn't Peterson's first choice for Troy. Composer Gabriel Yared (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Cold Mountain, and the upcoming Shall we dance?) had composed and recorded a complete soundtrack for Troy, but Peterson, at the last moment, decided to reject it as being too old-fashioned and commissioned Horner to write a brand new score. I find that interesting, considering the entire point of Troy is to be an old-fashioned swords-and-sandals epic. I hope sometime they release Yared's original work so comparisons can be made between the two. Altogether, I don't think Troy is an awful movie. It's not even a particularly bad one. For a summer distraction, there are much worse ways to spend three hours. The problem I had was that it was just average, not spectacular in any way. Given the cast and budget, Troy could have been great and to have it turn out to be so mediocre is a real disappointment. With all of the budget crunches going on right now at both the state and federal levels of government, I can't help but think that the $200 million spent on making this film could have been much more wisely spent.",6,0,0,17 May 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Completely forgettable entertainment
","I waited a pretty long time before seeing this movie because I didn't want to deal with the rice rocket rallies during the first few weekends.  I knew, just from the previews, that it would attract a large audience, no matter whether it was actually a decent film or not.  After seeing it, I have to admit, once I turned off the analytical part of my brain, I enjoyed it. While it's definitely true that the screenplay was trite and predictable and most of the actors were seemingly hired based on looks rather than talent, this film was saved by a few things.  The most obvious of this film's saviors was the outstanding camera work during the films many chase/race sequences.  Also, Vin Diesel has a magnetic charisma that makes his even his non-racing scene watchable.  A few of the other actors, in particular Michelle Rodriguez, turn in passable performances too, although I'm definitely not impressed by pretty boy Paul Walker, who phones in a typical and contrived performance.  Overall, if, like me, you're able to turn off the part of your brain that wants you to scream 'Who talks like that???', then you'll probably find this an enjoyable film, if forgettable, film. 3/5",6,0,1,31 July 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Great if a little bit shorter...
","I was dragged to this movie by a girlfriend so, needless to say, I wasn't expecting much of anything.  While I enjoyed Baz Luhrman's 'Romeo and Juliet,' I wasn't part of the masses of people that thought it was a towering achievement.  Before I saw MR, I heard they were using current pop songs ('Like a virgin,''Roxanne') in the soundtrack and was very skeptical. Well I must say is was much better than I expected, and just about all the pop songs fit very well, with the possible exception of 'Like a virgin,' which was totally unnecessary.  I actually liked this film a lot, and was very happy that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang their own parts.  The visual style displayed is key, but not the only drawing point, and therefore works well within the context of the famous French nightclub.  My only complaint really was that it was about 20 minutes too long.  With a TRT of over 2 hours, the plot is just not thick enough to support this length, and therefore becomes a major detractor. 7/10",7,0,0,1 August 2001
The Replacements," A fun and enjoyable film
","Finally a football movie that gives the viewer what they want, football. Yes, 'The Replacements' is a stupid, unrealistic movie, but it's not meant to be taken that seriously.  It's a comedy overall, but also features some great football action with hilarious performances by John Favreau and Ryhs Ifans.  The thing that surprised me is that it's actually pretty well written.  For a film that doesn't try to achieve any kind of social commentary, it's screenplay doesn't dip into the melodrama of 'Any Given Sunday,' or the cheesy themes of 'Rudy.'  Of course, there is a love story involved, but by making the woman not just a cheerleader but actually very knowledgeable about football, it allows her to interact in the story and not just be the token babe.  Keanu Reeves, who I normally ridicule relentlessly, is at his dunderheaded best in a role that seems to suit him almost as well as his character in 'The Matrix' did.  I was surprised/delighted to see Gene Hackman in this film; he gives it a center of gravity around which all the other characters revolve.  Overall, not taking itself too seriously is the greatest asset to this movie.  Just having this quality, from which many other films could benefit, gives it a light-hearted feel that's just plain fun to watch.",7,0,1,17 August 2001
