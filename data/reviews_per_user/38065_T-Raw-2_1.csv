The Blair Witch Project," Warning: This movie creates motion sickness!!!
","Yes this movie was scary, yes this movie was entertaining, yes this movie was interesting.  However, viewers be warned.  Do not watch this film in the first few rows....this movie creates motion sickness!!!  The first ten minutes were fine, then the constantly moving camera started to play with my mind.  Towards the end all I could concentrate on was whether I was going to make it out of the theatre in one piece, without losing my dinner. Initially I thought I was the only one, but as soon as the credits started to roll, I looked around and everyone close to me looked green also.  The moral is:   Yes, go and see this movie.  But be careful where you sit!!!",Null,1,1,21 July 1999
