The Avengers," Nothing short of amazing
","Loved this movie!I saw this film on Frebuary 17 but you know I'm not much a science-fiction fan but I quite enjoyed this one, he his pretty good and incredibleThe movie centers around a girl and his best friends, the girl got a power and she has to live with and to use it properly. The boy is an only child and he lost his mother in a car accident so he has to live with his widowed father. Gwendoline try to help his friend the best she can, and a miracle appearsThe acting of the mains characters Clara Busin and Pierre Foliot was really great, Clara gives a beautiful and very convincing performance, especially during the more emotional scenes.There were moments in The dreaming girl that were so intense that I barely breathe. He is a gripping movie that will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, but it's well worth the ride !!!!",9,1,1,28 May 2017
