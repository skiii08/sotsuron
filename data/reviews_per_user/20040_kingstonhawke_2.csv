Sucker Punch," A Dumb Movie Disguised As A Smart Movie
","Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that a ton of people are making this out to be a great movie simply because they couldn't understand it, and they feel to do otherwise would be an admission of ignorance. Don't worry, it's not you...Sucker Punch is a convoluted mess, that suffers critically from an identity crisis. But, who to blame? Is it the writer's for trying to pack too much 'story' into a 2 hour limit? Was it the person who was too dumb to realize that you can't have a movie that deals with this many adult subjects and fit it into a PG13 shell without editing it to bits? Throw in sub-par acting, and I'm leaning towards 'all of the above'.Keep in mind I only saw the theatrical version (the version THEY chose to present)...I'm going to try to be brief and just note the major flaws in the movie.The movie is overly vague. They were going for the effect at the end of Inception where it was really up to you to interpret the events the way you like. But asking the audience to connect the dots how they like ONLY works if the position that the dots are in makes at least some sense. These dots are scattered all over the place causing inconsistent underdeveloped, extremely one dimensional characters across the board. The BabyGirl killing (or thinking that she did) her sister scene makes no sense at all. This is the foundatition to the whole movie, and even after reading other reviews I still don't know what happened. All I know is that it doesn't make any sense for that bullet to have killed her sister in that way. Or for her to even have taken only one shot and then bypass her dad to check on her sister who was ALREADY DEAD. How exactly was a labotomy going to fix this anyway? Labatomies only turn you into a veggie if they go wrong. That's a real medical procedure, why would he be counting on that to erase her memory?2. I understand that it doesn't make sense to make a fighting movie that's rated R because all those teeens that make up that demo count for a lot of dollars. But then you shouldn't of made a movie with such adult themes. Because what ended up happening is that they couldn't show anything adult like, and instead the movie ended up being nothing but vague subtext. Was it even an actual whore house or not?3. You can't have a bunch of things that make no sense, and then say it's OK because she was dreaming. That's a cop out. She really mesmerizes people so much with her dancing that they completely lose touch with reality? Really? That was an awful idea. More awful is that you never see her actually dance. Instead, they use this as a dumb excuse to try and reel in a young audience with drawn out fight scenes. Time that should be spent developing characters. Don't get me wrong, the fight scenes look fun. But they are predictable as heck. Even the one that included the curveball of her friend dying was telegraphed horribly.Everyone talking about courage and what not. How? She had a mental break down and instead of getting it together and getting out of the situation she stabbed a dude, started a fire, and helped someone escape all while out of touch with reality. Bleu the orderlies friends turning on him and saying 'let's stop hurting girls' was retarded also. Way to be consistent. They've been doing that for how long and all the sudden decide that they are gonna snitch on him as if he wont tell on them right back?I feel like I'm ranting... but seriously, movies like this frustrate me. Sucker Punch needs to get off of it's high horse and realize that there's nothing impressive about leaving a million holes in a story and then asking the audience to fill in all of them for you.",3,2,7,25 November 2012
Draft Day," NFL meets Lifetime. It'll make you feel good if you just don't think.
","I was tempted to give this movie a 1, but then I bumped it up to 2 because it succeeds as a feel good movie. My girlfriend is a football fan, and she liked it. So I think that's pretty much who this movie works for. Anyone who isn't so serious about movies that they puke at all the clich√©s. And also someone who isn't so serious about football that they become enraged at the lack of realism. Unfortunately I'm both of those things...Where this movie suffers is that it doesn't try to be unique at all. Instead of relying on the actual drama that is the NFL draft, it takes the cheap route and focuses on all this personal nonsense that no one cares about. The characters are thin, and the cast (outside of a few) isn't strong enough to pull off what little they have to work with. The Browns GM and staff is ridiculously dumb. People are saying that the trade he made was unrealistic, but that's not true. The real life Browns almost traded 3 1st for Andrew Luck, who is what Bo Callaghan is suppose to be a version of. What makes the Browns GM so inept is his lack of communication, his whole staff's lack of preparation (you scout EVERYONE, not just the guy you expect to take), and how indecisive he is...The ONLY thing that bails him out after he digs himself into this great big hole, you guessed it, conveniently dumber adversaries. They make the Jaguars GM the dumbest human on earth! Not only does he get fleeced (and if you blame it on him being a rookie, the safe pick was taking the QB) but he's so dumb he doesn't just call the Seahawks and cause a bidding war for his pick. The Seahawks GM should've already been on the phone with the Broncos, the Jags, etc if he wanted the QB so badly. No one just waits for a player to fall, all GMs are proactive, it's the nature of the competition. Because there's no telling which one of the other 31 teams will trade up ahead of you. It's not as simple as 'the Broncos wont take him because they have a QB' they wont, but they will trade the pick to someone who will. If the kid is valued worth 3 1st, then someone would've offered at least 1 to take him at 4. Seriously, this movie is just painful if you actually follow the draft... and I'm assuming that's the demographic they were going after when they decided to make a movie about the draft. I really do hate movies like this. They are fun enough when you're watching them. But as soon as they end and you reflect, it's like swiss cheese, so many holes.",2,5,10,27 April 2015
