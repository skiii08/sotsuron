Requiem for a Dream," Unbelievably real!!!!!!!!
","Wow! I finished watching this movie some two hours ago and went to bed. It's not just that I couldn't sleep it's that I couldn't stop thinking about it. And here I am, up again, writing this review. 'Requiem for a Dream' is a masterpiece of a modern cinema! It is one of those rare movies that can truly move you. It gives you the chills, it makes you think! Ellen Burstyn is so real that at the moments I felt like I wanted to extend my arm and help her. Her acting in this movie was breathtaking. The talk she is having with Jared Leto about her being lonely is one of the best performances by an actress I have ever seen on the screen. It's all there on here face, sadness and loneliness mixed up with hopes and dreams. Absolutely brilliant! And what is more important this movie is not just about addiction, it is about dreams, hopes and solitude. And much, much more! Definitely a must see! 10/10",10,0,1,3 April 2006
