Source Code," Great Concept!
","I don't know why this took so long for me to watch this; I even saw the similar Edge Of Tomorrow before this movie. I'm a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, Vera Faminga and Michelle Monaghan so it was no wonder I liked it. In fairness, I'm a sucker for any time-travel related films. It is the ultimate bitter sweet ending. The frozen scene of all the passengers laughing and smiling was brilliantly shot. However the only issue I have with the end is that even thought it's an alternate reality, she still sees another man. What happened to the man whose body he is inhabiting? Anyway... I hate that it nags away at me, but still a good movie.",8,1,1,9 September 2018
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Makes You Feel Like A Kid Again
","I remember watching this film multiple times when I was young and only recently revisited. The film still stands today, mostly thanks to the great story and the practical effects of ET himself.Young Drew Barrymore really steals every scene she's in and it makes sense why she's last this long in Hollywood. I had goosebumps by the end of the film. Absolutely brilliant.",9,0,0,18 May 2018
It," One Of The Better Remakes
","It's hard for me to say whether I liked this movie or the original better. For me they both have aspects about them I like. This one the cast is great, a much more modern and scary feel to it. That's why I'm giving it the same rating as the other, because I couldn't possibly choose. Bill Skarsgaard is arguably a better Pennywise than Tim Curry and that's coming from a big Curry fan.",8,0,1,3 October 2018
Hereditary," Disturbing and Unsettling
","I think IMDb has this rating perfect because I too would give it a 7.5 if I could. This is a really well done Horror film with Toni Collette being tremendous in it. There are some visuals in this movie that had me cringing and literally made me feel physically ill and that should say a lot about a film that is essentially trying to get that sort of reaction out of someone. I'm not sure if I would ever watch it again, but that's not based on the quality, this is based on my own mental health! Top notch film and one of the best horror films of the year.",7,2,5,23 August 2018
In Bruges," My Favorite Colin Ferrell Film
","This film can be a hit or miss for people and I can understand why with it being a dark comedy. However for me, I absolutely love it! It's just on the verge of one of my all time top favorited and that's why I gave it a 9. It's hilarious while still sticking to its dark plot; creating moments of great acting and human emotion. This is also a movie you can watch multiple times and still enjoy.",9,2,2,23 August 2018
Chinatown," Slow At Times, But Worth The Watch
","The reason I put this film on was because I like crime stories and Jack Nicholson. The film can tend to feel longer than it actually is and drags on. There are some slow parts, but unfortunately they are important to the overall story, so there is no way around then.How ever it's a decent crime noir that will have you wanting to watch the entire thing to discover what is really going on in this whodunnit. Jack Nicholson puts in a good performance and I'd only recommend to fans of crime stories because I don't think a casual film fan would enjoy this.",6,0,2,27 May 2018
Rocketman," A Great Format For A Music Biopic
","The music makes the man, so why not showcase it by showing that. The musical aspect made the story that much better and wasn't dumbed down to explain everything. It was written and directed in such a way that they knew the audience wasn't a bunch of idiots. The way the scenes transitioned was phenomenal making you feel just as dizzied as Elton John was feeling at the time. I'm a bigger Queen fan than I am an Elton John fan, but I enjoyed this movie much more than Bohemian Rhapsody.",8,1,3,2 September 2019
Wind River," Beautiful Poetic Film
","I knew I would be in for a treat when I first saw the trailer for Wind River starring Scarlett Witch and Hawkeye... sorry, I mean Renner and Olsen. The cinematography is stunning and every part of the wintery Alaskan landscape looks like a painting. The story is intriguing and features one of the tensest scenes I've watched since Sicario's boarder scene. This film was overlooked in the award season, just reminding everyone that Awards don't mean a damn thing when it comes to film.",8,0,1,20 April 2018
Unbreakable," Interesting Take On The Superhero Genre
",I enjoyed this movie but hate that it left more questions than answers! I assume we'll learn more in the film Glass. It is an interesting take on a superhero-esq film in that we're not even sure that is the kind of film we're watching. The twist at the end was something I actually didn't see coming because the director did such a great job of placing our focus elsewhere that we were never looking for an arch nemesis. Either way it's a fun watch and I look forward to some loose ends being tied up in Glass.,7,2,3,26 August 2018
Citizen Kane," Still Holds Up
","Now I understand this film is a ground breaking technical first in cinema history. The incredible cinematography and angling is now something you see constantly today. There is no doubting this movie is a 10/10 for that, however I wanted to review this based on the story and the entertainment value because that's why we watch films in the first place. Citizen Kane still holds up and that should be a testament as to why many people say it's the greatest film ever made and even though I don't agree with that statement, I understand people's stance on it. The story structure is incredibly implied; at first the jumping around had me worried this was going to be a confusing film, but it changes. We're able to get caught up quickly on who Kane is and what point in the story we're currently living in. The way we go back to his previous relationships and the stories narrative begins to become linear again and makes the story more impactful in my opinion when knowing its being told by someone in his life. There is a point where his second wife's story ends and then the Butler follows up what happened after when she wasn't around; it is masterful! Citizen Kane walks through many narratives, you can't help but be drawn into each one whether you know it or not. The most obvious one being a man who just wants everyone to like him and struggles to make everyone in his life happy because it'll conflict with one another. The point of lost childhood, pride, the struggle of having a relationship with a significant age gap and always being unsatisfied with success that you need to keep going. At one point it says Kane was always the bridesmaid, never the bride but he would never be the bride because he is an insatiable man. This movie also made me a bit emotional, I felt for Kane because he represents a little piece in all of us. It reminded me how short life really is. The way Orson Wells was able to make you sympathize with his character so quickly is an incredible feat for even the movies of today and that can credited to the acting, writing and direction, all in which Wells played a hand in. Not to mention the aging makeup was incredibly done for 1941. This isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but for me I was captivated throughout and wouldn't be surprised if I put it on again someday to revisit Citizen Kane as I grow older.",8,0,1,4 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Don't Listen To The Idiots
","The reason I say don't listen to the idiots is because they're giving it bad reviews because of Brie Larson. Watch this film for its own merit, no reason to make it political. It is a form of entertainment, sit back and enjoy. This move was good, not great but on the brink of it. I think the superhero fatigue is starting to hit me because the first part of the film took me a bit to get into, but once she gets to Earth the story starts to pick up and is just as funny, entertaining and charming as every other recent Marvel film. For the first female lead Marvel film, it knocked it out of the park with Brie Larson in the role. The chemistry between Larson and Jackson was tremendous and the '90s soundtrack was one of my favourites alongside Guardians Of The Galaxy. I enjoyed how they explained some unanswered questions about the universe in this film and look forward to seeing Captain Marvel in End Game as well as the sequel they heavily hinted at.",7,1,3,12 March 2019
12 Monkeys," Brad Pitt Is Insane!
","This may be the worst headline for a review I've done yet, but screw it! Again, I'm a sucker for time travel films, I always find them entertaining but this one didnt do it as well as some of the others. However that is based on all th either time travel films I've seen and this movie is still good! Brad Pitt absolutely kills it in this role, the same year he starred in Se7en so that is really saying something. It was fun to theorize at some plot points and it was nice to see others were thinking the same things as me, meaning I wasn't as lost as I thought I may be by the end. Glad I have this classic under my belt now and it is definitely one I'll have to watch again sometime.",7,0,0,10 April 2019
Shaun of the Dead," The Best Zombie Film
","I absolutely love the Cornetto Trilogy and Shaun Of The Dead is on the top of that trilogy. I remember seeing ads for it and thought the film would be a bad spoof film along the lines of Disaster Movie. This quickly became one of my favourite films and arguably the best in the zombie genre. It also introduced to Edgar Wright who I think is a brilliant filmmaker. I know it may be a 'trilogy' but I hope Pegg, Frost and Wright have more films in them.",10,0,1,23 April 2018
Us," Great Follow Up For Peele
","I really enjoyed this film. A lot of people (like they do with most films) like to knit pick small things instead of enjoying a film for its entertainment value. In terms of horror, this is one of the better horror films in years. I understand that there is an underlying message of the class system in the United States, but I had a good time watching this as a film. The biggest films in the world right now are super hero films and we don't ask questions about well how is this even possible? and knit picking small details like 'How did they get the red suits?' Who cares! It's horror film, not a historical re-enactments. Lupita is amazing in the movie and in fact, everyone involved was tremendous. This is definitely a film you'll have to watch twice and you'll be able to watch it with a whole different experience than the first thanks to the twist ending. However, there was only two things I didn't like too much about it. One was that horrendous scene at the end where we can see Lupita in the background in the class room and her face up close. It's just a bad shot that you can clearly see the editing in; which this film is really well shot, so it's just the smallest blemish. The other thing being how insane the plot came when Peele tried to explain how all this was possible. It kind of made you sit there and go, 'okay?' This felt like a film where we didn't really need any solid answers as to why this was happening. All in all, a good film that I ended up eating higher than his previous film Get Out, but it is really close. Looking forward to seeing his next film!",8,3,5,3 April 2019
The Irishman," A Beautiful End To An Era
","The appeal and glamour of the gangster lifestyle evaporate in The Irishman as Scorsese washes his hands of the genre. This truly felt like a bookend to the gangster films as we've come to love from director Martin Scorsese and it ended up being one of his best. The fact that some theatres wouldn't play it because it is a Netflix streaming film is a travesty to filmmaking. You would think they would have learned from Blockbuster's mistake, but here we are once again.The Irishman is about former mafia hitman Frank Sheeran played by Robert De Niro and the disappearance of Al Pacino's Jimmy Hoffa. This is a movie in which Scorsese doesn't sugar coat anything; showing how this life can affect your family and your livelihood provided you live long enough to die of old age.The strongest performance comes from Joe Pesci, who was talked into coming out of retirement just to do this film and for someone who hasn't acted in over a decade; he eases back into the craft like a fine wine. If he doesn't score a Best Supporting Actor award, why are we even having the ceremony? It also amazes me that the only scene between Joe Pesci and Al Pacino was the one and seemingly only scene the two will have shared in their legendary careers.I felt the same way I felt the first time I watch Goodfellas while watching The Irishman and that is one of my all-time top five films and in a way, this is an anti-Goodfellas film. At a staggering three and a half hours, I only looked at the clock once with a well-paced storyline that you have to praise Editor Thelma Schoonmaker for. While we're on the subject of post-production, the de-aging technology was incredibly implemented.One scene that stood out to me was of Frank in the war; discussing how the soldiers would dig their graves unwilling to accept their fate as if they were somehow going to escape death. This foreshadows the entire story of Jimmy Hoffa. He is a man who we watch continually dig his grave deeper and deeper while continuing to believe he'd escape death. I mean even when he walks into the empty house and is standing on the plastic wrap; he is standing in his actual grave and still tries to escape. This particular scene reminded me a lot of Joe Pesci's scene in Goodfellas as he walks into the empty room, however, he immediately recognizes and accepts his fate.The final half-hour was unexpected and hits you like a ton of bricks. It was one of the only times I watch a movie and felt fearful about growing old. This is a man whose friends have all died before him and his family wants nothing to do with him as he sits as a decrepit man stripped of any power, alone as it nears Christmas day. When his nurse admits she's never heard of Jimmy Hoffa, it seems as though all the power and money, in the end, wasn't worth it while Frank struggles with mortality as he reflects on his life.These are actors I love in a film genre that I came to love them in most likely their final performance together and I couldn't be happier. This truly was a beautiful and incredible film and by far the best film I've seen in 2019. As Dr. Seuss said, 'Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.'",10,2,6,29 November 2019
Spice World," So Bad Its Good?
","This movie is nostalgic for me because I group during the Spice Girls craze. It was only recently I revisited the film and sure it didn't hold up to the nostalgia I built up for it but it was fun nonetheless. There really is no plot, it goes off the rails and feature many meta jokes, some of which got a genuine laugh from me. It was nice to escape into a 90s time capsule for a little while and feel like a kid again.",5,0,1,19 November 2018
Blade," One Of The Beat Comic Book Adaptations
","I had heard of Blade for years. He was a character I knew about and also some of the things that made him. I was still taken back by how badass Wesley Snipe could be; standing ominously before turning into a full on machine. The story was great, the cast was great and they had great source material and absolutely delivered. Looking forward to Balde 2 and 3!",8,0,1,16 April 2018
Hot Fuzz," Another Cornetto Great
","The second film in one of the best trilogies of all time, Hot Fuzz delivers nearly as well as Shaun of the Dead did. On its own, it's another great film, taking the classic buddy cop film and turning into something completely different.",8,0,1,23 April 2018
Constantine," Underrated Comic Boom Adaptation
","The first time I even knew about the character of John Constantine was on the CW show Arrow. He was different and I found him interesting that I began to do more research on his comics and found this film. I had no idea Keanu played this role and it was a pleasant surprise. He was a darker and grittier character than on CW and I loved it all more for that. The lore was interesting and had a different take on all of it with the story of Gabriel and The Devil - which by the way I loved the way the actor portrayed the Devil, making him almost likeable. Whenever I hear about comic book films, I never hear this one mentioned which is strange because it is quite good. This is a top five Keanu Reeves film for me!",7,1,2,19 July 2019
Insomnia," Really Good Crime Thriller
","This was a great twist on the classic cat and mouse crime thriller. Al Pacino is great and Robin Williams is even better. It's amazing how many films I can watch of him and completely escape into his character. There are some great subtle details that you can enjoy
It on rewatch. I didn't realize this was directed by Christopher Nolan until after I watched the film and now I understand the attention to detail. Would highly recommend for anyone who loves a good crime thriller.",7,0,0,19 June 2018
Deadpool 2," Better Than Thid First
","I actually had Deadpool as one of my few films with a perfect 10 rating, but after seeing this one I had to knock it down to a 9. The first one had a lot of flashback scenes but this one really let Deadpool be Deadpool. From the hilarious surprise cameos to the great new characters like Domino and Cable it really felt like a great film and arguable one of the best sequels of all time.My first perfect 10 film of the year!",10,1,2,8 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," The Best Of The Three Thor Films
","It's not often that a sequel outshines the original, but Ragnorak is Thor's best leading film. It feel much more lively, fun and comic book-esq. familiar faces and stand out new characters work together to create this visually stunning and solid story film that leads into Infinity War. Mark Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth surprisingly work well as an onscreen duo.",7,1,3,21 April 2018
The Terminator," A Classic Action Flick
","There is no wonder this was such an iconic film in the Sci-Fi & Action genres. The story is good, the make up is hit and miss. They did a great job of making Arnold look robotic, but later on the make-up is rough. The graphics also don't hold up, but other than it is a great story. There are just some moments and spots that I can't give it more than a seven, but I do think it is a good film that every film lover must see.",7,1,3,16 September 2018
Ready Player One," Better Than The Book
","I read this book by Ernest Cline a while ago and really did enjoy it because I'm a big nerd and a sucker for nostalgia; it was the ultimate story for me. When I found out it was being made into a film directed by Steven Spielberg but questioned how some moments in the book could possibly be depicted on screen. With already high expectations, I was blown away.This was a completely different film experience I had. Spielberg proves he can still make captivating stories come to life on screen. I've seen reviews trashing this because of technicalities, but what this was, was a popcorn movie. When I say that, I mean it's not going to win any creative awards, but it sure as hell will entertain you. The film is much different from the book, but you had to have expected that and I think it made it much better.The Shining scene was the most fun I ever had watching a movie in theatres. Everyone was surprised and enjoying watching Aech walk through a film where we already knew what was going to happen, but she didn't. It has me impatiently waiting for the Blu Ray in hopes they have a featurette on how that scene came to be.It may be new, but I already think this would be on one of my all-time favourite films list.",9,0,1,16 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," More Than Just A Figure Skating Film
","Sports is a huge passion of mine, despite not being an athletic abilities myself I've always been drawn to competition. The Tonya Harding story I knew from a documentary I watched regarding the famous 1994 incident involving Nancy Kerrigan. Figure skating wasn't ever something I enjoyed watching, but every sport has their stories and this is definitely the first thing people think about when they hear 'figure skating'. This story does recount the incident, but dives much deeper into Tonya's life - some of which may or may not be true.The film starts off by showing Tonya's love for ice skating at only four-years-old. That is the simplicity of the film; a girl who loves the sport she competes in and overcomes obstacles to obtain her dream. However it takes a turn showing her abusive and toxic relationship with her Mother played by Allison Janney. Her need to be loved comes at a cost when she leaves her Mother only to be put back into another abusive and toxic relationship with her boyfriend - turned future husband - Jeff Gillooly. I like how the film tows the line - taking an unbiased look into Tonya's life. Writer Steven Rogers is able to show that Tonya had a terrible upbringing and life, but also points out that she wasn't always the lovely person she let on to be. Repeatedly stating that nothing was her fault and taking no responsibility for her actions. Despite all that, this is the classic rags to riches tale that comes with a cost. She mistakes fame for the love she desperately desires. However no one really knows exactly what is true because the film is based on many interviews with everyone involved in a Scorsese-esq biopic - having the characters at times break the fourth wall and claim what did and didn't happen. You do get a good idea on how things went down though, because between everyone's separate recounts, there are some moments where their stories coincide with one another. Janney plays the textbook, overbearing sports parent that we all know still exist. Pushing their kids to do better by treating them with what they think is 'tough love'. She shines in this film, stealing every scene she is in; making you despise her. If you remember back when I spoke about Margot Robbie, I said her good looks were getting in her way. Everything she was cast in was the pretty blonde, but you could tell she was just about to break out of that and show everyone the talented actress she can be and she does that in this film. This in my opinion is Robbie's coming out role; showing everyone she is more than a pretty face and can act toe to toe with the best of them. There were a few things I didn't enjoy, which kind of stood out like a sore thumb; one being the atrocious CGI effects used when Robbie is skating. I understand that clearly isn't her doing those spins on the ice, but did they have to make it so obvious? With today's technology, you'd think it would be able to look more realistic and less green-screeny. The other thing I disliked was the 'character' of Shawn; Tonya's bodyguard who conspired in the breaking of Nancy Kerrigan's knee. I put character in quotes because he is based on the real man and unfortunately he comes off too cartoony. Instead of being the dumb person he is meant to be portraying, he comes off like a henchman from a bad '80s superhero movie. Overall, I enjoyed the film. If you're thinking you don't want to see a movie about figure skating, that is just what the story is presented on; it is much more than that and should be mentioned alongside some of the other great sports biopics. I, Tonya deserves a watch if you enjoy a unique take on a story as old as time.",6,0,0,15 April 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Not Your Typical Western, But All The better For It
","Amidst my recent western marathon, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is the only film I've watched based on true events. This film is carried by the tremendous chemistry between Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford's Sundance Kid. It is by far one of the best on screen duos I've ever had the pleasure of watching. They play off one another brilliantly with a back and forth witty dialogue that reminded me of Ocean's Eleven. One of my favorite lines being:Sundance Kid: 'I'll go.'Butch Cassidy: 'This is no time to be brave. You go.'The film picks up with the two outlaws near the end of their career in robbery. After being chased off to Bolivia the two begin robbing banks there until the authorities finally catch up with them. Going out on some further witty dialogue about moving to Australia moments before stepping out of a barn and going out in a blaze of glory.Going into Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid I only knew two things about it; they both die and the famous bike scene highlighted with the soundtrack Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head which plays a pivotal moment for the infamous duo. This moment is meant to depict the high point of their careers because after that moment everything starts to go downhill leading to their demise - a calm before the storm if you will.Another interesting scene for me was when they decide to go 'straight' taking up a job as an older man's hired protection. Here Butch Cassidy admits to The Sundance Kid that he's never shot anyone before. The first time he kills anyone is when he's on the right side of the law blurring the line between bad and good. You forget that these two are the outlaws, but you can't help but find yourself rooting for them.One thing I noticed about this film was how much Brad Pitt looks and acts like a young Robert Redford. It is almost uncanny and now makes me want to go watch 2001's Spy Game starring the two. This is a great western, but at a much slower pace than most. The film focuses mostly on the relationships and dialogue than it does the action. However it is captivating with the beautiful scenery and makes you feel like you know these two men after two hours. This isn't your typical western, but it is all the better for it.",8,1,2,4 November 2018
Ocean's Twelve," Disappointing, Yet Still Entertaining
","Ocean's Twelve is the weakest film in the Oceans trilogy. However, despite the move to Europe, this film has most of the ingredients the first one had, making it still an entertaining viewing. It just didn't feel right when watching it, but does become a key part of the continuous storyline that plays throughout the three films; making it a must watch for fans of the first. I have to mention the Julia Roberts/Julia Roberts scene was just bad. It probably seemed like a good idea at the time, but the fourth wall break was unnecessary for a quick laugh that really just throws the film momentarily off par.",6,1,2,15 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Interesting & Entertaining
","If it wasn't based on a true story, you probably wouldn't believe that a black man was able to become a member of the KKK. This is an incredible story, that is entertaining and has as many humorous moments as it does powerful moments. The chemistry is great between both Washington and Driver, their characters brought together for being the focus of the hate group. There is a strong reminder that we are far from when this story actually took place which is unfortunate. I also like that this wasn't a one sided story. It shows that both sides hate the police, assuming they're all the same as well while Ron is stuck in the grey area in the middle. A reminder not to judge someone by the color of their skin or the uniform they wear. Overall, I'm impressed at how entertaining this film turned out to be and I'll definitely watch it again.",8,9,18,17 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The Best Of All The Spider-Man Films
","I grew up with Tobey MaGuire as my Spider-Man, but the film got the casting right. Not only is Tom Holland a great choice for Spider-Man, but he rings more true to his comic book counterpart. This movie is not only charming, but hilarious. Combining the combination of humor, action and heart that we've become accustom go with Marvel films. Not to mention that Michael Keaton plays one of the best Marvel villains we've seen on screen with a backstory and motive that can make you almost sympathize with him. In my top five MCU films, see it if you haven't gotten the chance to yet.",8,1,6,27 May 2018
Begin Again," Will Make You Fall In Love With Music All Over Again
","Dan: That's some song you got there. I promise you it could be a big hit. Plus you're beautiful.Gretta: I'm sorry, what's beauty got to do with anything?This is the first exchange between Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley's characters in this story about flawed lives intertwining with a backdrop of music. This film centers around Gretta (Knightley) a young singer-songwriter who is new to Manhattan and Dan (Ruffalo) a music-business executive who both meet each other at pivotal moments in their life. Gretta who recently broke up with her rising star boyfriend Dave Kohl (Adam Levine) and Dan who had recently split from his partner lean on each other. With a little bit of help from her friend Steve (James Corden), who steals certain scenes with his witty humour. (Side note: James Corden will be making his mark on Late Night by replacing Craig Ferguson on The Late Late Show soon).Begin Again questions the music industry as a whole, while showing you someone who is a sellout and one who is in it for the love of music. There came a point when it was no longer about the art form, but about the money that could be made. The industry will check you up and spit you back out again given the chance at an extra buck. Dan and Gretta butt heads on this topic many times throughout the film. Dan wants to make Gretta into a hit maker while she just does it for her own pleasure. This film will make you fall in love with music all over again. The film may be about life and relationships, but this feels like a love letter to music from writer/director John Carney. Songs written specifically for the film show the depth of music and is used as a way to communicate and express one self. Knightley's soothing voice backed by a great melody will make you want to hear it over and over again.If this film doesn't get a nomination for original song it should receive acting nods for Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo's performance as a alcoholic finding his way to become a good Father is mesmerizing, while Knightley's performance is one of her best. Two actors who you would never think would go together, have an onscreen chemistry casting agents only dream of.",9,1,1,15 April 2018
Ocean's Thirteen," Better Than Ocean's Twelve
","This film is by far better than Ocean's Twelve, but clearly not better than Ocean's Eleven which I rated a '9'. This film gets back to its roots by returning to Vegas, however this time it isn't about the cash, but revenge with Al Pacino playing the villain - really the only actor other than maybe De Niro, who was missing from this franchise. I enjoyed this film and I've got to say... The Nose most definitely plays.",7,0,0,15 April 2018
Doctor Strange," Benedict Cumberbatch Is Doctor Strange
","It's sometimes hard to disassociate an actor from their most famous role and for Benedict Cumberbatch, that would be Sherlock Holmes. However he is such a brilliant actor that he never gets that sort of treatment, you're able to separate the character from the actor and I can't imagine anyone better for the role of Doctor Strange than Cumberbatch. Marvel never really screws up casting for this MCU, but I'd say this was one of their best ones. Doctor Strange is different from the other films and I was worried it may be hard to keep up with, but they made it quite simple to understand one of Marvel's most complicated characters. Looking forward to seeing more of Doctor Strange.",7,1,1,23 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Possibly The Best Film Of 2017
","Let me start off by quickly addressing the 'controversy' brought on after the film's release and Golden Globe wins. The first one of people being upset that Peter Dinklage's character is continuously referred to as a 'midget'. Take a second to realize the film takes place in the clearly racially divided South; do you really think they would be politically correct? The second one being Sam Rockwell's character being a racist cop who finds redemption. It is a movie for Christ sakes! Why does everyone have to be a social justice warrior! Just enjoy the experience or don't watch it at all. This could go into a much longer rant, but I'll save it for another time; now on to the review. Three Billboards... is the best film of the year in my opinion and deserves all the hardware it is receiving from award shows. The film is loosely based on a true story, but goes off trail in order to get more creative. The film centers around Frances McDormand's Mildred; a vengeful Mother who is pissed off with the small town police department because there has yet to be any arrests in her daughter's murder and takes matters into her own hands. That is already an interesting enough plot, but this film has a bit of every genre from comedy to suspense to drama all while keeping you captivated. I have to say, I'm a serial clock-glancer; always wondering how far into a movie or show I am, but with this film I didn't look once. Luckily if you've seen the trailer, that didn't scratch the surface of the story's arch; leaving you pleasantly surprised. Three stories are told in this film, all involving people struggling with their past, present and future respectively; Mildred with her past, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) with his present and Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) with his future. I like how the story doesn't paint this black and white story and doesn't pit Harrelson's and McDormand's character against her with the force of good vs. evil. You find yourself sympathizing with both of them; leading to such powerful, emotional conclusions that will make you feel like you're on an emotional rollercoaster. The only bad thing I can say about this film is that damn CGI deer! What is with bad CGI this year? Sam Rockwell has been one of my favourite actors for a long-time now; in my opinion he is one of the most talented performers alive. I think back to his performance in the Green Mile and wonder how he didn't manage to get an Oscar then, but this might finally be his year. In a film surrounded by acting powerhouses, he shines. Brilliantly portrayed, his character's story arch is one of the best and most satisfying ones I've ever seen in film - something you generally only see in television. Francis McDormand continues to demonstrate why she is a top tier actress and let's not forget about Woody Harrelson. Harrelson doesn't get much praise for this role, but he brings heart to a character we're meant to despise by the start of the film. Willoughby's final scene is gut-wrenching, yet beautiful and was the scene that stood out to me most.Three Billboards... will go down as one of the best films Hollywood has to offer. I haven't seen a critically acclaimed film in the past few years that I enjoyed this much and therefore I'm giving this an 'A+'. If you're not watching any other film this year, make it this one; you won't regret it!",8,1,2,15 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Best Film Of 2017?
","Let me start off by quickly addressing the 'controversy' brought on after the film's release and Golden Globe wins. The first one of people being upset that Peter Dinklage's character is continuously referred to as a 'midget'. Take a second to realize the film takes place in the clearly racially divided South; do you really think they would be politically correct? The second one being Sam Rockwell's character being a racist cop who finds redemption. It is a movie for Christ sakes! Why does everyone have to be a social justice warrior! Just enjoy the experience or don't watch it at all. This could go into a much longer rant, but I'll save it for another time; now on to the review. Three Billboards... is the best film of the year in my opinion and deserves all the hardware it is receiving from award shows. The film is loosely based on a true story, but goes off trail in order to get more creative. The film centers around Frances McDormand's Mildred; a vengeful Mother who is pissed off with the small town police department because there has yet to be any arrests in her daughter's murder and takes matters into her own hands. That is already an interesting enough plot, but this film has a bit of every genre from comedy to suspense to drama all while keeping you captivated. I have to say, I'm a serial clock-glancer; always wondering how far into a movie or show I am, but with this film I didn't look once. Luckily if you've seen the trailer, that didn't scratch the surface of the story's arch; leaving you pleasantly surprised. Three stories are told in this film, all involving people struggling with their past, present and future respectively; Mildred with her past, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) with his present and Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) with his future.

Bohemian Rhapsody," The Best Band Biopic I've Seen
","This was a tremendous and entertaining film. Many music biopics like to just look at the personal lives, but this also shows how the music was made; the thought process behind some of their biggest hits. It was also nice to see everyone look like the real people they were portraying and not shoe horn an actor in there like they did with Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison. I had goosebumps during the Live Aid concert the same way I did the first time I watched it. Great film for not only Queen fans, but music fans in general.",7,2,2,20 January 2019
Bird Box," Sandra Bullock Is Back!
","I haven't seen Sandra Bullock in a while and sure she was in Ocean's Eight, but this was much better and showcases Bullock's acting abilities better. I really enjoy these kind of post-apocalyptic films. It is similar to A Quiet Place, but instead of having to be quiet, you can't see the monster. It's an interesting take on the genre and will have you on the edge of your seat with an unnerving feeling throughout. Highly recommend!",7,1,4,4 January 2019
Baby Driver," I Don't Think Edgar Wright Can Make A Bad Film
","Sure this film wasn't on the level of the Cornetto trilogy, but it was really my first time seeing an Edgar Wright film starring Hollywood A-Listers. It was a really well done film and feels completely different from what I'm used to seeing, but it works. I may have rated this film lower than his other films, but that doesn't mean I didn't really enjoy this film.",7,0,2,23 April 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," Action Packed, But That's About It
","I thank god everyday they stopped at three because I can only imagine the fourth instalment would continue to fall in quality. If you like action, you may enjoy this, but that's all there really is in this film. The script must have been twenty pages long because it's basically one long final battle, stretched into an entire film. By the time it reached the final thirty minutes, I didn't care who won. I just wanted it to be over.",5,0,0,17 April 2018
Man of Steel," Not Bad Considering What Followed
","I've never been a big Superman fan. Growing up I gravitated more to Batman and Spider-Man, but this film was entertaining and the best recent DC film, just behind Wonder Woman. It is too bad, because this DC Universe has so much potential. Henry Cavill was cast perfectly for this role and I really can't see any other actor in this day and age playing the titular role. Forget what follows it and just watch this as a stand-alone film and you'll appreciate it much more.",6,0,3,18 April 2018
Lilo & Stitch," In My Top 5 Disney Animations
","This film came as a surprise for me at how much I enjoyed it. I remember when it first came out, there was a lot of hype behind it, including a televised concert. Not only is it a great story, but it also has a great Elvis soundtrack that you wouldn't think would mesh well with a cartoon about an Alien. Lilo and Stitch are the greatest on-screen animated Disney duo!",8,0,0,21 April 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," One Of The Best Spider-Man Adaptations
","I grew up with Spider-Man, but specifically Peter Parker; it was cool to see Spider-People I didn't know a lot about and a few I didn't even know existed. This was a thrill ride from beginning to end with the art being the highlight, but the story not too far behind. This is a magical representation of comic books on the screen and I hope to see more like it.",8,2,5,20 February 2019
She's the Man," You're Run Of The Mill Teen Comedy
","This came out when Amanda Bynes was at her peak and I remember watching the Amanda Show at the time, but somehow I didn't even realize this film existed until a few years ago. It was your classic color by the numbers teen comedy, that wasn't bad since it did follow those tropes heavily. It got a few laughs out of me, but is more of a Saturday night TV movie.",5,0,0,21 April 2018
Ocean's Eleven," The Ultimate Popcorn Movie
","This is the biggest cast ensemble up until The Avengers when Brad Pitt and George Clooney were Hollywood's top guys. The film is subtly humorous, making for big laughs. This movie is why people made movies in the first - it is pure entertainment from start to finish with every actor getting their chance to shine. If you're looking for a entertaining film, look no further than Ocean's Eleven because it features everything great about cinema. You'll appreciate it even more on multiple viewings.",9,1,2,14 April 2018
Tropic Thunder," Decent Action Comedy
","I enjoyed this film, but some of the jokes are a hit and miss. I like the concept and the cast is great, but there just seemed to be something missing from it. It's good we got it when we did though because a film like this would never be made in the politically correct world we live in now. Robert Downey Jr steals every scene he is in and has some the weirdest but most quotable lines in the film.",7,3,4,27 July 2018
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Edgar Wright Is A Genius
","This is such a uniquely made film and was visually pleasing. Paying homage to the video game, it does it in such an over the top way, yet it doesn't feel forced. I'm a bit bias having grown up near Toronto and my former hometown of Brampton getting a quick shoutout. Scott Pilgrim is by far Michael Cera's best role and most creative film. I really do lesbian it.",9,2,3,23 April 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A Fitting Farewell To A Film Era
","I understand that there are still many Marvel films in the works but this really did feel like a conclusion to the 20+ films that came before. Great action sequences with a lot of payoffs for anyone who has seen the previous film and will run you through the entire scope of emotions. There is one seen in particular that was incredible and gave me goosebumps. This is something we've never seen happen before and something we may never again. It really took so many pieces to fall in place and for that this film will stand the test of time and should be considered a milestone event, rather than just a great film. For those reason this is a 10/10 film.",10,1,5,30 April 2019
The Princess Bride," A Classic
","If you're a film fan and you don't at least enjoy this film the tiniest bit, I have to question your taste. The Princess Bride is an amazing fantasy story told through a Grandfather and Grandson in a way that can't be duplicated. The movie is in a league of its own with a memorable cast and quotable dialogue that is still used today. This is the perfect sick day film in that it truly makes you feel like a kid again.",10,1,1,21 April 2018
Saving Private Ryan," Greatest War Film Of All Time
","This film is amazing. Spielberg is able to create suspense in Saving Private Ryan like no other. Keep you on the edge of your seat with every muscle in your body tenses up.The opening scene of the storming of the beach is an iconic moment in cinema and becomes the measuring stick of how to open a film. This particular scene has been duplicated many times in film, television and video games, but nothing compares to this films depiction of war. Showcasing all the different reactions people suffer in war and makes me thankful I was born in the time period I exist in now. The dialogue is phenomenally written; being displayed during the scene in which they discuss their opinions on their mission after just setting out. You find yourself connected to this group of men almost immediately. The cinematography is beautifully shot and depicts the morality of these soldiers decisions.I would highly recommend this film to even the most casual film fan. It truly is great and arguably Spielberg's greatest work.",9,2,3,17 May 2018
The Favourite," Rich People Are People Too
","The Favourite takes place in the 18th century England, a time period film that I usually check out of about ten minutes in. However this movie was captivating and surprisingly funny by some of its absurdities and witty dialogue. Olivia Colman plays a sickly Queen Anne with her Lady in waiting Sarah seemingly running the government from behind the scenes. Enter in Emma Stone's Abigail - Sarah's down on her luck cousin who Queen Anne takes a shine to and you have a power struggle that can affect the future of the country.If you have yet to see the film, I would stop reading here because I am about to get into some major spoilers. I planned on making a spoiler-free review but there is too much to unpack. The film sets the tone from the start with a man masturbating to Abigail on a stage coach; revealing this isn't going to be your typical run of the mill royalty film. Then the shocking twist that Queen Anne and Sarah are in a sexual relationship with one another is revealed, throwing the entire plot on upside down. I have to applaud whoever put the trailer together, because they put in enough to intrigue you, but left out that one major detail.This film reminded me of BlacKkKlansman as in I was surprised by how humorous it turned out to be. The ballroom dance scene is brilliant and I feel is the core of the absurdity this film portrays. Sarah and Masham dance in a way that would make you think they were time travelers; sporting moves that were way ahead of their time with their b-boy moves. With the physical humour aside, the films dialogue is sharp. An example of this is when Masham meets Abigail in the middle of the night in attempt to court her:Abigail: 'Are you here to seduce me or rape me?'Masham: 'I am a gentleman.'Abigail: 'Rape it is.'Everyone involved in this film had a tremendous performance. Emma Stone was able to make us empathize with her, only to despise her by the end; Rachel Weisz able to seemingly do the same, but vice versa, with Olivia Colman portraying the vulnerable and lonely Queen Anne with compassion. This is a film that leaves you unsure who to root for because both characters are just as vile and manipulative as the other; created by the outstanding chemistry between Stone and Weisz whose characters are willing to bend and break their own morality for the slightest glimmer of power. Showing the battle within the Queen's chambers is just as important to the country as the battle miles away with the French. I'd also like to give quick props to Nicholas Hoult who under all of that makeup forced me to look up on IMDB to make sure that was who it was; he makes up the majority of the humour within this film and absolutely nailed the role.I wanted to discuss the ending momentarily and my interpretation of it, because director Yorgos Lanthimos is apparently known for his ambiguous endings and this film is no different. The final moments we see Abigail seemingly victorious on her knees as Queen Anne presses down on her head for balance; regret depicted on her face as the screen is overlapped with her rabbits. I believe this is reminder that Queen Anne got these rabbits in attempt to fill the void of her seventeen unborn/dead children. They'll never be able to replace the real thing; in which Abigail is nothing more than another one of her rabbits. A cheap imitation of the woman she truly loved and cared about Sarah. Sure, Abigail filled her lonely void at the time, but banishing Sarah was like losing a piece of her as shown by her struggling to run the government in her absence and now she is forced to live with the consequences of her decision.I was planning on giving this film a lower rating because after watching it, I wasn't overwhelmingly enthralled by it. However the more I thought about it, the more I liked it; it was a slow burn for me. I found myself thinking about this film the next morning; small little details that had only come back to me after reflection. This movie can be picked analyzed and picked apart in many different ways and that is the best thing about it; no answer is wrong because it is all a matter of interpretation by the viewer. I believe this film was a top notch for the fact it was funny, intense and was in a genre that usually doesn't intrigue me, but still found myself hanging on to every word and action. The Favourite may not be my favourite of the year, but it is well worth the watch - yeah I did the stupid pun.",8,7,13,23 January 2019
City of God," Incredible Film
","This film not only has a fascinating story, but it is an incredibly well made. The way the story is told - meeting characters who are important to the plot, yet you don't know that until later when it is all tied together. The shots are gorgeous and I was wowed by many of the camera transitions throughout; especially the cut between Lil Ze to Steak to Carrot. As for the entertainment factor and story of City Of God it has a powerful message of corruption and the lengths people will go to, to survive in the never ending cycle of crime and poverty within the City. Some of the scenes are hard to watch as it feels like your watching a documentary instead of a film, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat and engaged for the entire run time. I would recommend this film to anyone whether you're a film nerd, filmmaker or just casual viewer.",10,0,0,29 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," More Of An Event Than A Movie
",I absolutely loved this film. The way the characters we know and love we re-introduced was brilliantly done and just thrilling to see on the big screen. The only reason I couldn't give it a 10/10 is because of the 'deaths' at the end of the film. The ink death that effected me was Spider-Mans because of Tom Holland's amazing performance. It was hard to mourn these characters when it was clearly obvious they'd be coming back somehow because of all the future film announcements. You can't have Guardians of the Galaxy 3 with just Rocket.Other than that. Go see this in theatres if you get a chance to. The film is action packed and hilarious because of the connection between the characters. This really is what DC is missing out on in their films.,9,2,10,15 May 2018
Get Out," Would Give 7.5 If That Was An Option
","I really enjoyed this film and was like a breath of fresh air. Finally a horror/thriller where the main character doesn't make ridiculously stupid decisions. In fact in the end, he makes one genius like decision. Interested in seeing what Jordan Peele has for us next!",8,7,14,17 April 2018
Hellboy," Came Uo Short Of My Expectations
","I'm a fan of Ron Pearlman and I really thought I would like Hellboy and I did like the character, however there felt like something missing. I really wish I could put my finger on it, but it wasn't at all what I expected. However it was entertaining and deserves at least a 6. Maybe a 6.5 if that was an option.",6,0,2,16 April 2018
Across the Universe," Yes, I'm A Beatles Fan
","By looking at the audience's reaction to this film, it seems you either like it or you don't; there is no middle ground. I really enjoyed it. I've never seen a film that has taken previously recorded music and weave it so well into a coherent story. Plus being a Beatles fan, I was ecstatic to discover it years after its release. Sure the story is color by the numbers, but it will have you feeling good by the end credits.",8,0,0,14 April 2018
I Am Legend," Not Too Shabby
","This is another film that gets a lot of hate, mostly because of the ending. I thought it was a decently done post-apocalyptic film that features only one actor for the majority of the film. It was a fun watch that executed better than many critics would like to admit. It may sound like I'm heavily praising this film for something I only have a 6/10 to, but I think I Am Legend's negatives have already been magnified in other reviews.",7,0,0,21 April 2018
A Quiet Place," Amazing Thrill Ride
","A Quiet Place sets the tone early in the film by killing off the youngest son and creating a world where no one is safe from the plot - giving us an uneasy feeling anytime our protagonists find themselves in danger. It masterfully brings you in by taking away one of the audiences senses from the beginning and taking us immediately out of our comfort zone.This film heavily pays attention to detail and does its best to explain how this family survived so long (notice the grocery store is still fully stocked with bags of chips). Every scene has its importance to the plot; setting up future scene like falling dominoes. The creatures may be the main antagonist, but I couldn't help but cringe from the moment I saw the nail sticking out of the stairs - conveniently highlighted as to where someone would walk. Even when Evelyn (Emily Blunt) steps on it, you still tense up anytime someone walks down the stairs.The acting is highlighted by Emily Blunt's adrenaline filled performance. In a film that has limited speaking roles, she is able to convey emotion with the best of them and comes in as my favourite film of hers - which is high praise considering how much I loved her in Sicario.Comedic actors are proving to be masters of suspense with Jordan Peele's Get Out last year and now this film being John Krasinski's directorial debut - who had one of the most emotionally intense send off of any character I've seen on screen. I can not wait to see Krasinski don the director hat in the future. From a storytelling point of view, A Quiet Place is flawless.Don't listen to the cynical reviews from people who are trying to knock this film down from a practical point of view. We live in a time where Superheroes rule the box office and they are far from 'realistic'. This is a must see film - if your skittish when it comes to horror, this leans more thriller. There are limited jump scares, with the movie focusing more on enduring dread and tension than anything else. The year may not be over yet, but A Quiet Place is my early pick for movie of the year.",9,1,3,23 August 2018
Kick-Ass," Didn't Disappoint
","I'm late to this film, but have always heard things good about it and basically knew the premise going into it. Kick-Ass didn't exceed my expectations, but it also didn't falter. It's exactlt what I thought it would be and I still enjoyed it. It used to be Spider-Man was one of the most relatable Superheroes, but he is dethroned by Kick-Ass. This depicts the realities of if someone were to really take the law into their own hands as a spandex wearing vigilante and I love that about it.",7,0,1,15 April 2018
Coco," Disney Does It Again
","I was surprised by this film because at first I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it, but I should know better than to doubt Disney's ability to tell a story. I had fun watching Coco, with its culture and beautiful music. Would it make my Top 5 Disney Films? Maybe.",8,0,0,15 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars Fans Are Rating It Too Low
","It seems as though you can't pleaae The hardcore Star Wars fan base. I've seen a lot of '1' rating. This is not even close to a '1' rating. I actually put this film off because I get to a point where I think 'another Star Wars film, I'll get to it one day.' Then I watched it and completely remembered why I love these films from the opening scene.I get that it will never be the originals, but this is an upgrade from the prequels. It was an entertaining film and that is all that matters. Watch the film and judge for yourself, it may not be as good as The Force Awakens, but it is well done second instalment.",7,5,24,17 April 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Top Tier MCU Film
","This movie was so well done because it was superheroes I didn't even know existed like many casual comic book fans. When that first trailer dropped with the five Guardians standing in line like straight out of The Usual Suspects, I found myself excited for these character I didn't know. This launched Guardians Of The Galaxy into household names. I recently revisited this film and it's just as good on the second viewing. It's a funny, action packed thrill ride from beginning to end with arguably the best movie soundtrack of all time. This film is masterfully done and has us not only connect with the characters in a few hours, but really feel like they're family by the end; which is really hard to do in the limited time of a film. The chemistry is about as good as it gets and I hope for many more films - as long as they keep their quality.",8,2,3,20 April 2018
The Dark Knight," The Ultimate Tale Of Good Vs. Evil
","I've always been a fan of Batman, as a kid I even remember enjoying Batman & Robin. As I got older I grew away from the Superhero genre, but The Dark Knight drew me back in. I even saw this film before Batman Begins. It is an amazing portrayal of this age old hero going up against his greatest foe. A role that will forever be the measuring stick of a great villain thanks to Heath Ledger's performance. It isn't often a superhero film wins an Oscar and that is a testament to how great this film is from not only an entertaining perspective, but a critical perspective. If it wasn't for this film you could argue the Superhero craze doesn't explode to where it is at today. This movie is nearly flawless.",10,0,0,26 August 2018

I'm a big fan of both Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis so of course I ended up watching this film over No Strings Attatched - ironic that it came out at the same time and stared her future husband, but I digress. It wasn't bad, not great but a few notches above alright.",6,0,0,17 April 2018
La La Land," Overrated 'Musical'
","What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said. This was advertised as a musical, but just comes off as dry. There are only a few good musical parts like the dance scene between Gosling and Stone. It starts out strong with the freeway song and dance but only goes down from there.The plot.. well there really doesn't seem to be much of a plot. It's a love story, but ultimately ends up not being about the love story. It really is all over the place. Plus how many times do I have to hear one song throughout the film. It's like watching Grease but they play Grease lightening five times. City of stars... yeah we got it. I hate trash this movie because I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, but what a disappointment of a film.",5,0,1,27 May 2018
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Wow! Was Not Expecting That!
","When this film first started it felt dry like many British films. However as it went on the more I got into it until the end credits rolled and I was blown away. I never expected to like this film so much. It's a real gritty, crime comedy? It's acually hard to place this film into a certain genre because it really does its own thing and benefits from that.",8,0,0,23 April 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," I Want To Give It A 7.5
","I gave the first Guardians film an 8 and this movie is slightly better than a seven, but not quite as good as the first film. They still manage to capture the magic and imagination the first film has, while progressing the stories and ultimately leading into Infinity War. It was great to see this assemble back on screen again with another killer soundtrack. The first scene is so perfect for the sequel because it wraps everything we love about the Guardians into a few minute explosion to get you buying right back in to why we love the first film.",7,0,0,20 April 2018

The Matrix Reloaded," A Decent, But Unneeded Sequel
","I loved athe Matrix, it was unique and intriguing. They really should have stopped there because these sequels just seem like money grabs and it just gets worse after this film.

Jaws," Spielberg The Master Of Suspense
","I was always a fan of Steven Spielberg, but I never considered him the king of suspense, until recently when I went on a Spielberg Marathon. Nearly everyone of his films had me on the edge of my set with this being one of the main features.It still holds up today even with the terrible mechanical shark because it is masterfully hidden throughout the film creating a more sinister villain. Everyone in the film pulls out a tremendous performance and let's not forget that without this film we don't have the Summer blockbuster as we know it.",8,0,2,19 May 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Hard To Argue Against Being #1
","I saw this film back in high school after having read Stephen King's novel. I fought to give this film a nine, but the more I think about it, this is absolutely a ten film. It may not be my personal favourite movie, but I really enjoy it. If I see it playing on television I have to stop and watch. Shawshank Redemption is all about hope which is expressed by Andy. The twists and turns that play out keep you entertained for the entire runtime with a message no one will soon forget. I for one quote the movie all the time. It's absolutely brilliant and the epitome of film structure.",10,0,0,26 August 2018

Black Panther," Rising Above The Hype
","I went into this film fully expecting to be underwhelmed; only because it had been hyped so much. Black Panther did something only the likes of Deadpool did - it impressed despite being built up as a phenomenal film. For those of you who aren't as deep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as you'd like, let me first discuss what the film is about and who the titular character is. The first time we saw Black Panther was in Captain America: Civil War and like 50% of the characters, I didn't know a lot about him, but he stole every scene he was in, in that film. This film is his origin story, giving us a glimpse at the man (T'Challa) behind the mask and making us care and connect with the hero - something DC has been failing to do. Black Panther draws from the similar Lion King storyline, which in turn draws from the story of Hamlet; a king who is overthrown by a villainous counterpart, only to fight his way back to his rightful throne. That being said; it clearly isn't a shot for shot remake and blazes its own trail for the future Avenger. Black Panther is highly entertaining, straddling the line between action and character-driven storytelling brilliantly. Chadwick Boseman - who get this, is 41-years-old - feels as though he was born to play the leading role; becoming one of the most natural on-screen heroes since Chris Evans' Captain America. Andy Serkis reminded me of how good of an actor he is, even without CGI. The women - specifically Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o's characters - held their own playing heavy roles throughout the film. In a film featuring two strong male leads, they're able to display even larger feats of strength and power - Nakia is no Lois Lane. This film was the most well-cast film I've ever seen. I continuously said 'Oh I didn't know they were in this' throughout the film after quickly being sucked in by their character. I can't say anything bad about any of the characters' including the token white character Ross played by Martin Freeman who has quickly become the new Agent Coulson - connecting all of the MCU films together and having a much larger role in this film. However, the person that stole the show was Michael B. Jordan. Jordan's Killmonger was outstanding, giving us the villain we didn't know we wanted and redeeming himself from his role in The Fantastic Four. Jordan is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors - have you seen Creed? You find yourself sympathizing with Killmonger throughout the film because he isn't your general good vs. evil villain. The reasoning behind his actions are understandable, delivering some of the most memorable lines from 'Can you believe that? A kid from Oakland walking around and believing in fairytales,' to 'Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors what jumped from the ships because they knew death was better than bondage.' A powerful character for such a powerful film, especially in today's racial climate. The bottom line for Black Panther is it's an entertaining film that features culture and something new for a Superhero film. I don't have an official list on hand, but I know Black Panther would be in the top five films for me in the MCU - possibly top three. Don't miss out on this soon to be classic.",8,1,2,15 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," One Of The Best Musicals I've Seen
","I'm a sucker for a musical, I'm not ashamed to admit it as a guy in his twenties! This was a really well put together film that had a great message with tremendous songs. It gave me goosebumps at certain points. Anything that can get a reaction like that out of me deserves a high rating. Definitely one of the best films of the year. Great cast, great chemistry; all around a top notch film. This is further proof of the disconnect between critics and the audience.",8,2,4,2 July 2018
Pitch Perfect 3," Cash Grab, But Still Fun?
","I've now seen all the Pitch Perfect films which may be a surprise for a single 26-year-old guy, but I'll admit the first one was entertaining. It could be argued they should have stopped at one, but this one has its redeemable points. For example, I never thought I'd ever see John Litgow singing, but I'm thankful that is in the world now. The story was predictable and the sudden fighting sequence of the usually clumsy Fat Amy was just odd to watch and seemed out of place from the entire Pitch Perfect universe. Finally the fact that the main plot line is trying to impress DJ Khaled who is portrayed as the epitome of music is laughable. Looking forward to number four where Beca begins work on her first album and brings the Bellas back in to help with vocals... because that's how predictable these films have become, but Brittany Snow will continue to bring me back.",5,0,1,15 April 2018
Speed," Cheesy Lines But Good Action
",This movie started of bad for me. A lot of cheesy lines and banter between Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves. I was worried that it would be a film that either didn't live up to the hype or wasn't as good as everyone has said. Luckily it picks up once the bus is introduced and it feels like it becomes a completely different and well executed film. The cheesy lines are still in there but they're not as bad once you're pulled into the tension and action. Well except for the 'lost his head' remark near them end. Had a lot of fun watching it and is a film I can see myself stopping and watching again if I were to see it on tv.,7,1,1,1 July 2019
Munich," Intense, Realistic Assasin Film
","I was not expecting this kind of film for something based on historical events. It's a great assasin first with a straight forward direction that is easily followed. It also shows the tremendous toll this line of work puts on the human psyche with Eric Bana bringing in the best performance I've ever seen him portray on screen.Yet again Spielberg proves he's the master of suspense. Experiencing not only the intense moments as the play out on the edge of your seat, but feeling the same paranoia Bana experiences. For such a long film, I didn't look at the time once as it drew me in with ever bit of action and every line of dialogue! One of Spielberg's best!",9,1,2,20 May 2018
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Excellent Surprise!
","I recently went on a Keanu Reeves marathon so this was one film I know I need to watch and I had low expectations. In fact I was fully expecting to not like it, but this film has a charm to it that is thanks to Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter; this could have easily been a bomb/trash film. I understand now why this stoner comedy is an iconic film and it doesn't hurt that I like time travel films. Usually there are rules in place and consequences if those rules are broken during time travel, but this movie laughs in the face of those films and it's all the better for it. I'm sure this line has been used many times on here, but this film is EXCELLENT!",7,0,1,19 July 2019
The Matrix," Still Holds Up Today
","This film is arguably one of - if not the - biggest film of the 2000s. Yes, I know it came out in 1999, but because of the sequels, The Matrix has a huge impact on film of the decade. Thanks to the practical effects, this Sci-Fi film still holds up even in today's CGI filled cinema. It is a story of finding you're ultimate potential and featuring some of the action sequences to ever be put on the big screen. I can't believe it took me so long to jump on this bandwagon.",8,0,0,14 April 2018
Deadpool," Latest Film To Become One Of My Favourites
","I discovered Deadpool not too long before the film became official, so it was really that, that made me become aware of this character. After reading some comics and watching clips online it became apparent that Ryan Reynolds is the only person who could play this role and does he ever knock it out of the park. His passion for this character is not only apparent on screen, but off the screen.It's action packed and hilarious with great fourth wall breaks and Easter eggs that you'll only discover all of them on multiple viewings. The Merc With The Mouth has come a long way since Wolverine. It's also worth noting that this film changed the genre by making way for more R-Rates comic book adaptations like Logan. I'm sure thirty years from now I'll still be watching this movie and that's why it gets a perfect ten from me.",9,1,2,27 May 2018
Green Book," An Entertaining Ride
","Out of all the 2018 Oscar nominees, this was one I was looking forward to the most and I'm happy that it lived up to the hype. This wasn't your typical racial film, it was so much more. The chemistry between Ali and Mortenson is tremendous and I enjoyed it thoroughly.",8,1,1,20 February 2019
Annihilation," Unique And Beautiful
","This is a really good Sci-Fi film that didn't feel the need to explain too much into why this was happening and I appreciated that because this is meant to be entertainment and has many interpretations that you can draw from it. All five women were stellar with Natalie Portman proving again why she's one of the best working actresses in Hollywood. This is mainly a Sci-Fi film but does stray a bit into action and horror. The scene with the bear/wolf with a screaming woman's voice is some of the scariest and tense moments I've seen in any horror in a long time. The final scene between Natalie Portman's character and the metallic doppelgÃ¤nger just fills you with dread and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The way it moves and reacts to her is mesmerizing and so unnatural that it makes you feel almost off. Other than that, the film is visually stunning to the point that it feels like a massage for your eyes. I'll probably end up watching it again!",8,1,2,9 April 2019
The Nice Guys," Very Underrated Comedy
","I've seen a lot of bad reviews from this film, but absolutely loved it. Right from the first time I saw the trailer I was thrilled and the movie delivered. Gosling and Crowe have surprisingly good chemistry and in fact it may be my favourite Russell Crowe film behind Gladiator. If you enjoy a good buddy comedy, don't miss out on this sure to be classic one day.",7,0,1,17 April 2018
Donnie Darko," Completely Different
","It is really hard for me to explain why I liked this film because I really don't know. It's such a strange story that I had to read an essay on the film after to fully understand some lingering questions I had, however I did like it. It was different and Jake Gyllenhaal plays an ominous young man that really displays how good of an actor he would become. I was surprised by the cast because I went into it having no idea Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze were in the film. It's an interesting different film that will make you feel just as disoriented as Donnie by then end.",7,0,0,21 September 2018
Back to the Future," In My Top Five
",Back To The Future has stood the test of time - no pun intended. I've seen this film multiple times and absolutely love it. I can't see Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as anyone but Marty and Doc. It stretches the imagination of film and completely immersed you in a unique (at the time) story where you almost instantly connect with the character of Marty McFly. I really can't express how much I love this film. It is the epitome of creative story telling for me.,10,1,1,18 April 2018
Goodfellas," The Epitome Of Filmmaking
","Goodfellas will forever be one of my favorite films and could arguably be considered one of the greatest films of our time. I enjoyed it much more than The Godfather. Clearly Scorsese's best film it still holds up nearly thirty years later.Well written, well directed, well acted, well... everything. I can't look at Ray Liotta ever again and separate him from this film. Even on multiple viewings, I still manage to find small things I hadn't before - proving the attention to detail in this film.",10,0,1,15 April 2018
The Proposal," Not A Big RomCom Fan, But Enjoyed This
","Like I said in the headline, I'm not a big RomCom fan, but this does feature actors I am fans of in Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Not to mention the hilarious supportive role Betty White plays. The storyline is a new take on a classic RomCom narrative and both Bullock & Reynolds play off each other well.",7,0,0,21 April 2018
V for Vendetta," Most Captivating Comic Book Adapatation I've Seen
","After being told over and over again from friends to watch this film, I finally got to it. Despite it being overhyped by them, I still found myself captivated by V For Vendetta. There was something brilliant about seeing our 'hero' at face value just like every other character along the way. There was no Batman/Bryce Wayne, there was only V and because of that it made him more of a myth and much more intriguing for what he stood for.Vengence is in the title, but it so much more than that with a deeper meaning that rivals some of the best in Hollywood. I found myself reading more into the 'idea' V represented. Now one of my favorite Comic Book Films.",8,24,30,15 April 2018
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Great Music, But Drags A Bit
","I know I may get a bit of flack because this is a Coen Brothers film and it is an interesting take on The Odyssy, but I couldn't help but find myself checking the clock from time to time. When the film is good, it's really good, but the lulls in between can make this film feel longer than it is.",6,4,7,21 April 2018
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Maybe My Least Favorite Ferrell Film?
","I generally love Will Ferrell film, but this one didn't really attract me. Sure it's heavily quotable like most of his films, but I feel those scenes are the only redeemable parts from this film. For the longest time because of this movie and Step Brothers it left a bad taste in my mouth for John C. Reilly until I was able to see some of his much better films. Sorry Ricky Bobby, if you're not first, you're last.",5,0,2,21 April 2018
The Godfather," One Of The Greatest
","I understand that this film has been argued as flawless, but I'm giving it a nine based on two reasons from a personal standpoint. This film can drag on at times which can become a bit dull and Goodfellas I think is a better film so I can't possibly give The Godfather a ten. That being said this film still lives up to the hype. The story is fascinating, the characters are well structured and this movie can really bring out every human emotion in its audience. The runtime be damned, this is a film you can easily watch over and over again.",9,1,1,26 August 2018
