War Dogs," Hard to believe but as a comedy it may be successful
","'War dogs' is one of the most anticipated movies of this summer. When I saw the trailer it felt to me that there is so much fun and it will be a good entertainer movie. Casting is also good. Jonah Hill is a good actor but is a very good comedian and Miles teller is a promising actor. It is a 'based on true story' film so My expectation was huge and as a comedy movie it is good and the story pick up is fair. The title of the film tells you nothing but maybe this is a metaphor.I am not telling this is only a comedy and fun film. The story is very serious and there are good crude and real incident humor are in this movie. So if anyone is searching the seriousness of that issue it will be good. This is the story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. They won a contract of 300 million from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan. It is a very funny story and the script makes this more interesting. There are lots of real incidents with good political humor and good double meaning dialogues. These double meaning dialogues will make you laugh and the political drama will make you thinking the real reason of the arms dealing. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller has done a very good job and the background score is a perfect matching. The story is good and fresh with good humor. the direction could have been better but not bad. The only negative point is movie's pace. Very slow pace movie and sometimes I felt the continuity is not built well. The story-telling style is also another negative point. It could have been better. Otherwise, it is a good movie. The story writer could have made this more believable but after all I will say it is a good choice for fun lover.",5,6,23,16 August 2016
Deepwater Horizon," It's not as good as you expected but not bad
","After 'Lone Survivor' Peter Berg again comes to with 'Deepwater Horizon'. It is a thriller movie and for me, it was a very anticipated movie. I was so excited about this movie and I like Peter Berg's direction. My personal favorite is his 'Battleship'.That was science fiction movie but I liked that movie. His next venture is 'Lone Survivor' and that was a critically acclaimed movie. The way he executes the story line and the script sometimes that was very imposing that's why I was eagerly waiting for this movie.It is the story of 'oil spill in U.S. history'. In April 2010 the explode happened and there are many political and social problem created for this reason. The story is about this and I am not revealing the story. The story very catchy and full of emotion. You can see the opposite reaction to this incidents and feel the emotions of the involved persons. I think this is a thriller and equally a drama movie.The story is good but the director failed to catch the opportunities. He just missed making this movie a gem. The continuation and the emotions of the characters are sometimes like fake. The chemistry between the characters are not so imposing and not engaging. The character development is not authoritative and sometimes the dialogues are very clich√©.Performance wise Mark Wahlberg has done an OK job but nothing to shout about. John Malkovich and Dylan O'Brien has done a wonderful job and I think John Malkovich steals the show properly. Rest of the cast's acting is very average and nothing to applaud about. The background score is very poor and not matched with the story.If you want to know the story of that explode and you are not aware of that then this movie is for you and don't tell me anything after watching this.",4,9,29,21 September 2016
Lion," Lion is a full show of Dev Patel and only Dev Patel
","In the IMDb page, the movie is showed as a drama movie but I think this is a thriller movie. The movie's story line is full of suspense and the movie is more thrilling than dramatic. The story is about Saroo Brierley (who is also the writer of the novel) and the there are lots of suspense and emotional attachment about India. I am nit telling the story but as per IMDb, the story is about a five-year- old child who lost on a street of Calcutta city which is a thousand kilometers away from his home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple who lived in Australia. After 25 years, he sets out to find his lost family. Very engaging story and this is based on a novel written by Saroo Brierley.Well, this is recognized as a drama movie but I think this is nit a drama movie. The story is full of suspense and the until the climax scene the story is a suspense thriller. There are lots of emotions and struggling of the central character and the survival story of the boy is very much imperious. The one and the only reason is Dev Patel. He has already done 'Slumdog Millionaire' which is a very good movie. This movie is not like 'Slumdog Millionaire' and the story between these two movies are completely different. In this movie, he is the central character and as 'Saroo Brierley' he is just outstanding. The director missed some opportunities to create a gem like the novel but Dev Patel saved him from making a dumb movie. The movie is the full show of Dev Patel's acting and he made this movie an enjoyable one. I am not telling this is a bad movie but if you have already read the novel this is not for you. And another advice is if you want to watch a good performance, Dev Patel will make enjoy you.",5,5,62,13 September 2016
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," Neeraj Pandey and his best.....Marvelous shot executed
","Right now maybe everyone should agree on this, Neeraj Pandey is one of the most talented directors of the Bollywood. He has made some outstanding films and this is also a very good film. His all of the films are thriller genre and he is right now a master of the thriller movie. His previous ventures 'A Wednesday', 'Special 26' and 'Baby' all of this 3 movies are highly appreciated by the critics and the audiences. This movie is not a complete thriller movie, Moreover this movie is a biography. But just you think when biography meets with the thriller genre, what will happen? Exactly!!! A very good enjoyable movie. This movie has all the elements what you like to watch. Sports, Drama, Emotion, Action, Suspense and thriller. the perfect combination of all of this.I am not revealing the story of this movie. You all know Mr. Mahendra Sing Dhoni. He is the captain of Indian Cricket team of Limited version. You know his career in cricket and you know his contribution to Indian cricket. But you don't know his untold story and how he came here and how he made his fame. This is a very emotional journey and very encourageable for everyone.We all only see how a player plays on the ground but we don't want to know his struggle and his hidden story. This movie tells the hidden story of Mr. Dhoni and reveals his actual character. I am not telling the story but you may think biography movie is not enjoyable. But believe me, this movie will demolish your previous experience about this genre and definitely you will enjoy this. Good storyline, Very good script, Outstanding direction and very good acting made this a good enjoyable one. If you feel bored after watching Raaz 4 and Pink, go catch this movie. You will not regret.",1,24,56,29 September 2016
Sultan," Not a great one but outstanding performance of Salman transformed this movie a good one......
","In my point of view right now Salman is the number one superstar of Bollywood. He has the power to sell a mediocre movie into 100 cr easily. He is a good actor but right now he is a brand more than an actor. Film producer and distributor sell his name as a brand. Which brand that need no marketing and strategy of sales. Just the put his name on the project and the project turned a profitable one. Again, I am not telling Salman is a bad actor but in this movie, the brand name surpassed his acting.In recent days Salman didn't deliver us any good watchable movie except 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan'. That was a masterpiece but rest of 10-12 releases didn't get the pass mark but all of them were proved commercially successful. These happened by the branding of Salman, not by the acting or story or quality of the film. I know 'Sultan' have the same fate and will turn a huge commercially successful movie. But this time, there is a difference. The effort of Salman as a wrestler is outstanding and possibly all type of effort he has done for this role. Already I said he is a good actor and no wonder he has done a good acting but his effort of work out surpassed all the things. I am not revealing the story but Just want to say you will not regret. The script is wonderfully written, acting of rest of the cast are very good. But one thing I want to say Anushka didn't do a justice for her role and sometimes her screen presence made me bored. I am not telling her recently plastic surgery went wrong but her acting was monotonous. Songs are not great, editing was good, the direction was very good and surprisingly the story was not typical and you will surprise. The Screenplay was good and other technical aspects are average. But you will wonder after seeing Salman with a transformed body because a 51 years old person gave almost 100% effort to visualize the wrestler's role. Outstanding!!!! His effort made a huge boost for this movie. Thank you, Salman Bhai....You made me happy by this role and thanks again because this movie was not same by your other typical movie like 'Ek tha tiger' or 'Prem ratan dhan payo'.",6,7,56,6 July 2016
Sausage Party," Don't listen anybody......just enjoy the fun
","First of all, I want to say if you are a fun lover and animation movie fan then this is a fair choice for you. This is a movie with a good story, enough adult jokes, and a very good political message. It is a good combination of comedy and serious double meaning message. If you are confused about the theme then please don't listen anybody....just enjoy the fun.This is a story about some sausage snacks who lived in a supermarket and they just want to expand their experience and they wanted one of any customer choose them and bring them home. A hot dog sausage named Frank with his friends, want to warn his friends of their terrifying future, and in the process, wages war with the human race. The story is charming and the script is full of energy to give you the right humor. If the question is the story, I think this is good.Performance-wise Jonah Hill has done a very good job and Seth Rogen also has done a fair job with their voice. Rest of the cast is good. The storytelling style is nothing new. Sometimes I felt it is not new and Movie Like 'cars' already use this strategy. So the style is predictable. First, 30 minutes the movie has horrible pace and the story is not gradually built but after all, pace is not bad. Animation quality is very good and the plot also holds some good point. The director duo Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon were trying to give you the fun and I think they are successful. Their effort was good but this movie could have been better if the directors would make some fast pace in the story. If you a fun lover then don't listen anything or anybody, Just enjoy the fun and you will not regret.",5,13,30,11 August 2016
Sully," Not a very well made life time special but as a true story based movie you can take a chance......
","The movie tells the true story of what happened January 15, 2009. It is about when Captain 'Sully' Sullenberger landed U.S. Airways flight 1549 onto the Hudson River. Many people called this 'Miracle on the Hudson' but the maximum of them do not know what actually happened. Mr. Sully, this national hero was also being investigated for his actions on that day which put his career in peril. this movie tells the whole story of this investigation and how Mr. Sully struggled and to deal with the new found honor and the stress of post-trauma and the crash had on him and his crew.This is a Clint Eastwood movie and Tom Hanks starring the central role Sully. He portrayed the role Captain 'Sully' Sullenberger very nicely and think he really deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. No doubt that Tom Hanks is a very talented actor and again he proves this. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles has also done a good job. But the main hero is Tom Hanks. He acted naturally when the plane landed and his bravery was very good at the screen. He made sure all the 155 passengers were good and this sequence of the movie was very good and really worth watching. Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles who was in the cockpit on that day and he also has done a nice job and his comedic delivery was good.Clint Eastwood's direction was OK but nothing to shout about. He has made a much better movie than this and this is not his best effort. I think the script is a little bit choppy and slow and the character development not so imposing for a true story. I am not telling this is a bad movie but if you want to spend time or money on it, you please think before investing. This is a very very good choice for DVD but in theatres may be you will not enjoy this.",5,25,55,6 September 2016
