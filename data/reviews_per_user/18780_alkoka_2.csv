The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," It has an effect for everybody in some way.
","This film just inspired me to watch more older films. In the summer i was in a Christian camp where they showed the main scene (for me it is) when Alexandre Fabbri is playing with the marionette ballerina. When I arrived home I immediately started searching for this film and finally i found it! It took me 3 days to watch it. This became my favorite film of all my life. There are scenes and quotes that mean so much to me. I feel I am not the only one with this feeling because as I can see, there are events that are alternative, and has effects that are different for you and your friends either.What is the most interesting thing what i've ever seen/heard? There is only one music in the film and makes you happy or sad depending on the scene. The cameraman's work is excellent too! :) I absolutely would nominate this for Golden Globe of all times.",10,3,5,12 September 2013
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," They Did Let Me Grow Up On This
","I am 16 years old and very proud of myself and my friends who grown up on these kind of films. We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time. You don't have to search for it because it has a really different meaning if you don't want to search for more. It is not bad, it's just different. Funnier, light-minded.",9,0,1,19 June 2013
