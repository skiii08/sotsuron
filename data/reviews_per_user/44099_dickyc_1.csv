3:10 to Yuma," really really bad. terrible
","I've seen some rubbish lately (10,000 BC, Hit-man, even XXX 2) but this film takes the biscuit, its possibly one of the worst films i've paid to see. Why is this piece of trash film so bad? It is one of the worst types of film. Those films that look promising, start off good, three quarters of the way through your thinking this is a great movie, then suddenly takes a huge nosedive has a terrible ending and just annoys the hell out of you because they ballsed it up so badly.I do not usually write comments on these websites but this film just infuriated me. Before you watch it you think Christian Bale, Russell Crowe should be good. Bit shaky start with the guy getting shot in the stomach then making a miraculous recovery, but OK i can live with that. Right up until the final 20 mins its a really good film. Then for some unknown reason Russell Crowe's character after being a bad guy for the whole movie (and references are made throughout the film just how bad he is) suddenly turns into good guy. Utter folly. I want my money back.",1,11,19,17 April 2009
