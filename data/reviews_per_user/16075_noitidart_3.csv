Catch Me If You Can," World of fake
","A guy in this world generates fake stuff to fake a fake society. Jailed for fake reasons and released for fake reasons.Of all the forgers, he gets a chance to help catch and live outside of prison. Why him? Why not every forger? Fake selection. Fake justice. Made up laws, and bind people by it.It's a good movie to show this is a world of fake. Get name and fame and cash, go to Harvard, Berkely, be a doctor be a lawyer. Fake fake fake. The ending, Hanks says, live the lie. If DiCaprio knows that why put 3 more sons into a world of lies. Now they have to live a lie. Did he think he now has so much money its not an issue?I gave it a rating of 8 as at time of rating it was 8 and I didn't want to change that. It's very watchable. I re-watched it after years. It's a great movie even though I'm very mixed about it. If the actual rating was 10 at the time of rating this I would have rated it a 10. Fake.",8,1,3,10 January 2017
Shutter Island," Ending 5% makes the starting 95% wasted time
","So this review has spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie, the only continue reading if you don't care for spoilers.So the start of this movie, up till 95% was absolutely awesome. I was hoping for the sweet revenge of DiCaprio totally taking down this institution.However he last 5% of the movie shows that he was dreaming/imagining up ALL of it. All the 95% was his frickin imagination!!!! Oh my gosh at that point I felt like I had wasted HOURS of my life. The first 95% of the movie likse 2+ hours. I know movies aren't real, but now the STORY WASN'T REAL. I watched the movie for the story, just to find out in the ending that everything up to that point was not real story, just imagination of the patient. What on earth?!? If the ending was where DiCaprio got revenge on the institution, then this would be mind blowing 10 on 10 review for me!",2,2,4,17 January 2017
Doctor Strange," Sherlock does justice, Ancient One falls flat on face
","As a reader of the classic comics, Sherlock Holmes (Benedict) did absolute justice to the the character of Dr Strange. He brought that funny but serious but constructive character perfectly to him. I was not disappointed and is the only reason I gave this movie 4 stars.The reason I didn't give it more is they absolutely ruined 'The Ancient One'. They made everyone in the movie white. He was a saintly and extremely mystical figure. A Buddhist monk. They put some British chick! What on earth? It explains why they didn't give The Ancient One the screen time he deserves, because it was a totally out of character. Extremely disappointed.After the absolute disgrace of The Ancient One, they didn't do justice to Dormammu. They made him seem like he took a plea bargain. But Dormammu is such a immense character he's hard to capture. The Ancient One is also pretty immense but much easier to capture as he can be personified by a human. They even had a guy with white beard in the movie (the one with no hand). Shoot, short and fat Miyagi San from the Karate Kid would have personified 'The Ancient One' better.Gosh I can't get over at how much Marvel just insulted The Ancient One.",4,23,49,7 November 2016
