Blade Runner 2049," An Above Average Sequel that Pays Homage to Ridley Scott's Masterpiece
","Some films are not well recieved at first because of how strange or unusual they are and they either end up being forgotten or later hailed as cult classics. This is what happened to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and so in spite of this I can imagine that you are asking how one can possibly make a sequel to a film like Blade Runner, especially a good one. Reasonably, I was worried. How did it turn out? A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! Blade Runner 2049 feels like a worthy sequel to Blade Runner and it carries the atmosphere of the original and even expands on it. Ryan Gosling is an amazing lead and he is really interesting on screen and Harrison Ford is well, Harrison Ford. This movie didn't set itself up to be a next MCU that would burn itself into the ground, it simply told a good story and expanded on the story of Blade Runner by exploring the universe that it exists in. It's fair to compare this sequel to beloved sequels such as Toy Story 2, Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, and Terminator 2 which expand on the original story while also adding new and exciting content. This movie may be less thought provoking than the original but it certainly makes the audience have to think about complex ideas involving humanity and life. Needless to say, Hans Zimmer is great and really goes out of his way to make the music feel like Vangelis in the original Blade Runner and there are many callback themes that original Blade Runner fans will surely recognize. However, the true winner in this movie is the cinematography. The cinematography is amazing and so many shots seem perfectly organized. The techniques utlizied are truly award worthy and make other cinematographers bow their heads. Everything done to create the atmosphere of an amazing Ridley Scott is done and Denis Villeneuve really shines in this movie. This is not your average sequel but it also isn't your average blockbuster. This is not like some Marvel movie that forces in cheesy humor nor is it a generic action flick like Pearl Harbor or Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. It's a compelling Sci Fi and it feels like something that will be remembered years later for it's greatness. It will provoke deep thought and really make you appreciate its beauty on par with something spectacular such as the original Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or I dare say, the original Blade Runner. It's damn good even if it isn't neccesarily for everyone and if you want to watch a movie that will stand in greatness against the other generic movies you watch, give it a shot.",9,1,3,30 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Prequel that Took the World by Storm
","This movie is the most despised prequel in existence. Star Wars the Phantom Menace is certainly a film to behold whether it be for the good or bad qualities it had. With a film that came 22 years after his last directed movie, one can't expect to find a flawless movie but I suppose people couldn't imagine it would be this different from what we saw in the Star Wars Original Trilogy. Anyway, it's time to unravel just why this is a bad Star Wars film, but not necessarily a bad movie. Yeah, this isn't THAT BAD of a film, even with all the screw-ups and failures within. Let's get started, and if you don't wanna continue than just know that I think this movie is watchable even if a disappointing follow up for Star Wars.To be fair, though this movie is terribly flawed it still has a lot of nostalgic value for me. The music and sound design is fantastic, the visuals are very inviting, and it still carries that Star Wars atmosphere. Whenever you see a planet or a spaceship fly by it's an epic experience. This is visual storytelling done very well. BUT that means that we pave way for a lot of dumb crap. Why is it necessary to have dumb lines be said by everybody without any sort of emotion behind them? We get lines like, 'I hope so, yes, I guess.' That is inexcusable! 'Yes, I guess?' 'YES, I GUESS???' Are you kidding me?!?! They just pop out at random, though to be fair, when they manage to be bad at least their quotable and hilarious to listen to. But when you realize that this is supposed to be a Star Wars movie.....you get kinda upset!The biggest problem with this film is characters. Seriously, characters? Why is that so difficult? Well because George Lucas decided to rob these characters of emotion so everybody talks the same except for a few characters like Palpatine who have a distinct voice. The British are the only ones who can act when given no direction, all the Americans are just robbed of emotion. The worst case of this is with Jake Lloyd. This boy just had no emotion whatsoever and whenever he spoke in a different manner it sounded awful 'Yippee' he often screams? 'Yippie?' Does anybody proofread Lucas' script!The movie itself is of course labelled by the sin to cinema called Jar Jar Binks! Everybody hates him and so do I, but not for the reasons you might expect. Yes the dialect could be called racist but when he speaks normally I actually don't mind him.....I seriously mean that! The problem is that whenever he screams I want to tear my ears out! He screams all the time so thus he's insufferable and his 'comedy' fails to warrant any intentional laughs. This is jarring, no pun intended, because Star Wars is supposed to have lovable characters.....not this! First of all this movie doesn't need comedic relief, so to insert one in here requires expect writing and Lucas clearly lacks this.Now how can one like this movie. Well, as stated, whenever this film gets bad it's still fun bad! It's just a fun space adventure that can be stupid at times but sometimes you can just forget about it because you're having a good time. The moments that are good, are really good, because there actually is a lot of practical effects used in this movie as well as real landscapes and miniature work! When it's good, it's really good! The light saber battle in this movie is easily one of the best action scenes ever put to cinema! Sometimes a legitimate laugh does come and it's refreshing to hear it at certain moments. Overall this is a fun movie. It may be dumb, but for what it is I can still find enjoyment.As a Star Wars movie this gets a 6/10 but as a fun space adventure 8/10 baby! There is a great movie hiding here and sometimes you can get glimpses of it! The Phantom Menace has problems galore, but when it succeeds it's legitimately fun to watch and revisit from time to time. Check it out and see for yourself.",6,2,4,27 October 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Spielberg's Ultimate Adventure Movie
","Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the Indiana Jones trilogy and definitely the best. This movie redefined what an action adventure movie could and should be. After the epic Horror Adventure that is Jaws comes the epic action adventure, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie easily deserves 10 stars for it's sheer innovation, directing, visuals, and entertainment ability. Here's why. Harrison Ford is a perfect choice for the awesome hero, Indiana Jones. An archaeologist who dreams of fortune and glory, he embarks on an adventure to find the Ark of the Covanent and save it from the Nazis. Harrison Ford is perfect in this role and it's so refreshing to see a badass hero that everybody can root for simply because he's awesome and embodies everything we want from an adventurer. Every moment of him is simply cinematic gold and it makes him shine against everyone else, even himself as Han Solo. That's not to say that the supporting actors aren't great, they are, but he's the main character and he steals the show which he should. Steven Spielberg really went out of his way with this masterpiece. The practical effects and stuntwork isn't just phenomenal, it's almost godlike! The action is jaw dropping in its awesomeness to the point where it almost doesn't even look like a movie, it looks like a portal into somebody else's universe: Spielberg's universe. What visual effects that are used are so good that it makes modern day action flicks look like stupid college projects that got F's. Michael Bay ain't got nothing on Golden Age Spielberg! Every scene screams with action and it just gets better and better all the way through but it never forsakes the story in place of action. Modern day directors need to take notes from this movie. Once somebody watches this movie, you soon find yourself in a trance in which you can never get sick of it. Nobody can get sick of Indiana Jones, it's not possible. Go watch this movie and you will be very pleased. Or just listen to the Golden John Williams music, that works too.",10,5,7,27 February 2018
Minority Report," This Forgotten Movie from Spielberg is Rightfully Forgotten
","So, Minority Report, a Spielberg film that came from the 2000s era. Here's the cold hard truth. No pretending, no illusions, no nostalgia blinding me this time. This movie, it sucks ass!I'm sure it was praised when it came out, but this movie feels lousy. The reason I say that is the directing. The directing just feels so lacking. It seems that Spielberg wants to use the Phillip K Dick story to form an action thriller with complex themes but he never takes on a moral stance offered by the story and as such he doesn't deliver a story that has much meaning behind it. The movie should have taken a stance when it comes to whether we are free or unfree and stuck with it instead of trying to say both are possible. This movie leaves out the complexity of this subject matter and dumbs it down to the viewers by not exploring how Pre-Cog may be morally acceptable. In the original story by Phillip K Dick, Anderton kills a man to preserve Pre-Crime and keep the system intact since it would be the lesser of two evils. Unfortunately, this movie tries to give a very black and white scenario with big government vs little guy and therefore leaves out the complexity that made the story fantastic. It's just watered down to make way for another generic action movie. Also, on a side note, the dialogue sounds like garbage! Almost every line is some pointless overdramatic philosophical rambling or insane techno-jargon that we just have to assume makes sense. It honestly reminded me of bad M Night Shyalaman writing.....I seriously mean that. As for the action itself, it feels average. Nothing really stood out and though the CGI was okay it didn't seem that imaginative. Though the funniest scene was when that lady started beating the jetpack cop and Tom Cruise during that escape sequence. Tom Cruise is pretty much Tom Cruise, I cannot see him as anything else in this movie. There's just nothing remarkable about his character, it's as cliche as it can be. The girl he's with is like a boring version of Eleven from Stranger Things, and that is not a compliment. She's just empty. It's really unsurprising why nobody remembers this movie. When one considers all the good movies Speilberg made before the 2000s and the massive successes they were, it makes me wonder why he didn't try to make anything remotely that awesome when it came to this movie. Minority Report but with Indiana Jones level action! How about that? Anything other than this. I feel like I listened to a bad philosophy lecture. 6/10 a disappointing flick.",6,2,9,18 October 2018
Wind River," 2017's Underrated Thriller that Deserves Love
","Wind River is a cruelly underrated movie from 2017. Since 2017 has been one of those amazing years for cinema, this isn't surprising but it hurts when something like Three Billboards gets all the praise when this amazing crime drama get's nothing at all from the Academy Awards. It has phenomonal acting and a really good story, one which is not often told. First off, this is the best performance I have seen from Jeremy Renner. He plays a devastated father who seeks to redeem his life and you wanna cheer for him since he's a figure who deserves redemption. Yes, one who DESERVES redemption! I am so sick of the failed father figure cliche and movies and I hate it when it's done lazily. Why does every father in movies have to be Adam Sandler? Can't we have a movie with a stable working relationship. Of course not! It's hard to write those movies and it's a lot easier to have the generic divorced family get's back together at the end plotline which I am just sick of! That being said, Jeremy Renner's character Cory is a failed father but it doesn't focus on him getting back with his wife it's about him coming to terms with his mistakes as a father. That's way more interesting than just him being a father who fails comedically and a father who lacks awareness. Then, in the story, Cory goes out of his way to track down a murderer who killed an innocent women and the case has some emotional impact on him since his daughter suffered a similar fate. This allows us to feel sympathetic towards Cory and want him to succeed. It's genius! Then we have Elizabeth Olson and she plays a really good really compelling FBI agent. She's not some generic female lead who's just great at everything, she just knows how to do her job. Her character, Jane, joins Cory and asks for his help because he knows the land and how to hunt in the frozen wilderness while she knows how to be a good cop who can handle herself in a fight. If this was a Marvel movie she would be doing Karate and be completely unstoppable and that's not realistic. Showing her struggle in the Wyoming Wilderness is may more compelling and gives her a reason to ask for Cory's help. Every second they spend together demonstrates good chemistry and I can really appreciate how both characters sort of bond with each other. But the number one thing this movie does is tell a story that deserves to be told. Let me explain. I've seen lots of crime dramas, but most of them happen in cities with generic cops vs criminals. How often do you see a crime drama in which it's not black people vs white people but native American locals vs White American outsiders/ Not many I bet. What's even better is that neither side is shown to be pure good or pure evil, both have their own problems which hurt their communities. I won't delve too deep into the plot but let me say that it really gives an accurate portrayal of the deep tensions that impact these two communities, tension which only fuels the suspense as the hunter and FBI agent team up to take down a criminal. This movie is a wild ride that is suspenseful and compelling. The social commentary is in the background and you can make your own conclusions without having to be told what to think. If you want a good crime drama that actually 'feels' suspenseful rather than looks suspenseful give this a watch. 8/10 pretty good flick.",8,2,5,22 February 2018
Man of Steel," Super Action but Rotten Story or Awesome Man and Dull Hero
","It's time to take a look at the Superman in Man of Steel. It's been years since this movie came out and I think it's time to take another look at this movie. People have already established that this movie has nothing to do with Superman. All we see is some living god that doesn't have a personality and only exists to fight other living gods. One thing that people never seem to talk about is that Superman must have some serious problems being super. Imagine trying to open the door to an office building or any building. Imagine trying to write with a pencil, or play sports with someone, or put on clothes or give somebody a high five or hug or fist bump! He can only do normal things when he's around Lois Lane. People who have seen this movie know how lackluster this romance is and you can probably get the picture. But you wanna know what the rest of the movie is like? Does Private Jimmy ever show up, do we ever see Superman save anybody, does the John Williams theme ever make an appearance? Or anything else that has to do with Superman? Let's find out. As the movie begins we start with a cool Krypton sequence which shows some cool imagery and effects, however the Cinematography is kinda lackluster. Nothing really feels that cool or breathtaking, just kinda meh. The acting itself kinda works and I like Russel Crowe and Michael Shannon in this movie. Zod shows some clear motivations for his actions as does Jor El which is nice, just kinda sucks that Superman himself doesn't get much motivation. No effort is put to him. He just has to save the world and hang out with Lois Lane, just do that and people will think it's a Superman movie! Do they think we're idiots! Anyway there are tons of moments where we see Superman in the most literal of terms to describe his personality. He's the Man of Steel and he's unbreakable so let's have everything else get destroyed. He's a Christ Figure so let's show him in a church. Was this designed by a human being, or did Zach Synder just feed his story into a computer to get a basic bluprint for the rough draft of the screenplay and then use THIS for the movie. By the time the middle act starts we barely have a developed Clark Kent and he's suddenly forced to be a big superhero. What does he do, save people, no! He fights Zod and his gang in the streets and buildings and destroys spaceships! Oh, and character development, he falls in love with Lois! What more did you expect? I'll tell you one thing this is no Dark Knight. Why does Superman just let all this destruction happen, why doesn't he at least try to stop it. If he at least tried and failed that would be compelling, but by not trying he looks stupid and boring. At least he's not as boring as Lois Lane, good lord she starts off okay but then becomes a lifeless love interest. Does him saving her work as motivation because she has nobody else? Where's Private Jimmy? Why is the Daily Planet so uninteresting? Why are these subplots so distracting and dumb! Couldn't they have tried to make this movie ANYTHING like the original?!? Couldn't it have any warmth inside of it?!? Also, wouldn't it be good to have some triumphant music when Superman fights for humans! You know, a JOHN WILLIAMS remix? Well, there is Superman music, HANS ZIMMERS music! Granted, this works and often the music is powerful and intense, but other parts are just flat and lifeless. If that is the intent I guess it works but Superman movies should have inspirational music, not boring music! If Batman Begins could have some inspirational music that blended with the serious music, why not here? At least the music has soem effort put into it. After more CGI battles, the big confrontation happens and Zod fights Superman. During this battle, Superman manages to save people from death, yes he does this after all. The fight itself is actually kinda kickass but it doesn't have much emotion to it and is just some thing from an epic video game boss fight. All it is is two men fighting through a bunch of buildings! That's all! Anyway, Superman saves people from Zod by killing Zod. To be honest I kinda was okay with this because I think it helped advance Supeman's character, what a relief, but it's still kinda disappointing when you see Superman have to give up and not actually succeed in a good morally incorrupt way. The reasoning is that Zod would never be stopped since he failed to rebuild Krypton and so there was no other way, which is kinda dumb. Why is Zod so into rebuilding Krpton anyway? Wouldn't he rather take control of the weak humans who can't harness the superpowers that a Kryptonian gets when they absorb the radiation from a yellow sun? Isn't that the whole idea of Superman II?????? Anyway, Superman snaps Zod's neck, wails, and finally manages to crack a joke at the end of the movie. That's it, nothing! Fuck Zach Synder! Now that I've discussed the whole movie I can conclude that....uh, some things are kinda good. While it's underdeveloped, Henry Cevill looks like Superman and it feels so refreshing to see a mature version look so good even if it doesn't have much substance to it. Also, the music does work for a lot of the time, Hans Zimmer does great. But this movie doesn't carry any of the emotions of Superman. And don't tell me it's some reinterpretation crap like, they couldn't use the old versions as templates but they also couldn't go full Nolan on this movie and make it realistic and awesome like the Dark Knight Trilogy was! No Superman Theme, no Private Jimmy, no saving people, no feelings of heroism! Well, screw this! 6/10",6,0,2,17 February 2018
Batman Begins," The Batman Movie that made Bruce Wayne Awesome
","The movie that started the best Superhero trilogy of all time is definitely one of the best superhero movies to be made. It's shame that the Dark Knight's greatness casts a shadow over this amazing origin story but then again it's kinda hard not to do this. That said, Batman Begins is an amazing story with some phenomenal acting and storytelling. First I'm gonna talk about the story. This story does something rather risky, it focuses less on Batman's story and more on that of Bruce Wayne's story. Mark my words, you will not be disappointed by this choice and you will come to think of Superhero movies differently. This movie delivers in making Bruce Wayne an awesome hero who becomes darkness to take on the forces that corrupt Gotham City. By the time he becomes Batman, we have connected to him and we are ready to see him become the Caped Crusader in full glory, and Batman's introduction.......oh man......it's awesome and it's something you have to see to believe. This movie sets up this amazing trilogy to a great start and it achieves this so well because it adheres to as much realism as possible and really goes out of it's way to make Batman seem possible. This is best seen in the cinematography. The amount of practical effects in this movie is insane! The stunt choreography is well done and the amount of detail is truly amazing. Anyone who loves Batman will be satisfied. One last thing to talk about, the actors. Christian Bale is an excellent Bruce Wayne and he is a badass hero who is awesome to watch. The voice is a bit strange but other than that there's not a damn thing wrong with him. Watch this Batman and you will never look at Ben Affleck the same way. Michail Caine is a great Alfred who really adds fantastic emotion to the character we never thought we could love. Cillian Murphy and Morgan Freeman are also great and...do I really need to explain Gary Oldman? Well, he's great. And lastly, Liam Neeson is kickass! He is my favorite character in the whole movie and I loved every second he was onscreen. Liam Neeson is pure gold as Ducard and you can't help but see a badass warrior who does no wrong in this film. You are the best, good sir. Batman Begins is an amazing Superhero movie that truly is amazing and still remains one of the best Superhero origin stories every made and one which I will continue to love for all time. I easily give this movie an 8/10 and hold it much higher than any of the modern Superhero movies especially the Marvel ones. If you love Batman, if you love Christopher Nolan, if you love good storytelling, go watch this movie.",8,0,0,23 February 2018
Get Out," A Welcome Addition to the Horror Community
","For a while I was becoming pretty convinced that it was impossible to make a movie that focuses solely on being a good movie. Not trying to throw in political themes or the director's private views so he could please people, no, just a damn good movie that's fun to watch! Get Out is that movie, one which I have throughly enjoyed watching. It's a damn good horror movie because it has psychological horror about being powerless and trapped in a world you can't escape. That's really powerful and it's great to see a movie focus on this often unexplored psychological aspect of fear. It felt like watching a really good Twilight Zone episode that just so happened to have a black actor in the leading role. Daniel Kaluuya kills it as Chris Washington, he is such a cool everyman. You can really relate to this guy regardless of who you are, he seems like an average chill dude who you want to hang out with. This perfectly helps you relate to a character. He's our outlet into the story and our way of becoming immersed in the horror. One thing that kinda frustrates me though is how everybody sees this movie. For those who call it politically correct nonsense about evil white society, I almost want to punch these idiots in the face! This isn't something like Mudbound where you instantly realize what the movie is about without even having to see it, Get Out pushes racism and white prejudice in the background so it can focus on the story, not the political climate it happens to be in. People who praise or hate this movie on the grounds that it tackles racism are people who didn't get the point of the movie. This movie is not about political themes but everybody thinks it is because it has white villains. For those people, leave your damn politics to CNN and just appreciate a movie because it's great! Get Out is great, and if you like horror movie and want a good modern horror movie, give this a watch. I love the classics and I will adore movies like Frankenstein and Bram's Stoker's Dracula to death (literally), but sometimes I wanna watch a modern movie where the real villains are the monsters inside the people we think we know. It's a great movie. It's really fun! Go watch it! 9/10 great movie that holds up well and a welcome addition to the horror community!",9,17,32,22 February 2018
The Dark Knight," Do you wanna know why this film is a masterpiece?
","Superhero flicks are too lackluster these days. It's all about the fast action, the cheesy albeit funny dialogue, the either super serious or super corny tones, and the dramatic action scenes. Now that's not necessarily bad, but this movie goes above and beyond every superhero film with only a few others rivaling it. The Dark Knight proves that it's possible to make a great film first, before making a good Superhero film. Many have said that this trilogy is the best trilogy of the 2000's. Now this may or may not be wrong, but Christopher Nolan definitely aces it with this masterpiece. The first thing he does is make memorable characters that fully embody what they should be. Each character has extreme effort put into them, and each one is characterized by a phenomenal cast. Heath Ledger, may he rest in peace, did a phenomenal job as the Joker, and there will be moments in his performance that will trump anything that Jared Leto throws your way. That being said, Christian Bale is a superb Batman who pays homage to the Batman universe while also giving an amazing performance. Then there's Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as James Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Aaron Eackhart as Harvey Dent. They all carry the movie and make it even more of a masterpiece. There are more to list but this film is so well cast that when I say that any of them could have won Oscar's, I'm dead serious. Additionally, the realism of this film shines through. As people reflect on all the 'praised films' of our generation, they will probably realize that many of these films are mediocre crime dramas. However, this film will not be one of them. It really is a a highly intense thriller that just happens to take place in a DC comic book universe. Everything from the vehicles, to the corruption caused by a mob, to the themes involved totally embody realism to the point where you could believe that such a scenario presented in the movie could occur in real life, for the most part. This is a movie worth watching, even if you don't like superhero movies. It's gripping, intense, powerful, and enthralling. You will be on the edge of your seat the entire way and will look back on this as one of the best films you had the pleasure of watching. If you're a movie fan, it's a highly recommended film, for DC and Superhero fans, it's a must.",10,0,0,25 September 2017
Rosemary's Baby," The Most Pure of Evil Triumphs
","Rosemary's Baby is a film that is not meant to be a terrifying movie per se, but when it comes to a film that puts you on edge, kills you with tension, and simply steals your human attention to the point where suspense is at an all time high, there are few movies that compare.When watching this movie I was already put off during the opening credits. It lures you in with potential happiness and joy between our two leads but that is harshly and violently reversed with a simple yet effective tone shift. This movie doesn't screw around, when it decides to get dark, it embraces that darkness with absolute conviction.Is Rosemary's Baby as horrific as people say? No, it's actually more.Normally when a movie is created with so many spiritual themes and concepts being introduced it often fails to deliver with a creative and frightening end game. But when you see the ending of this movie you will suddenly be filled with a sense of dread that cannot be put into words. There are scenes that literally shock me into silence so that I can't find humor or any sign of light whatsoever. It's as if there is only evil within this movie which makes our connection to Rosemary that much more powerful. Throughout this entire movie I feel a sense of dread with the exception of maybe a few scenes in the beginning and that party scene, but even then I couldn't find myself happy, just holding in nervous laughter. With this movie, you're mood is just killed and you are punished for having any sort of hope. This makes the climax all the more effective: I thought I was prepared, but I wasn't.My only nitpicks might be that some of the scenes are kinda dated with the movie makers not having complete knowledge of cigarettes and alcohol and how these just don't appear during pregnancies, ideally, but now that I think about it this might have been intentional as another way to show how something is wrong.This is one of the most terrifying movies I have seen and an absolute must for he/she who wants to venture into the horror that is Rosemary's Baby. 9/10.",9,0,1,19 October 2018
Jaws," The Perfect Film
","Ask yourself what Jaws is? Is it a Thriller? A Horror flick? An Adventure story? A Drama? The correct answer is that it's all of these things. It's a blockbuster! It's the definition of a movie that triumphs in terms of entertainment. Citizen Kane is considered the founder of films since it invented many cinematic techniques and styles used in films. Well if that's true, then Jaws is the legend of films. After this movie, everybody wanted to be Jaws. But why is that? First of all it's a masterful retelling of the novel, Jaws, by Peter Benchley, and the film adaptation is also a massive improvement over the original story. The cast is amazing, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss pull off amazing performances and make one feel invested in the story since we're invested in the characters. They all feel like unique characters that break away from traditional clichÃ©s associated with their character types. More importantly, they have amazing chemistry since they all play off one another. This is something Hollywood couldn't do today since it would be too concerned with appealing to ethnic and gender diversity rather than acting diversity. The cast is perfect. Additionally, Jaws replaces boring plot elements to create better pacing and it carries a tone appropriate for both horror movies and adventure movies. That's because it has a two act structure that works even with two different atmospheres for each act. The first act feels like a horror movie and functions as one while the second act feels like an oceanic adventure. This works because the intense tone is consistent throughout the story even as the atmosphere undergoes an evolution between the two acts. Why? John Williams! John Williams amazing score makes the movie lively and thrilling. Few scores can compare to the iconic theme for Jaws. The story is masterfully done and allows one to be entertained for the entire film. Jaws is also a massive victor in cinematography. The shark used in the film, Bruce, had massive problems that caused it break down constantly. Therefore, Spielberg decided to utilize as many shots that didn't show the shark on screen. This may seem lazy, but it actually works beautifully since the film plays off the fear of the unknown. By not seeing the attacker, the shark is more terrifying than it would be if we actually saw it. By the time we do see the shark, it's far beyond our wildest expectations and even then shown only occasionally. Additionally, the usage of first person shots for the shark, shots set between the water line, wide-scale shots, and close ups, we manage to see the story through multiple angles which makes the story all the more real to us. And if John Williams score wasn't already amazing enough, it further makes the cinematography feel epic. This whole movie is epic, and it continues to hold up to this day. It has one of the greatest legacies for a film. When you're film managed to lower beach attendance and make people afraid to go swimming, you know you did something right. The film is timeless and can be enjoyed by absolutely anyone. Steven Spielberg's greatest masterpiece and my personal favorite film of all time, Jaws is a brilliant movie that I will love forever.",10,1,2,7 December 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Best Superhero Trilogy Risen at Last
","The Dark Knight Rises has gotten a bad reputation as of late that it is not as good as the Dark Knight. What could? Seriously, what could possibly beat that superhero movie? I dare say this is equal to the first installemnt Batman Begins and some scenes are Dark Knight level quality, so I can wholeheartedly say that I was very pleased by this movie. This is a very satisfactory conclusion to not only a movie trilogy but also a superhero trilogy. Everything that Batman Begins was building up and almost everything that the Dark Knight had expanded on are fully realized here. We see a complete story of Bruce Wayne and how his quest to save Gotham and defeat injustice comes to an end. Christian Bale does a pretty good job here as usual as well as Michael Caine. The real star though is Tom Hardy, he is phenomenal as Bane. Heath Ledger may be the best Joker, but Tom Hardy will make all future Bane's have to turn their heads. Ann Hathaway does a good job too as Selina Kyle and she is far more interesting than the other female actress who plays Miranda Tate, man she is boring. I swear, it seems that the only characters who are boring in Batman are the women, they just don't do that much besides be plot devices. Selina is definitely the best of the bunch and it's refreshing to see a female with an actual personality. Anyway, the story is what really shines in this movie. Some people might have been a bit annoyed by the communist undertones with Bane's character and the stuff that happens with Gotham, and I myself am kinda annoyed that the police are so lazilly removed from the movie but other than that I don't really have many problems with the story. The opening scene is just amazing and manages to top the bank robbery opening of the last movie! Its unbelievable that they managed to make such a kickass opening to a film and you become fully convinced that Bane means business. The struggle to take Gotham from Bane and his revolution is nothing short of epic and you are immersed with the story. The stakes feel really high in this movie and it makes the viewing experience a roller coaster ride. I easily give this movie an 8/10 and reccommend that anybody who likes Batman and Nolan watch this movie. It's a damn good conclusion and it wraps the trilogy together nicely.",8,1,1,5 April 2018
The Matrix," A 'Cool' Sci Fi that's Outrageously Overrated
","I liked this movie. But damn! Number 18 on IMDb with a score of 8.7??? That's not appropriate for the movie's overall quality. There is some good here, don't get me wrong, but it's not as if it's some Godlike Sci Fi! They really think this movie is better than Alien? Better than Blade Runner? Better than Star Wars A New Hope? Better than Planet of the Apes? Better than 2001 A Space Odyssey? First off the whole Bullet Time thing is just a ridiculous slow mo effect that must have really looked cool back then! In the modern day, this 'Bullet Time' did not age well and looks ridiculously dumb not ridiculously awesome. As for the sound effects used, I honestly thought The Phantom Menace was more innovative than this movie. The story itself isn't that unique or special, I've seen other movies tackle these concepts before. Hell, one Twilight Episode is all I need to get what this movie is about and yet people didn't freak out then! I don't think Neo is a particularly interesting character and I find his story dull and lackluster. There are a few other things I don't like but none of these are as prevalent as to what is listed above. As for what I like, I gotta admit that I liked Morpheus and thought he was an interesting character. And while the story is kinda unoriginal, I still liked it and they do it well just not as amazingly as everybody seems to think. I also admit that the gun battles are actually pretty damn cool and some of the visual effects really are breathtaking even if once again they're overrated. The one word I would use to describe this movie is 'cool!' This is a very cool movie and I do recommend that you check it out and get your own opinion on this still popular movie. I give this movie a 7/10 because I don't think it's all that revolutionary but I still enjoy it and I might watch it again sometime and I'm glad it saw it in the first place. If somebody decided that 'No, it really is a masterpiece' or conversely 'Yes, this movie is garbage that's outdated' then you are welcome to think that but for me I see it as a 'cool' sci fi that's outrageously overrated.",7,1,2,24 February 2018
Tarzan," The Best Adaptation of the Jungle Swinger
","Tarzan is an underrated masterpiece made by Disney before the 3D age. I found this to be very engaging and very entertaining. Mostly because this movie is beautiful to look at and has truly great animation. The color scheme feels lively and active, one can really appreciate the beauty and wonder of the jungle and the animals that inhabit it.Furthermore ths story is also amazing and very entertaining. While it's not a perfect retelling of Tarzan nor is it an accurate one, it works and feels like an original retelling of this epic. My favorite character is Kerchek who is a really cool character and one who really adds life to the narrative. Tarzan is also a welcome character who really is fun and exciting. He starts off decent but ends up becoming awesome. This movie feels like a great adaptation of Tarzan which feels alive and refreshing unlike the live action reboot. The soundtrack in this movie is also amazing and Phil Collins really shines. The music is amazing and adds the Disney magic to this movie and it works so well because the music can be enjoyed outside of the movie. Overall I give it an 8/10 and think it's a pretty great Disney movie. Give it a watch.",8,0,0,25 February 2018
Incredibles 2," 14 Years but Not Too Late
","Going into this movie I expected to see a film that just outright sucked. Too much time had passed, the voice actors had to change, the hype was going to be too great and there was no way it would please expectations which would be way too demanding. Then, when I heard this film was really good I thought that people might be overreacting and just saying it's great when really it wasn't. This is how I thought, this is how I was trained to think. Well? They're damn right! This film was awesome! It was on par with the original! It was super! In an age of superhero movies you'd think that they wouldn't be able to get it right with a sequel for a movie that came out 14 years ago.Yet they did, Brad Bird scored again! The key to this film's success is the pacing and flow. The movie feels very upbeat with energetic action and an engaging story. It has some quiet moments for storytelling but it never feels like the story comes to a halt. There is also plenty of humor but unlike say the Marvel movies it feels natural and doesn't come from dumb one liners but instead from slapstick and funny writing and a few running gags. This helps the story maintain a fast beat and the audience is almost always invested. The only real downside is that the villain is not nearly as good as the villain in the first movie. I don't wanna get into spoiler territory but it isn't as memorable or as entertaining as Syndrome (the first villain in these films). Once you watch it you'll see why. With that said, this is more than made up for with the family dynamic. This film continues the great family that we got a taste of in the first movie and devokes so much time into it. The only detracting flaw from the first movie that kinda pulls people away is the fact that a lot of the movie (at least in the beginning) deals with Mr. Incredibles mid-life crisis and not the family dynamic. But this wasn't a problem since this allowed him to be the main character and thus we feel a closer connection to him than we would with Elastigirl. Well, now it's full circle. Even if the first film has the better villain, this film gets the better family so it's pretty even. Holly Hunter, how do I say it, damn well killed it. She is so good in this movie! I had my doubts and I kinda expected her character to be a step backwards but she felt really natural. The perfect family dynamic from the first movie is preserved and even expanded on and Elastigirl is no exception. Also really liked Mr. Incredible who was my second favorite character from the last movie (Syndrome was number one). He goes through a pretty convincing arc and he is still a great father character, something that had become rare in animation today. The kids are great too, including Jack Jack who is hilarious as ever, and though Dash has a different voice actor (which I know is unavoidable) I am very pleased that it sounds so similar to the original and my suspension of disbelief was preserved. Go watch this movie, it's worth the wait and really fun to watch. If you loved the original you'll love this movie too. It's great. Super great. 9/10. Really fun to watch.",9,7,11,27 June 2018
