Passengers," A good movie to see in the theatres.
","Now having agreed to go see this on Christmas instead of collateral beauty which would have been my choice this film definitely did not disappoint . It's not easy making a movie with just one or two characters for pretty much the entire film but they definitely did a good job with this one . It takes place on a flight to a new planet that will take 90 years to get there, all the passengers are in a chamber that will preserve them for the duration of the 90 year flight. The problem is there is a malfunction and some of the chambers open, leaving Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence awake and alone 90 years early. This is one of those rooms where the less you know the better so as to not do too much away let's just say they have to figure out how they're going to survive For 90 years all by themselves, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawerence both give good performances that make her feel very enjoyable definitely a movie to check out in the theaters",6,0,2,3 January 2017
Point Break," Entertaining but needs some familiar faces
","Now this would have been a decent movie if it wasn't a remake of a cult classic from 1991. The visuals and action sequences are actually pretty entertaining but Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze Who were in the original were replaced by two guys that I had never seen or heard of before .if they could have cast actors like Taylor Kitsch, Tom Hardy, Ben Foster, or Emile Hirsh just to name a few it would have made all the difference in the world . The action scenes made it watchable but it was just a really good bad movie with these actors. So unfortunately they wasted the opportunity to remake a good 90's action film. I saw the list of actors considered I don't know if everyone refused or what happened but with a 100 million dollar budget they deffinitley could have afforded some familiar faces.!",5,2,2,3 January 2017
Pulp Fiction," Best movie of all time
","Shows multiple different stories and how they interact with one another in an out of order sequence but boy does it work. The main story focuses on the Vincent Vega and Jueles two hit-man working for gangster Marsellus Wallace. Brilliance of this movie besides the way it's filmed and the acting is the dialogue. Shows to hit-man on the way to a job and what they talk about not just loading their guns like any other movie. Bruce Willis is another one of the main stories a boxer supposed to take a fall for Marsellus Wallace, things don't go according to plan and Bruce Willis is forced to go on the run. Unfortunately his girlfriend forgot the one thing that matters to him his father's watch which Christopher Walken explain explains in an unforgettable dialogue. One of the best scenes of the movie comes from director Quinten Tarantino as Jimmy. The third story which is the minor of the three is Vincent Vega taking Marsellus Wallace's wife out on a date. Uma Thurman as Mia. Although a short subplot also has one of the most unforgettable scenes involving a heroine overdose. There are so many great lines and every single actor gives a great performance. I have never seen such a perfect movie before. It is a shame that not only did this not win best picture but that there were no Oscar wins for acting. Although this movie may not be for everyone it is definitely a must see and by far the best movie of the 90s. So much more can be said but I will just ended on what does Marsellus Wallace look like?",10,1,3,18 August 2015
The Departed," A Perfect film
","The departed it is arguably the best movie of the 2000'sand they're probably hasn't been a better movie since then. Scorsese is back in the world of organized crime. This time instead of the Italian Mob, the focus is on the Irish mob in Boston. Led by Jack Nicholson who humor and one of his best performances in Year's The biggest question is who can you trust . Damon and DiCaprio are both undercover, Leo is a cop pretending to be a criminal and Damon is A cop working for Jack Nicholson . Mark Wahlberg also gives one of his best performances of his career and was awarded with an Academy award nomination. Also in the film is Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin Anthony Anderson and more are also in the epic crime saga. Who's working for who and who can be trusted with questions are constantly asking yourself while watching this. A great movie that get to the weather with each additional watch . The most cities for anyone who is a fan of Scorsese or the crime genre in general .",10,0,2,3 January 2017
