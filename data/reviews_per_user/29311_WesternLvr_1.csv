First Man," I've Been To A 2nd Grade Piano Recital That Was More Exciting
","We went to see this film because of the rating it had here on IMDB. A bore-fest doesn't begin to describe this plodding story that sadly depicts Armstrong as having no redeeming qualities as a human. A film about a flatlined anteater would be more interesting.There is also not a single ounce of character development. None. Wading through perhaps the most horrible, heart-wrenching tragedy that could befall any parent is as emotionally charged as picking paint colors at Walmart. From the beginning of this film to the end I cared exactly nothing for any of them. During the interminable, mind-numbing (not to mention silent), closeups, I kept expecting Ryan Gosling to yawn. This role had to have bored him and the rest of the cast to tears.This was a moment in time populated by men who took unbelievable risks~~many of whom died~~to put a man into space and on the moon. Their families paid an immense emotional toll watching husbands, sons, and fathers march slowly into flimsy spacecraft, perhaps never to be seen again.Mr. Armstrong, his family, and his fellow astronauts deserved far more than this.",1,18,33,29 October 2018
