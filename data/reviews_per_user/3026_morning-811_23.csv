The King's Speech," An ordinary father a great guardian
","Perhaps it was because of the same stuttering that the king and his father were so similar. On the surface they were weak and taciturn, but in their hearts they had a strong sense of responsibility. They tried to be respected in their own way, but because they were the king, he could only allow himself to speak fluently in front of others. During the movie, all I saw was the shadow of my father, the hesitation to choose the right words when I opened my mouth, the tangle of frowning in order to pronounce a sound, the same desire to speak, and the same forced silence. The king ended up in the history books. My father also got all the happiness of a mortal. They are lucky to meet people who are willing to communicate with them. I don't know if my father had any efforts like the king's. I don't know if he ever cried in secret when he was a child.",9,0,0,7 April 2020

Ready Player One," ready player
","Good science fiction showcases the science and technology of the future, and great science fiction discusses the ethics and values of the future. When reality, like the crumbling city of the first playhouse, becomes squalid and empty day by day, the tide of entertainment and capitalism merge into one, and finally ride the ship of virtual reality, where does it all go? What do people become? Are players really going to fight a war against a big company over some values? You refused to give the oasis to IOI, so what kind of oasis do you want? Neither the film nor the novel gives an answer.Spielberg just tell you, if there is such a virtual world, you like the pop culture are included, it will surely take up the reconstruction of meaning of the standard, and save you in addition to entertainment has no other desire of contemporary humans, retreat from reality nothing in the desert, desperate to escape to the VR glasses inside the hurricane cool oasis.",8,1,1,8 May 2020

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," spider man
","The first floor was originally, we're doing a cartoon, but it's a real world. You read comics in the real world, and there are real world people in the comics, and that's fine. And then a bunch of comic book characters from other time and space travel, not to the comic world, but to the real world, which means that the real world that you're building is actually a comic world.There is a kind of dramatic sense of alienation, of jumping out, which is revealed by the style of disharmony. It makes me think that this version is really subversive. The creators are so confident with love, and they don't care whether the audience can accept it or not, the box office will be damaged. We came up with the idea, and we did it, and that's what a comic book fan would do. This is so cool, just give this a standing ovation.These are the things that animators do on purpose, doing 3D animation and then anti-3d, which is really fun and confident design. In this way, ordinary audiences have a sense of novelty and feel the extraordinary painting style. On the other hand must be deep comic book fan's favor, kill two birds with one stone.",9,0,0,7 May 2020

The Chorus," love
","The sincere movie always can firmly grasp you, after the performance of more than 100 minutes, the soul to return to oneself, allow you to comment on the praise or derogatory, it is demure and proud of standing on the side, indifferent to the matter. Angry roar, moved tears, vent and tidy up are in front of the screen of their own, seemingly endless cycle, the catalyst is the film. At this point, I ruminated on that 100-plus minutes. There are no beautiful actors, no gaudy stunts, a few childish 'problem' children, a bald teacher, plus clean and simple music, trickling stories, not fierce tears and laughter, clumsy edges and corners of the gentle file...... Clement mathew, a country teacher with a passion for music, was appointed to a re-education school, known as the 'bottom of the pond', a chaotic and irreverent centre for troubled students. Here the principal teacher fraught, on the face is the line of rigid boring, abuse and corporal punishment is the only communication between teachers and students. The lovely new proctor has no choice but to watch the students play practical jokes, until one day accidentally found the beautiful voice of the child. Very naturally, rare resonance, singing in the eyes of the children back to clear and clean, teachers and students in the joy of the staff learned to understand, tolerance and love.It's a broad theme, but I can't be indifferent to the change from gloomy to positive.",8,0,0,6 May 2020
Coco," gentle
","On a normal day, my life is not a theme song, more like the weather forecast that nobody noticed the background sound. The movie probably didn't extend my life. Even if I won at the starting line, I would still die at the end. Even in such a normal life, there are always moments when you pick up the guitar and brush the next chord, feeling the time is extremely quiet. When no one is watching, oneself watch oneself, tell oneself, even if one day life comes to an end, also want to try to be gentle.",8,0,0,14 April 2020

","The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue. The reason why this is a film with the growth of people, because from the film we can see their own growth.

Jojo Rabbit," Jojo
","The film is not a critical piece of serious literature directed against the evil, dark, or even radical actions of the nazis. It's anti-hate. It's a smart move to reduce some of the controversy over the director's nazi-themed comedy. And when the last film, when we saw the leading role is so hidden in the darkness of the environment is still strong to grow up, and find the light, is a source of even better to resolve the dispute, will race, war, rebellion, hegemony and other sensitive topics are moderately bypass, only pay attention to jo-jo the child's mind world and his life.

The Pursuit of Happyness," happyness
","It's part of my life.
Even with its poetic Chinese title, 'the pursuit of happiness' is still just a part of life.
After going through so much misery and suffering, happiness finally came, then after the happiness came.
People are always greedy, no matter how much happiness is not satisfied. Ambitious people, every day to do everything, be kind to others, wronged themselves, just for their own an ideal, try their best...... We say, this is an example, this spirit is worth learning from; No ambition of the people, every day eat lazy, muddle along, but, even if the life is simple, but still have 'not too bad' hope... We said, this is not good, people should pursue something.
In fact, we are all chasing happiness, but the standard of 'happiness' is not the same.
But in any case, these are just 'parts of life'.",9,0,0,19 April 2020
