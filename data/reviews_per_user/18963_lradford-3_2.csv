Scarface," The World Is Yours.
","At the school i attend, there are these guys, I guess you could call them your standard school bully, every time you see these guys they are always quoting the film, they have the slit eyebrow and they walk around with the same cocky strut Tony Montana has.These guys may not have understood or even seen the film, they only care for what Tony stands for, his opinions, actions and beliefs. In a way, Tony is a violent anarchist, always angry, always wanting more, whether thats money, coke or women. This kind of approach to life is what these guys are after, to be feared and respected. Its amazing to think, a film that was made over 20 years ago is having an effect on the youth today. But it makes me laugh when I see 50 Cent and other rappers trying to act like Tony.Anyway...As for the film, well its genius, to people who haven't seen the film or now nothing about films in general, when you say scarface to them they immediately think of the violence and the drug related scenes that have hung over the films head. But when you watch the film, it isn't very violent, yes it does have short outbursts of violence but not whole scenes donated to it, in a way its more intellectual movie. I'd like to say at this point, I'm not one of those types who are trying to ban violent movies, on the contrary, I love violent films, its just that films like Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction and Scarface have built up these untrue reputations of being really violent when there not.Al Pacino is also amazing in these film, I believe that either this or The Godfather Part 2 is his finest role, but we all now how good how Al is in this movie, so I ain't' saying anymore.The film also does this really cool thing in which the audience has a love/hate relationship with Tony, at the beginning of the film you find yourself cheering him on, but at the end after he kills his best friend, you want him to meet his grisly end.Anyway, enough from me, if you haven't seen it go to your local video store and rent it out. No wait, don't do that go and buy it instead.THE WORLD IS YOURS...",9,0,1,1 April 2006
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","Pulp fiction is easily my favourite movie ever. No other film matches its nerve beating brilliance which is packed with unforgettable moments. The script is pure gold and is so ingeniously clever, funny, compelling and cool.People say how films like, Casablanca, The Godfather, Chinatown and Brief encounter have really good scripts,(don't get me wrong the Godfather and Chinatown are both really good.) but they don't have the wit and dazzling performances to up to match Pulp fiction.It also has some of the greatest quotes ever - Ezekiel 25:17, you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris, foot massage and I'm about to get medieval on your ass.What other film has the balls to kill one of the main characters half way through the film? Tarantino also single handedly brought John Travolta's career back to life in the role of Vince.The music is amazing in this movie, the beginning credits with Misirlou running over them is such a rush, the film is also hilarious to such an extent you can almost hear Tarantino cracking up behind the camera.This film is a masterpiece and I cannot praise it enough. If you are into films and haven't seen this film yet, i highly recommend.",10,1,3,24 February 2006
