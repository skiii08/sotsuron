The Rock," The BEST action/drama movie I have ever seen. **** 4stars!
","Besides Black Hawk Down, The Rock and Armageddon are my favorite Bruckheimer movies. The reason is because of Micheal Bay. The guy is brilliant with that camera, and he let's his actor's make you care about them by getting the most out of them. Unlike most action movies, where they tend to focus on explosions and the extra ammo, This movie had me caught up in all the drama as well. Nothing compares to the Rock because it has a lot of everything in it, Romance, Humor, Action, A Car chase scene, a top notch script, and the best soundtrack I ever experienced since Rocky!! Phenomenal acting by Connery, (He should still be agent 007!!) at his age proves he can still be an action star. Nicholas Cage was good as well playing an FBI bio-chemist who was sort of a wimp but proved otherwise. I actually cared about the characters and the story was awesome. I heard this movie was underrated, It's too bad, people really don't know what they are missing in The Rock. Easily my favorite action/drama of all time. It's not considered a war movie, even though it involves conflicts between our Government and ex US Marines. But this flick qualifies as a masterpiece, and whoever disagrees needs to go have their heads examined.",Null,2,2,12 February 2002
The Avengers," I'm a satisfied Avengers fan, although find it hard to overlook the flaws.
","I'm writing this review from the perspective of an avid comic book collector, and Avengers fan.I absolutely loved the action in this film, from every one of the main characters. They fought like they do in the comic books, especially Captain America. It seems as if he had plenty of time to practice with that shield of his, the choreography of his fight scenes were better, and he showed the agility and super strength this time out. Chris Evans was very solid in portraying him, and acted like a true captain. Very authoritative.Even Thor used his hammer to its full capacity, making the most out of it. He used it to absorb and block kinetic energy, dish out energy in return, and he just felt more powerful than he did in his introductory film. He was a bit too serious in the film, gone was that positive attitude though.Iron man was his usual self, mostly there for comedic elements. Sometimes, it took away from the solemn tone of the action scenes, there were just too many jokes in the heat of battle and found it hard to laugh at times during his jokes. One thing I loved about his fighting scenes was how he used Captain America's shield to deflect his beams. So, so cool. Well choreographed! Now, the Hulk. In a nutshell, well, he stole the show! That's all I'm going to say. He looked so much better then he did in his film just several years ago, my how technology progresses in such short time! Now, the supporting cast did OK, Black Widow got more screen time then I expected. She is fun to watch, a great tough actress Johansson is. As is Renner, too bad he was limited in his action. I won't mention the other performances by Paltrow, Jackson and Skaarsgards...they were all just solid and short.Plotwise, well, nothing that complicated. It was a sublime story, but simple when looked above the surface. Aliens invade through a Stargate/Wormhole. Dark and evil energy is brought forth by the main Protagonist, who was fantastic as usual. Hiddlestone was just as menacing as he was in Thor, a fine actor indeed. Acting wise, he stole the show, and threatened mentally more than physically. That is rare in a Marvel film.Now, if a Marvel film would only have a top name directing it. I mean, DC movies get the best directors, Donner, Burton, Snyder, and Nolan. Am I missing one? The Avengers felt too confusing at times, a comedy for the most part, yet, having the violence and action of a war film. I didn't like that. And as for the 8.8 score and fantastic reviews, well, I can't rate a movie above an 7 if its missing a good soundtrack. Perhaps less CGI and a good composer would add more emotion to the film. I found that The Avengers lacked in emotive substance.Go see it though, it's a hell of a roller coaster ride and one of the best comic book adaptations ever.",7,4,9,5 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," A visual cinematic gem, but a jumbled story
","Blade Runner is not only one of my favorite science fiction films of all time, it is one of my favorite films ever;-period. Blade Runner 2049 is a film that any Blade Runner fan would approve of. The atmosphere of the original film is matched in this one. The world is believable and feels lived in. Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. Cinematographer Roger Deakins makes sure to provide the surreal, dark, and gloomy ambiance that guarantees a brooding story.That being said, I will not go as far as saying it is superior to the original, though, it is superior aesthetically. This is pure sci-fi art. I'll even go as far as saying that even the cinematography exceeds that of the original, but the story was convoluted. As long as this film is, I still felt it could have used another 40 minutes or so because there was so many parts of the story that were undeveloped. The story felt like a collection of subplots, with no clearly defined central plot. There were certain parts of the story that I hoped Villeneuve would emphasize on a bit more;-mostly having to do with the Older Model Replicants.For those of you unfamiliar with the original film, Replicants, who are genetically modified humans, were built as slave laborers. But they were made too perfect and too human for their own good. 'More human than human,' was the motto of the Tyrell corporation, the corporation of genetic designers that engineered the replicants. The replicants are designed to obey and never rebel or overcome the limits of their programming and if they should ever do so, a fail-safe is activated that would shorten their lifespan.As you know, it turned out that most of the Nexus 6 replicants were prone to rebelling and so all Nexus 6 replicants were to be hunted and killed by 'Blade Runners.' Blade Runners were Replicants themselves, except devoid of humanity and pure killing machines. They obeyed and were excellent at their jobs;--which was to kill or 'retire' all Nexus 6 Replicants. In Blade Runner 2049 a new corporation figured out how to make new replicants that would obey and not rebel like the Nexus 6 Replicants. Any Nexus 6 replicants that remained in society, now called Older Models, were to be hunted and retired. But when 'Joe,' a Blade Runner, played brilliantly by Ryan Gosling starts to experience breaks in his programming, he goes on a quest to find out if he is indeed like the Older Models, in that he is more human than the others of his kind. It turns out that some Older Model Replicants had the ability to reproduce naturally and so many of these Older Models hid their children in orphanages in order to keep them safe from being hunted by Blade Runners. Joe begins to think of himself as one of these children when he begins to suspect that his childhood memories were real and not implanted memories. His new mission causes him to lose his job as a Blade Runner and he risks being killed as he seeks to find out whether or not he had real parents. I always thought this whole idea of hunting Older Model replicants was allegorical of the holocaust, in that Jews were always prone to rebelling in religious scriptures.The film also picks up on the threads where Ridley Scott left, which is a monumental task, and it succeeds. The original 'Blade Runner' left us with many questions regarding Rachel and Roy, and it left us wondering if Rachel actually felt love for Deckard. And in 2049, we are presented with a similar question, from a holographic girlfriend that Joe is madly in love with;- and we are left wondering if the hologram was really in love with Joe?', or was she just programmed to be in love?', 'Is she capable of real emotions?' I only wished we had more of the holographic girlfriend, and more of the Older Model rebellion against their makers, instead of focusing so much on Joe finding his parents, or Deckard reuniting with his replicant child. There were lots of subplots in this film, and in the end, I found it to be a bit anticlimactic.Blade Runner 2049 is fantastic movie nonetheless and a film I will watch again. But If you're hoping for action, be advised, that there is almost no action in this film, not until the last 15 minutes. Its a film that has more intellectual content than action so keep that in mind if you're hoping to see a popcorn film. This is not a popcorn film. Thank goodness for that!Final rating- 8/10 Beautiful. Haunting. Poignant.P.S. If you're not familiar with the original film, you might not enjoy this film as much.",8,5,13,5 October 2017
Angels & Demons," Better as a movie, rather then a book!
","I went to the Midnight showing Thursday night with a curiosity I haven't felt since the DaVinci code. Although the DaVinci code is a better book than film, Angels and Demons is just the opposite, directed and paced perfectly with a blend of action, mystery, and academic researching. Unlike Ron Howard's take on DaVinci code, this story was better in film form because it was concentrated and compressed superbly in the Screenplay.The acting by Tom Hanks was light years ahead of his performance in DaVinci. He had some emotion behind his work, and the direction helps the actors too. Everyone was great here, especially Ewan McGregor playing an Scottish version of the Camerlengo perfectly, and straight out of the book! He was soft spoken and powerful at the same time. Supporting cast was decent enough, including a bigger formidable menace in the villain who was far more intimidating then Silas was.I loved the cinematography, and it's the best in cinema history although limited in large exterior shots, besides St. Peter's square. The set combined with real locales made this film seem like a vacation to Rome.As for the academic research, I can honestly say this film is accurate in my mind, being fascinated by the material. It's based on many facts and some theory and so it is easy to decide for yourself what the truth is. And what is probably just Dan Brown's theory. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a serious movie goer. It's a 2 1/2 hour film that feels less then that, a 9/10 score.(Minor Spoilers) *Fans of the books: Be prepared for some twists!",9,6,12,15 May 2009
10 Cloverfield Lane," Could have been so much better.
","(Some spoilers included)I went to see 10 Cloverfield Lane after reading a tweet from the great Stephen King, who expressed his love for this film on Twitter. I didn't read any reviews before going because I felt that didn't need to;--after all, the master of horror said he enjoyed it and so it had to be worth the nine bucks right?. Well, after leaving the theater, I was a bit disappointed and wished I would've waited for the rental. If King happened to like the film, it's probably because 10 Cloverfield Lane borrows heavily from Mr. King's own stories, including 'Misery' and 'The Mist.' However, unlike those two masterpieces, 10 Cloverfield lane was a bit anti-climatic, because I never cared for any of the characters. And the ending wasn't as ambiguous as I was hoping it would be. I was hoping for an ending like in the movie, 'The Mist,' a film that I re-watched a dozen times searching for clues that would lead to a definitive answer. 10 Cloverfield Lane gives you no food for thought, and leaves nothing open to interpretation for the viewer's imagination.On the bright side, most of the film was absolutely thrilling to say the least. John Goodman gives a memorable performance and I found myself liking him and hating him at certain points in the story. The other leads were okay, but lacked urgency in many scenes. The story-telling was brilliant for the most part, doing an excellent job at misdirection, raising many questions, and making me guess a whole lot, but I wouldn't say this story had any major plot twists like you'd get in an M. Night Shyamalan or Hitchcock story.I expected that the writers of this film were taking a page from greats such as Hitchcock, Serling, Shyamalan, and King, but they only tried to. This film is just short of great, but I find it hard to call it a waste of time. Like I said, I did love the performance by Goodman, and I was intrigued for most of the film;--but only to be let down in the end.6/10. I enjoyed most of it, but I don't think I'll watch for a 2nd time.",6,2,5,13 March 2016
Ali," The Greatest? not quite, but a very good movie.
","Micheal Mann is a favorite of mine. His quick cutting, intense movie directing really makes movie watching fun. Ali is a film with top notch acting, with Will Smith proving that he is an established one. No body could of portrayed Ali any better. I would give him an oscar for this performance without any doubt. Jamie Foxx was hilarious and this is a breakthrough role for him. His stock went up after delivering a very good performance. John Voight's transformation into Howard Cosell was amazing. He talked and looked just like him. So your not a big Ali fan? then you might be dissapointed with this film. Micheal Mann intended the audience to already know about the greatest boxer of all time. If you expect to see many of Ali's fights then you might be dissapointed. This movie is intended to give the audience a perspective of his life out of the ring and all the drama he went through. After the 3 hr's is up, i respected Ali more than I ever did. The movie was slow paced, they should of showed more bouts, including the Joe Frazier battles, all of them, because after all that was Ali's number one rival. Overall a very good movie, with very good acting and directing, and a good script. *** 3 stars",Null,0,1,11 February 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Excellent film that is hard to dislike
","This movie did not catch my eye at first, but after the first 15 minutes of watching, I realized that this film was different and unique and very easy to watch. Of course, Speilberg's direction and pacing was great, and even though it was a long film, it never got boring, and it never dragged. The acting was superb, Tom Hanks is always Phenomenal. Christopher Walken is one of my favorite actors, and shows why in this film. He is Hollywood's most underrated, and Leo was his usual self, never steals the show but has enough to bring character's to life. I think this is one of the best films of the year and should not be missed. The only thing I had a problem with was the dialogue, It wasn't bad but could of been more interesting, I kind of felt the screenplay was rushed, and not as true as the real story actually is. Overall a great film, i rate it ***1/2 stars out of 4",Null,0,1,21 June 2003
Spartacus," The best sword and sandal flick.
","Yes, thats correct, my favorite out of all the movies of this genre. This movie served as the blueprint for movies such as, Braveheart, and Gladiator. Those movies had something in them that came out of Spartacus one way or the other. However, the Direction in this movie was of course by the legendary Kubrick, and when he directs, the acting is always great. This movie has no happy endings, its sad but uplifting. It is a dark fictional story with amazing sets, hundreds of extra's that fill up the screen make this the most realistic of all the movies. Gladiator was great but it was more comic book like. Braveheart was great also but it didn't come close to the movie that set the standard, and that's Spartacus. BenHur is the only movie that is better. 4stars ****",8,0,1,8 May 2002
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Review from a die-hard Resident Evil fan...
","Of the video games! I played every Resident Evil game, and more than once. I can honestly say that the reason I score this film so high is because I saw it in 3D. I was totally blown away by the technological aspects of this film! But; 3D aside, it was still a large production, and larger than all three films preceding it.Milla Jovovich is one of the best female action hero's ever. She is born for these roles, and also can act! Ali Larter was not as gripping and emotional in this film, but they still make a good team. I really think they are friends off=camera.Lets face it, the Resident Evil films were nothing like the video games. RE2 was probably the closest, because it was more of a horror film than Sci-fi. The games were like that, closer to horror with a touch of Sci-fi. Instead, the movies are the opposite, not excluding this 4th installment. I wonder...what does Resident evil have to do with the Matrix? or Equilibrium? Nothing if you ask me, but still, a rather impressive film nonetheless. Afterlife makes the effects in the Matrix feel like yesteryear. I actually had to take off my 3D glasses at times! Still, I would trade it all away for the nostalgia of the games, the Gothic and creepy sets; the Mystery; Umbrealla Corp and their motives; The scarcity of ammo; the psychological aspects of the Zombies, reading about what they were going through during transforming; and finally the soundtrack. I loved the Electronica soundtrack in this film but would gladly trade it away for the excellent creepy soundtracks of the video games.Fans of the games won't be too disappointed. I was a little, since it had no plot at all. It was just eye candy to me, but some pretty sweet candy at that! So if you like roller-coasters, then you will like Resident Evil : Afterlife.",7,3,8,17 September 2010

Lone Survivor," Brilliantly directed film
","Peter Berg really did an excellent job at conveying a sense of isolation in the atmosphere of this film. Coupled with great cinematography, excellent performances and great action (albeit exaggerated) you have one of the best war films ever made... despite the low budget.The camera never leaves the pinned down Americans most of the time and that gave me a very claustrophobic feeling as I watched this film this morning. All the action was shown in the perspective of the main characters and just like them, you didn't know when the next bullet was going to be fired, or the next rocket launched.Unlike films like Black Hawk Down, Lone Survivor was a bit more personal and even more emotional than the Ridley Scott classic. It made me think about karma, and the reward for acts of compassion. And I was in tears by the end of the film. Not many war films choke me up like that. And I can't think of one flaw in the film.Final Rating 8/10. Despite being without flaws, it is a B-movie. I would've rated it higher if I wasn't comparing to the larger war films out there.",8,0,1,29 November 2014
Star Trek," Old fashioned fan who loved it !
","Now let me first introduce myself since I find it necessary to let other Trekkies know that I am a huge Sci-fi fan, and always regarded Trek as the best of all franchises. Besides a few seasons of DS9, I've watched each and every episode of all the other series, as well as reading five Star Trek novels and watching each film dozens of times.This film was a treat, and the best birthday gift I have ever had. I will go into detail as I continue to write this review, but will start off by summarizing it in a few words- SATISFYING and EPIC in scale! Besides some flawed editing and pacing, the direction was tight and JJ is indeed the new Spielberg of our time, or at least will eventually become.Kudos to the writers for sticking to the Star Trek formula. I had to really watch this film twice to appreciate it. After the denial ended after my first trip to the theaters, I realized how easily producers could have messed this film up and they didn't. It's not easy re-booting Star Trek, the last time it happened, we had Roddenberry supervising TNG and DS9. Enterprise wasn't really a re-boot, just an alternate universe so it doesn't count as a re-boot.Star Trek by JJ Abrahms is a re-boot!! Trust me when I tell you. The acting sometimes made me feel as if I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit because of all the Nostalgia but I still laughed and even choked up a bit in some scenes. If anything was missing, it was a bit of the old Trek's ways to make a point about things, and this film wasn't the most philosophical Trek film. However, the plot was very good which involved a re-booting of the entire time-line that I found no problem with. I was perplexed as to why Old Spock would break the prime directive since I don't think he would do that in his prime.The Special Effects were stunning! Nothing groundbreaking, but just lots of it, and on par or better than Battle Star Galactica's effects also by the great ILM company. I was miffed about some little things, like the effects of beaming and warp speed causing a haze around the Enterprise. Speaking of the Enterprise, she wasn't treated with proper respect in this film, maybe we get a director's cut soon? I would like to see scenes from the first trailer, when she is being built.I give this film a 9/10 because it's not my favorite Trek film. I am too old fashioned to put this #1 after just two viewings. But its' up there because of the good writing and performances by all of the cast. I hope the next film will be less of an intro film and more of the Hard Core Trek! Finally, Leonard Nimoy in his cameo role. What a treat!! I was rubbing my eyes and pinching myself, numb with emotion. The Vulcans were really introduced to the world in this film, and it's what propelled this film for me. One of the Best Trek films ever for sure!",9,3,11,9 May 2009
Fury," The war movie that is supposed to be cool
","I liked the film for the most part. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I felt as if the movie needed some more philosophy in it, and more social commentary. Instead, we got more explosions instead.Speaking of the fireworks, David Ayer really knows how to put on a show. This film was a high octane spectacle, and it was beautifully shot, but Ayer is probably a better director than he is a writer. I would hate to call this film mindless, but it was close. Some of the gore in this film was over the top too.Fury is a decent depiction of tank warfare and features some interesting characters with psychological conflicts. However, the only reason I would play this film again is to show off my home theater system.",6,1,4,3 March 2015
Inglourious Basterds," A movie with great scenes, and bad scenes
","I usually spend time reviewing films that I really enjoyed but I feel this film deserves a review because it had some memorable scenes in it. Too bad there were more bad scenes than good ones, but overall a very watchable film and even worth a buy.The film starts off brilliantly, Chapter 1 had some of the finest acting ever, coupled with Morricone melodies to spice up tension. Waltz and Jackson were great and the movie felt serious. After the 1st chapter it turned into a comedy, maybe to take away the shock of the gore in the film, which was just unnecessary. Tarantino should forget about the blood and violence sometimes, he goes overboard with it and ruins the great writing and tense dialogue. Some actors were serious, while some were comedic.Brad Pitt was the latter, he just felt out of place in this film. I loved Kruger's performance, and of course Waltz was great! See this film just for his scenes, he could win an Oscar. The character's had personality, but you really never care for these characters at the same time. Like all Tarantino films, the plot isn't anything too complex. There are no plot twists except for the usual cohesion of his many chapters at the film's climax.Finally, the Directing, which is just like the film. Brilliant at times, bad at times. Old School and New School mixed together. Other than the horrible action scenes at the end, most of the action was good, squibs galore, but good...just campy at times. One thing I love about Tarantino is that he knows how to shoot a long, long scene, with one camera, and from one angle. His dialogue and tension are his strengths, while his plots and character's usually remain shallow.I rate it a 6/10 for it's decent writing and directing. Interesting to see a film that doesn't have that politically correct Hollywood formula, but still taking two steps backward whenever the film shows promise.",7,1,2,13 January 2010
Underworld," An original Vampire/Werewolf movie that does not dissapoint.
","Yes this movie is very unique, and there is no movie like it. It is set in a beautiful, dark and gothic world, with well detailed sets, and even though it takes certain elements from the Matrix, and Blade, it is unique in its own way. First off, the budget was only 30 million. After watching the film, you would think its more like 80 million. The costumes, sets, great stuntwork, wirework, its all here. I also was very impressed by the acting here, especially the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, I hope she is Hollywood's next 20 million dollar actress, she is so talented. I also would like to mention that there is no CGI !! very little Cgi is used in this film. I thought the werewolfs looked great, If your a fan of Aliens, and Pumpkinhead, then take a look at the werewolves in this film. The vampires in the movie appeared to be very weak, and do not follow their legend at all in that they do have reflections, and do grow older in appearance. But hey every vampire movie has its own mythology. I hope They make a sequel to this film, the end shows you that they might make one afterall. I think if they boost the budget a little, a new masterpeice will be born. *** 3 stars out of 4.",7,1,2,8 January 2004
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Star Wars dream come true.
","I rated this film an 8/10, the same rating I gave The Force Awakens, but for different reasons. Rogue One felt more in line with the George Lucas look and tone, and this film served the fans, despite being thin on plot;--it sure was heavy on nostalgia.The first thing that surprised me was just how beautiful and visual this film was. Gareth Edwards is a master of smoke, silhouettes, shadows and action and is a far better visual director than JJ Abrams is. I also thought the pacing of the film was superb, and even though we knew that the rebel alliance would emerge victorious at the end, some of the scenes at the end were very tense! One of the things I hated about The Force Awakens was the musical score. Rogue One's score was pure John Williams. This was a movie that serves the fans. And as a 39 year old Star Wars fan, the darker tone of this film was welcomed.I felt like I was watching a WW2 film with a Star Wars skin. It was pretty brutal at times, minus the blood, especially the ground battles, which were so well choreographed. On the topic of action, Rogue One is Space Opera at its finest. I'm not usually the one for CGI heavy films, but the CGI in Rogue One was so spectacular and well choreographed, that I couldn't possibly complain. This is Industrial Light and Magic's magnum opus! Before I get to the negatives of the film, I'll just say that this film did one thing to me that The Force Awakens did not and that was, bring me to tears. When I saw Darth Vadar at the end do some things, bloody things, I just lost it. I'd rate Rogue One even higher if it wasn't for its thin lot. What the Force Awakens had was a unique, conflicted villain, central characters and a story that raised many questions. But in a sense, those strengths were also the film's weakness because unlike Rogue One, the Force Awakens didn't really leave you with a satisfying ending. Rogue One left me satisfied as the end credits rolled because it had a beginning, middle and end. I just wished it had stronger characterizations.My final word is this;-- I hope Gareth Edwards directs more Star Wars films in the future! Period.",8,2,8,15 December 2016
World War Z," Save your money!
","If you read my reviews, then you will know that I have never rated a film so low on IMDb in all of my years here. But World War Z was just bad on all fronts, and every aspect of what makes a good story/film was lacking in his film.The best part of the film was the opening credits. It featured a collage of news broadcasts, and images of ecological disasters. After the credits, we get nothing but action...which is entirely computer generated. Brad Pitt plays a UN delegate tasked with finding the cure to what is automatically deemed 'a virus' And that basically sums up the plot. There was no human element in this movie, unlike the book, which had some integrity compared to this mess of a film. In this movie, there is no reminder of what it means to be human, and what it takes to survive as a group. All the things that made shows like the Walking Dead great.If you're an action fan, then go see this. You might like the spectacular action, which in my mind, was just comical. There is no gore in the film, so stay away zombie fans. This is not a zombie film at all, the zombies were all CG, there was no gruesome make up effects, there is no explanation of what the virus did the brain, no explanation of how Brad Pitt found out about the cure....other than super intuition. It's downright silly. Never in my life was there a time when I went to a theater and found more people laughing at a zombie film before. If you want to see a great zombie film, watch 28 Days Later or the more recent 'Warm Bodies'",1,19,38,29 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Different sort of Trek, but worthy of the brand.
","Into Darkness shares a lot with the original, after all, it is a re-make, or better yet, a re-imagination of Wrath of Khan. When I first saw Into Darkness, I was a bit miffed at the fact that it felt smaller than Star Trek 2009. Less extras, no cool looking aliens, less sets, BUT, it had more CGI. That doesn't make the film feel...Epic! Nevertheless, Into Darkness was well directed, acted, and scripted...yes, scripted. The plot was simple, no different than the plot in Wrath of Khan. Both films were very different than the previous ones. The Motion Picture (1979) cannot be compared to Wrath of Khan...and Into Darkness cannot be compared to most Trek films either.With that said, I really enjoyed the character driven elements. Loved the Spock/Uhura relationship, the psycho-analysis of Spock and his logic, his conflicting feelings, due to being a human/alien hybrid. It was deep stuff and after the 2nd viewing, I said to myself--it's action heavy, and CGI heavy! So what!? The CGI was fantastic, seeing the enterprise zip around in brand new ILM fashion was a joy. At least the story was engaging enough not to consider it a CGI crap-fest! Overall, worthy of the Star Trek name, even without the Techno-babble, and philosophy.",8,2,6,15 September 2013
The Irishman," An instant classic
","While The Irishman may not be Scorcese's best film it does what many of his films haven't done since Raging Bull; emanating with emotional character drama. Characters die throughout and you may find yourself getting emotional about it. Scorcese does an excellent job at building tension, in his scenes and also as the film progresses from beginning to end. I found myself on the edge of my seat during the Hoffa and Provenzano conversations, and especially in the end, when a meeting was set up to quash a beef, between major characters.At the end of the film we are left with a powerful character drama and study of The Irishman, which is almost used metaphorically as a term to represent the Criminal minded, or the 'Wiseguy,' who are often killed for merely insulting someone with lots of money, and lots of power. It is a film about what an overdeveloped sense of pride can do to a human being, often resulting in their demise, whether it'd be their career, job, or in the case of Gangsters, their lives.While The Irishman may not have as many memorable scenes as Goodfellas, Casino, and Gangs of New York, it does what many of Scorcese's smaller films did, like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, and that is tell a very emotional story. The Irishman, just like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, are not only the titles of those movies but also representations of the same archetypes that have enthralled us in Scorcese's films.",9,1,4,30 November 2019
Creed," Beautifully shot, well acted, but a flawed script.
","Creed was exciting from start to finish, and to quote a line from the film, 'you belong here!' Creed does indeed belong in the Rocky saga. It was a passionate film, directed by a young passionate film-maker named Ryan Coogler, who happens to be much more talented with his directing ability than his writing, but I'll get to the script's flaws later. First and foremost, the fight scenes in this film are amazing and some of the best you'll ever see. The final showdown in the end was brilliantly edited and cut, and there was some noticeable influences from The Raging Bull too. There was also a fight in the middle of the film that was absolutely brilliant. This particular fight was shot entirely on a single take without any cuts. And it wasn't just a one round fight either. I don't think I've ever seen that done in a boxing movie and this single take method was very effective at creating tension.Action aside, the the urban cinematography was as good as John Avildon's work on Rocky and Rocky 5, and many scenes were shot on some of the very same streets from those films. Unlike Rocky Balboa, and many other sequels, this film had a somber tone throughout. And it didn't have that comic book, campy, superhero vibe to it like so many of the sequels had. There were some instances in the end that were very exaggerated and illogical but for the most part, the film maintained a very serious tone. Homages to Rocky's patented training sequences were cool to watch too, and the soundtrack will surely please Rocky fans, as well as hip- hop fans too. However, I would not say that this film is as good as the original Rocky, its not even close. Creed is a boxing movie, and Rocky was a movie about humanity. Creed had bits and pieces of lectures here and there, about overcoming one's demons, but it was an action movie at its core.I will guarantee that every one will be pleased by the lead performances. Stallone was superb as a lonely and somewhat depressed man who was beginning to give up on life. He was tired; tired of the bad stuff on the news, tired of being lonely, and tired of having nothing left to fight for. As for Michael B. Jordan, I thought he had excellent chemistry with Stallone, both really made the most of what was a rather formulaic script at times. It wasn't really the best script in a Rocky movie and its clear that the plan is to make more sequels because many of the story's sub-plots never developed or had closure. It's unfortunate too because one subplot was very emotional.Final score is a 7. I'd give it a higher score if I wasn't comparing it to the other Rocky films but it was definitely much better than the last Rocky film!",7,2,11,26 November 2015
Terminator Salvation," A confused film at times
","I don't know how I'm going to review this film. I should compare it to the others, but I would never compare this film to the three that preceded it. But let me give a brief summary on the first 3 before I review Terminator Salvation.The first Terminator film was the ultimate mystery chase film. The robot was a mystery, who revealed his true self little by little as his flesh began melting off during the course of the film. The audience just didn't know what to expect until the great finale.The 2nd Terminator film was as good as action movies get. Real stunts, epic production, and intelligent ideology to compliment the fantastic action and character development. T2 will always stand alone as the best.The 3rd film was lacking something, but it was very well written and acted. Arnold played the role very well in this film. It was solid, full of great action, even though it didn't have the emotions of T2.But as for T4 (Salvation)....I'm just at a loss for words. I loved some things, and hated some. First and foremost, the things I liked about it- Atmosphere. Loads of it. Great production for this film, even better than T2. The film was reminding of me some video games I've played such as the Half Life games, and Fallout games. There were some scenes that McG filmed very well, reminding me of Children of Men at times. The sense of chaos was felt in some scenes, and mystery, not knowing if the characters would survive the assault of various machines that could be very sneaky at times, causing me to jump here and there.Now, the things I hated. Quite simply; the PG-13 rating. The movie started out as a grim tale of survival. And the action was way too unreal. It became too far fetched and took away from the realism.John Conner. He was a complete waste. Forget Christian Bale's boring performance, it was the way the character was written that sucked. Poor Bale, such a fine actor, stuck in the shoes of a poorly written character. The guy yelled the entire film, whether trying to convince military characters to change their plans, or even in plain conversations, always yelling. And the leadership we all heard about was not evident at all. The guy was just trying to survive like the rest of humanity, there was no leadership besides his ranting on his daily radio show which was as motivating as a speech given by Mayor Bloomberg.Arnold's cameo. The only time the audience cheered in the theater. For all 10 seconds of it! Thats about it.The story in general. I'm a Battlestar Galactica fan and to me, this story presented in this film was for kindergarten kids compared to the depth of a series like BSG which has similar messages as Terminator films.The ending. Not going to spoil anything, but I'm just going to say that it reminded me of the first Terminator, except...the first film scared the hell out of me! 6/10 . Above average production, but the rating hurts it. This franchise belongs in the R category, and if it wasn't for the latest Star Trek film, I'd probably have no more faith in Hollywood anymore.",6,1,3,21 May 2009
Aquaman," Great art direction, cinematography, fight choreography and characterizations!
","Aquaman sets a new benchmark and standard for Superhero films on an aesthetic level. The art direction in this film was absolutely mind blowing! The costumes, sets, locales, CGI, was unlike anything seen outside of Game of Thrones. This film was not only immensely epic in scope but it works on a dramatic level, which was something I often wondered about before arriving at the theater. It did not disappoint.This is why I read pulp fiction and love Superhero films. This is not Deadpool. It's deeply spiritual and emotional and most importantly, relatable. Lots of social commentary in this film regarding real world issues, having to do with the destruction of the environment and pollution of the planet. And even Arthur, as super as he is, is very relatable in this film, written as a rather reclusive, depressed, underachiever archetype that all people will relate too. The DC motto was regarding their heroes was always that it's not about DNA or blood, but what people do that makes them heroes and nothing more. Aquaman is the poster boy for the alien hybrid, or fallen angel, whose Earth blood balances out his alien blood, making him more suitable for the throne than full blooded Atlanteans, who are can be too ruthless at times.This is supposedly an origin film but I had wished for more flashbacks. Perhaps another ten minutes of young Arthur could have fleshed out his relationship with Vulko, who I absolutely loved. William Dafoe played an excellent, even headed mentor to young Arthur Curry. Fans of Aquaman will be very happy and fans of stories like King Arthur will absolutely adore the neo myth of the Aquaman universe!James Wan, I am officially a fan. I am not sure how this could be the same director as those horror films. If you love long take action scenes, beautiful wide angles, and action choreography then brace yourselves. So many films today feature chaotic action with no sense of wow factor. This film felt like a roller coaster ride that I wanted to jump back into immediately after it ended.I can't end this review without talking about the art direction again...it is Oscar worthy. This film was like one big Romanesque painting. The makeup, costumes, the design of the Atlantean ships and technology, all looked absolutely gorgeous and this film is clearly a product of passionate filmmaking. Of course, all of this is nothing without a good emotional story with characters you care about and it truly was a touching story. Some of the comedic stuff felt out of place but never ruined tension. It got better and better as it went on and the 3rd act was very tense! Aquaman was always my 2nd favorite superhero film and is no longer underrated thanks to James Wan, who did it!",9,2,5,21 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Corny and no where near as good as the first film
","This isn't comedy. It's crass, trash writing laden with gratuitous cursing and perverted profane one liners. Not funny at all. I did not laugh once at this waste of a film. I shut if off at the 45 minute mark, it's the dumbest film I've ever seen.",5,3,5,17 February 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," It's a comedy! And I'm not complaining
","My analysis of Thor Ragnarok. (spoilers)The recent installation of Thor was a bit more lighthearted than the previous films, which had more of a serious tone to them. Normally I would complain but I got a few laughs and there was enough substance to the plot, especially the part about Norse mythology.In the film, Odin tells Thor that the time of the Gods are over. And that their reign was largely based on a sham, and that their religion was made up, in order to cover up darker truths about their history....which includes the covering up of Ragnarok, who is just a renamed devil in this movie, complete with horns and fiery breath.Without giving too much away, the coming of Ragnarok is a Norse prophecy of apocalypse. Ragnarok's return led to the freeing of Hela, Thor's sister and daughter of Odin, breaks free from her prison with an army of undead. Yes, there's zombies in a Thor film now! But I'm not complaining. This awakening force of nature will eventually lead to the destruction of Asguard.When Thor realizes that he, and the Hulk and a few other of his friends are powerless to stop Ragnarok from happening, he comes to realize that it was never meant to be stopped...and you can't stop prophecies. The plot isn't the most intricate or dramatic, but the strength of this film comes from the interchange between the cast, who are beaming with charisma. Even the Hulk is charming in this film...yes, that's right, a charming, funny Hulk. Last but not least; the soundtrack was brilliant. It reminded me of Tron Legacy, in that this film felt like a Synthwave musical.",8,11,19,8 November 2017
The Prestige," Prepare to pay attention to every detail...the film is a trick in itself..
","Prepare for non-linear, plot twisting writing. The film is shot in a 3 act fashion which is the secret formula to a great film whether non linear or shot in order. The acting was superb and the character development fully fleshed out all the characters most importantly Bale and Jackman as two competitors in show business in Vicorian era London where the beautiful costumes and set design transport the viewer there in the middle of early metropolitan media hyped civilization. Sometimes a showman is in the business strictly to hear the applause of a crowd, to feed the ego. A showman will go to desperate lengths to be # 1 on the billboard charts or in this case invent the best magic trick in a time when magicians were as popular as pop singers and rock stars. But what if the magic trick is not magic as we know it. Magic is a trick. But real magic is science.The film is not a realistic revenge drama/mystery. I suggest you walk into the theater prepared to see a Science Fiction film. The movie can deceive you into thinking it's a serious factual film. The film is never boring though. To me at least being a huge Twilight Zone and Star Trek fan. The characters really hate each other, and you feel their envy, hatred and jealousy in every scene. The only problem with the film is that it shifts from realistic revenge drama to a long twilight zone episode after the midway point, which can cause some audiences to be let down or disappointed . Love it or Hate it film. But it's not easy disregard the smart script, off guard plot twists, and great acting. Spiritual religious people and Science fans will love the story because of the hope we get from realizations that humanity can achieve when all the bad emotions are tucked away. Science heals and science kills, but it all depends on the soul of the man who controls the science. 3 1/2 stars. 7/10.",8,1,2,23 October 2006
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's worst film, but still watchable
","I did laugh a handful of times. There was also some decent dialogue other than the witty banter but only some. Compared to Quentin's other films, The Hateful Eight was mindless. I wonder if the leaked script had something to do with this mediocre writing effort. And when I say mediocre, I mean mediocre when compared to Quentin's other films.The violence felt gratuitous and so totally unnecessary. None of the characters were really on screen long enough to like or hate for that matter...and so don't expect to root for or against anyone in this film. On the bright side, I thought this film was excellently directed. The old Tarantino formula returns here, and I always enjoyed his stage play style of film-directing. Overall a 6/10. I liked it, but I don't think I'll be watching this one again. Then again, I always say that about Tarantino films and I always wind up watching them again!",6,0,7,22 January 2016
We Were Soldiers," A good movie, but far from great.
","I expected this film to be a lot better than it was, but I guess I could say it dissapointed me. The movie was a tribute to vietnam war veterans, and that is something they truly deserve. I thought Full Metal Jacket and Platoon were better than We Were Soldiers, but that doesnt mean the movie was bad. It's just that it paled in comparison to those two classics. However I thought it was better than the Deer Hunter and Apocalypse now. It was more emotional, and Mel Gibson was at his best in this film. I liked the way he portrayed Col. Moore as a good man with a heart, who represented the bravery of all who served in nam. God bless the veterans who served in this war. Definatly in the top ten list as far as war flicks go, but not better than Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan. The b plot in the movie was about the soldiers wives, and it came at the wrong moments in the film, during battle scenes, and that took away the feeling of being on the battle field with the soldiers. But I still give the movie *** stars. Definatly worth having in my collection.",Null,0,1,3 March 2002
The Town," Solid story, but not a character driven one.
","I heard a lot of great things about The Town, both from friends and critics here on IMDb and so I had great expectations for this one when I popped the DVD in. I wasn't entirely let down, but wondered why I found myself forgetting the film right after wards. I didn't want to discuss it right away, it wasn't boring, but still felt like something was missing. But, the film isn't entirely forgettable because I am after all; writing a review on it.Reasons why the film has it's merits, is in the action, and script. Affleck sure knows how to put together a story. He's a proved script writer with his gold statue and it's his strong point. His directing and acting however, could use work. I would have liked him to cast someone else in the lead role. He can do well in a supporting job, but never once did he steal a scene. And it's not because He's a bad actor. It's because he isn't convincing as a villain, there's just something angelic about him. In my opinion, he was miscast in this film, he should have cast someone else. When the lead actor doesn't fit or act his way into the role written for the character, the good script could wind up being meaningless. It's hard to find the energy to direct and jump into scenes, and it showed here. Ben was just lacking energy I thought. Luckily, the supporting cast was excellent, especially the 'Wild man' Jeremy Renner. He put a lot of energy into his role. I also loved the job Blake Lively did, she has just gained a fan. Everyone else also did a decent job, but nothing that sticks with you.The directing was OK, found myself wondering why there were some scenes in the film, and why the timing of some scenes also appeared off. This is no directorial masterpiece by far. But once again, this negative is off set by the great cinematography, in which I loved.Oh, and the action. This should have been an action movie, and less of a character drama. It would have been better off if Ben wrote it that way, but nonetheless, worth a watch. It is an old school action film which is refreshing, but in this high tech time we live in, old school films should have more of an emotional impact like 'State Of Grace' That film is a classic, not sure if The Town compares to it. Or even 'The Departed' for that matter. Nevertheless, a solid rating because I just think it still belongs along those 2 films in the same breath at least.",7,0,1,21 December 2010
Suicide Squad," A lot of people are going to connect with these characters!
","Suicide Squad is a story about redemption. The anti-hero formula is becoming a popular trend lately in literature and cinema, and even though it didn't work for Superman, it really works for these guys because they didn't start out good. The reason why you root for the Suicide Squad is because they feel guilt; and they really seem to want to atone for their sins.Will Smith absolutely stole this movie as Deadshot both for his dramatic scenes and action ones. I was surprisingly brought to tears on several occasions because of his performance and story arc. Even is action scenes were the best. One of the disappointments I had while watching this film was in the action department because there weren't any jaw dropping scenes like you got in Civil War or even BVS for that matter. However, Deadshot kicked ass! My next favorite thing;--Margot Robbie. Oh baby, she was a maniac in this movie, and I was surprised at the passion she brought to this role. There were many instances however, when she was used for comic relief and it I found that it really offset the otherwise serious tone of this film. Her best scenes were when she got serious and rallied the crew. Loved her, absolutely looked, sounded and acted like the Harley Quinn from the cartoons. Brooklyn accent was SPOT ON!The 3rd standout was Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. I found myself rooting for this guy, despite his degree of villainy and his dark past. There's a lesson to be learned from him in that we can all grow from past mistakes. Each of the members of Task Force X AKA Suicide Squad will leave you rooting them for one reason or another, as we are given glimpses of their dark pasts in many flashback scenes throughout the film. But all in all, great chemistry between the characters, especially between Deadshot and Rick Flag.Enchantress, the villain in this film, without giving away too much, is kind of a representation of each character's own inner torment, one they have to overcome in order to redeem themselves and grow as people. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the main villain in this movie, and many would've preferred the main villain to be Joker, but I didn't mind. I thought the villain and villains added a spiritual aspect to the plot. In a sense, the main villain represented each member of the Suicide Squad's dark past.Now, the cameos. DC fans...be ready! I know you're expecting Batman, and his scenes were pretty bad-ass. But be ready for more Justice League members to kick some ass. That's all I'll say! And if anyone thinks Jared Leto is rehashing Heath Ledger, be ready to be proved wrong. Leto really made this Joker his own. He was hip, sexual, burnt out, and just sick! And I do admit with a shame face, that I was rooting for him in the end.If I had to nitpick though, it would be in the editing department. This film is another example of a director's art being mutilated by the studio for the sake of greed. There were some really choppy editing issues in the middle of the film, and I heard that a lot of film was cut. I am starting to think that studios force directors to cut their films so that a director's cut may be released, increasing the amount of rentals, Blu-ray and digital purchases. A lot of people, including myself, felt that the Joker felt out of place in this film. He had nothing to do with the plot at all, but yet, he was so brilliantly played by Jared Leto, that many longed for more of his screen time nonetheless.I hope a director's cut will be released. Perhaps the Joker might matter a bit more because of it. All props to David Ayer though, for creating an eerie atmosphere in this film, that was clearly inspired by the Arkham Video games. The entire 2nd half of the film took place during the course of one night, in parts of the city were evacuated so that the Suicide Squad could deal with the threat in secret. It really felt like I was watching a live-action Arkham City video game. DC fans will eat this movie up. And judging by the cheers at my theater, non-comic fans will too. 9/10. Not a classic piece of film making by far, but a gem of a comic book film!",8,4,9,4 August 2016
Taxi Driver," DeNiro's second best performance of all time.
","Haunting, chilling, disturbing, and simply great film making. For a low budget film, Taxi driver delivers, and only a great director in Martin Scorsese can accomplish that. Robert DeNiro steals the show, his portrayal as a vietnam vet who slowly loses his mind due to the terrible things he witnesses day in and day out. He can't sleep, and everything seems to bother him, especially Newyork City's dark, hell on earth atmosphere which is actually the way it was back in those days. I almost felt as if i related to DeNiro's character personally in this film. I myself sometimes get so fed up with politics and drug dealers and pimps abusing young prostitutes, the crime, etc. Newyork is always exaggerated as a hopeless hell on earth in Scorsese films, but it is a very stressful place to live in and It could be depressing at times. (but i love it here too much, and will never leave) but besides that, this movie so great, DeNiro was only better in one film (the Raging Bull) in my opinion he was at his best in that movie, the way Pacino was in Scarface and the Godfather. Also, the soundtrack in this film is haunting and adds to that psychotic feeling that is going on in DeNiro's head as the movie progresses. Overall i rate this a 10 out of 10 **** 4 stars",10,0,0,6 February 2002
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel's best film since Iron Man 1
","CA3 The Winter Soldier is the first Marvel film that I felt compelled to see in the theater since Avengers. I heard a lot of good things about it, and so in the midst of my curiosity, I grabbed my umbrella and traveled in a rainstorm just to go see it, hoping I wouldn't waste $11, and hoping the film would be worth soaking my boots for.I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. This film was tightly written, tightly paced, and had less camp than most of the Marvel Studio films as of late. Sure, the Marvel humor popped up out of nowhere, but it wasn't over done and cheesed up. This film had just enough plot driven and character driven elements, and makes for a mature, political conspiracy thriller that even mature audiences would enjoy. After just 5 minutes into the film, I knew that this film was a different animal than the first Captain America film. High production aside, the acting and directing were way better, and most of all--it made Captain America much more likable and appealing than the first film.The action scenes were superb, and this is the way Captain America SHOULD have been depicted in not only his debut film, but in Avengers as well! Not since The Terminator have I been awed by a super-human's physical prowess. The choreography and stunts in this film are second to none. Outside of Asian Kung Fu flicks, this film takes the cake when it comes to hand to hand combat. A lot of real stunt men, real car crashes, equals a formula for success.Now I docked a few stars because I'm rating it in comparison to other superhero films. After leaving the theater, I didn't feel the same buzz that I felt when I saw Man of Steel or The Dark Knight films. And it wasn't as emotional as the Spider Man films. And so...a 7/10.",8,0,2,7 April 2014
Interstellar," One of the top 5 science fiction films of all time.
","Science Fiction films are rare these days, extremely rare. I know that's hard to believe, given the fact that we are in a super-hero golden age, but when you think about it, most sci-fi these days are fantasy films. The new Star Trek films included. Interstellar is a rare science fiction film, because the plot is built around the science fiction itself. Studiers of Quantum Physics will absolutely devour this film! The visuals bring me back to Kubrick's 2001. Instead of CGI, Christopher Nolan decided to use models for the space craft just like Kubrick did in 2001 when he paved the way for sci-fi films, including George Lucas' Star Wars. The results are stunning, and Interstellar is space opera at its finest. When you couple haunting visuals with outstanding sound mixing and Hans Zimmer's masterful score, you just might forget to blink!I will say however, that I was rather disappointed with the art direction in this film. The ships were okay looking, both inside and out, and the settings on the alien planets didn't wow me. But I'm not sure they were supposed to. They were supposed to be Earth-like planets after all.I can't say enough about the acting, it was absolutely brilliant all around, and by every part of the cast. Did I even mention Nolan's editing? I would rather call him a film editor 1st and a director 2nd. He's the best at pacing films, with his patented style of quick cutting scenes. But this is expected of Nolan. What I did not expect was the sentimental parts of the story. Nolan's biggest weakness is usually his inability to implement human elements in his stories, but that is not the case with Interstellar. This was a story of a father's logical thinking, clashing with his emotional thinking. It was very dramatic.As unique as this film was, there were some influences from 2001, mostly in the visual department. I also thought that it borrowed some plot devices from Apollo 13. Still, in the end, Interstellar is one of the most innovative science fiction films in decades. A dying planet. Humanity at a precipice. And a story based around the almost religious theory of direct panspermia. I also was surprised to see a supernatural element in the story. As a science fiction writer myself, I know how difficult it can be to bridge the gap between scientific theory and the mystical. And Christopher Nolan managed to do exactly that. He took the science fiction genre and made it his own! The film might not be the ground breaking film that Kubrick's 2001 was, but it still sets a standard!",9,3,11,17 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Unoriginal end to an unoriginal trilogy with characters difficult to care about.
","I think Star Wars stories about Jedi and Sith should always consist of a similar plot, which is; to tell a story that is centered around the prospect of whether or not a force sensitive person will rise or fall. However, the story needs to flesh out their characters or it will not end up as a climatic one.The problem with the third trilogy is that we never got to see why our main characters suffered from their demons. We never got to see the traumas they went through, we only heard about them, and were rarely depicted on screen. We never saw Rey struggle as an orphaned child, feeling neglected, unworthy, and low. We never got to see Kylo Ren struggle as an overconfident young man, feeling disrespected, like we did Anakin do in the first 3 episodes. We were only told about the very things that gave Kylo and Rey their demons but we were never riding along the characters on their life long journey.This is why this trilogy fails. It's because the characters were not fleshed out and too much screen time was wasted on other things beside character development. This already tried plot driven story about a hero's journey would be okay if we witnessed what caused all the character conflict, but we were only told about it and never got to feel it. The story in these 3 films was so conservative and unoriginal too. Kylo was basically another Anakin, Rey another Luke, and Luke another Obi-Wan. This trilogy was a rehash of the first trilogy and I will end this review by saying I miss you George Lucas!",8,4,16,20 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great eye candy...but thats about it
","I have been a Star Wars fan ever since 1983, when Return of the Jedi came out. I was 6 yrs old at the time and I was hooked ever since. I saw the previous 2 movies after that, and what great movies they were. Those movies had chemistry between the actors and the result was that Star Wars magic. Now George if your reading this somehow, listen carefully. Using your huge budget to create a film of this magnitude is very entertaining, and a treat for the eyes, but please retire as a director George. You can't direct pal. Maybe you can cyber direct on a computer, editing and cutting out pictures and scenes, but you cant get the most out of your actors,  the guys who directed the original trilogy did.In AOTC, I did not laugh once. C3PO and R2 had once decent scene but their limited screentime is due to the fact that George had to showcase his cgi's in terrible scenes like that Diner scene. EWWWWW!!!!bad. Special affect's are nice but nothing beats a good ol cheap mini set of a Millenium Falcon cockpit with Han getting on Leia and C3PO annoying the hell out of them with his nagging, squabbling and yelling with Chewie grunting in the background resulting in me laughing my butt off. Where's that Star Wars Magic George? Well, The Phantom Menace didnt have it and Attack of the Clones sure didnt. I was impressed though, a few scenes were jaw dropping, and I must admit Hayden Christiansen, stole the show by far. It was nice to see how crazy he is becoming and how in one scene in particular, was the best in the movie I think, where he explains and admits to Padme how crazy he acted. I thought that scene had the most emotion. The movie drags a bit after that. Obi-wan played by Ewan McGregor was a success also. He spends the whole time playing detective trying to find out who is planning on killing Senator Amidala. Decent Plot twists though, much, much better than episode 1. I loved the ending, not the colisseum scene, where dozens of jedi confused the hell out of me, not knowing who is who, and not caring who got killed or survived. Mace Windu? cool character, I didn't even notice it was Samuel Jackson playing him. That was Mace Windu, he is now an official Star Wars Character. Yoda? dissapointed me because he was a CGI. George, bring him back as a puppet dammit! yes I loved the fight scene where Yoda showed the world why no one ever messed with him, but use the puppet in the other scenes where it didnt require you to have him computer generated. Their was few space battle scenes as well, and the duels in the end didnt come close to the duel at the end of episode 1, with Darth Maul duking it out with Obi-wan and Qui-gon. that was the only thing better about Phantom than Clones.  Well episode 3 must have a lot in it because I had many things I expected in this movie that just didnt happen. Please George, if you read this, for the sake of your fans out there, dont direct episode 3!!!
overall I give this movie 3 stars for its great affects , thats all.",7,0,1,17 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," The true meaning of 'part 2'
","Certain sequels have the same movie title with 'Part 2' after it. However some of these movies are completely different films than their predecessors. I beleive the Godfather and Godfather part 2 is the same movie. I read Puzo's book, and the majority of The Godfather pt. 2 is in the book The Godfather. Therefore, it is just a continuation of the story. Pt.2 also used the same exact sets that they used in the original film, (some of the ones used in the streets of sicily) it might of been shot on location, I think they were sets. So as far as the 'second half' of this film goes, I just can't find a film out there that I saw over 20 times, that still gives me goose bumps whenever I watch it over and over. The Godfather flicks still do that. The acting is uncomparable to anything, and Al Pacino and Robert Deniero are just phenomenal in this film. Pacino is just so cold hearted and emotionless in this movie that it boggles me. It is a movie that still puts me on the edge of my seat even though I know Fredo will never see the morning sun after that forgiving hug. **** 4stars out of 4Classic!",9,0,3,23 July 2003
Bird Box," Suspenseful, allegorical film. Darren Aronofsky mixed with M. Night Shyamalan. Social commentary via visual poetry.
","An analysis of the film...and a review-; (SPOILERS AHEAD)This reminds me of They Live. The main character in that film was the 'one who can see.' He went a little crazy...'She opened the door because she liked the feeling of being outside the door.' Jim Morrison! Do you concur? When that guy opened the window and holds the woman's eyes open and asks 'Do you see it?' In the scene, there is the sunlight blaring through the window, shining on her face, in her eyes. It kills her. The light is the truth, and maybe it is also emotion. Reminds me of vampires...the light kills them...vampires have higher senses than humans, just like Vulcans in Trek, but the light is overbearing. Many people shut down and rather not feel and rather not see the light clearly in order to avoid the pain, sadly. 'To become vampire is to heighten all of one's senses.' -Dracula, AKA 'Little Dragon.' The vampire is the failed god/goddess. Fallen angel.Apathy seems to save rather than kill. Ignorance is bliss. I have my days when I shut down but overall I am a truth seeker. I haven spent a majority of my life deciding to take the blindfold off and not hide behind comforting lies. I seek unpleasant truths. We gotta fly from the bird cage. This film is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion. I can't stop thinking...What saves the sighted people is the birds. Nature...the ability to see the beauty of Earth and not be distracted from seeing it. The natural world is where it is safe to take the blindfold off. Masterpiece of a film, 10/10.",9,3,11,29 December 2018
Watchmen," Spiritual and motivating film depicting superheroes as gods
","I am a science fiction author and the timing of this film couldn't have been better. I am currently working on a superhero story and after watching this spectacular film, I find myself going back to the drawing boards because the stories are very similar.Enough about that, lets talk about this phenomenon. It is groundbreaking film directing and Zack Snyder is now officially a genius. After watching 300, I gave most kudos to his video editing software, but now it's official, he is the next Kubrick. Big words yes, but coming from a Kubrick fan, and I really mean it.The acting here is good enough to draw you into feeling for the characters. The problem is that there is too many of them, and the film should be a bit longer even though the theatrical cut is long for some. Personally, I would have sat in the theater for another 2 hours. The film gives you great special effects, set design, and most of all atmosphere. Snyder wraps this all together in a package filled with philosophical debate, centered around the nature of humanity and our imminent future. A dark future it is, mostly because we are destroying our planet with primitive energy sources, and if we develop free energy, we might save the planet but destroy ourselves, because humanity isn't mature enough to handle such power.I wanted to talk about the soundtrack, which is excellent. Lots of eclectic music, mixed in with some Rock and Roll. Some bashed the idea of including such popular songs, but I loved the songs and the music adds to the film's emotional scenes. Most of the film is in the past, showing how the watchmen came to an end. Each character gets a backdrop story, and in the end, all the drama intersects and all the characters find their judgment day. Even the all-mighty Dr. Manhattan will face his demons in the end, and proves that even a perfect man is never really perfect and perfection doesn't really exist permanently.I don't recommend children watch this film because of the violence and gore. Some of it unnecessary and I guess Snyder needed to be free with his R rating. I do recommend this to everyone above 18, it's a must watch because people need to keep their brains on when watching a film, not shut them off. If you disagree, go watch the Fantastic Four! 10 out of 10. Groundbreaking visual masterpiece, and a story on par with Clash of the Titans, Jason and the Argonauts, and even the Ten Commandments.",10,1,3,11 March 2009
The Italian Job," Awesome remake, better than the original
","i recently saw the original Italian Job, and liked it, I rented it because I am a fan of the video game and plus the new movie was about to be released. This film was far better than the first, higher budget, clever , well thought out heists that make you say the word WOW, over and over again. The car/boat chase scenes were really good , and man those Mini Coopers (both the new and old model) can help get you through traffic in a flash. Hmmm...makes me think NYC traffic is tough, I'm thinkin about buying one! but to sum it up, Acting was great in this movie, Mos Def is handling his business in hollywood, Wahlberg and Theron team up again in this one, I cant beleive how long it takes him to put a move on her already!! She is #1 on my list as far as beautiful actresses go. Great movie, awesome settings, direction and originality. *** 3 stars out of 4",Null,0,0,17 June 2003
Justice League," Perhaps not the best DC film, but by far the COOLEST!
","(Major spoilers ahead) Justice League may not be the best DC film but it sure is the coolest of them all and I believe it is the epitome of what a comic book film should be. A good blend of darkness and camp, comedy and philosophy;-inspiration, and loads of eye candy. The action scenes were fantastic, which I'm sure is to be expected in a Justice League film, but what about the other components of the movie? The ones that DC fans were all worried about?Well, I'll start off by talking about the plot, which many critics have deemed as simple. On the outside it appears that way but many of these characters are used symbolically, especially Superman and Steppenwolf. Superman was beacon for humanity, he represents the hope people have that people need to climb out of despair. After his death, hope for Earth was all but gone, giving rise to the awakening of Steppenwolf, a symbol of Fear and a destroyer of civilizations. Steppenwolf, basically a reiteration of a devilish figure, was the culprit of the falling of several civilizations in the past, including Atlantis, which if you're familiar with the myth of Atlantis, you'll know that it represents human civilization at its highest peak, both technologically and spiritually. Atlantis' sinking is metaphorical, in that it sank, as in failed, due to misused science and its history is lost and buried. And so Steppenwolf claimed that without Superman (hope) on Earth, Earth is destined to repeat as another fallen human civilization. Our doom is inevitable. And so as Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince set out to recruit the Metahumans they've been watching, encouraging them to climb out of their shells and trying best to restore their faith in humanity. What I loved about the characterizations in this film is that they rely heavily on anti-social behavior. Whether it'd be Aquaman, Cyborg or Flash, all three of those characters were either jobless, drunks, depressed or recluses. Throughout the film, as the team gets together, they seemed to gel pretty well together, as they all come to grips with the reasons why they shut down and lost their faith in humanity and also faith in themselves. There was a touching scene between Bruce and Diana, who I swear, seemed really close to kissing in this movie! Aquaman was very snarky in this film, and Momoa is more than just an aesthetic quality, he is a pretty damn good actor. The Flash was a complete neurotic mess and his comedic lines never felt out of place or took away any sense of urgency. And so despite creating such a formidable team, their attempts to thwart Steppenwolf failed, and after losing a battle, Bruce Wayne realizes that one sure thing will be needed to defeat Steppenwolf (fear), and that is Superman. (hope)The problem is, that he's dead. So how do you bring him back? The same thing that brought Cyborg back from the dead, with a Motherbox. The Motherboxes in this film were representations of technology that could recreate DNA. This story touches heavily on aspects of Transhumanism and the many iterations of superheroes. Whether it'd be Wonder Woman, the old soul, or Aquaman, the man out of time. The Flash, struck by lighting and reborn, and of course Cyborg, a man made superman, who is depicted in a very Frankenstein way in this film. Cyborg warns Bruce that the Motherbox contains the power to write DNA to create humans but it doesn't always get it right, himself being a poster boy for that, in that he considers himself a failed experiment because he has no control of his powers and that his soul is too strong for his body, causing both cellular and nervous breakdown.And so Bruce's idea of stealing Superman's body and using the Motherbox to rekindle his DNA is dangerous and the result could be something monstrous and not the hero we hoped would return from the dead. But there was no other choice. This is when Justice League really takes off, which is right after Superman's resurrection. Superman stole the show in this film, he was so bad ass that he even made Batman smile. The action in this film, at times, got chaotic, but for the most part, the choreography was sound. Wonder Woman had the best hand to hand combat scenes, Aquaman and The Flash looked great in slow motion, and Batman didn't get a duplicate of his awesome warehouse scene from BVS but he was more of a General in this film, sitting back, barking out commands, and letting his technology do the work for him. Visually speaking, this is Zack Snyder's magnum opus. There are scenes that are absolutely gorgeous as the team stood side by side, capes billowing in the wind in slow motion;- absolutely beautifully shot and directed. It's really hard to complain about anything in this film, except that it should've been longer. I thought Superman needed an extra scene after his resurrection, to acclimate and deal with the side effects he was feeling. I was hoping for a little more Hans Zimmer music from previous films. Although I admit, the Danny Elfman score is growing on me and so not many complaints. Even the little things I was hoping to see in the movie, such as Superman using his frost breath and the appearance of Green Lanterns, happened!Final score 9/10. Better than BVS and as heartfelt as Wonder Woman.",8,3,8,16 November 2017
Man of Steel," One of the top 5 best Superhero films ever made
","Strong words, but anyone who appreciates a good action film with a message might agree. The science fiction was fresh, and although a bit bare on the emotional side of things, there was still plenty of heartwarming philosophy in this film.Never have we seen Superman like this; the way he is supposed to be depicted. Henry Cavil is no Christopher Reeve, at least not physically, but he's a pretty damn good actor when it comes to silent body language. This is a Superman who is easy to relate to, even though he seems to impervious to pain and suffering. He just cares. And doesn't use his power for personal aggrandizement...which is something that so few people do in the real world today...a world where absolute power corrupts.Russel Crowe stole the show however, his lines were said in the tone of a great leader, and he bore the carriage of a king. The acting was fantastic throughout, from Lane, to Costner and even Fishbourne.Now when you compare a film like this to lets say...The Hulk...or Captain America, or even the Avengers, one might find that Man of Steel has more substance, more heart, more intelligence for that matter. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that this film even helped change my religion in a sense...even though I was aware of ancient astronaut theory already. Now, for me, this is a powerful film but an esoteric film, and those without a specialized knowledge into the occult and ancient astronaut theory might not appreciate this one as much. 10 out of 10 despite its flaws. My one problem with the film is that the character development went no where in the end, and Superman never was threatened, even though the Earth was. Perhaps they should've had Superman sweat a bit, or even bleed. Nothing thrown in his way seemed to hurt him at all, and that took the urgency out of the situation, at least when it came to his peril, not the Earth's. A little more character driven stuff and less action and this film would've been a masterpiece. I still love this movie to death and it is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite superhero film ever!",10,2,5,29 June 2013
The Village," Quality filmaking.
","Part 1:  Night's 4th film was probably his worst, but still an above average movie. First off all, the acting. The large cast was great, usually Night works with small cast. This time he has more people to direct. Good acting all across the board. His camera work was phenomenal. His trademark still shots, camera's do not move often in some shots, awkward angles, signature reflection off glass shots, remember young Samuel Jackson staring at a TV in Unbreakable? Or the Alien popping up on the Tv in signs? Shyamalan makes a brief appearance in this one too, except he is the one shown in the glass this time. I love how he uses that red color in most of his films. Notabably in the sixth sense. Part 2:  This movie was suspensful of course. Not like Signs but a little more realistic and predictable. I predicted the surprise ending after 1 hour into viewing the film, and also predicted The sixth sense also. Unbreakable was Night's only film that shocked me in the end. Signs was a message movie, and more thought provoking. The funny thing is , I predicted the end of this movie but it was almost as if Night added something more suspenseful in this movie just incase the audience caught on. Not up to par with his previous films, but still an outstanding script, concept, and creation of suspense. An amazing filmmaker!",8,0,0,1 August 2004
The Revenant," The Revenant is a great experience, but not exactly the perfect film.
","Inarritu's directorial style, including the patented long single takes, the lack of music during action sequences, and of course, his choice of camera work, allows for viewers to feel like as if they had just witnessed something real. I came out of the theater feeling like I had just witnessed a video recording of a real massacre, or a real bear mauling and of course, a real journey of a man on a mission--a mission to survive and get revenge on a man who left him for dead. The Revenant is a fantastic experience and felt extremely realistic, but unfortunately, the film fell short in several categories.For a revenge tale, I found it to be a bit melodramatic, and I just didn't have that same emotional attachment to the story like I had with movies such as Gladiator or Dances With Wolves. Don't get me wrong, I loved Tom Hardy's performance, he stole every scene, but a lot of his role was entirely improvised on his part and I heard that he didn't even read the script for this film. As good as he was, I much would've preferred a more complex villain, with a deeper back-story and a deeper personal dynamic with the protagonist. Speaking of the protagonist, I thought DiCaprio was superb, and if he ever wins an Oscar, I'd clap for him because he deserves it not only for his expressive but silent acting, but for his stunts too. Supposedly, Leonardo DiCaprio was actually forced to endure an immersion into an ice-cold freezing river, a real blizzard and he even ate raw meat. He'll be nominated for this role and the film will have garnered many nominations come next month, but I'm not sure it will rack up any wins in the screenplay department. I loved the beautiful Indian proverbs sprinkled throughout the story but it was lacking in character development. All in all, a visceral, cringe-worthy experience, and a movie that I would surely watch again despite being a bit longer in run-time than necessary. I also thought that there was a lot more CGI in the film than I expected, especially when it came to the wild-life. I was hoping to see dozens of horses on the screen at once, a real herd of buffalo, or a real pack of wolves, but there wasn't any. However, despite that minor gripe, I thought the set design, art direction, make-up, props, and the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. Do yourself a favor and watch this film in the theater for the best effect. I give the Revenant an 8 out of 10, two points short of a masterpiece!",7,0,4,11 January 2016
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Great Script won't let down Terminator fans.
","I thought T3 would not be the same because Cameron was not involved. Mostow did a great job of staying close to keeping that Cameron look and dark feel but it wasn't the same.  I asked my self that they better come up with a good script, I thought the last pieces of evidence destroyed in T2? isn't Arnold too old and out of shape for the role? I was not dissapointed. Arnold was as jacked as ever, this is his definitive role and what he's known for and is as good as he was in T2, however he was the best in the original. Writing was excellent. The dialogue was ok, except for the many comedy lines which were uncalled for.      The action never let's up until the greatest old school action  chase scene ends. Yes i did see Matrix reloaded but it was too cartoonish, I hate when movies overuse Cgi, nothing has the feel of 'real' car models and 'real' stunts. I did not move to the edge of my seat until midway point. Critics keep bashing the movie because it set up for a potential T4. Who cares? why not make another movie if you can write a good screenplay like this. It's not possible to dislike great writing unless you like hating on good things.      The acting was superb. Nick Stahl surprised me, did a good job of making you beleive he is an older Ed Furlong. Clare Danes was impressive and basically played a similar role as Linda Hamilton did with Sara Connor. Newcomer Kristanna Loken also did a good job of recreating Patrick's T-1000 role. She wasn't as advanced, she has a metal skeleton but is full of gadgets. I guess the machines realized since the T-1000 failed, they decided to send back a T-X. Why do the humans keep sending old model primitive T-101's to protect Connor? I guess it's because he can relate to humans the most, I guess he is like a machine with a soul.       This movie had to be made. I know Terminator fans would love to see how the machines first start taking over humanity and T3 Rise of the machines keeps the prestige and greatness of the Terminator franchise. Too bad Cameron did not direct it but it's not as big a deal as I thought.  **** stars out of 4.",7,0,0,9 July 2003
Spider-Man," Great!
","This movie was so cool to watch, unlike Blade 2, Spiderman had a great story backed by good acting and I cared for the characters. It was a little emotional too!! I couldnt beleive how great this movie turned out to be! I can't wait for the sequel, I wonder who the new villain will be?? VENOM????? DR.OCTOPUS?? give spidey some new weapons too, he isn't as versatile as Batman is with his vehicles and cool gadgets. Webs and crawling on walls could get boring to watch after 2 movies. But man was Spiderman a classic that stands up to Superman, Batman and the X men flicks.",9,0,0,7 May 2002
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Cinematic brilliance
","Days of Future Past is by far, the best of the X-Men films. I can't recall when a film franchise managed to weave in the past and the present like this before, and even though the writers tried hard to throw in tidbits of info for the sake of continuity, but I can't help but applaud Brian Singer for putting it together in such a seamless manner. Expect to see some cameos too! This is Brian Singer's most beautiful film, and I'm not biting back any words when I say that it truly is a brilliant piece of film-making. The camera-work, the lighting, the vantage points, the use of Slow-Mo, the blur effects during the Charles meets Charles scene...it was just so masterfully done and unexpected. There were some instants where the action was shown from the perspective of old 1970s grainy TV footage, and it seemed as if we were watching real, historical, archived footage that was locked away in some CIA vault! The main cast, as expected was nothing short of brilliant--and I'd like to start with Micheal Fassbander. He stole the show in my opinion, and I also thought McAvoy, and Lawrence had some Oscar worthy, tear-jerking scenes. Besides the fantastic acting by this young, talented trio, they also had the some of the coolest action scenes. There was an airport scene in the film that featured Mystique and McAvoy, and I thought it was amazing--both on an artistic and technical level. I thought Magneto's superpowers were really stretched to a whole knew level in this film, such as the scene where he was disarmed and still fired the gun as it fell...so creative! However, the single best action scene belonged to the character Quicksilver. His scene was absolutely beautifully shot and should be shown in film schools!As for the rest of the cast, they all put in solid efforts. Hugh Jackman made for a good wise-cracker as usual, Stewart and McKellan had their moments, however brief they might have been. I really would have liked to see more Dinklage in this film, and I thought Peter Dinklage did such a fine job at playing a scientist that was deeply concerned with Homeland security. However, his screen-time was sadly limited.Other than that, I really have nothing negative to say about this excellent film, except that it may require multiple viewings for some people who aren't accustomed to Time Travel based science fiction. I myself, am a die-hard Star Trek fan, and so I had no trouble with the complex plot. Just hearing Patrick Stewart say the words-- 'We must go back in time' was worth the price of admission alone, and I can honestly say that this is one of the top 3 best superhero films ever made!",9,1,2,24 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Lights, camera;--action! and...more action...
","Civil War was a blast and a hell of a ride, and even though it wasn't masterful film making, it was a beautiful comic book action film, teaming with coolness and jaw-dropping fight-choreography. However, it lacked something that the 2nd movie had, which in my mind, is the best Marvel film since the first Iron Man. The reason why those movies were so great was because they were paced better; had less characters crammed into the plot.Civil War dragged in the beginning because it treads on a topic that has been way overused in superhero films, and that is, of course, the debate on whether or not Superheroes should operate on their own or with government sanction. The villain in this film was no super villain, and had way too little screen time I thought. I actually thought he was pretty interesting, but seemed to serve as a sub-plot. His motives were unknown for most of the film, but when we found out what they were, I realized that his motives carried a real world gravitas to them, and felt similar to the motives of many of America's real enemies, or more generally speaking, the modern west's enemies, who resort to terrorism usually because their loved ones were killed in wars started by NATO countries;-or in this movie's case, wars started by The Avengers. I wonder how many villains exist out there in the real world, trying to destroy western countries from within. It was pretty frightening to think about.If you took all the Marvel films and viewed them in order, Civil War would be the filler episode. Yes, Black Panther was introduced, and a new Spider Man, but they only convoluted the story. I can't help but wonder how long this movie might had been if you took away all the action scenes. The entire plot could have been compressed into a single episode of Agents Of Shield. Spider Man was hardly relevant in this film. He was thrown into the movie for comedy only, and if he didn't matter enough for me to like him, despite the levity he brought to what was one of the gloomier Marvel stories as of late. Black Panther was fantastic, loved his graceful and unique fighting style, but he deserved to be introduced into the MCU with his own movie first. Black Panther's quest for vengeance was so unwarranted, given the fact that we already knew he was fighting the wrong guy the entire film, and in a sense, he also seemed to know it too, but still fought Bucky despite not having evidence that he murdered his father. Same goes for the new Spider Man. He had no motive to fight other than the fact that he was following Tony Stark's orders, and like Black Panther, they did nothing but make this film feel convoluted. I think my favorite co-stars were Vision and Scarlet Witch, who were the only ones who seemed to have a reason to fight in this movie. Paul Bettany was great as the stoic and wise Vision. Still, a fun film that I may see again. I thought there were way too many jokes during the airport scene, which was beautiful, but lacking in seriousness and tension. Seeing Hawkeye and Black Widow crack jokes as they beat on each other was cringe worthy at times. These are two characters that are so close, that seeing them fight over the reasons they did were just absurd. Nevertheless, the fights were so cool that I just blocked out the audio. On a positive note, the final act fight between Bucky, Cap, and Tony had much more drama, and like I said, was very heart breaking to watch. 7/10",8,5,10,5 May 2016
Pearl Harbor," Bad ratings for this?? you critic's are nuts!
","Pearl Harbor was great. Definatly a classic. Yes it wasn't solely based on the trajedy at Pearl Harbor, the love story thrown in the mix was a good one and it was very authentic. Why did Titanic get such high praises and this movie bad reviews. Titanic was a love story based on a trajedy, and Pearl Harbor is the same. Don't hate on this flick, if you never seen it don't listen to the critics. Bruckheimer produces this, directed my Micheal Bay, two of my favorite's, and this is another classic under their belts. I found it to be very emotional, the bombing scene was a whole other movie within the movie. Probably the best special affects i have ever seen. The acting?? top-notch, the script? great, Randall Wallace is awesome, I have no choice but to give this movie 4 stars ****  a Classic!",Null,1,2,17 February 2002
Resident Evil," Big Resident Evil fan gives **1/2 stars out of 4
","I been playing Resident Evil games forever now. I own all four games including the original version that came out in 1995. I must say I enjoyed the movie. I was entertained for 2 hrs, but it is clear Paul Anderson intended the movie to be for the younger audience. I liked the fact that the movie stood true to the game's story line with the exception of it's main character's but that did not bother me. What bothered me was the fact that I didn't jump once while watching the film, and not once did I get goosebumps. Horror? play the video games, those scare the hell out of me. This movie had techno and rock music playing in the background while funny looking zombie's are on screen looking to bite people. The zombie's are not scary at all, compared to George Romero's zombies, those were creepy, even John Landis' Zombies in the Micheal Jackson video Thriller looked creepier. Not once do you see the zombies in Resident Evil tearing flesh on rotting corpses. Watch Dawn of the Dead , and you'll see what I mean. I expected to be disturbed by this movie, like the games do to me, but unfortunatly not the case. What's good about the movie is the story, decent acting by the sexy Milla, she's mint, as well as my favorite sexy gangsta chick Michelle Rodriguez. Too bad there's no S.T.A.R.S. members, like Wesker, Barry, Jill or Chris, but the screenplay is very similar to the game. Keys needed to access different parts of the lab, the crows, the lickers, security code's ,and even a sewer scene. All true Resident Evil fan's know a RE game is not an RE game without a Sewer level of some sort. Looks like there will be a sequel, This time the setting will be the street's of Raccoon city, like Resident Evil 3 'Nemesis' which is actually part 2 in the game series. I hope it is creepier, and scarier, and bloodier, because if the video game's have mature ratings to keep it away from minors, then the movie which is rated R should not be intended for the young audience as well.",Null,1,1,21 March 2002
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The most unusual of the Tolkien/Jackson films.
","All in all, very disappointing...and here's why: -Characters were no where near as fleshed out as the characters in the LOTR films. In those films, I felt Aragon's shame. I felt Frodo's pain. And I felt Gandaulf's concern. Not so this time around, and I thought Bilbo's character was second fiddle. Unlike the Hobbit: Unexpected Journey, which was a better film than this was IMO.-No Gollum for the first time in a Hobbit/LOTR film. I love Gollum!! No Saruman, no Galadriel (except for a 2 second scene) Legolas was nice to see again, but he didn't have that chemistry with anyone, like he did with Aragon and Ghimli.-Did I mention the few extras, with no large battle scenes with hundreds of horses and REAL people!. The movie felt small. Sure, the CGI was grand, but that doesn't add to the grandeur in my opinion. A couple of ORC's might be shown in make-up, the rest behind them were CG. I liked the Spider scene, and the best scene was when Gandalf faced off against...well, let's just say, someone very familiar! But, I can honestly say that my eyes got heavy during some of these action scenes...there were way too many...and I rather get some character development instead! This film is a prime example of being over-funded.Despite my complaints, I absolutely loved Smaug. I just felt as if they spent so much money on his scenes to digitally create him that they forgot to pay Andy Serkis!! And I didn't even mention the simple, plain, mellow-dramatic soundtrack! The beautiful music of past films...don't expect to hear it in this film, or anything as masterfully composed.Nevertheless, it's hard to rate a film of this magnitude under a 6. The end was fantastic, and the last 40 minutes of the film made up for the other 2, boring hours. I am a huge fan of the LOTR films and the Hobbit so I'm too committed to rate this any lower. Despite my huge disappointment.",7,6,13,13 December 2013
Batman Begins," 'Batman in his true form'
","I was 14 years old when Tim Burton's Batman came out in theaters. I loved it. Before that movie, all I knew was the cheesy 60's series filled with so much corny campy stuff, I always wondered why the Batman comic book covers looked so different in comparison. I blame those shows from the sixties for making me overlook the comics and pass them by and opt for the Marvel comics instead. But after 1989, I began purchasing Batman Comics and I realized Batman was a grim, dark tale of a person with split personality fueled by rage. Oh the comics were so different and I Instantly became a Batman fan at the age of 14.Burton's first 2 movies were dark, and his first was a Masterpiece due to great acting by Nicholson and Keaton's unemotional pokerfaced, cold portrayal of the dark knight. Burton's created a nice dark world, but it still was cartooned and campy. It came down to Burton being booted from directing the 3rd film because they said his movies were too dark for the children, and Burger King wasn't selling it's batman toys because Kids were not attracted to the films, so in comes Joe Shumacher and brought back the sixties all over again.Oh now the 3rd generation Batman is here. Sticking to the comic roots and I thank Chris Nolan for realizing that Batman can't be tampered with anymore because he is the darkest superhero. This film is filled with disturbing, depressing, and intimidating images of the dark knight, the way Bob Kane envisioned it. Too bad Kane could not be alive to see it. The character development engulfs the viewer, the direction seemed a little rushed in the beginning, but it slows down and builds slowly. When you see how the cave was conceived, the bat suit assembled but various military prototypes, and a realistic Batmobile, or should I say the 'Tumbler'. The movie has nothing in it that says, this man could never exist. Who engineered the bat-mobile in Batman Forever? those batwings and over the top gadgets are not here. Batman uses stealth as his main weapon. No flashy kung-fu fighting in this film, Nolan intended to show flashes of Batman, hiding and striking, hiding and striking, like some sort of Splinter Cell and Ninja assassin. But whoever has second thoughts about Christian Bale as Batman, then think again and just go see this film already. He is the best Batman, sorry Micheal, but you weren't scary enough, you didn't scare the hell out of me when you spoke. You were cold, but not a caged beast who had just been released from his prison, of not knowing his destiny, and not knowing his purpose. This film is great, the acting, casting , especially Neeson, Caine, and of course Bale. I give it a 10 out of 10. It's an 8.6 right now, and I think it might go down eventually, because despite that the movie is a little flawed--because Nolan is not really an action director. Some of his shots are too jerky jerky. The movie is not the greatest in terms of hand to hand combat. I know Nolan intended it to be this way, and Batman is still young here, so he still has time to get better. His Gadgets will probably get better in the next film, but despite my inability to accept Batman in this realistic depiction, and despite the fact that I didn't see some over the top action scenes, I still marvel as Nolan's filmmaking ability and cannot deny this film the title of masterpiece!",10,8,14,18 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Way over-rated....but still very good.
","Yes i enjoyed Saving Private Ryan. Although it was full of Spielberg-esque drama, and not exactly a history lesson here. SPR is very short on the facts that took place during this period in WW2. This movie is basically a story with a plot, that took place during the turning point of WW2. Unlike most war movies, SPR is a movie with fictional characters and the realism of the battle scenes is the only realistic part of SPR. The opening scene was amazing. Better than 'The Longest Day', which depicts ultra realistic scenes of the infamous D-day invasion of Normandy France. But if your looking for a really great WW2 movie, then purchase A Bridge Too Far. That is by far my favorite WW2 movie of all time. I thought Stephen Spielberg copied the Kubrick method of hand-held camera style filming he used in Full Metal Jacket. It had a documentary feel to it, and Spielberg definatly copied that. But the battle scenes in this film are unmatched, with the excepton of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down...however..*** stars out of 4..well worth the 25 bucks.",Null,0,1,18 April 2002
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Groundbreaking animation and a great spiritual story.
","I loved the first film so much that I shook my head every time I read the scores of positive reviews that this sequel was getting. In no way did I believe that this film was better than the first--that is--until I saw it for myself. This truly is one of my favorite animated films, right up there with Wall-E and The Incredibles. The animation is light years beyond any of the recent Disney films, including Frozen or Big Hero 6. It was so good that it actually distracted me at times, having to rewind the film over and over to catch all the dialogue that flew past my ears. I really wished I had seen this in the theater.The story is more mythological than the first...and the script really goes deeply into the Dragon myths. It may be a bit too deep for younger viewers, as the villain's motives may come off as a bit silly for those who are unacquainted with the meaning behind all the spiritual/religious connotations.But myth aside, the story's heart lies with the characters, and especially the strong bond between Hiccup and Toothless. Never have I seen such a duo on screen with so much love for each other. Another reason why the film works is due to the threatening villain named Drago Bloodfist. He presented a big challenge in this film, and it made for a very dramatic, sad, and happy ending all at once. The best animated film of all time!",10,5,9,26 February 2015
The Pianist," Prepare yourself for a depressing movie.
","I loved this film. It was as realistic as possible. Based on a true story, perhap's some of the events in the movie were made up, not every little incident is true. I think Roman Polanski did exaggerate some things, but the Nazis were as ruthless and cold as he showed us in this film. It gets me sick to my stomach whenever I see some of the things they did to the jews. I think this film is not entertainment. It is a history lesson that keeps you glued to the television because Brody gives you an awesome performance and really makes you shout at the screen saying things like 'no go that way!!!' or 'stop making noise, the Germans will see you' I almost felt I survived the whole thing with him, and the end dissapointed me because It felt incomplete, but its a true story and thats the way it went. **** 4 stars out of 4. Brody deserved the Oscar, Polanski did not, Scorsese should have gotten it for Gangs of NY.",Null,0,1,16 July 2003
Seabiscuit," Best sport movie of all time!
","What a fabolous film. I thought it had plenty of heart and beautiful cinematography. All of the actors were great, and i almost felt like watching it again as soon as the end credits started. It definatly deserves an oscar nominee, and even though doesn't deserve best picture over some other nominees, it deserves to be a contender. It could win it but Lord of the Rings is gonna be tough to beat. There are so many scenes that remain in my mind hours after the movie ended, and it really lifts your spirit. *** stars out of ****. I thought the only bad thing about the film was the directing, i thought the pacing of the film could of been better, and scene cuts were innapropiate at times. nevertheless, a classic!",Null,0,1,4 February 2004
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The most emotional Planet of the Apes film.
","To sum it up, a very powerful film falling just short of being a masterpiece. However, the only flaw in the film is that the film could have been just a bit longer! I am really hoping for a director's cut because there should have been a few more character development scenes between father and son, boyfriend and girlfriend, and even Ape and Human. I felt the movie was paced a bit too quickly but nevertheless, still contains very fleshed out characters driven by excellent performances throughout, from Lithgow, to Franco, to Cox and especially by Andy Serkis.Cesar is by far the best animated character in the history of cinema. His facial expressions tell it all! You feel his rage, his fear, and his child like innocence through his wonderfully animated eyes. Not only is the C.G.I. good, but the character is written very well in general. You will go through all of those emotions yourself as you witness his journey. All I can say is that I now know why I try to walk my dog without a leash as much as possible. This movie just confirmed it for me! Through the film, you will understand what Cesar is feeling and why. The invisible character of the film is humanity itself, and at times, feels like a study of human nature.Plot wise, it is very well told. I thought there was nothing cheesy about the script, although not as intelligent as the original, but not dumb either. There is some science fiction in the film, and other than the experimental drug, there was some other surprising Science fiction plot elements in it too which might lead into the sequel; if there is one of course, and I think there will be.For the skeptics who think the film would be cheesy seeing all the apes battle armed policemen then think again. I too, was a bit skeptical at first, wondering how the apes would defeat an entire police force, but when you watch the film your doubts would dissipate. Just remember the physical ability of apes and how powerful the apes are, and how much more powerful they would be if they had brains! The action was very good, but as good as it was, I'd trade it in for more plot development. There were a bit too many plot jumps in the last 30 minutes, but all in all, it was directed very, very well. Coupled with a good score, mellow at times, but highly dramatic which heightens the tension. Speaking of tension, there is a lot of it in this film. If you're an animal lover like I am, then be warned; You will be in tears 30 seconds into the opening scene.I also wanted to mention the original film even though it's tough to compare the two. This is an origins story that actually makes the original better. The original was more about the plot than the characters and they each stand apart and alone with their own merits and flaws. It was nice to see a few homages to the old classic, and don't be surprised if you see a character from the original as well. I highly doubt this film will disappoint the fans of the original and TV series! It will have you climbing trees!",9,364,527,5 August 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," Cash grab! They are stretching out this story into two parts.
","The movie had some good character moments but aside from Thanos' story arc, which was interesting, the movie was a convoluted mess. And not even all of the action kept me from yawning. Dr. Strange had some great action scenes but for the most part the choreography in this film was nonexistent and sloppy. And If people thought the humor in the Last Jedi was out of place then you will really be disappointed here. Unlike Thor Ragnorok, the humor in Infinity War was for the most part; not funny and it came up at wrong moments in the film, which removed the seriousness in certain situations. Even the acting seemed lazy, especially the performances of Ruffalo and Evans. These guys are running out of steam and put no energy into the roles this time. Even Robert Downey and Tom Holland lacked the chemistry they have often displayed in previous films. Perhaps its not their fault but the due to the fact that they had so little screen time. This film might as well be a Guardians of the Galaxy film, but they called it an Avengers film because they have more prestige. The film should have been called Infinity War and that's that. To sum it up, this film is a 2.5 hour long first act of a three-act film. Save your money because you will be disappointed, just like my entire theater was.",6,43,140,27 April 2018
Hellboy," Fun, cool...but no where near classic status.
","X-men...classic depiction of a comic book, beautiful characters, you actually care for them. In Hell boy, the characters are well developed, its just that it's lacking in plot. No subplots besides the love story between Hellboy and Liz. It was a decent subplot, besides Ron Pearlman, and some really cool looking characters, the movie does not remind me of anything other than Men in Black 2. Just plain and corny looking Monsters, and a boring Plot. Great visuals...I loved the Character Hellboy, there is a very human side to him, almost like an ordinary Joe. He was cool and down to earth, and even though the movie was corny at times (only Marvel comic book movies are realistic, in the sense that they make you believe ...(for example)that a science experiment can change you can't it? but as far as Nazi's opening up Portholes and bringing in Demonic creatures from hell? Thats a little too campy. So I guess the unique cool looking characters and their personalities allow the movie to get the well deserving high 6's rating. but anything over a 7 would not be right...its a little above average, and it entertained me for 2 hours, but it's no where on the same level as the x-men films, or even spiderman. **1/2 stars out of ****",9,1,2,29 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The second part of the already classic trilogy
","I must say I did like TTT better than FOTR. I think it's a darker picture. It's a shame it didnt pick up any oscars. I thought the movie dragged a little the first hour, but it's just in a class by itself. Only George Lucas' Star Wars compares to this series. Old school movie making. Peter Jackson is ok as a director but no one can knock his vision. He has a lot of it, and he did stray away from certain parts of the book, and created his own material, but hey, thats an adaptation for you. TTT continues from where FOTR left off, and the final hour of this movie will be talked about for a long time. Nothing compares to this not even the jedi battle in Attack of the clones. Peter Jackson gets knocked for his choppy direction, but he can get a lot out of his actors and that is what all great directors do. I think the other great thing about this film that also sets standards other than the final battle is the amazing 'Gollum/Speagle' character. CGI has come a long way. One day,  an oscar will be presented to one. Gollum probably deserves one! Not only did he look so real, he stole a lot of scenes, and is amazing to see how movies have progressed. Of course this movie gets **** stars out of ****. Passionate movie making, nothing short of perfection.",8,0,0,27 August 2003
X-Men: Apocalypse," Don't listen to critics! This movie absolutely popped my brain!
","There has been a trend in Hollywood lately, several trends in fact. One of these trends is the overproduction of mindless or crass films, which sadly, are usually the ones that are well received and make a lot of money. X-Men Apocalypse is not dumb Deadpool, or an action-packed Civil War film, which was thin on plot and high on action. I loved Civil War but X-Men Apocalypse is a different animal all together. X-Men Apocalypse is a very theological film, full of wonderful writing and deep, insightful character arcs that make you consider the human condition.X-Men: Apocalypse makes you realize that being transcendent doesn't mean you have more knowledge than everyone else, or that you are smarter. It means that you grew past your own inner torments and don't let the pains of your past affect you and your future. It's also a bit dark, darker than any other Superhero film I've ever seen, including BVS. The Magneto scenes in this movie made be cry my eyes out, they were that disturbing! That's all I'll saw without spoiling anything, but man, I don't know how this film didn't get an R- Rating. I saw a lot of people walk out of the theater with their kids and I don't blame them. But anyway, back to what made the movie great.The acting by Fassbander and McAvoy. As good as it gets in the genre. Then we have Singer's excellent direction, and brilliantly paced story, which had a good blend of character driven drama, humor and of course, an excellent plot. However, some of the sets looked cheap at times, and I had wished that the film had more extras during the action scenes. Luckily, whenever Apocalypse did something terrible, we'd get a news report every now and then, which helped you realize that so many people were indeed affected. Speaking of Apocalypse, Oscar Issac absolutely stole this film. Say what you want about his look, but man, Boris Karloff move over! He looks just like him! I thought he was scary as hell and had some of the best lines in the film. He kinda had that Darth Vadar thing going for him for a while, and I actually agreed with 90% of his philosophy about humans and our destructive behavior. It saddens me to see so many people dislike this brilliant piece of cinema. I agree, that it was a bit more plot driven than the last movie, but hey, some of the best science fiction novels are plot driven. I don't mind theology every once in a while, we need more of it in Hollywood, and like BVS before it, it seems like people cannot stand esoteric films anymore. And that my friends, is a tragedy.9/10. One of the top 3 best X-Men films of all time and a top 10 favorite of mine. Don't let critics shape your opinions!",8,9,18,29 May 2016
The Illusionist," Deep storyline and superb acting throughout. (small spoiler)
","I enjoyed this film because of it's dual ending. If you love films that have a different ending for every person's opinion who watches it than this film is for you.Paul Giamatti was great in this film. He is basically the main character and Norton's role is supporting. I don' think this was better than the Prestige, but it was a smart script. The illusions were over the top, but they were based on real events so I can't complain. I just find it hard to believe shapeshifting and 4th dimensional beings are real. Keep an open mind and enjoy the Illusionist. You will be talking about it for days after you see it!",7,0,0,15 March 2007
Transformers," Choppy and Sloppy at times, but setting standards.
","Action in this film could be very claustrophobic. But there were some scenes that blew my mind as well. I usually don't get headaches during films, and I love loud stuff, but only Black Hawk Down gives me a worse headache. The action does not let up. Worth going deaf, I admit that. The CGI lighting effects are awesome, the CGI blending in with real automobiles and aircraft is standard setting. Fake one minute, real the next, and that equals realistic robots! The role played by Shia Lebouf was really funny. He could be the next Tom Hanks. He is going to be a big star. Love the role by John Turturro. I was really angered and annoyed by him. Voight needs to retire and make up with Angelina, and cameos by Anthony Anderson and Bernie added humor. Lots of humor in this film, surprised, I was hoping for more darkness. R rating and it would be the best film of all time.",8,1,3,4 July 2007
Children of Men," Epic film, and an instant classic.
","I went in with low expectations, which might of helped, but I can't remember the last time I saw a better film than this in the past 2 years or so. This is a film in the Science Fiction category, but it's more of a Drama set in the future. Ill write this critique assuming the reader already knows what the film is about so Ill speak of it's positives and negatives.The rare but not unique directing in this film is very much ala Kubrick, and ala Spielberg. Both used long takes, Kubrick mastered the tracking take and Spielberg the long take with extras and chaos in background. Cuaron' does a great job at doing this in 3 particular scenes and especially at the end with a 9 minute single take. The effect achieved with this method is ultra realistic, evoking a situational feeling which puts the viewer in the main character's shoes.The acting was superb, throughout the entire cast, my favorite was Caine's character Jasper. I hope he snags up an Oscar just for some face time, he deserves it. I also wanted to elaborate on he atmosphere here. Managment of extras in this film was fantastic. People tend to forget about that aspect of directing. The setting is a Gothic future London and they really made it look depressing. I haven't seen such brilliance since Kubrick's Full metal jacket. COM has more action and epic-like war scenes that will give you flash backs of Saving Private Ryan.Now some of the flaws in this film include shallow writing. It's a drama at heart. Little philosophy about god, religion and science. Few scenes mention or explain such topics, but the film doesn't really concentrate on what caused infertility or why the world collapsed and how. You will see the hate Bush signs and some violent Muslims parading with guns. But it's all in the background, and your journey is the main attraction in this film. The moral is about one thing. Everyone has a purpose, whether you contribute to chance, or to the will of nature.",9,2,5,10 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood is Hollywood's Savior... 4 stars!!!
","Million Dollar Baby is without a doubt a Masterpiece. It is One of the most powerful movies that should be mentioned in the same breath as films like , Godfather, Citizen Kane, Shawshenk Redemption, Schindler' list, Rocky, etc. Basically it should be in a top 15 List of all time already.I left the theatre around 2 hours ago, and I must say that I am still getting goosebumps thinking about the film....No spoilers here so don't worry.This is a film about a 31 year old with a dream. An old trainer living with guilt, and an old former fighter of the trainer who never knew what the word 'can't' means.Character development? I can't remember the last time so much emotion was involved when I saw a film. Acting? great on the part of all 3 characters. This movie has to pick up a few Oscars along the way.Clint Eastwood has always been my Idol as a kid, mainly for his Western's and Dirty Harry was OK. His movies then were violent. Clint always regretted his earlier days how he was perceived as only an action guy. He does not want people to remember him for his violent past. Now he makes movies about Strength, forgiveness, redemption, faith, opportunity, and the straight impact all these words have on the audience. No body does it better than Clint.",9,1,3,14 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Lots of philosophy, plot twists and surprises.
","The Last Jedi was such a beautiful film on so many levels, despite its flaws, it's a movie that will make you cry, smile, laugh and inspire you. The most notable surprise was the script, in that it wasn't as dumbed down as I expected it to be. Unlike the Force Awakens, which was just one giant nostalgic introduction to the characters, The Last Jedi had lots of philosophy, and for that it will stand the test of time as a movie I'll go back to over and over for inspiration and not just for the action-adventure. There were so many memorable lines in this film. I won't spoil anything by saying too much but that's what Star Wars is all about. I'll never forget those moments that intrigued me as a kid, when Yoda would guide Luke, and when Qui-Gonn Jinn mentored young Anakin. There were a lot of memorable philosophical quotes in this film. For example, there was a scene where one of the Rebels worried over the fact that they were lacking firepower and expressed concern that it may not be enough to topple the evil First Order. Princess Leia approached the Rebel, took a look around, and watched some of the other Rebels as they displayed acts of bonding, such as laughter, and hugging, and then Leia replied, 'We have everything we need.'Unlike so many movies today, The Last Jedi was very unpredictable. Just when you think something is sure to occur, the opposite happens. I was really on the edge of my seat for this one. Nothing was as it seemed. I can't really talk about anything else before mentioning the phenomenal acting by Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver. They were outstanding. They were so good that they looked like they were gonna pop or explode at times, and that also includes the wonderfully animated Supreme Leader Snoke, who was perfectly animated and in sync with the brilliant voice acting by the master of voice acting, Andy Serkis. There is so much more I want to say but don't want to spoil too much. There are so many surprises in this film. But for all its praises, I admit, I was left wanting for more in the end, and at times, the film shifts tone from a serious one to one that borders on slapstick comedy. Star Wars always had its comedic moments, and I laughed during this film more than once, but I admit, some of the comedy did feel out of place at times. I also thought there were some major events in that film that required more explanation that was given, including the deaths of a couple of characters. Some of them died and I was left asking myself how.All in all, I'd say this is the 4th best Star Wars movie behind episode 5, 6, and 3.",8,1,6,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Beautiful film, great action, but zero drama.
","I watched this on New Years eve and I decided to interrupt my Twilight Zone marathon for a few hours so I could see this. I found myself yawning quite a bit, but I kept watching because the beautiful cinematography. I gave this film a 6 based on it's stunning production values. The sets, the makeup, the art direction, the CGI, the costumes, etc. Besides all this, I thought that film lacked in plot. The characters I thought were full of personality but their conflicts didn't get me emotional enough to care about them.It's worth a watch with the kids, or late at night with a couple of brews when the mind is usually turned off. It's a fun ride...at times.",6,1,6,1 January 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Finally, a American Martial arts movie that hangs with the best
","Tarantino is a movie maker with vision and a gambler. He pulled off a movie that will please and capture martial arts fans and non fans. He redifines the way we tell stories, influenced by only the old school great directors, no cgi here, just creative methods that boggled mind. I love old hongkong action movies, and old japanese samurai films, now i add Kill Bill vol. 1 to my collection. I cant fully rate the whole film yet because I havent seen it, it is split in half so they can make extra $,  but the first half definatly had entertained me. A must see for all martial arts fans.",9,0,0,13 October 2003
Clash of the Titans," Intellectual, Inspiring, and passionate film-making !
","I want to review this film by comparing it to the original and as a film on it's own. As a kid, I watched the original on HBO over and over because it was the most mesmerizing thing on TV at the time. Even Star Wars didn't immerse me into the mythological world like Clash of the Titans. After seeing this re-make last night, I could honestly say that this film is going to stand the test of time and eventually become a cult classic like the original.I left the theater with goosebumps and still have them as I write this review and think about the film. Now I'm not the type of casual movie fan that enjoys everything with great CGI and pretty actors like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy 3, or other mindless swash-buckling adventures.Clash of the Titans is not that kind of movie. I'll even go as far as saying it is superior to the original. The reason is that the producers of this film were very passionate about it and put lots of love into the making of this film. Being a lover of old mythology myself, I was really inspired by this film and was surprised to see such a smart, metaphorical, religious and inspiring movie. It never gets boring like Lord of the Rings did at times. There is always something happening to keep you on the Edge. The choreographed fight scenes were pretty good, and there was lots of wire work which was pleasing to see. At times, the movie felt like a God of War video game with a boss fight at the end of every scene! The main character really grows with each minute and you care about him in the end.Now as for the acting, well, top-notch all around. What do you expect with such talent on the screen by the leads and supporting actors. Sam Worthington is no joke, he's going to be a bigger star than he already is, and on a side note; I find it odd he always plays a character that is half human. Lliam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are imposing as the Mighty brothers Zeus and Hades and look very similar in appearance. I think they really are a match made in heaven; (No pun intended) I wish they had more screen time, better yet, I wish the film was longer in general! Now the directing; excellent! Paced very well. Louis Leterrier has a new fan. He really has the promise to be the next Ridley Scott! Too bad this was a big budget B movie, and if he had more funding, this film could have been as Epic as Lord of the Rings or even the Ten Commandments and Ben Hur. It really reminded me of all those films, it reaped quality.The sets were epic! A true old fashioned film in every sense. Fans of the original might find a surprise in this film in the shape of a stop-motion, metallic bird! That's all I'm going to say! Finally, the soundtrack impressed as well and featured such beautiful music! I can't remember the last time I purchased a soundtrack not made by Hans Zimmer or Danny Elfman. I am buying the soundtrack for sure.Summary: 9/10 A film with great acting, directing, music, sets, CGI, plot and characters. Oh and I didn't mention the Pegasus! Wow !",9,11,27,1 April 2010
Jurassic World," Great first half, but script fell apart
","What a shame. This movie could have been so much better! I was completely enthralled during the first 45 min or so, and it was as if I was visiting the Park myself. The cinematography was beautiful, the attractions were innovative and the park was filled with so many extras, that it felt like a real place. There was a lot of interesting man vs. nature debate in the script as well as tidbits on the danger of technological progress. I applauded the writers at first. There were even some pretty decent character arcs but unfortunately, they never fully developed.When the action started to pick up, things went sour really fast. If this film had maintained its serious tone, I may have scored it in the 8's or even 9's. But sadly, the director chose to include bits of cheesy comedic lines in moments of urgency, completely ruining the thrill. I cared nothing for the characters, because, it seemed as if the characters took the threats they came across a bit too lightly for my tastes, so much so, that it completely nullified Bryce Dallas Howard's excellent performance. But hey, at least the action was better than expected and so was the CGI. I was skeptical at the fact that there were so few robotics used in this film, but it didn't matter. The CGI was that realistic. I still can't say it saved this film. I yawned a lot in the end, despite the pretty cool plot twist. This film should have been a horror film like the first 2 installments, but it chose to be a movie aimed at teens. What else is new these days with blockbuster films right? 6/10",6,158,319,23 June 2015
Black Hawk Down," Definatly a Classic [****]
","My favorite war movie of all time was Full Metal Jacket by Stanley Kubrick, no other movie explains the psychological aspect of war like this movie did. Saving private Ryan was second, it was very realistic and was also backed by fantastic acting. However, after i left the theatre last night i realized that no other movie depicts the realism of battle like Black Hawk Down. Financed by Big time producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Ridley Scott is the perfect director for a war movie. His trademark Gloomy look you see in his movies really make the movie stunning and visually marvelous. Ridley's intention was to put the audience right int he middle of the battle which is in fact the entire movie except for the first half hour which is mostly character introductions. Many people are knocking this movie for its shallow characters. Thats not what this movie is all about. It's a movie that shows the reality of war, and how brutal it is. War is a terrible thing and to all the people who say let's bomb this country and let's bomb them and them....Go see this movie. If you happen to be sensitive to disturbing grotesque images, go see this movie. War is War and people die in terrible ways, and Ridley Scott shows that. He definatly created a masterpeice and the movie almost has a documentary type feel to it. Despite its shallow characters, you do get to care about them, and at times i found myself pumping my fist rooting for them at the end even though it was viewed as a trajedy as 19 soldiers perished in a battle no one even knows about. It's not a patriotic, Go kick their butt America! film. No happy endings in this flick. Just the Truth. The Truth about human war. An Great Movie Overall..it is definatly in my top 10 list of the greatest movies of all time.",Null,0,0,22 January 2002
Black Hawk Down," One word: Excellent!
","First, the rating...[4 stars]..i can't see myself giving the movie anything less, No other war movie depicts the realism Ridley Scott and big time producer Jerry Bruckenheimer dish out in Black Hawk Down. That also includes Speilberg's Saving Private Ryan and Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Yes, both are fantastic films, but this movie is on a totally different level. Ridley Scott's intention is to give the audience a feeling of being in middle of the battle which is in fact the entire movie except for the first 30 minutes which is mostly character introductions. However, the movie does not focus on its characters as much as other great war films, and although you do care about them, especially Tom Sizemore who by far steals the show as a brave, and fearless captain. Ridley's intention was to simply make you realize that war is very serious, and he does a good job of making you understand this in a human perspective, not an American one. He makes you feel bad for the many innocent somali's who died as the result of this 15 hr battle. Somalia was a hopeless country and maybe we shouldnt have gotten ivolved but at the end you realize that thats what some people are put on this earth for, to make a difference. 9 out of 10 people most likely never knew about this situation which took place in 93, these are the small battles we never even hear about, and yet so important. This movie really has you thinking that dying for a cause is worth living for, Even though most people beleive we shouldnt fight other people's wars. The movie deserves best picture of the year, it definatly sets the standard for future war flicks. Go see it!!! and I suggest you find a seat really far from the speakers!!!",Null,0,0,21 January 2002
Logan," Logan is the most important superhero film of all time
","Minor spoilers ahead.Logan may very well be the most important Superhero film of all time because it touches on social issues that we are facing today in the real world. One of the things I thought that added to its real world gravitas was the 'Donald Trump Wall,' The film's near future setting isn't quite post-apocalyptic, but it teeters on the edge of it. The film made me wonder if such a border patrol wall would one day be used to not only to block illegal immigrants from entering the country, but perhaps, even the disabled, or others, because in the case of this film, it was also used to keep mutants out.The year is 2029. Mutants are all but extinct, and a mutant hasn't been born in 15 years. Frank Logan (Wolverine) and another vampire-like mutant named Caliban care for an ailing Professor Xavier, who is on the brink of developing dementia. Patrick Stewart played his best portrayal of Professor X to date. He was brilliant in this film, teetering on the brink of madness, and also plagued by seizures that happen whenever he uses his telepathic ability. Because of this, Professor X is heavily medicated so that he no longer can use his special ability, and medicated without Xavier's behest. 'You're putting me to sleep!' Xavier tells Logan whenever he stuffs pills into his mouth. This made me wonder if many of today's gifted people are misdiagnosed as crazy and put on medication just because they are unique, different, depressed and alienated.The plot is rather simple. Wolverine is tasked with escorting a young girl across the country so that she can reach a haven for mutant kind, where she will be safe from a coven of trans-humanists. Wolverine refuses at first, but when he realizes that this young girl is his clone, and just like him, he dedicates his life to keep her safe from Transigent, a scientific corporation looking to genetically modify humans into weapons, just like Wolverine, except, unlike naturally born mutants, Transigent wants to engineer them without a conscience, and without a soul.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was nothing short of perfection. Oscar worthy in every sense. The best performance of a pulp fiction character on the big screen;--ever, period. If another actor other than Heath Ledger is ever going to win an Oscar for a portrayal of a comic book character, it will be him! My one gripe about this film was the brutal violence because it bordered on being gratuitous, and there was one small plot hole in this movie that sort of irked me. I was hoping for a happier ending too, because this movie depressed the hell out of me. Logan is a tragedy. And surprisingly, it borrowed a lot from the classic Univeral film, The Wolfman. The final scene in this movie was one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen. It touched me on a personal level and I can't remember the last time I got teary during a comic book movie.9/10",8,2,6,3 March 2017
The Dark Knight," More than just a Batman film
","I only became interested in Christopher Nolan's work when Batman Begins resurrected one of my favorite personal stories/sagas of all time. I love Tim Burton, but I'm grown up now, and Nolan gave a different take on the genre, making it more relative, and The Dark Knight is another masterpiece script that surpasses the Prestige and Memento respectfully.The Dark Knight in a few words would be considered as a Neo-Shakespearean film for the modern age. Sublime in many of it's rich subplots and the loaded cast members each have their time to shine and make their impact or deliver their messages, and fit into the story so well. A story orchestrated by Heath Ledger's Joker, reminding me of another great performance from the past, played by Gary Oldman in the film, State of Grace.Ledger's Joker had that same menacing, unstoppable, determination, and he isn't a normal criminal at all. The Joker drives the story, putting the elite people of Gotham face to face with their inner demons, causing them to fall themselves. When Batman's hope for a successor in top Lawyer Harvey Dent takes a twist, he is pitted against decisions forcing him to make the ultimate sacrifice that only Batman can make. When thoughts of hanging up his cape finally come to an end, he realizes that the only way to endure his role as the Dark Knight is to take the blame for everything, just because he can, and no one could catch him. Most fans won't like Nolan's take on the Batman since he gave the character a darker persona than ever before. Bale is perfect under the cowl, with his Bowery bum voice.The Batman was played by Christian Bale very well, although he made a bad Bruce Wayne I think. Keaton! you still have the honors, but Bale is much scarier. His re-imagined voice for the Caped Crusader is one you would hear from Rambo, or Snake Solid in his older days. I think most comic die-hards from the Bronze age like me will not be happy with the fact that Nolan wanted to keep this story original and completely his version of The Dark Knight, and used little nostalgic elements from comics and the cartoons. Gone is the Frank Miller and Bob Kane inspirations from Batman Begins.Most film buffs and amateur screen-writers like myself will also note how the script was confused at times, forgetting it was PG-13 rated in some scenes and using comedy to offset the mind from being creep-ed out by the Joker's twisted ingenuity, or Harvey Two-face's gruesome appearance. It should have been rated R just so they could remove the comedy because this film is completely about the urban bureaucracy and its Heroes, Anti-Heroes, and Villains that make it up.This Masterpiece will remind you of an old fashioned cops and robber film from the 80's, sort of like Heat mixed with some Black Rain, with a little bit of Serpico in there. The action is sub-par for an action film despite Batman's ability on the road and his skill with cables and ropes. It's all realistic action, Batman will get hurt if he falls 20 feet, but not 100 since he gets a chance to use his memory cloth. This Batman misses sometimes, he's human, he falls, he bruises, looking like a UFC fighter with his bruises. Nolan added a beautiful weapon to the Batman saga with the Sonar suit. Finally a real Batman that can see sound, and detect people up to a few miles away! Just like a real Bat! This Batman is all new, making his character even more timeless since he has an enemy that completes him now. This movie has the atmosphere of a Blade Runner film, sets that would make Kubrick jealous. He isn't breathing thick air in a bat-cave, he is in a loft this time, and has offices so big they would make Google's conference rooms look like closets.You would think Batman is killing just as many Bad guys as the Joker does in the film, and flip-side, causing the deaths of cops as well. In the end, Batman fans won't like the fact that Batman was the Anti-hero and not the hero, and some will like the fresh take on the super-hero film. Besides the Bat-spotlight and a few scenes taken out of comic books, Nolan tried to make this his version of the Batman, and many die-hard fans will love Batman's first new superpower, Sonar ability!8/10 Highly recommended for it's fresh script. As an amateur screenwriter myself, I can appreciate the ingenuity here. Would have been perfect if Rated R. Certain characters in film were hard to get attached to making it hard to match the emotion of the first film.",8,3,7,19 July 2008
Avatar," Might win 2 or 3 Oscars, but that's about it
","I sound as if 3 Oscars is nothing big. How many films win 3 Oscars? I'm just admitting that the film is over-hyped yes, but still a phenomenal film. It's just not the type that wins 7, 8, 9 or 11 Oscars. It's actually well deserving of IMDb's 8.6 score and should be around 40th on the top 250.One of the BIG reasons why the film is so great is because of the visuals, it's true. I saw it on IMAX 3D and was blown away. Cameron actually filmed the movie live in 3D and for 3D, using specific shots. The CGI in this movie is better than anything I've seen on film. I can't say it any more plainly than that. I can say that I haven't seen such detail since Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars before it. The planet in Avatar was very fleshed out, and wasn't just another technological planet with large skyscrapers or another planet with large mountains, waterfalls and dinosaurs. Cameron's art design team is very talented. The Navi were amazing looking creatures, feeling mythological even.Now of course, the story was exactly what critics deemed as 'Dances with Wolves in space' I agree, the only thing original was the Avatar idea which is mind boggling to say the least. I think it's a clever and original idea that makes me wonder how it wasn't thought of before. But all in all, nothing too original, I've seen Mechas in video games and the Matrix. I've seen anti-gravity craft in Star Trek. And I've seen this story before, definitely comparable to Costner's masterpiece Dances with Wolves. But after all these complaints, I still give the movie an 8. The directing was amazing and it's not easy directing actors with CGI, but Cameron mastered it because he had the right tools. 400 million is a lot of money to make a film, and not a dollar went wasted here. Even the orchestra was phenomenal, composed by James Horner who is no Hans Zimmer, but loved his score for this film.This is one film that MUST be seen in 3D. I don't think there's any other ones out there.",8,0,3,22 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Comedic take on demonic possession
","I almost turned the film off after watching the first 5 minutes. I was expecting something a bit more serious because when I'm in the mood for a comedy I watch a comedy. When I'm in the mood for horror I watch horror and so I scrolled down my On Demand list and was ready for a spooky evening. However, I laughed instead, all while getting the creeps sometimes shortly after laughing! Raimi can do that to you! This film threw me off, I thought Raimi was done with doing movies like this! Now even though I'm very familiar with Sam Raimi's style and loved the Evil Dead series as well as Dark man. But after seeing his film, The Gift, I expected this to follow the formula of that film, which was a serious take on the supernatural as in films like The Exorcist, and The Unborn, etc. But don't expect total macabre with Drag me to Hell. It's a film Id compare to the Evil Dead films. Typical Sam Raimi here and in the end, I was very entertained. I laughed a lot during watching the film, all while the others who saw it with me covered their eyes.Now this isn't some campy Creep show type film. I would consider this a very intelligent film although heavily exaggerated. Mediums who watch this film will pick out the subtleties and subliminal things that may or may not be scientifically explained; but that is another story. Just watch it for the make-up effects, thrills, and surprisingly great performances by the talented Alison Lohman and Justin Long. The directing was masterful, and of course, the production for this film was pretty awesome.",7,1,1,22 May 2010
From Hell," Fantastic directing, and a Kubrick like experience
","First and foremost....the Hughes Bros. They are undoubtably the most underrated directors out there. I loved the visuals in this film. The dark alleys, and foggy streets, dark settings and amazing sets and also the method used by the directors to pace this flim was very unique, and gave this film a look unmatched by any other horror movie out there. This film is more than a slasher flick set London during the Victorian era. It contains phenomenal acting by Johnny Depp and Heather Graham who have an unusual chemistry in this movie that works. She was a little too pretty to be an 'unfortuante' or prostitute in my mind, but it's only a movie afterall. I thought the suspense faded after the first hour but nevertheless explains the Jack the Ripper case in a comic bookish way that is not based on facts but opinion. There is no real proven story to the Ripper murders, so why not make a movie showing a possible scenario? That is what the Hughes bros. did in From Hell. I reccomend it !! *** 3 stars!!",9,0,2,27 June 2002
The Departed," Great film, but not his best job in director's chair.
","I really think Scorcese created a unique way of depicting criminals in unconventional forms , whether you are a police captain or a member of a mob family working double shifts. The story is real. It's modern, the writing is smart and the film lets you know in the opening scene that it's setting takes place a few years ago. But in reality, it's a story that takes place right now, present time to near future. There are hints of political jabs concerning levels of power now given to the local police departments and FBI and all other agencies of law enforcement for that matter. So the writing was smart and I was really never bored once throughout the entire 2 and half plus hours.Now I'm not going to tell you what this film is about, just go see it. It's a modern cops and mobsters/Donnie Brasco/state of grace type film. The cast has all stars everywhere. This film has a B-movie feel to it, set wise, and firefights were OK, but nothing major..very little extras, very little car chases or anything else that looks expensive to produce. Most of the budget must of went to the cast. Starting off with Jack Nicholson. He was at his best here comically since Batman. He is great comedy throughout the film, and acting wise he does a good job at showing valence, and is believable as a mob boss. The show stealer in my mind was Leonardo DiCaprio. In my honest opinion, he overshadows everyone else in the film and that's saying a lot considering how good Damon was. The only good character development Scorcese paced well is the character Leo plays named Billy Costigan. I didn't care what happened to anyone else in the film. He was as emotional as anyone has ever gotten on film. It was almost as if other actors who were on screen with DiCaprio were intimidated by his overpowering acting. The other great performance that stood out was Baldwinn's character as a vulgar fast trash talking cop. He had me laughing throughout.So great story, smart unpredictable writing, and top notch acting; What else does this film need? well, other the split screen time between Damon and DiCaprio kind of took away from good character development. Scorcese paced the movie in choppy manner, with cuts at inappropriate moments, and some scenes were just time fillers. He might win the Oscar this year, but its all politics.He deserved it plenty of times before, but not this one. Don't take it the wrong way though, this movie deserves at least 3 Oscars, one for DiCaprio, other for Screenplay, and perhaps a third for score. This movie had some pulsating scenes in it, due in part to it's great rock and roll trademark 70's Scorcese soundtracks.The love story was OK, nothing like Stone and Deniro in Casino, or even Diaz and DiCaprio in Gangs of NY. But there is a subplot love story in the film. The story is about going crooked in life. Monsters could be anyone, and some are saved, some are only going to wind up dead. Every dog does have it's day. Scorcese will in March, when this film racks up some awards. 8 out of 10.",7,0,1,6 October 2006
30 Days of Night," Above average acting for a Vampire slasher flick
","I saw the movie with high expectations due to all the hoopla amongst fans of the vampire genre and horror movies overall. I found that I enjoyed the movie for what it was a little bit more during the 2nd viewing. I understood the ending a bit more, some people might not like the ending, but I'll leave it at that.Acting by Hartnett and supporting cast was satisfying and enough for integrity's sake, but the true stars were the ghoulish and demonic looking vampires who showcase some super speed and agility in this film. The make-up is astonishing, and jaw dropping. I loved the rubber suits from Underworld, but this is just twisted stuff. There was good tension and the vampires made for an imposing looking bunch and even a bit disturbing for that matter. Gone is the eloquence and vanity and here you will see a whole new vampire, sort a vampire/zombie mix, but very intelligent and even philosophical at some times.There are no cheap jumpy scenes here, and gore is held to a minimum until the end. Director David Slade did a decent job, nothing spectacular. He had big help from the big B movie budget and beautiful atmosphere created by the expansive set of a whole town. I just thought Slade used some western film noir and could have done a better job with some pacing elements of the plot.The end will leave you with some questions and some will say you are left hanging at the end and it is likely that another sequel will be produced shortly since this film was successful in box office. There is no doubt that you will remember this film for a while after seeing it.",7,1,1,3 March 2008
Joker," Powerful psychodrama led by an incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix!
","Joaquin Phoenix gave the performance of a lifetime as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society. It's more of a psychological character study than a comic book film. Todd Phillips did a great job directing, as did the cinematographers, turning New York City into an almost hellish landscape.Joker is a dark psychodrama of nihilism and Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing performance as the iconic Clown Prince is the embodiment of pure anarchy. But never once did this movie feel like it was glorifying radical anarchism or anything like that. It's more of a cautionary tale, and critique of societal failings, shedding awareness to all the things that are misunderstood about the misunderstood.9/10.",9,3,6,4 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Overrated, but a fun film
","I've been waiting for HBO to broadcast this film for quite some time and I had high expectations based on the positive reviews this film has garnered. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed, and I'll tell you why without spoiling anything.Now I won't go on and mention the lack of characterization or emotional depth. That's not why some stories are told--especially science fiction stories--which are usually always plot driven. Still, after the first twenty minutes, which happened to be contain the most engrossing moments in the film, I found myself wondering if this story would wind up as some mindless circus film and it wound up being the case.The villains were very shallow things, with no motives whatsoever. And if science fiction is supposed to be plot driven, then, this film's plot could have had more depth. As a matter of fact, this wasn't even a science fiction movie at all, but rather an action movie. And so if the villain is shallow and without motives, chances are, that the hero will be shallow as well. A hero is defined by the degree of the antagonist's villainy after all. And the hero, Major Cage (played brilliantly by Tom Cruise) was just a soldier in a war, with a gift. His plight was simple. Save the world from evil robotic aliens.The action was fun. I bet this looked great in the theaters. I just hoped for something more. Something more politically driven, conspiratorial, or philosophical. In the end, it's a fairly unique story, with some clever directing and cool action scenes--but that's it. I admire the script and the slow dramatic buildup that the time loop creates. Each new day that Major Cage experiences led to new discoveries and new ways for him to defeat his enemy. I may watch this again simply for Tom Cruise's excellent performance--and of course--the impressive fireworks.",6,21,50,7 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," After almost 30 years, I finally have met my Messiah.
","I grew up with Yoda on my Lunchbox, Han Solo figure in my room with the blaster sounds, the Jabba the Hutt setup with the Rancor and Ewok village. Characters that I spent my whole life admiring and the ideology of the Force which inspires me spiritually throughout my life. I was born in 1977 and after all this time it all finally ended with such a bang and this time ROTS proved to be a very emotional movie. This movie redeemed George Lucas. It really did. I must admit, although I was disappointed in Episodes 1 and 2, I still watched both movies over 10 times already. I finally realized that they were nothing but a prelude to the story of Revenge of the Sith. Lucas needed 2 movies to set up his 3rd episode. The way he connects all the dots, and Lucas is a straight up genius, his writing and imagination is phenomenal. It all came together. I think AOTC did a great job with character development of Obi Wan and Anakin and the love story with him and Padme. I know realize why the Jedi code forbids any attatchments. Jedi must not fall in love with anyone, and after you watch ROTS, you will understand why.The movie will not disappoint Star Wars fans. I think the dialogue was fantastic, the only thing cheesy was of course the beginning when Anakin and Padme exchange 'I love you's' The acting gets better and better as the movie rolls along at a great pace. I thought Ian McDiermid was amazing. He was very disturbing in this film, more so than in Return of the Jedi. I thought Ewan McGregor had the second best performance. Very convincing, all the characters, even down to Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle who look like younger versions of the actors we saw in a New Hope. To bring balance to the force, you don't have to be good. Even the dark side can bring balance, and chosen heroes are flawed, and some even evil like Darth Vader. 4 stars, the best since Empire Strikes back !",9,2,8,19 May 2005
Arrival," Great visual poetry
","I didn't plan on seeing the film because I thought it was going to be another rehash of 2001 and Childhood's End and in a sense, it borrowed some ideas from those classics mentioned but in the end I was surprised to see that Arrival had a different spin on the genre. And most of all, I was surprised at Villeneuve's directorial prowess. This was a beautifully shot film.Its hard to describe this film without giving too much away. All I will say is that the film is more about the final message than any character driven drama. It took me a good 10 minutes of reflection after leaving the theater to soak everything in and I found Arrival to be a very cryptic film, and a film that is very relevant to real world events. It's not so much a science fiction film but more of a spiritual film, and a film that will make people take a close look at themselves, our civilization and humanity in general. All in all, a very positive movie, that will leave you feeling uplifted in the end.",8,0,3,30 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Funny, satirical take on modern show-biz, albeit a bit over-rated.
","I really had a fun two hours watching this film. It was brilliantly crafted, and some of the dialogue was classic. However, I cannot consider this film a masterpiece simply for its witty dialogue or its technical and artistic merits alone. Sadly, Birdman: the unexpected virtue of ignorance lacked deep characters. Keaton's plight never made them worthy of any emotional involvement on my part. The thing is...that the jokes didn't match the tone of the cast's acting because the performances were realistic. If this film had a slap- stick element to it, then it would've worked a bit better for this story.I do believe this film should win awards for the directorial effort and writing but as for Keaton--well, he wasn't bad at all, but he was out- staged by Ed Norton--who was fantastic in this film! I know this film will win plenty of statues this coming Sunday, but perhaps it deserves only a couple. Nevertheless, its worth a rent. After all, how many films deserve ONLY a couple of Oscars right? I will surely watch this film again for the behind the scenes moments in a major Broadway theater.",7,0,4,20 February 2015
Platoon," Excellent film. Every movie fan should not miss this
","What a great movie, I just saw it again after watching APOCALYPSE NOW, THE DEER HUNTER, and the recent WE WERE SOLDIERS. Yes, they are all great films but PlATOON is the best. Only Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET entertained me as much as Stone's nam film. Stone recounts the events he experienced in nam, and the acting by the character's is so good that you feel every ounce of their pain. Who's side would you choose? Barnes or Elias? It's a real emotional movie, unlike Kubrick's FMJ, and the is right on top of my best Vietnam movie list.",Null,0,1,4 March 2002
Platoon," A fantastic Vietnam tale
","Oliver Stone's PLATOON fascinated me. I recently Purchased the special edition on DVD and watching it the second time with Stone's commentary in the background was interesting. This is a recount of the events he experienced while stationed in nam. You can't help but love this movie, It's backed by great acting, especially Charlie Sheen who is supposed to be Oliver Stone and played the exact same part his father did in the movie APOCALYPSE NOW, as a Mellow Soldier who hasn't experienced enough combat to lose his mind yet. He narrates the film as well, explaining the chaos that is all around him and it really let's you feel what he is feeling. Overall i'd rate this flick an 9/10. Not as good as Kubrick's FMJ, but the 2nd best nam movie ever for sure.",Null,0,1,25 January 2002
Wonder Woman," The most relevant superhero film ever.
","(Spoilers)Wonder Woman is not your typical superhero film because there is no major super-villain or high tech super-weapon to challenge the superhero. In this story, the only challenges that Wonder Woman faces are the challenges we all face...and that is, the challenge to remain positive and selfless in a world tarnished by so much lust, greed, selfishness, hatred, and war. The movie opens up in present day with a narrative by Diana, and she explains a little bit of her backstory to Bruce Wayne in an email. I loved this inclusion into the film, as it brings the DC characters closer as we get ready for Justice League. And so as she writes Bruce, the film moves on to the beautiful Amazon Island, where Diana grew up. The film never really felt like an origin movie though, and these early scenes served as a means to explain why the Amazonian Goddesses no longer meddle in earthly affairs. We are quickly introduced to Trevor, the British air force pilot, played brilliantly by Chris Pine, who informs Diana and the Amazonian Princesses of the World War taking place on Earth. His story compels Diana to leave the island try to help mankind pull through the turmoil, in which her misanthropic mother, disagrees. Chris Pine stole the show along with Gadot, both displaying excellent chemistry. The feminism in this film was very light compared to some of the comic stories in the past. The social commentary was strong though, having to do with various social constraints placed on woman at the time, in Victorian England, as well as the structure of modern military, and the lack of honor in modern warfare. I thought the action in this film was beautiful, albeit, at times, over done, but only for a split second or two. For the most part, Wonder Woman awed me with her hand to hand combat, swordplay, and rope-play! Zack Snyder's visual style was all over this film, and it makes sense, given that he produced the film. In the end, Diana comes face to face with not only a threatening villain, or a threatening weapon, but more menacingly, she faces her own doubts and insecurities about mankind, which are depicted in the form of Ares, the God of War, who in my opinion, served as not just a physical threat, but metaphorically, a sort of mental one, a sort of voice in her mind, convincing her that mankind does not deserve her help... or the help of any God. In the end, Diana must decide;--does she abandon mankind? Or does she continue to have faith in it;--and if the latter, why? It doesn't take her long to figure out why after realizing why she had fallen in love with Trevor and even though mankind is flawed, Diana learns that Love is our savior, and it is up to us to allow ourselves to fight our doubts and fears so that they do not interfere with our ability to love;--because only love could save us all. 9 out of 10.",9,17,34,1 June 2017
Paths of Glory," Snubbed of the many Oscars it deserved
","United Artists turned down Kubrick on numerous occasions to produce Paths of Glory. Thankfully Kirk Douglass had the same vision Kubrick did and knew the film would be a successful one, so he dished out the money to produce the film. Kubrick is definatly my favorite director of all time, and I haven't even seen all of his films! I never saw the previous three movies before Paths of Glory, but i must say this film ranks up there with Full Metal Jacket.           Whoever says Kubrick does not make emotional films is so wrong. Paths of Glory is as sad as a movie I have ever seen. The three French soldiers sentenced to die made me feel as if I was joining them to face the firing squad. Kirk Douglass was great as Col. Dax, who tries to defend his men. This is an anti-war movie and one of the most powerful, even more emotional than Speilberg's SPR, and Scott's Black Hawk Down. Full Metal Jacket was considered an anti-war film, but itlacked the emotion this movie had.           The last scene was so sad and so true. We are all human, their is no real enemy. The only enemy in war is war itself. One of the best Kubrick films ever! **** 4 stars!!!!",Null,0,0,11 February 2002
X-Men: First Class," Well acted, well told, but has a cheap feel to it
","I enjoyed this X-men very much because of the script and performances by the two leads. But there was something missing I thought, and realized what it was after watching the old X-Men films after coming home from the theater.X-Men First Class had some epic sets, and some very good CGI, but the pacing was off, and at times looked cheap. The direction was OK in some spots when it came to the pure shots, and cinematography, but the story felt choppy. Scenes ended too fast at times and there just was no atmosphere in this film. It was as if cheap cameras were used to film this, with no camera filters. It almost had the quality of a Smallville type television series. Or even Heroes...it felt like it was made for basic TV. The word Epic can't be used to describe this film even though I'd like to call it epic.Anyhows, I'm a big X-men fan, and wasn't let down. The story was pure X-men, basic, and an origins story, and so no surprises in this one. Magneto was written in a way that made him less hated. Xavier's character was played very well, and had some charm to go along with the wisdom. I also thought the score was good at times, and sometimes sounding like Parade music. The Marvel films need better scores in general, and it's as if this movie was influenced somehow by Disney. The best way to sum it up is like this. The old X-men films felt more like the new Batman films, and First Class felt more like the Tim Burton films. I just think it's tough to call this the best X-men film of all time. I don't think it is.",7,1,6,9 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," An instant classic that will haunt you for years to come.
","(SPOILER FREE)Christopher Nolan has outdone himself with The Dark Knight Rises. The power behind both it's plot and the chilling visuals that Nolan brings to the screen will haunt you and scare you like no horror movie can. Not only is this a film about overcoming fear, like the first film, or learning about sacrifice like the 2nd film; The Dark Knight Rises is a film ironically contradicting the first film in that Batman needed to be fearful again in order to succeed. Rises also presented itself with a plot that embodies many of today's real world political arguments.The Dark Knight was always called the Citizen Kane of our time, but comparing that film to TDKR is like comparing a slice of pizza to a whole pie. TDKR is the nutshell, and unlike the previous installment, is tied to Batman Begins a bit more. In a sense, it feels like the real 'Part 2' of the trilogy, whereas TDK was the subplot, like the ones included at the end of a monthly DC comic to flesh out a story arc. This 3rd and final movie matches the emotions induced from the first film, and is the darkest and most terrifying one of them all. If you're expecting humor, or fun, or just want to be entertained. Forget it. This is not an entertaining film. It's dark, its serious, and more violent then the last 2 as well. As a viewer, I was thrown into the middle of a modern world on the cusp of apocalypse and anarchy. And Nolan presented such a rich atmosphere that a pang of panic shuddered through me for most of the experience.Now, I'm a huge Batman fan, and wanted to bring up what I thought from a comic book geek's perspective. Yes, I was always a bit harsh on Nolan for not being nostalgic enough, and even Batman Begins felt a bit too realistic. TDKR does pay homage to the comics here and there, but very little. However, I've come to grips with Nolan's vision, since he is just an absolute master director; although could use work on his writing. I loved the lines in this film, especially those spoken by Wayne, Alfred and Bane, but what Nolan needs to work on is plot holes. He is not a great writer by far, and neither is his brother because there are some few plot holes in this movie that could have been addressed. But he can sure pace a film. TDKR plays out like a novel, each scene slowly building tension, and at times, certain scenes break this tension, but not too much. Perhaps, there his huge budget led him to shoot and write too many scenes, and some could have been sacrificed to make room for necessary scenes. A minor gripe...and I would love to see a director's cut. All this is easily overlooked after witnessing such masterful film direction. Nolan used inspirations from everything from spaghetti western films, Kubrick's silent wide angle shots, movies like Metropolis and Spartacus come to mind at times, and it's safe to say that this film is more like a war movie instead of an urban crime drama. Nolan's own patented quick cuts are less frequent in this film, and even John Carpenter's famous apocalyptic urban opera, Escape from New York comes to mind when watching TDKR.I won't get into the acting too much, Bale is the best Batman by far, and he is the best in this film. My favorite performance was from Gordon Levitt. A fine actor and I look forward to seeing him in more films; Nolan films preferred! And as for Bane not being menacing? well, I disagree. He was physically menacing, and if you were disappointed in the fight scenes in TDK like I was, then you will surely leave the theater satisfied this time out. The fist fights in this film are breathtaking to say the least, Nolan puts you right in the middle of them, no music, just the sound of fists hitting bone.9/10 for incredible film directing, pacing, score, and top-notch acting by the entire cast. This is a hardcore, old school film with lots of extras, and minimal CGI. The chilling villains and the steps they take to carry out their ideals and goals are absolutely terrifying. I live in Gotham City myself, NYC to be exact, and seeing the city in absolute states of anarchy had haunted me for hours after leaving the theater. I would have given this a perfect 10 if not for the choppiness of the story. The end felt cut to death, as if Nolan took a 5 hour film and condensed it to two and half hours. This film needed more scenes...but instead, there were too many time jumps...and it really hurt the pacing of the film. It's a shame that there was never a directors cut... :(",9,8,18,20 July 2012
Mother!," Poignant messages in the form of visual poetry.
","This movie is an absolute gem and work of art. I know that Aronofsky films aren't for everyone but I highly recommend this movie even if you're not into allegorical storytelling. Each character in this film is a metaphor for something, and each plot trope an allegory of some sort. If anyone happens to watch it, keep in mind that she is Mother Nature and the husband represents god or mankind in general. If you keep that in mind, the movie will make perfect sense. It's great visual poetry that delves into the destructive nature of mankind to both nature and itself. It's a very cynical story, and if it would have ended on a more uplifting and inspiring note, it may have gotten better reviews.",9,0,2,31 December 2017
Creed II," A dispassionate production of 2 stories in one film
","Creed 2 is a story split in half. One half is a story about love, sacrifice and family life in the modern world, where husband and wife are often taken with career and are unable to raise children. I loved this part of the movie, the relationship subplot between Adonis and Bianca was well written and both Tessa Thompson and Michael Jordan performed best when they were together on screen.The 2nd half of the story is the boxing part, which was terrible. It was written poorly, acted poorly, especially by Stallone. I though Sylvester Stallone was an absolute piece of iron in this film, no pun intended. Just like Ivan Drago called him in Rocky 4, Stallone was as stiff and as wooden as ever. His acting was just flat out lethargic and bad.It was so predicatable....and in a sense, it was a remake of Rocky 4 and Rocky 3 mixed together. One of the most unoriginal Rocky movies ever. A complete cash cow in every sense of the word. I was hoping for some remorse from Drago, perhaps a showing of respect between him and Rocky, but there was none of that. The scene between Rocky and Ivan in the restaurant was cringe worthy.Michael B Jordan is a pretty good actor and overall, he was excellent in this. He stole every scene. I loved Tessa but she lacked energy during the fight scenes. She hardly seemed scared for her husband as he took a beating.I can't give this film more than a 6. I admit, I was never bored during watching despite the horrible writing. There were some good, human, heartfelt moments, including at the end. I doubt I would watch this film again though, unlike Rocky 4, which was a film I've seen over a dozen times.",6,0,1,7 March 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," One of the top 5 best in the Superhero genre.
","A lot of people are calling this film depressing, but that's because it treads on many topics that people would rather not hear about;-- topics that people would rather shut out, and focus on comedies instead. A lot of movie-goers don't want to hear about the world's ills, and how to make the world a better place. But it's a story we need in the Superhero genre.Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman are depicted as forces of nature and forces of politics. Superman is the embodiment of an angel, and Batman the fallen angel. Superman is essentially a representation of America, a country that has reshaped the modern world with technology and many are questioning whether or not Superman has failed mankind. The same could be said for America today in the real world, as more and more people are wondering if America is doing more harm than good by trying to spread modernity to countries stuck in their antiquated ways. I loved how Superman was treated in this movie. He is almost a silent character, But his actions do speak volumes in this movie! As for Batman, well he is more of a cynic. Unlike Superman, Batman lost his child-like innocence a long time ago, and to see Superman heading down the same path as Batman is heart-breaking. As for the political insinuations, Superman is beginning to cross the line of fascism, and Batman of course, wants to maintain democracy. But as democracy continues to fail in the world, Batman starts to become the very dictator he fears Superman will one day become, and as for Wonder Woman, she is the old soul, never giving up on humanity and ensuring that Batman and Superman keep the faith as well.The film's tone is so much different than Man Of Steel. It's dark, somber, and even more so than Watchmen, which was a rated R film. Of course, Batman v. Superman is intended as a rated R film, but the theatrical cut is PG-13, even though it doesn't feel like one. Batman is a Batman that will do anything to survive a fight, including shoot, stab and kill his way to victory;--albeit, usually in self defense. Ben Affleck steals ever scene. Not only when fighting, but even as Bruce Wayne. Never have I seen such a wise Batman before. This Batman bears the carriage of a leader. He's smart, intuitive, confident, tormented, an insomniac and demonic. Affleck is without a doubt, the best Batman ever depicted on the big screen, and even though Affleck didn't redefine the role like Christian Bale did, he surely had a better written role to work with than Bale had and so that is why I think he's the best Batman ever.Jesse Eisenberg was also one of the film's standouts and to sum his performance in one world, I'd say he was maniacal; even Joker-like. I did feel that his motives were questionable though. I would have preferred a few more scenes regarding his back-story, telling us, the audience, why he would hate authoritative people other than the fact that his dad used to beat on him. I felt as if we were thrown into this DC cinematic world, sort of like jumping in the middle of a comic book run. Snyder sort of did this with Watchmen, as we were suddenly introduced to a bunch of characters that have known each other for a long time and had such good chemistry and history together, without ever seeing much of that history on screen. Note, that I will revise this review once I watch the directors cut. I loved the way the other Justice League members were featured in this film. Very mysterious ! I didn't think they would fit into the story but they did, and never did they feel like they were just throw into the mix. Especially the Flash! He mattered!There are some other gripes worth mentioning, like Wonder Woman's short cameo and the Batmobile car chase. I would have preferred less CGI and more real car stunts like in the TDK trilogy. I also disliked the Doomsday fight scenes. The choreography was great, but the setting was a mess. Wouldn't it be better if they used a rubber suit for Doomsday? Like something that looks like the Predator? That would've been epic!Now I can't end this review without once again mentioning Henry Cavil as Superman. I'm still feel disappointed in his role. He still feels like a baby in this film, confused, new to the world, unsure, and child-like. He never displayed the wisdom that Kara Danvers displays on CBS's Supergirl show for example. However, I still cared for him in the film because of this naivety. When he fought Batman, I cringed whenever Batman got the upper-hand, because I had more invested in his character than Batman.For me, it's all too easy to overlook the film's flaws. I'm a big DC fan, and I consider this film a masterpiece superhero film more than film, and although not as cohesive as MOS, its just as esoteric and theological. I also thought that the heroes aren't as charismatic as those in Watchmen. If you ever wanted to know what a real-life Superhero must be like in real life, then go watch this film. Chances are, they'd be depressed as hell, and misanthropic nihilists with zero personality whatsoever. The film is full of great philosophical dialogue, poetic cinematography, with deeper meanings beneath the surface of many scenes and the film has a real world gravitas to it. It's a human study, and a political study, in poetic fashion! 10/10! Simply one of the best Superhero films of all time!",9,15,22,24 March 2016
Blade Runner," Stunning!!
","Next to Kubrick, Ridley Scott is one of the greatest when it comes to visuals. Ridley Scott is a genius plain and simple, and it shows in Blade Runner. A former cop (Harrison Ford) who's job was to track and detect replicants, who at one point were accepted as humans and now outlawed on Earth, is called back to track down 3 replicant's who are dangerous to society. The movie is not too action packed but instead makes you think about life and our creator. Comparisons of humans and these man made replicants constantly cross your mind throughout the film. The setting is Los Angeles in 2019. Is the world really going to look like that in 17 years!!! Flying cars? huge pyramid like skyscrapers with flames spitting out of them!! i don't think so but apparently Ridley thought so back in the 80's. This movies is just beautiful to watch, and I rate it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,29 January 2002
The Deer Hunter," Very emotional and simply great!
","When i heard This movie had 2 of my favorite actors in it, (DeNiro, and Walken) i went and bought it, despite my friends telling me that it was bad. Well after watching the film, i realized that i should never listen to my friend's opinion's about movie's again. This movie was very good, not perfect but very good and I would not consider this a war movie, it explains the effect of the vietnam war on a tightly knit bunch of friends. It turns out to be very depressing, and i couldn't sleep after the movie ended. It depressed me because the war ruined these people. But at the end it's a sad ending and a happy ending at the same time, so the movie does leave you smiling as the credits scroll up the screen. There were many moments in this film that will be stuck in my mind forever, especially those disturbing Russian roulette scenes. The acting was phenominal, and i found it to be a symbolic movie. The deer hunting was symbolic, but that's for you to find out. The only bad thing about the movie was the length. This movie did not have to be 31/2 hrs long, it could of been 3 hrs tops. The wedding scene was too long, but that builds up the character's i guess. Overall i rate this movie a 7 out of 10 and i give it ***1/2 stars.",Null,0,0,6 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's just part one of a 3 part trilogy, keep that in mind.
","(Spoiler Free) Episode 7 is nothing more than an introduction to what will inevitably become a new Star Wars trilogy. Just when the film started to get good, it ended! The main characters never really developed, and the the supporting ones had little screen time. BB-8 was adorable, and I did like Kylo Ren, he's going to make for an interesting villain, despite his goofy boy next door looks. Note how I said, 'Going to make' So far, we got too little of him to judge. But he's a promising villain. Harrison Ford acted well, and Hans Solo seemed like the same Hans Solo of the past. Ray and Finn were also good. They put a lot of heart into their performances, but, their story is only just beginning. It's easy to say that this film had little plot, but after all, didn't episode 4 have little plot? We didn't get to find out that Vadar was his father until the next film!Okay, so as the end credits rolled, I felt like I wanted more, but I'm not complaining. I gave the film an 8 after all, and even though it sounds like I'm disappointed, I did like a lot of things about this film. I docked two points because I felt myself wanting more and we will indeed get more once the other movies are made. It just stinks that we have to wait so long to see this story through. Don't get me wrong, this film was well acted. The dialogue was very good, it was funny too, and the nostalgic elements had me teary eyed a few times. I thought that the film almost felt small, at least it did when you compare it to the prequels because this film was made in the image of the original trilogy. Bigger sets, less green screen and more props. I'll take it over CGI any day, but the prequels still felt bigger and grander overall because they the CGI did all the work. And I can't help but find myself disappointed in the score for this film. John Williams is getting old...its no secret now after hearing the music in this film. No memorable pieces...no music on par with the old stuff.The light saber battles were not as impressive as the ones in previous episodes either. Yes, I understand that JJ didn't want the sword fights to look like ballet dancing, and JJ went for a more realistic approach, but we don't go see Star Wars movies for realistic sword fights. I missed the elegant choreography from the previous films. Remember how dramatic the light saber battles were in the other six films? They all were shot with no background music. No dialogue. Just the sound of light sabers. Well, JJ did leave out music for the final battle, but it just didn't have any wow factor. The sabers looked too damn heavy! Perhaps its because the final light saber battle was fought by 2 people who were newly acquainted with the force. If you look at it that way, then, perhaps JJ made the right choice after all!8/10 for the excellent pacing, direction, dialogue, action and more importantly, the nostalgia!",8,0,12,17 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The movie that establishes LOTR as the best trilogy ever!
","First off I'm rating the 3rd part of the trilogy, if I were to rate the trilogy as a whole I would give it a 10 because nothing compares to LOTR. Starwars? can't say the first trilogy compares, those films were made over 25 years ago,  and the 3rd episode is not out yet so I have to exclude the 2nd Starwars trilogy from the comparison.The Return of the king is the greatest out of the 3 movies. The FOTR introduced the characters and had classic scenes in it, but not as exciting as the ROTK.   TTT started out slow, although it had the best non Cgi battle ever in the battle of helm's deep. The ROTK is Jackson's best film in terms of his directing.  I thought he did the best job at pacing the movie, creating the largest Cgi aided battle ever, and having such tremendous actors to work with. Every character in this movie seems like they are born for the role, and you really get to care for these characters like no other film, what more can you ask for in a film? jaw dropping visuals, balanced special effects, blends Cgi and realism like no other movie, and of course top-notch acting.This movie sets the standards of future films. In my mind it tops out Matrix and the Starwars flicks, I mean, seriously, what films, blend in all of the essentials of a perfect film? Great Acting, amazing sets that should be considered a sin, if they knock them all down, and demolish such beautiful sets. cgi used sparingly, and a Cgi character(Gollum) that probably deserves the best supporting actor oscar. Jackson gets your blood pumping and plays with your emotions. Just when you think something is going to happen, just the opposite does, I can't remember being on the edge of a seat for so long. One Flaw....any time you adapt a story from a book, important parts are cut out..and people that complain about the running time, shouldn't go to the theatre to see such long movies. **** 4 stars",9,0,0,21 December 2003
Godzilla," For the fans.
","If you are not into the Godzilla lore, then stay away from this film. You won't like it. If Godzilla mythology isn't your thing, and you simply want to see a good, visual action-flick, then skip this one. It's nothing you haven't seen before.The thing with Godzilla is that it differs from other monster films, which are mostly all style and no substance. Believe it or not, Godzilla at its core is film with a message--and a film that makes you wonder what scientists are doing behind the scenes...horrible things...that destroy the Earth.As a Godzilla fan, it's easy to give this film a 7/10 because I'm biased towards it. However, it is far from the best Godzilla film ever made. There was very little philosophy in the script, and only a few lines to provoke thought.The acting was atrocious...and yes, atrocious is the proper word here. The only exception is the role played by Brian Cranston, who absolutely stole every scene he was in. I was however, highly disappointed in the acting of almost everyone else in the film. There was no proper display of fear coming out of everyone from the main star, Taylor Johnson, to the extras, and to the military personnel. It was bad, really, really bad! Luckily, the film looked beautiful. Hauntingly beautiful. Godzilla fans will cheer in the end. Casual fans may not.",6,3,7,17 May 2014
Deadpool," Saturday Night Live skit of the superhero archetype
","I enjoyed this film. You will laugh from the opening credits to the very end, but I think the coolest parts of the film weren't just the jokes but the character himself. Deadpool, AKA Wade Wilson, a rip off of DC's Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) but still a cool, unique character nonetheless--and a tormented character with a lot of baggage. I thought the film actually did the character a disservice because they could have used all that inner torment to make a great revenge story, but instead, we got a bunch of cliché scenes and a really flat villain, a villain whose name I couldn't even remember after leaving the theater and a villain who had as much depth and motive as any typical villain of the week on a superhero TV series.Now, for my biggest gripe. I just hate it when actors talk to the audience throughout the film, or when actors refer to themselves by their real name, like Ryan Reynolds mentioning the name Ryan Reynolds. That just takes me out of the film and tells me that I'm watching something akin to an SNL skit. I am not really a Deadpool reader and so I don't know if they do this in the comic books, but if so, they should stop. Deadpool is a really interesting character, more interesting than the character he was inspired from (Deathstroke) and he should be taken a bit more seriously. Okay, maybe I'm taking this too serious! I love the jokes, but this was overkill. I take my superheroes serious!!!I score this a 7 out of 10. A movie with a score of a 7 or higher means that I will watch this movie again, at least one more time.",7,1,11,20 February 2016
The Thin Red Line," My Favorite of all WW2 movies.
","It is hard for me to believe that THE THIN RED LINE did not recieve any oscars. The cinematography in this movie was amazing, I'm talking about jaw dropping shots. It was a movie with no flaws, great acting, directing, and some of the best shots ever in any movie. I loved the battle scenes. I thought they were so realistic, and very emotional. The philosophy in the movie is what sets it apart from the other WW2 flicks, and Saving Private Ryan's shallow storyline. SPR is not better than TTRL. Not even close, I slept on this movie and It's a big mistake if you havent seen it, and still choose not too, just because it recieved such little recognition. This is a classic in my mind, and will be a fine addition to my DVD collection. I hope you take this review seriously, go and watch this picture, if you appreciate great movies, then you wont be dissapointed. **** 4stars",8,0,0,24 June 2002
Green Book," A charming character and social study but its ridden with cliches.
","If I were to sum this film up it would be funny, charming, pretty and unoriginal. Every stereotype about African Americans in the 1960s is reversed and removed from the black character and placed on the white character. It's a rehash of a dark part of American history, shown via the adventure of two people on the opposite ends of the social spectrum.What really disappointed me however was the acting by Viggo Mortensen. His New York City accent was borderline terrible. I'm from NYC and I am Italian American. It was unnatural. People do not force their accents like that here. His performance reminded me of Travolta's accent in Saturday Night Fever. Way over the top and forced.Gripes aside, the two main characters have decent chemistry and their growing bond over the course of the film feels genuine and felt. The cinematography and set designs were spectacular as well. It's not the most dramatic film though. I can't give Green Book more than a 6/10. Worth a watch but very forgettable.",6,6,10,21 February 2019
Gangs of New York," Passionate movie making.
","How can you not appreciate the amazing effort and passion that went into this film. Scorsese is an artist with a camera. I'm not being biased here because I'm a Newyorker but c'mon, what's with all of these bad ratings? This movie is one of a kind. The set design alone, along with the fantastic costumes should be enough, but The acting by Daniel Day Lewis was just mind boggling. This man became a character and acted with passion. The academy basically stole the Oscar from him. Leo showed us why he is so inconsistent. He was great in Catch Me If You Can. But in GONY he was bland. Nothing to him, bad irish accent, did not fit the role at all, as well as my lovely favorite actress Cameron Diaz. I thought she was miscast as well, but Bill 'the butcher' saved the acting aspect in this film. As far as the story goes, look at it as a documentary. It's a history lesson, and the realism is unmatched. The story does feel a bit rushed, but this movie does not lack heart. I thought it had a lot of it. Altough some actors were miscast, they were not terrible. I think most people think it's a mindless gory film with no heart. But I disagree. It was a realistic portrait of 19th century NY city.  NYC is still very similar today, and if you think the NYPD is not a gang, then you're nuts. We have our rich, our poor, slums that the politicians don't care about. They rob us here too with outrageous ticket prices. *** stars out of 4. You just have to appreciate they good aspects that make the bad aspects meaningless.",9,0,0,12 July 2003
Moon," Fantastic 90 minute Twilight Zone episode ! ( Minor SPOILERS)
","I was thrilled when I saw this film on my satellite TV on demand list. I immediately toggled down the movie list with anticipation knowing how good the reviews were and I wasn't let down despite the high expectations.Science fiction fans will love this film. It has overtones of 2001, and Solaris. Basically, GERTY, the computer that controls the space station will remind you of HAL 9000 from 2001. The movie shares some plot driven elements from the movies Solaris as well. But other than that, the story is entirely original and what a great one it is.The movie starts slow, but then picks up a bit, and grabs a hold of you. Each scene makes the next one better, and the mystery never ends until that final scene. Sam Rockwell is always great, he's an A-list guy for sure. At least he should be, he's very good in this film although a bit comical in some scenes that felt out of place even though you knew he was going out of his mind.GERTY is voiced over by the great Kevin Spacey, and wasn't as spooky sounding as HAL 9000 but he has the perfect voice for a computer. GERTY was a character in this film, and it was intriguing to see some hints of humanity coming from GERTY, it was touching in fact! Unlike HAL 9000, GERTY was a sympathetic computer in this film and in this film you will feel very bad for the protagonist for sure.The CGI was great when seen, but there was not too much CGI in this film. I'd compare the overall production to Pandorum since it feels more epic than it is. It's a B-movie, but doesn't feel like it. The soundtrack was excellent too. I would rate it higher than an 8 but I feel the story wasn't entirely original because of the influences from the films I mentioned above. It felt like a long Twilight Zone episode, and had Hitchcock flavor as well!",8,1,8,30 April 2010
Warcraft," The best Fantasy film since Avatar
","I loved Warcraft. It really makes you think about the human condition, Take a look at the movie poster for this film;--it is fascinating, depicting the leaders of two warring factions, one with red war paint, and the other, with blue. The tag-line for the film is;-- 'Two worlds; one home.' So many films are centered around that whole 'red vs. blue' thesis. And it seems like this trend has a real world gravitas to it, when you consider the fact that our civilization was always in a sort of civil war with itself.But not just politically. In a sense, I found that these two particular factions in the film, the 'orcs,' and the 'humans,' represented the duality of man. The Orcs, our animal side, and the Royal Blue side, is our left-brain analytical computer brain side. The ideological conflict that arises in this film is no different than what we have gone through on this planet, conflicted between 2 worlds, the natural and technological, and cycling through revelation. And during the time of Revelation, the two sides of human nature will result in a conflict. The world will be divided into two groups. One group, will deal with the world's pressing problems with their conditioned, conservative, pre-programmed responses of the past, and the other group, will be ready to embrace change and step into the unknown.The acting in this film was solid, Ben Foster stole the cake in my opinion. He's a fine actor that guy. I wish there was more make-up and set design in the film, but with CGI this good, It hardly irked me. The CGI and motion capture acting was some of the best I've ever seen! I look forward to a sequel!",8,0,3,16 June 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Believe it or not, this is an important film, and this is why
","(MINOR SPOILERS) I know I'm saying a lot by summarizing it this way, but I can't help but feel right in doing so. Before I review all aspects of the film, I'll talk about the story.The story is being reviewed as convoluted, choppy and all over the place. And I can admit it can seem so for some audiences, but I think the film is directed for a target audience. I'd say Star Trek Trekkers! If you're a hard core Trekker, than this might be the best film ever created. It sounds bold, but I seriously feel that this is the case. I might sound corny for saying so, but I acknowledge that. And this is why I believe it is one of the most important films of all time.In Transformers, and Transformers 2, we saw some simple good vs. evil battles, great action, and funny scenes. In Transformers 3 Dark of The Moon, we get a whole lot more. More in plot, and a much more subliminal tale that blends fiction with historical account. If you believe in The Secret Space Program, E.T. controlled governments, and UFO's, or plain and simple; aliens amongst us, than this film is the nutshell. I believe that Transformers 3 and it's plot is basically centered around conspiracy theories that have been running since the 50's. This is E.T. disclosure in fiction form, You will see simulated stock footage of John F. Kennedy discussing UFO's. Only to see real stock footage right after wards. You will see astronaut Neil Armstrong in a cameo appearance, only to see a scene of him taking an oath not to discuss his knowledge of aliens on the moon and on Earth. Why would Neil Armstrong agree to the role if he didn't agree with all of this?! It's absolutely perplexing to me.The movie was darker than the previous 2. Less comedy, but thought Shia Lebouf was the best in this 3rd installment. He was very good, and as funny as ever. But yes, the movie lacks emotion as most critics say, but It doesn't matter, it's a plot driven film, not a character film. The CGI is the best I've ever seen, simple as that. It surpasses Avatar's CGI by far, I was absolutely mesmerized by the CGI in this film, and the previous 2 Transformers films do not compare to this one. Even the fight scenes were well choreographed, where as in the past 2 films, they seemed blurry and rushed.This is Micheal Bay's best film. It's his masterpiece, without any doubt! I just wish the film was rated R, like I said in my review in the other Transformers film that you can find on here. I think a more serious tone would have made this less campy and just better.In the end, there is an all to powerful message. All the evil in this world is due to a spiritually evil Extraterrestrial intelligence that intervened with our technological progression. And there is also a good kind of E.T.'s keeping us safe. Whether through their messengers, or not.Star Trek fans, be advised, there are many homages here to Spock in this film, some of his most famous lines are used, and after all, he is voicing Sentinel Prime, so why not! 9/10 I'd give it a round 10 if it wasn't for the lack of emotion, and lack of care for the characters. But like I said, it's the plot that is good, not so much a character driven film.",9,19,30,12 July 2011
The Martian," Boring, unemotional, but beautiful.
","The Martian is another big budgeted blockbuster by Ridley Scott, who I like the call, the hit or miss director. I loved all of his classic films, and who doesn't right? I loved Prometheus, and the underrated Kingdom of Heaven, but lately, he's been a bit off. I don't think this will be the flop that Exodus was; because it is more catered to the casual moviegoer of all ages. Exodus was messy at times because it was the product of an entire group of people, rather than the single vision of Ridley Scott. I think Ridley did a fine job with this film as far as pacing goes and directing, but the writing was iffy and juvenile at times.The script was an adaptation of a highly acclaimed novel, a novel that I never read but I have a feeling that the fans of the book will be disappointed because I just never felt bad for the main protagonist. Matt Damon's fantastic performance was not enough to save the film in my opinion. I think he'll be nominated for a best actor Oscar and he deserves to be. He was absolutely hilarious too, many of his lines were clearly improvised, but never once did I feel myself rooting for him. He was a character without back-story, without family, and without something to live for. He hardly lost a single pound of weight during his ordeal and the obstacles he faced did not produce any amount of tension at all. He had a lot of tools at his disposal, and the solutions to his problems were solved easily. He came off like a vacationer at a resort rather than someone in grave peril.Most of the film was spent on NASA officials and their hypothetical solutions for the rescue mission. An entire hour was spent on the plan, and the plan B, and the plan C. As I watched, I kept saying to myself, 'Just save him already!' The scientifically minded moviegoer will cherish these scenes, and at times, the solutions by the protagonist were clever, but there was nothing close to the wow factor of pseudo science. Natural elements, from gravity to sugar were used in creative ways, and the making of water from out of thin air was cool, but it all just felt like a science lesson. Some people might be wowed by it all, but I wasn't. What wowed me was the set design. Ridley Scott and his art directors are as good as they come. Visually speaking, this movie blows away anything seen on screen before, and that includes Interstellar, Prometheus and Gravity. The sets, props, and CGI were stunning. But all in all a disappointing film. When I spend 12 dollars on a movie, I expect one or both of two things. For one, I want to be emotionally stimulated. This movie failed to do that for me. And if the film is labeled as science fiction, then I expect a clever script, a story that makes you think. This was far from an esoteric film and it was not on par with great survival films such as Cast Away or Alive either. If this were a film that was based on a true story, it would've had a bigger impact on me. But it's just a futuristic adventure story, unoriginal, and a boring one at that. 6 out of 10.",6,10,76,1 October 2015
The Fighter," This Film is hard to forget
","I rarely go to the movies anymore, saving my money for the good films, and this one was one of them. The critics got it right with The Fighter, it really is one of those old fashioned films. It feels like an Independent film, not a Paroumount Production. The direction felt like that of a Clint Eastwood film, each character fleshed out to the fullest, even the ones with just a couple of scenes, they each fit into to the story in their own ways.What made the movie great was the performances. All around, especially by Christian Bale, I really can't help but wonder about this man. He is a fine actor and I always knew that, but after Terminator 4 I wondered about his future. I thought money got to him, but he's back to form, and this was his best performance since The Machinist and The Prestige. It's as if Bale always plays a lunatic in all his films, he's just that type of actor, but He just doesn't play a yelling and insane lunatic in this film, he plays an eccentric and emotional role. Even comedic at times. And he really molded into the role and put his heart into it. I didn't even know it was him at times, the weight loss added to it as well. It's amazing how this man loses and gains weight from film to film.Melissa Leo was phenomenal ! Where did she come from? Great emotive acting from her part, I'm now a fan. And Amy Adams also has a great future in this business, what a job by her as well, never has a movie been full of so many great performances by the whole cast. Oddly enough Mark Wahlberg was the only one who was forgettable in this film. He wasn't bad, but nothing outstanding. His fighting was also shoddy, the choreography was poor in my opinion. He didn't convince me in the ring, Hilliary Swank was more convincing in Million Dollar Baby. Just like DeNiro was in Raging Bull and Will Smith in Ali. They actually looked like boxers, Wahlberg looked as if he never threw a punch in his life.All in all, a great film, even though it's predictable as all True Stories are. The screenplay was solid ,as were the performances. A contender for multiple Oscar nominations.",8,0,1,4 January 2011
The Godfather," Perfect !
","Francis Ford Coppola's version of the Mario Puzo best seller is simply perfect. It is without a doubt the best American Film of all time. If you have never seen The Godfather, and you appreciate great movies, then go out and purchase it. This movie should not even be available for rent because it should be in everyone's movie library. This is a movie with the most ultimate character development. Each scene makes the next one better. The restaurant scene was one of the most tense scenes in cinema history. This isn't just a gangster film; it's a film about cause and effect, what would, could and should be. It's action scenes are a bit dated now, but the directing was masterful here. In my opinion, it's better than the sequel.",10,1,3,25 January 2002
