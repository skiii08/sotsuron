Miracle," ...from a purely 'business perspective'...
","...it's one of the best examples of 'Business-crises Management' I've ever seen. Kurt Russell - playing Herb Brooks so well you'll barely recognize Kurt - is a true business manager: 'I'm so sick and tired of hearing about the Soviets...now go out there and TAKE IT'!!Who said 'business management' isn't exciting?...who??? take names on a clip-board and kick some butt. I saw the Real McCoy when it happened - true tears of joy, and my knees were shaking so bad I couldn't even stand up from the couch to cheer - I don't even have a business degree. And fortunately, you don't need one either to enjoy this really, terrific film.~ 9.5 out of 10 for pure entertainment and true-to-life history. No? here's a quarter - go buy a life...",9,1,1,12 December 2005
The Big Blue," ...caught you holding your breath, didn't I?...
","...I certainly held mine.If you ever wanted to know what the international sport of SCUBA-less, very-deep, 'free-diving' was about, here's your film with a dream-like twist.Haunting, exquisite, sublime, beautifully photographed and scored, THE BIG BLUE will find you pushing-the-envelope inside your own lungs right on the living room couch. You'll find Jean Reno at his best - and you'll definitely want the recipe for 'Spaghetti Fruti di Mari.' I'm very partial to the US version (and I own both the US and European CDs) with John Conti's superior musical score (others agree - see Pat Epstein's review). I loved Luc Besson's international flavor in this film. Prepare a Greek or Italian dinner for your friends, open a fresh bottle of Chianti or Ouzo, butter the Italian/French bread-loaf slices, launch yourself into the couches around the coffee table, push the 'Play' button and enjoy...'Roberto, yo parma!'",9,2,4,28 January 2006
The Legend of 1900," Well, lookey - a Diamond! ONE of the reasons we go to the movies...
","For myself, I've read every single comment on this film - took me a while (208 to date). Some have made me think deeper about it. Still, I find it one of the most pathos-infused stories-put-to-celluloid I've had the privilege of viewing (please read the book...). If your spirit can't find the uplifting benefit in this film, I'd have to question your personal character, your outlook on life - or your moral turpitude. What's not to like about a ship-born infant whose, ultimately, self-imposed life at sea fosters his world-class musical talent - but which bungles the one, single, opportunity to requite the land-based love of his life?Beautifully crafted, exquisitely shot, immaculately directed. If you have no ear for the extreme craftsmanship of (Tim Roth's or Clarence William III's) piano, or (Vincent Taylor Pruitt's) trumpet, I'm sorry for you. If you have no eye for divine camera-work, go play a video war-game. And if you can't recognize great acting when you see it then attend a rally for your local politician. But, if you have a sense for the ethereal within real life, an imagination to go with it, and your body still has the ability to produce real tears, then watch this film. It will cleanse you. 'THE LEGEND OF 1900' is ONE of the few reasons we go to the movies - they complete us. Believe me - I wept. Kudos to the fine actors, director (Giuseppe Tornatore), and musical composer (Ennio Morricone). Bob Shank Jr. Tucson, AZ",10,1,5,20 June 2009
The Red Violin," ...and so we learn the 'mystery'... (spoiler at hand)
","Excels beyond finer celluloid fare, and most certainly, ambitious....but you have to be 'ready' and 'comfortable' for this film. I like 'weymo's' commentary from Atlanta: '...the perfect movie for a rainy autumn Sunday afternoon when everything is quiet but the popping of the fire and the creaking of your favorite easy chair.' ...well said. And 'courage' to Francois Girard and Don McKellar for making the effort to put us in that perfect spot. But as Dylan Thomas once said - and Bob Dylan echoed many years later - 'Do not go gentle into that good night...(Mr Taborine Man)', or you will find yourself wanting. Having said that, pay attention to the real plot: WHAT MADE Le Violon 'rouge'? Why, blood, sweat and tears of course -- particularly, the foremost. And it wasn't without a bit of hand-crafted genius from Nicolo Bussotti...such trade sorely lacking, these days, I'm afraid.Go beyond yourself; take a step into the mysterious - see the film, and think about 'another world' right here on your own planet Earth, with all it's failures - and serendipities. We DO produce some good 'bling' from time-to-time....and I only 'tune' computers.",Null,0,0,9 November 2005
