The Avengers," Avengers is awesome!
","Marvel's The Avengers is a fantastic movie! Director Josh Wheldon did a fantastic job creating this movie. I highly recommend it to watch, but beware to those with young children...this movie should hold true to the PG-13 rating it was given. There is some language and intense battle scenes. But the overall message is great you have to come together to conquer evil. This movie gets that message across in a unique way of pulling together the world's best superheroes: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. All the characters have been previously developed through other Marvel movies, which will help your understanding of this movie a lot more if you watch them in advance. Also, it never fails to amaze me how Marvel always manages to work in the cameo appearance of their founder and comic book writer, Stan Lee. I look for him in ever Marvel movie now. The overall basis of the movie is that Loki, Thor's not so nice little brother, is trying to take by the Tesseract, a blue cube that is an energy source and can connect multiple worlds. SHIELD, led by Nick Fury, pulls together the best superheroes to protect all people from Loki. Through a complicated, but well scripted and funny plot, the movie ends in a huge battle. Which you'll have to watch the movie to see how that goes... It really is a great movie with a well planned out cast and an amazing script. One of my favorite quotes is 'There is only one God, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure He doesn't dress like that', said by Captain America. SO surprising that modern Hollywood will still say something towards Christianity; it was refreshing. Overall an amazing way to kill a couple of hours! I recommend it to anyone who likes action with a side of comedy.",9,1,4,2 June 2014
