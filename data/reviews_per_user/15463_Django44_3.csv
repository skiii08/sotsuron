Casablanca," Still stands up well
","This is a true classic where every aspect shines, but notably the amazing script and performances (especially of Bogart and Claude Rains). It still stands up as perfect entertainment, and the ending is very memorable. Admittedly, it might not be entirely to everyone's taste, but you can't fault it on any level.",10,0,0,20 April 2003
U-571," No 'Run Silent, Run Deep' but good nonetheless
","Before you mouth explodes with criticisms, remember one thing: this film was not made to be a heavy, fact-reliant war account. It was made for pure entertainment, and it fulfills all its demands in that area. Forget the 'Americans winning the war' content (which Hollywood was releasing over 50 years ago in films like 'Objective, Burma) and the improbable shots of torpedo near misses, and view it as it should be viewed. The action scenes are good, and there is sufficient suspense to keep you awake. Its many inaccuracies weigh it down, but ignore them: this is not a film to be taken too seriously. It's no 'Run Silent, Run Deep', but I'd give it 7/10 anyway.",6,0,2,10 July 2002
The Mission," A masterpiece of modern cinema.
","The effort that clearly went into this film shines out in all areas, which makes watching it a satisfying and absorbing experience. Visually the film is perfect, with some of the greatest cinematography ever viewed on screen, combining majestic jungle scenery with religious imagery and style. Ennio Morricone's musical score is another highlight, incorporating exultant vocals and pensive, moving segments in an effective mixture. The acting is less obviously excellent at the start, but becomes so in later scenes. Truly this film is underrated, too underrated: people condemn the length and occasional slowness of the film, but you do not notice either really. From the incredible opening scene to the moving ending you are carried along on an epic, spectacular and thoughtful voyage through the beginnings, troubles and workings of the mission in question and of the people involved in it. You will not walk away from this film without looking back.",9,3,3,24 August 2002
