Requiem for a Dream," In Praise of Dreams
","In my opinion, this is the most important film I have ever seen. It is also in my top 3 favourite films of all time, and this is not just the novelty of the film which makes me say this, as I first watched it nearly a year ago now. The music, in combination with the characters and atmosphere of the film is incredible. To watch the entire film is an emotionally challenging experience. To watch only 10 minutes of the film would probably draw the viewer in, however, you need to follow the four characters through summer, fall and winter for the ending to truly hit you. It is a beautifully tragic film, and not one I would recommend for the faint hearted. I think that Aronofsky's contemporary style of directing is utterly amazing, and although I love the traditional Hollywood style, I am always open to something new. I fear many right-wing film fans would oppose this film for its 'hip hop montage' styles of editing. Like I said at the beginning, I do believe this to be the most important film there is, and although it is a film, I found it whacked me so hard emotionally, I would call it more of an experience. I cannot praise this film enough, Thank you Darren.",10,0,1,1 December 2004
