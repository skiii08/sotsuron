Deja Vu," a crime investigation is on progress, here science allows the investigation team to view past
","Deja vu is set in the present times; a crime investigation is on progress, here science allows the investigation team to view past exactly 4 days, 6 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds back. At first this is mentioned as a camera recording with the help satellite to the agent Doug Carlin and the above delay is due to the time lost during processing by the satellite. Later Doug point a laser beam on the video and find the subject Claire Kuchever to respond to it, in video footage claimed to be taken from satellites and thus truth is brought to him. Now Doug is aware of that past he is observing may be changed and the events may take a different path but the scientist tell him they are not able to send any thing or person in past to make the change. But Doug insist on sending himself to the past risking his life so as to save Claire and the around 500 peoples from the explosion. Movie never get out of track and I like the most is the realistic touch give to the technology, everything is seem to be believable were none of the freaky gadgets are given more attention than the story itself and this is what expected from the director of Spy Game and Enemy of the State, Tony Scott.",8,2,3,4 September 2013
Looper," people from 2075 have appointed the people called loppers for the disposal of the bodies for someone they want to kill
","Lopper start and sets around 2045 (something on screen make me believe it to be 90's with few of a machines and gadgets to be from future) were people from 2075 have appointed the people called loppers for the disposal of the bodies for someone they want to kill, as in 2075 it will be nearly impossible to dispose any from the government. Director Rian Johnson make us think the time is already altered by the peoples from the future, travelling back. Anyway it is the best ever movie I watched on time travel (Also it is the first movie by Rian Johnson I get to watch), director does not try to fancy people with the future gadgets and actually for today non of gadget shown is seem to be unbelievable even only time machine is shown it's not put forward as some fancy space ship and actually no concern is ever put about the technology and to me it worked good because it's it make you believe that time travel is so common that who the hell give a attention. The only time the machine is shown it looked like a junk concrete mixing machine with few cables running around and actually it convinces me that these common machine is prohibited by law as the story tell. At last will mention that this movie nicely mix technology with concept of mutation with a base of crime. And the main objective in the movie is to kill a mutant child before he grew up and set future according to him, with his immense powers.",9,0,2,4 September 2013
