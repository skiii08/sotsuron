Black Swan," Do not attend this movie if you're peasant
","I read a lot of action movie fans who tried to level their experience to something they don't understand. This is an artistic movie, no western, no action and no comedy. It's a genuine drama focused on a pure, naive hearted ballet dancer who makes the necessary sacrifice in order to produce the perfect art form: she gives up to her soul. The side effects and the general dark background of this film contrasts very well with the character's naive shaped beliefs, implemented by a too strict and full of regrets mother. I would really like not to see any more un-graceful peasant comments - as it is in movie, ballet is not for everyone.",10,1,4,7 January 2011
