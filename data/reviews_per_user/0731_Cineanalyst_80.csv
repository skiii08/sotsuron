Ford v Ferrari," Vroom Vroom
","I doubt auto racing can be made to be any more engaging to me than in this, which is to say I'm not fascinated by men in sports cars driving around in circles, but 'Ford v Ferrari' is a ripsnorting ride. Despite its two-and-a-half-hours runtime, it's never dull, and the whiplash cutting and vroom-vroom sounds are wholly deserving of their Oscars. Casting two of the most likable actors around, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, both of who try on different accents, in the leads helps, too. The title, 'Ford v Ferrari,' winds up being rather misleading, though, as the picture shifts gears more along the lines of Ford suites v Ford gearheads. That at one turn, Henry Ford II frightfully weeps as a passenger in a race car suggests where the movie's sympathies rest in that competition. The pissing competition between two bosses of car manufacturers takes a backseat to this inter-corporate one-upmanship and even that is of less interest than chasing the adrenaline junkies speeding around corners and risking death for glory. Rather simplistic for a Best Picture Oscar nominee, although not for its technically splendid production, but it's undeniably popularly entertaining.",7,1,2,28 February 2020
The Lobster," Eye for an Eye
","'The Lobster' is certainly an off-beat dark comedy and satire. The dystopian depiction of state-enforced couplings and the equally rigid renegade singles is rather simplistic, but the absurdity of it all is quite amusing. In it, those not already bonded to a romantic partner are forced to check into a hotel with other singles, whereupon they have 45 days to pair up or be surgically transformed into the lower animal of their choice (hence the title). Indeed, David (Colin Farrell) brings his brother, who is now a dog, along with him. Hotel guests--or, rather, inmates--also have the chance to extend their stays by slaying the renegade singles, who like other 'uncivilized' animals inhabit the woods. To encourage the marriages, the hotel performs parables on a stage for the guests (a woman saving a man from choking at dinner, and the man protecting the woman from being raped on a walk) and enforce symbolic punishments (on the first day, inmates have one arm tied behind their backs). Punishments for other offenses, along with those applied by the loners in the forest, have the flare of the Code of Hammurabi or Biblical laws of retaliation. A man who masturbates--a decidedly singular act--in the hotel has the masturbatory hand burned in a toaster. Likewise, acts requiring a partner are similarly punished by the loners, whereas masturbation is accepted.'The Lobster' is most amusing while occupying the hotel; whereas, it threatens to derail into a self-contradictory celebration of coupling in the woods when David meets Rachel Weisz's character, who up until then had been providing monotone narration. Their shared short-sightedness (note the use of this term instead of 'near-sighted') marks them to be together, just as one's defining characteristic--in a society that reduces one to be identified by their limp, nose bleeds, lisps, sociopathy or what have you--required one to find a mate with the same trait at the hotel. Fortunately, however, writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos and company don't settle for such a cop out of affirming the state-repressed individuality in rom-com banality. The acting remains intentionally stilted and the characters entirely unsophisticated. As the pun with the main couple's sight underscores, this is a world where an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.",7,1,3,2 December 2018
First Man," Visceral
","I'm a sucker for a good space movie. ClichÃ© as it may be, they're awe inspiring and the stuff that stirs the imagination. That always traces back to the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and no cinematic reenactment, regardless of IMAX high-resolution, will ever capture the magic of the grainy images of the actual event broadcast on televisions around the world. To the credit of the makers of 'First Man,' this wasn't their primary mission. The use of TV here is interesting, though; rather than trying to recapture that event, these clips add context--the sort that one might've thought would've averted some of the ridiculous controversies thrust upon the movie--to what is a narrowly-focused biopic of Neil Armstrong. The wonder still derives from the Moon, including the self-reflexive reveal of the camera that captured those first steps, but following the first man to walk on it through selected moments culminating with that astronomical body foster a visceral portrait of the man and his subjective experience on the lunar surface. 'First Man' features the giant leap for mankind, but its focus is on the one small step for a man.Say what you will about Ryan Gosling's career repetition of long takes of his seemingly blank gazes, from 'Drive' (2001) to 'Blade Runner 2049' (2017), but he's perfectly cast as Armstrong, perhaps history's most famous introvert. Understated by default, when his Armstrong does display overt emotion, it's all the more effective because of this. The rest of the cast is fine, too, including Kyle Chandler's drawing the Moon shot on a chalkboard reminding me he was the coach in the TV version of 'Friday Night Lights.' This is so focused on Neil, however, that the only other vital part here is his wife, Janet, as played by Claire Foy, who marks the right balance between expressing what her husband won't, or compelling him to, and without being reduced to a stereotypically tempestuous housewife. There's a reason this movie ends where it does, not in outer space.This inner look at Neil also filters and limits depictions of NASA's achievements through his experiences. From the tragedy of the death of his daughter to his ultimate lunar triumph is why those parts of his work that are selected between are the near-death ones (and, indeed, deadly for some of his fellow astronauts) and those that were failures or qualified successes. Even when not tumbling in rattling aircraft and rocket ships through the sky and space, the scenes on Earth tend to be captured by a shaking camera. Only on the Moon does the style, like Neil, find some reprieve. It's a wonderful sequence and quite a feat--managing to be the most insightful of the character while he says nothing and his face is hidden by the helmet visor and when the scenery in IMAX is the most overpowering.The character-driven focus within the monumental historical event, however, seems to be the cause of some laughable, if not depressing, sociopolitical objections to the movie. The flag dispute is especially unfortunate, including the current President of the United States rebuking a movie he hasn't seen--and for what? To capitalize on an imaginary controversy over a movie that celebrates a defining achievement in American history? For those who wanted a critique of current politics in a historical biopic (yes, some do--Kate Gardner's review, e.g.), there it is: look at President Trump's comments and compare them to the speech in the movie by President Kennedy. The flag being planted on the Moon isn't shown because this film isn't chiefly about the American achievement, although it's there--inescapable even had the filmmakers wanted to avoid it, which they obviously didn't. There are flags, allusions to Cold War geopolitics, JFK and more. Regardless of what the Canadian lead actor says, it's not about the human achievement, either, although that's there, too, including TV reactions from around the globe, plus the 'one giant leap.'Conversely, critic Richard Brody calls it 'an accidental right-wing fetish object.' Much of this line of criticism is borne from the protagonist's personality and the role of TV here. The 'lack of expression' that Brody calls 'a character flaw,' a lack of 'consciousness' and a detachment from humanity and what critic Matt Zoller Seitz calls 'a tragedy of American machismo' and 'emotional constipation' restate the usual attacks of supposed coldness, repression and lack of emotion leveled against introverts, as if quiet reflection and even a cry in private, as opposed to airing one's emotions publicly, were a vice. More to the point, Gardner criticizes the movie as 'a tale of the exceptional white man,' and plenty of others have questioned the movie's lack of gender and racial diversity--often citing the prior NASA movie 'Hidden Figures' (2016). Never mind that the focus isn't on people behind the scenes, even the likes of Wernher von Braun absent, and that the Houston control center is downplayed, especially compared to a film such as 'Apollo 13' (1995), with their input coming in as babble while the camera focuses on Neil and crew hurtling through space. Of course, there was segregation and institutional racism in the 1960s, too, and such context is TV's role here.From 'Whitey on the Moon' to coverage of the Vietnam War, one may interpret the juxtaposition within the film how they wish, but I think it's as much as anything to placate and avoid offense (failing in Brody's case), as well as appearing too unbound from the world, for what is intended as a mainstream, all-pleasing product. Anymore focus on ancillary and contextual aspects surrounding Neil's life would've detracted from the inward examination of the man, just as further depictions of his outward accomplishments would've been irrelevant to the picture's purpose. Moreover, I find it more intriguing how the use of TV here inverts its historical role of presenting the Moon to us earthlings by, instead, doing the opposite for Earth in a film focused in space. I also want to see 'First Man' again to examine the style, how its camerawork and look may do for space movies what 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) did for war ones, whether it is, indeed, too darkly-lit, and just for the pure exhilaration of the scenes from Armstrong bouncing off the atmosphere to walking on the Moon.",9,0,1,17 October 2018
Love and Death," An Unlikely Pairing: Allen's Farce and the Russian Novel
","'Love and Death' is one of Woody Allen's 'early, funny ones,' before he made darker and more serious films, such as 'Stardust Memories' (1980) where Allen's line about his own oeuvre originates. He made 'Annie Hall' (1977) next, and his career would never be the same. On the other hand, being a parody of 19th-century Russian literature, 'Love and Death' is full of esoteric references. The major throughline is Leo Tolstoy's 'War and Peace,' but there's enough Fyodor Dostoevsky here for me to have reviewed it as part of my mission to see a bunch of 'Crime and Punishment' pictures after reading the book. Moreover, Allen would go on to make three movies (thus far) more heavily and singularly inspired by this particular novel: 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' (1989), 'Match Point' (2005) and 'Irrational Man' (2015). It's interesting to compare how he went from 'Love and Death,' which is non-stop comedic frivolity complete with a gag being performed at every moment to 'Match Point,' where there are no jokes.Indeed, 'Love and Death' is not only an homage to literature, but also to early screen comics. There's even a scene where the sound goes out for some silent slapstick, and the fourth-wall-breaking absurdity of the whole thing seems to be especially indebted to the Marx Brothers. As for the Russian connection, though, there are extended mock-philosophical discussions, angst over the existence of God, somber soliloquies, multiple suitors and lovers for everyone, subplots upon subplots and periphery character galore, a lot to do with class and nationality, and... wheat, I guess. (I love that in a blog post from Alistair Ian Blyth that one of my favorite films of the 1910s, 'After Death' (1915), which is based on the prose of Ivan Turgenev, is brought up to help explain the supposed importance of wheat in Russian literature.)Some of the Dostoevsky references are obvious. Allen has a conversation in a jail cell that entirely exists of characters and titles from his stories, including some gossip about a local named 'Raskolnikov' who murdered two women. Additionally, Diane Keaton's character is named 'Sonja,' the hooker with a heart of gold who instigates Raskolnikov's regeneration in the book. 'Love and Death' offers the best character summary of Sonja, though, from her own lips: 'I'm half saint, half wh-re' (IMDb censorship, you know). And, naturally, Allen plays the atheistic foil to her pious promise land. Best of all, however, is how the connection with Napoleon between 'War and Peace' and 'Crime and Punishment' is exploited in this film with two other words surrounding the conjunction. Sonja decides that she and Allen's Boris should kill Napoleon for the benefit of humanity, which is akin to the rationale of Raskolnikov for murdering the pawnbroker. Ironically, Napoleon was also his role model for this 'extraordinary' act. Boris mixes up the roles further by comparing himself to an insect, which is what Raskolnikov said of the pawnbroker, and claiming Napoleon as a great man. Looking at the parodic adaptation this way gives one as much whiplash as Allen and Keaton's philosophical repartee. To top it off, there are two Napoleons.There are some allusions to non-comedic films here, too. The ones to 'Battleship Potemkin' (1925) and 'Persona' (1966) seemed most conspicuous to me. Although 'Love and Death' is a lightweight affair, and the jokes are hit and miss, it rewards those who've seen and read what it parodies. And, admittedly, Russian novels such as 'Crime and Punishment' were just asking for this sort of loving pillory.",7,2,2,26 September 2019
10 Cloverfield Lane," (Un)Confined Craziness
","Re-watching the drama in a bunker that is '10 Cloverfield Lane' is easier to relate to nowadays amid pandemic-related shelter-in-place orders. In a way, it's an amusing diversion to a fictional post-apocalyptic world. Part solid, claustrophobic drama concerning the dynamics of a triumvirate relationship underground--the rest of the picture remains effective, too, if you're willing to roll with the diverting contrivances. I don't especially care about the Cloverfield franchise, although the marketing of the movies has been innovative. This installment, in particular, was shoehorned ex post facto the subterranean-shelter script. Regardless, it rather fits in the sense that things are crazy in the movie from the get-go: from the abduction/rescue of a woman, that what at first seem to be a rape horror flick turns into a conspiracy-theory being validated by Armageddon and back into a sort of rape-threat plot, and that instead of the nut relishing his validation, he's mostly bothered by what little of humanity continues to surround him and exerts his energy on establishing his dominance over them. And that's just the stuff that happens before the bonkers finale.None of this would work, either, without some decent acting. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is especially enjoyable when in the fighting spirit. It's John Goodman, however, who steals the show. His character is a more horrifying monster than any CGI alien or spacecraft covered by dark and obscure angles and framed by an artificial shaky camera. It's the deeply-rooted human interaction that's terrifying and thrilling--not, frivolous fun though it may be, that franchise-building surface nonsense.",7,0,0,17 April 2020
Hereditary," Mommy Sees Dead People, Too
","One may debate the merits of the term 'elevated horror,' as it suggests that horror is otherwise inferior to other genres if not 'elevated,' but I think that word could just as well be placed in front of any movie that surpasses expectations of a genre piece. Regardless, it fit 'Get Out' (2017) which was 'elevated' by its satire--reworking standard horror elements to tap into the zeitgeist of racial issues at the end of the Obama era. I'd even accept the moniker for 'A Quiet Place' (2018) under an interpretation such as Richard Brody's for the 'New Yorker' magazine that it's the antithesis of 'Get Out.' It need not be political, either. For this purpose, I'd consider horror films that introduce innovations in style or narrative structure to be 'elevated' ('Psycho' (1960), 'The Shining' (1980), 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) come to mind as obvious major influences in the genre). Even 'The Sixth Sense' (1999) had its twist. Otherwise, without being 'elevated,' you just get a scary story, and it either works on you on a physical level or it doesn't. Unfortunately, that's what 'Hereditary' does.It's a simple ghost story. The revelation of some details are delayed, but they're heavily foreshadowed, so I don't see why anyone would consider the ending surprising or a betrayal except that for all of its good reviews and talk about a new era of 'elevated horror' its surprise is that there's nothing more to it. Of course, there's some drama (in this case, regarding dysfunctional family dynamics and the loss of loved ones); there almost always is. But, then, it's just strange-looking kids, apparitions, séances, grave desecration, cults, supernatural happenings and jump scares from there. The usual clichés. It also follows the basic complex discovery plot, as outlined by film theorist Noël Carroll (see e.g. 'Interpreting the Moving Image'): Onset, Discovery, Confirmation and Confrontation. The Onset is where we the audience begin to become aware there's a monster--for instance, an apparition is seen here and there and we learn about the dark past of a dead mother. Discovery is when the mother played by Toni Collette discovers there's a monster, too. In the Confirmation phase, she tries to convince others, to confirm, the existence of the monster. And, then, Confrontation, of course, is what it sounds like. This has been the most common plot of horror movies since the genre was largely introduced in Hollywood with the 1931 'Dracula.'Too bad, too. I was hoping for more, especially with the business of replica (haunted) houses--the mother's dollhouses, the kid's tree house--and the casting of Toni Collette, who also played the mother in 'The Sixth Sense.' Something self-reflexive, perhaps, or something reflecting the multi-layering of houses and planes of existence. Yet, at best, 'Hereditary' is merely a better-crafted replica of a formula and conventions that continue to haunt the genre.",3,1,5,28 September 2018
Detroit," Bigelow and Boal's Torture Porn 2: This Time It's Bad
","'Detroit' is disgusting--and not only for the racist Milgram experiment based on the real incident at the Algiers Motel--but for how director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal exploit the events for their morally-dubious depictions of torture continued from their last collaboration, 'Zero Dark Thirty' (2012), which depicted so-called 'enhanced interrogation' in the lead up to killing Osama bin Laden. Well, whereas Bigelow and Boal controversially thought it fair to suggest that torture was useful for that purpose; in 'Detroit,' they seem to entirely reverse coarse. The only consistency is the cinematic exploitation of racial others being traumatized by sadists with guns--or, rather, cameras. Such exploitation is much easier to overlook when those being interrogated are terrorists and when gruesome scenes are kept brief, or when the revulsion remains the domain of fictional horror flick scenarios, but 'Detroit' is based on a real tragedy, involving racist cops murdering innocent Black men and sexually and otherwise physically assaulting two women, and it goes on for a long time--seemingly longer than the already-lengthy runtime would indicate.It would be one thing if this sequence were brutal only to authentically depict a historical tragedy, or to relate it to the more recent context of police killings, the unrest in Ferguson a few years prior to this movie, as well as the Black Lives Matter movement and preceding the current protests and violence of 2020, but 'Detroit' doesn't serve that function. The picture's prologue, going so far back as titles explaining the Great Migration and segregation, to the 1967 Detroit Riot, and the picture's third act, which mostly focuses on a farce of a courtroom drama at the expense of following through on tracing the survivors living with the trauma they endured (only the singer receives any justice in the latter regard), are completely blundered. We see one of the cops murder a looter early on, which is never followed up on, either. It's just another scene for the filmmakers to perversely demonstrate a simulated lack of respect for Black lives on par with its villains. Sure, it's hackneyed screenwriting foreshadowing that a character is a sociopath, but it also foreshadows the sickness of Bigelow and Boal's torture porn to come and the by-large removal of the same agency of its Black characters as done by the picture's villains towards its victims.As pointed out by film critic Mike D'Angelo, one of the most glaring indications of this picture's problems here is in the editing of the death of Aubrey Pollard. Unlike the pretend executions that the police enact in their perverse game, the picture cuts away from the room where this one takes place, as we hear the shotgun blasts, only to learn shortly thereafter that the cop really murdered Pollard--seemingly unaware that his fellow officers were only playing a twisted game aimed at manufacturing confessions. That is not how you film a docudrama. It's a shameful folly of suspense filmmaking. It's intended to be exciting and thrilling, and that's shameful.One silver lining of 'Detroit' is that it's masterfully photographed and even the editing and cutting back and forth between characters is effective for its intended purposes, misplaced and hostile as they may be. The shaky, darting camerawork especially works well at affecting a spectatorial participation in the hectic events. If only such stylistic competence were in the hands of filmmakers who also had the compassion and understanding of how to depict such a tragedy.",4,1,2,9 June 2020
Rocketman," Elton John Gets High on Psychotherapy: The Musical
","Another musical biopic of a pop star from Dexter Fletcher, who was also behind completing 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018), 'Rocketman' is an improvement upon its predecessor in some ways, but an uneven movie in still others. Taron Egerton makes Elton John his own, and unlike Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in the prior picture, reportedly does his own singing. This one is also different in that it's an integrated musical instead of a backstage one; that is, characters break into song and dance during their daily lives and, thus, the musical numbers are more ingrained in the narrative. 'Rocketman' is like 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939); whereas, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is nearer 'A Star Is Born' (1954, or the two later ones, too). (I also recently viewed 'Judy' (2019), another backstage musical biopic, and with Elton singing about 'the yellow-brick road,' well, you get the idea....)At best, this integrated format supports a seemingly drug-induced momentum, from one stage in the star's life to the next, which is entertaining spectacle, including the dreamlike imagery. It's also apropos given the focus here on Elton's drug and other addictions. I'm less fond of the psychotherapy framing device, though, whereby he faces his mommy and daddy issues and related desires to be loved. Not exactly profound insights there in a production that's largely an Elton John vanity project in itself. Meanwhile, his music here largely does appear to come to him easily, which his mother criticizes of his life in general in one scene. Ditto his flamboyant concert performances. At least, in 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' there was a bit covered of the experimentation and genre-mixing that went into the success of Queen. On the other hand, 'Rocketman' benefits from being rated R and so doesn't fear some depiction of drug abuse and gay sex, which is more than can be said of the PG-13 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' where Mercury's romantic life was mainly and outrageously represented by his relationship with a woman. Like many others, I enjoy the rock and roll of Elton John and Queen, and these movies are pleasant vehicles for that, but they're also flawed and flimsy pictures otherwise.",6,0,1,2 November 2019
A Star Is Born," Same Story Told Over and Over Forever
","'A Star Is Born' has proven itself to be a story with legs, to borrow from the phrasing of Bradley Cooper's Jack, and I think that's because it does, indeed, dig deep into the soul of Hollywood and the business of art and entertainment in general. Like the songs within this iteration of the familiar story about the characters who sing them, the movie is about itself, about the stars who play the characters within it, and it echoes the same stories that have been told afore.The story is older than some people realize, too, as before it was 'A Star Is Born' in 1937, 1954, 1976 and again in 2018, it was 'What Price Hollywood?' (1932), which itself is said to be loosely based on real-life tales such as the marriage of silent-film flapper icon Colleen Moore. In 1937, the Academy's first Best Actress Oscar winner, Janet Gaynor, repeated the feat within and almost without (with another Oscar nomination) the first 'A Star Is Born' by playing the same ingénue type that she'd already honed over the past decade in Hollywood. In 1954, the versatile Judy Garland brought the now-familiar backstage musical to the narrative, while her real life seemed to mirror that of her alcoholic on-screen husband more than the aspiring star she plays in the film. Then, Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson took the story from the Oscars to their more familiar territory of the Grammys, a formula that is reused here for the talents of Lady Gaga.This latest 'A Star Is Born' has its faults. Bradley Cooper seems to spend most of the picture admiring himself as the handsomest drunk and drug addict to ever appear on screen--sometimes to the point of marginalizing the more pivotal role played by Lady Gaga, and her launch to stardom seems shallow with all of the business of her nose and her confidence being built up by a man calling her 'pretty.' And, of course, it's a vanity project: it's a movie about show business, it's about money and awards made to garner money and awards. While seeming to turn a critical eye on the pop music business, the movie itself often plays as an extended music video, cutting from the same overly-emotional outbursts to the next that's a staple of the success of popular music--that the stars feel things so powerfully that they have no control and must punch people or things or drink and drug themselves into oblivion. Even the fun stuff is a whirlwind of losing control to one's primal urges. Inevitably, at some point, it's going to get hokey. On the other hand, the acting, cinematography and editing are far above anything in a music video, and the music led by 'Shallow' being also outstanding.Nevertheless, I've fallen for the self-reflexivity of the story. I like how Sam Elliott's Bobby mentions how every song and story is the same and that the artist offers the world how they see that same story, as that essentially is the point of remaking 'A Star Is Born' for the fourth, fifth or umpteenth time. There's also the business of Cooper adopting Elliott's voice, which recalls for me, at least, all the other great voices to be broadcast in prior versions of the story. For the male lead, the memorable voice of James Mason most often comes to my mind. The insertion of drag queens, and its similarities to the pageantry of rock concerts and music videos, also seems to play into this meta notation--besides also reflecting Gaga's, like Garland before, status as a queer icon. Most interesting of all, however, is how much this 'A Star Is Born' seems to be a critique of the career of its own star-in-the-making. She came to fame within and without the movie by being what Cooper's Jack calls 'ugly.' Indeed, the dance routines, hairstyling and costumes she adorns in 'A Star is Born' are far less outrageous than the Lady Gaga persona she has performed in the real pop-music world. The story's traditional end is especially unfortunate for leaving this critique a bit shallow. It's, nonetheless, an interesting self-reflexive aspect to this addition--more so I suppose for those who've been bigger fans of Lady Gaga than me. At the least, this 'A Star Is Born' has surely borne more fans, myself included, for this star.",8,1,1,29 November 2019
The Death of Stalin," Political Stupidity
","Stalin's death hasn't been this amusing since 'Children of the Revolution' (1996), which isn't something I though I'd ever write. Armando Iannuci and company transplant their brand of political farce from liberal Western democracies lampooned previously, with 'In the Loop' (2009) and the HBO series 'Veep,' to the transition of authoritarian power in the post-Stalin Soviet Union. As others have criticized, 'The Death of Stalin' is riddled with historical inaccuracies, but Iannuci's prior, aforementioned work isn't amusing for fidelity or even cutting satire, either. It's always a bunch of cruel numbskulls yelling at and backstabbing each other. But, now, it's in the USSR, so people are slaughtered, too. The result is an uneven black comedy.Gallows humor works well enough, I suppose, when members of the politburo are executed, but it's another thing entirely when the masses are being shot and trampled to death. The movie is given too much credit by some for being supposedly insightful; it's not. Obviously, the USSR and Stalinism was a disaster, and making the men in charge into caricatures doesn't really lend any enlightenment upon that. Don't get me wrong, though; politics is worthy of mockery. After a slow start (the opera stuff seems particularly irrelevant and unfunny) and despite a lot of misfires, 'The Death of Stalin' can be humorous at times. The tempo especially picks up after Steve Buscemi, leading a well-rounded cast, begins to take over as Khrushchev. With him, one moment, joking around with his cohorts that he would just as soon have shot in the head if it were to his Machiavellian interests, Buscemi could just as well be playing his gangster parts in 'The Sopranos' or 'Boardwalk Empire' than as a would-be national dictator. Meanwhile, the British actors could just as well be enacting a drawing-room comedy of manners or performing a Monty Python sketch (Michael Palin, after all, is here, too, and as absurd as ever). None of this trans-Atlantic cast attempt foreign accents, but what would be the point had they, or had the cast been mainly employed of actors from the former states of the USSR. 'The Death of Stalin' doesn't bother to reflect history or politics in profound, or even accurate, ways. It merely reinterprets it all for easy laughs.",6,2,4,2 November 2019
Unbreakable," The Super Sixth Sense
","Although 'Unbreakable' is essentially writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's prior film 'The Sixth Sense' (1999) remade as a superhero movie, it does integrate the world of comic books into what was an effective formula in the first place. Once again, there's a young boy who believes in something that Bruce Willis is partly oblivious to. Again, that boy cries over the secret in a revelatory moment with a parent. Again, Willis's character has marital problems, and the picture is crammed with pregnant pauses--mostly of Willis looking away wistfully, as though that's his idea of acting in something other than a 'Die Hard' sequel or retread. This time, however, Willis has the sixth sense--plus, he's unbreakable, and Samuel L. Jackson substitutes in the way of an adviser to the person with supernatural powers. I also like the obligatory (in a Shyamalan movie, that is) twist ending even though it's humorously abrupt, which is incongruent with the otherwise somber treatment and subject matter.Appropriately, Jackson's character invests in comic books instead of the prior picture's psychobabble, too. They inspire him to seek out a real superhero. For the most part, 'Unbreakable' is filmed in an identical manner of realistic supernaturalism as in 'The Sixth Sense' and quite apart from Shyamalan's more Hollywood, off-the-assembly-line products that comprise his subsequent oeuvre. But, there are flashes--like the hero's sixth-sense visions of others' misdeeds in the story--of comic-book-like imagery, although this is mostly reserved for the superheroic stuff. 'Unbreakable' also benefits today as a contrast to the explosion since its release of big-budget and doggedly light and unrealistic action-packed superhero fare from the MCU and elsewhere. In that sense, it comes across as both familiar and refreshing.",7,1,1,7 October 2019
Train to Busan," Zombies on a Train
","The action of 'Train to Busan' is so intense and the set-up excellent that the movie's faults may almost be overlooked. Others have, rightly, compared the fighting aboard a train, moving through carnage from car to car, to 'Snowpiercer' (2013), also by Korean filmmakers and also including a heavy-handed message on socio-economic inequality. The cinematic potential of trains, which partly came of age along with motion pictures at the end of the 19th century, was realized early on, though: as coinciding movement with the Lumière brothers' 'Arrival of a Train' (1896), as framing movement with the phantom-ride views that displayed shifting scenery from the point of view of a moving train, and, with action as a third layer of momentum, as early as Edwin S. Porter's 'The Great Train Robbery' (1903). So, here, in 'Train to Busan,' we have zombies instead of bandits. Zombies running down aisles after their fleshy prey, zombies seen outside shifting views from the windows, and zombies thrown into windows. Even the effects for their piling up when a large enough herd is in pursuit works well enough.The father-child dynamic is effective, too. But, the prospect of the fund manager investing in a company maybe responsible for the outbreak adds nothing. And, as if it weren't enough for this 'bloodsucker,' as another, lower-class character (played by Ma Dong-seok, the most charismatic actor of the bunch) calls him--such terminology putting him in league with the flesh-eating zombies, to learn his lesson, to treat people with respect and egalitarianism, an insufferably irredeemable baddie is introduced. This leads to a contrived class structure between the train doors that's ridiculously oblivious to the undead threat surrounding them. Plus, there are other melodramatic contrivances and repetitions in the characters' quest for survival. As a zombie action flick, however, 'Train to Busan' is, indeed, a thrill ride, and the ending nicely threatens a reference to that first modern zombie film, 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968).",7,0,1,13 April 2020
The Birth of a Nation," The Birth of an Art
","Before 'The Birth of a Nation,' motion pictures were a medium with the potential to be an art. This movie, more than any afore, realized that promise. It's the most important film ever made; it's the birth of an art. Alas, it's also racist.The film's controversy appears to have left director D.W. Griffith dumbfounded, judging by Griffith's responses to critics and from descriptions by Griffith biographers. The son of a Confederate soldier, his prepossession for an antebellum South wasn't, if not still, unusual. Histories of the day, including those by would-be US President Woodrow Wilson, supported his perverted depiction of the Ku Klux Klan saving a South pillaged by carpetbaggers, scalawags and encouraged Negroes. The film quotes Wilson's 'History of the American People.' Thomas Dixon Jr. himself solicited the White House screening where the President is said to have quipped, 'It is like writing history with lightening, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.' Dixon's racist book trilogy and the subsequent play were Griffith's inspiration for 'The Birth of a Nation.'In it, the American Civil War and Reconstruction disrupt the once-friendly relations between the Unionist Stonemans and the Confederate Camerons. The first part is largely free of controversy, although its racially-segregated imagery underlies a nostalgia for the institution of slavery; it's idyllic romanticism and melodrama typical of Griffith, absent Dixon. And, the battle scenes are excellent. Explosions, smoke and hundreds of extras fill the action. Future prominent directors like Raoul Walsh and Erich von Stroheim assisted the direction. The action shifts between bird's-eye views and medium shots, demonstrating vast scope with attention to isolated skirmishes. Including Griffith with 'Judith of Bethulia,' filmmakers had until now failed to realize massive battles with such grandeur. To top it off, cinematographer G.W. 'Billy' Bitzer's moving camera shot of the Little Colonel's charge.The second half of the film, when Congressman Austin Stoneman (based on Radical Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens) and his mulatto protégé Silas Lynch lead the freed slaves into postwar power, is when the racism becomes especially blatant. Blacks are portrayed as childish morons or as easily-excitable brutes--harmless enough if put in their place, such as with the condescending 'faithful souls.' According to Griffith, it's the mulattos that are especially dangerous, because they posses the cunning of a white with the animalism of a black. What they want is to 'marry,' which means rape, white virginal women. The film is sexist, too. This is most evident in the infamous scene of the Black buck Gus chasing the childlike Mae Marsh through the woods, to a cliff she leaps from to preserve her purity. It's especially offensive because it's so well done, except for the trope of the 'Little Sister' ludicrously surviving the fall briefly for a last gasp. The photography sets it apart, and the crosscutting intensifies the classic last-minute rescue attempt, as the Little Colonel enters the action.Yet, the Klan rescue is by far the most offensive and concurrently most exciting sequence in the picture. Griffith and his editors, headed by James and Rose Smith, crosscut between multiple actions, climaxing with the rescue of Elsie Stoneman from the threat of being raped, the Aryans and faithful souls under siege and the whole of Piedmont under the heel of a black mob. To that date, it's the most advanced, amazing montage and remains impressive to this day. Before, Griffith had found how exciting well-edited suspense could be, with 'The Battle at Elderbush Gulch' and his last-minute rescue flicks, such as 'The Girl and Her Trust.' And a variation of Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries' greatly adds to the intensity.The silhouette of Klansmen riding upon a hill, with the sunrise behind; the moving-camera shot of the approach; the angled camera positions: Bitzer and Griffith photograph it brilliantly, too. That is, besides the interiors. Theatricality is the film's major cinematic weakness. This is most evident in the missing walls. The narrative structure is also traditional. Griffith would never do otherwise, and it's certainly not unique for 1915. Filmmakers were beginning to exploit the advantages of controlled filming within studio sets by now, but the open-air sets with natural lighting, as used here, were still prevalent. At least, the sets here are decorated in detail. Bitzer and Griffith, however, were consistently innovative in their beautiful outdoor photography--with camera movement and positioning, tinting, nighttime photography and good use of split-screens and of masking the camera lens.The acting is also theatrical, but Griffith did direct his actors to be subtler in comparison to contemporary acting. Lillian Gish rose to the forefront of this style, largely because of this film, which made her a star. She plays Elsie Stoneman, who has the more prominent of the two romantic relationships in the film with a soldier from the other side; she's Griffith's ideal white virgin. There are some especially well-acted moments here for its time. The sequence with Marsh using ermine in attempt to garment her ragged house dress for the homecoming of her brother and Henry Walthall's slow, moving walk towards the front door of home are especially poignant--showing the destitution of the postbellum South.'The Birth of a Nation' is a troublingly racist picture, which is said to have revived the KKK (as well as being the cause célèbre of the newfound NAACP in its efforts to censor it). Nevertheless, its importance in film history, and its cinematic merits are immense. There are other impressive works from this time: films by Bauer, Chaplin, Christensen, DeMille, Sjöström, Starewicz, Tourneur and Weber. Yet, to say the least about 'The Birth of a Nation,' as far as I've seen, nothing before matches its scale with such filmic innovation.It runs for 12 reels--having cost some $110,000 to make. Its vast popularity also had incalculable effects on movies as an industry, including the establishment of Hollywood at its center. Although other estimates are lower, Griffith-biographer Richard Schickel claims it grossed more than $60 million by 1917. Its influence, not only on cinema, is enormous. No other film has been as important to the direction of motion pictures as an industry and an art.",10,166,226,31 July 2005
Captain Marvel," And Why Do We Fall, Bruce?
","After the successes of Best Picture nominee 'Black Panther' and 'Avengers: Infinity War' (both 2018), the MCU seems to have retreated into a comedic hiatus before the anticipated 'Endgame,' with formulaic entries in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' (2018) and, now, 'Captain Marvel.' Sure, it's a somewhat amusing diversion, but I see why many fans feel it misses the mark. The underlying girl-power message calls for some unironic superhero gravitas; instead, it's a light delivery of the generic MCU origins-story formula mixed with some winking retro gags along the lines of those introduced to the franchise by 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (2014). Ultimately, 'Captain Marvel' is more retreating than progressive and a lesser variation on superhero movies we've already seen.There is a funny cat, though, and the 1990s references are admittedly humorous. Having Brie Larson's Carol Danvers crash land on Earth through a Blockbuster store is a fitting summation that this is a pure popcorn flick. Surely, hardly anyone will mistake this entry as a potential awards contender; the closest it's getting to the red carpet is when Vers picks up a rental copy of 'The Right Stuff' (1983). Even an important aspect of the visual effects was a problem for, at least, me: the digital de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson as Fury and, more briefly, of Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson transgresses the uncanny valley. This effect isn't much of a hindrance when it's used sparingly, as done before for short stints with stars Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr. and Kurt Russell in the MCU--heck, the one with Downey wasn't even intended to be real within the fictional world. But, young Fury is in this one a lot, and almost every time I saw him I was either feeling that something was off--something non-human (the skin seems too inflexible or they seem to be trying to hide his face in the shadows) or I was looking for something to be wrong. Danvers firing photon blasts from her hands in outer space I can buy, but a de-aged Fury creeps me out.The warring aliens and sci-fi stuff isn't too compelling, either. There's more Loki-esque shapeshifting, another species with elf ears (à la the Dark Elves in 'Thor: The Dark World' (2013)), another species that tends to look exactly like Homo sapiens, science-y talk about light speed and universal-language modifying devices seemingly straight out of 'Star Trek.' Yet, more troubling is how much the plot borrows from other MCU entries and the basic origins story formula first set by 'Iron Man' (2008). Like Tony Stark, Danvers receives her power during an explosion from a military conflict, realizes at some point that she was fighting wrongly in the war and that something in her past was hidden from her, so she flies around blasting energy from her hand cannons--again, like Iron Man. Her arc is also similar to that of Jane Foster in the second Thor movie in that she's baffled by her absorbed powers, and like Captain America, she spent much of her earlier life getting knocked down before coming upon superpowers.I don't have a problem with the picture's underlying politics as, apparently, others on the Internet do, except that it's trite, and the story of Danvers here is not interesting enough to even execute that properly. Indeed, this Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue in that she's over-powering and is being set up to take the place of other, soon-to-be-retired superheroes. Moreover, the main conflict is that she's confused about how awesome she really is--an egregiously simplistic parable for women with low self esteem. Supporting this message, too, rather eye-rollingly boils down to playing songs like 'I'm Just a Girl' as she kicks ass or seeming to borrow the falling-and-getting-back-up montage from a Dwyane Wade shoe commercial, among other things.Plus, this isn't an Ant-Man movie; if it's going to be more than the female equivalent of a vehicle for Paul Rudd's affable personality, it needs gravitas. They don't need a savior allegory to fully make her over as Marvel's counterpart to Superman (besides, Stark clearly is still holding dibs on the MCU's requisite Christ figure), but I think this one missed an opportunity to have some striking heroic moments, had it only set the tone and tempo correctly. Even the fish-out-of-water joking was done better in 'Wonder Woman' (2017), but there's absolutely no equivalent in 'Captain Marvel' to its predecessor's No Man's Land scene. Nevertheless, 'Captain Marvel' can be amusing and light entertainment, and even though she's fallen with her debut, the makers of this franchise must remember why we fall. She can pick herself up.",6,2,8,22 March 2019
Dawn of the Dead," Undead Remake
","Remakes prove that even when a film is done and dead, it may be reanimated and, like the undead here, oft in a more sickly form. If you're looking for improved zombie make-up and effects and more frills in the flesh-eating and head-shooting action, this 'Dawn of the Dead' may be for you, but if you expect a more compelling reason for one of the classics of the subgenre, George A. Romero's 1978 original version, to be remade, this is a pretty pointless endeavor. Between the additional cluttering of characters in this second iteration and continual set pieces of the living fighting the ghouls mixed with episodes of the living yelling at each other, one may be forgiven for not noticing the utter lack of comic relief, social commentary, or merely even trust in the audience to piece things together relative to Romero's film.The after-credits sequence here is a good example of how nothing is left to the imagination. With Romero, we may wonder what ultimately happens to the remaining heroes. Director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn, instead, prefer to keep everything simplistic and tidy--something that also served them well with superhero franchises. At least, I suppose, this final sequence involves a character video taping it, which is rather unexpectedly reflexive. TV is also employed earlier on as surveillance and, as Romero did, for largely unnecessary news broadcasts. Regardless, there's also no insinuation, as with Romero, that the living are like zombies in their unreflective materialism, as well as with the warring with each other. Heck, the remake even goes to pains to explain the mechanics of zombies--head shots, effects of bites, etc.--as though we aren't already overly familiar with said conventions.It's no wonder the gang here is so eager to get on with what seems to be a suicide mission for the climax; they have little apparent reason to live in the first place. Families die. Jobs are gone. The only guy from a church is an atheist, while others consider an alternative worse than death. And chess, sex, shooting and smoking only entertain one for so long. Romero's group had lives inside the mall worth protecting and appreciated their bounty. This gang, on the other hand, just seem to be looking for a diversion to pass the time and overly willing to risk their lives for an adrenaline rush.",4,0,0,24 April 2020
World War Z," 'Movement is Life'
","There could be worse mantras, especially for a zombie-apocalypse, action flick, than 'movement is life,' uttered by Brad Pitt's protagonist in an early scene expounding on the dictum for survival. Everything in 'World War Z' is constant movement. The Zombies are fast. After the obligatory opening scene of domesticity lost in the house of Pitt, survivors are always on the run, always chased by the undead. Pitt and company continually move from one city to the next, from automobile to automobile, helicopter to helicopter, plane to plane, one explosion, gun fight and action set piece after another, in the investigation of the pathogen. To look back isn't to see the stillness amidst the carnage. Shots hardly have time to even frame the usual zombie gore, which, besides having the benefit of a more marketable PG-13 rating, keeps the focus on the mass movement, panic and rate of infection. A striking picture amid a pandemic. Moreover, movement is the foundation of movies. It's in the name, and motion pictures themselves work as an analogy to the undead, or its antidote, as reanimated photographs, once still and dead, projected back to life, living pictures on the screen. Movement is life.Oh, I doubt the filmmakers had any intention of making such a self-reflexive connection, to philosophize cinema, and the movie certainly doesn't follow through on such a thesis; I'm merely saying that it's apt, this relentless momentum. The closest the movie comes is with the surveillance cameras at the World Heath Organization facility. There's the seemingly contradictory dichotomy here, too, of the capturing of still images as a metaphorical death and their reanimated movement as returning life. The same contradiction exists within the film in the ultimate confrontation, the vaccine, against the zombies--that to defeat the undead, one must become terminally ill, too. Just as to create motion pictures, still, lifeless ones must be made.",7,0,0,7 April 2020
12 Monkeys," The Jetty Revisited
","'Twelve Monkeys' is about remembering. The time travel is an extension of this--revisiting the past, before most of humanity was wiped out by disease and the survivors imprisoned underground. As a remake of the 1962 short film 'Le Jetée' (1962), there's also the memory of this past film. The twist in this revision from Terry Gilliam and company is the suggestion that remembrance, as viewed through the perspective of Bruce Willis's protagonist, may be mad and, thus, unreliable, which plays into the director's penchant for canted angles and otherwise strange camerawork and production design.One setting in particular, besides the airport, plays well into the remembrance aspect of the scenario as the time traveler visits it in present and past. The asylum stands out, too, and helps question the reliability of the protagonist's perspective, with Brad Pitt, as another madman becoming the subject of obsession for Willis's character, providing an especially apt energetic and over-the-top performance. Meanwhile, the underground reminds one of Gilliam's prior 'Brazil' (1895). And a WWI photograph recalls the reliance on still photography in 'La Jetée,' which are otherwise replaced in 'Twelve Monkeys,' along with viral pandemic instead of the threat of nuclear apocalypse, by erratic movement--actorly, cinematographically, along with the continued time shifts--within twisted spaces.",6,1,5,1 April 2020
Shaun of the Dead," Gold Standard of Zombie Spoofs
","'Shaun of the Dead,' with the title itself imitating those of George A. Romero's zombie films, such as 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978), is a pleasant diversion from more serious fare in the subgenre, especially when, if like me, you've been viewing a bunch of zombie and other apocalyptic dramas during, as of this posting, the pandemic. The parallels between the yawning protagonist Shaun (Simon Pegg, also co-writer)--working a dead-end job, returning to the same pub night after night and playing mindless video games with his best mate Ed, much to the frustration of his girlfriend, who seeks more culture and varied experience--to thoughtless, slow zombies is even played purely for laughs instead of as some sort of social commentary along the lines of that with materialism in 'Dawn of the Dead.'It's amusing, too, how Shaun's obliviousness to his surroundings is largely reflected in our understanding of the story. While there's some dramatic irony when the outbreak initiates, as the spectator will surely pick up on the escalating population of zombies surrounding Shaun before he realizes it, any explanation for the events remain elusive. Humorously, Shaun's first news of the epidemic on TV is cobbled together by his changing the channels, with words and phrases from each show adding up to a report on the undead. We hardly get a look at the newspaper accounts, either, and as soon as the TV is about to tell us what caused the outbreak, the boob-tube is shut up. Contrast this with, for instance, the rambling of talking heads about radiation from a Venus satellite in 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968). There's also a funny reference to '28 Days Later' (2002), where the outbreak's supposed origins to rage-infected monkeys is dismissed.The point is that it doesn't matter where the zombies came from or that they're an analogy for some real-world problem; 'Shaun of the Dead,' regardless, is going to do the same thing that's been done over and over again, whether it be drinking at the pub or being yet another zombie movie, to make light of it. If you're so bitten, like me, to have binged on numerous zombie movies already, such a sentiment is easy to appreciate.",7,1,1,14 April 2020
Us," Mirror Image
","Writer-director Jordan Peele's prior picture, 'Get Out' (2017), didn't get enough credit for its cinematic allusions and how they doubled the social commentary on race that grabbed most of the attention. Like 'Us,' Peele's follow-up film, it was about doppelgÃ¤ngers, about an idyllic world above and a horrific 'sunken place' below, there was the metaphorical animal motif (deer in 'Get Out' and rabbits in 'Us'), and there was a haunted artist. In 'Get Out,' the protagonist was a photographer, who was desired for his artistic eye. Here, 'Us' features a dancer who is envied for her freedom of expression and movement. Somewhat the inverse of 'Get Out,' however, the socio-political message of 'Us' is submerged, while the artistic, including cinematic, references are lifted to the surface.Some are so conspicuous they are worn on the characters' t-shirts: Michael Jackson's music video 'Thriller' and, while at the beach no less, 'Jaws' (1975). On the boardwalk, a reference is made to 'The Lost Boys' (1987) being filmed, and there are others, intentional or not (I'm not sure whether anyone anymore is intentionally imitating Hans Zimmer's horns from 'Inception' (2010), but they keep coming back, including in the climax here). As in 'Get Out,' TV plays an important part, too, especially for narrative and cultural context. There's the 'Hands Across America' event, as well as some VHS tapes beside the TV of movies that some astute viewers have pointed out bare important themes upon 'Us.' One of them that, at first, doesn't seem to share any similarity to Peele's horror piece is 'The Right Stuff' (1983). (Another recent movie, as an aside, that I've seen to contain a similar reference to the same film but for, assuredly, different intent is 'Captain Marvel' (2019). Go figure.) Like the hand-holding charity event, or the declaration herein of 'We're Americans,' the copy of the patriotic 'The Right Stuff' seems to hint at the underlying agenda of 'Us'--and reminding that the title's letters also stand for 'U.S.'I'll leave it to others to decipher that message, which although less succinct than that of 'Get Out,' seems to be of the muted and downtrodden 'other' below 'us' above who are occupied by keeping up with the Joneses (as best represented here by the Tyler family, and Gabe Wilson's jealousy of their material possessions) and the general hubris of the 'us versus them' mentality at all, and others can investigate the relevance of the Biblical verse 'Jeremiah 11:11.' I'm more interested in the allusions that double, or reflect, the allegory. Plus, I think it's apt that 'Us' focuses more clearly on the surface with those material references; after all, arguably and at the risk of cynicism, even 'Hands Across America' was better at selling t-shirts than it was raising money for charity, let alone alleviating any of the social problems it, or 'Us,' for that matter, raised.Live-action motion pictures themselves have always been doppelgÃ¤ngers--reflecting us back to ourselves and capturing the essence of the living and since dead. Narrative cinema (and, later, TV) caught onto the possibilities of this early on, including 'The Student of Prague' films (1913 and 1926), partly based on the novels of E.T.A. Hoffmann, where the student is haunted by his mirror image (long before any 'Twilight Zone' episode that inspired Peele was made). Although now we have digital processes and CGI, from the beginning, cinema was able to replicate what it had already replicated via effects such as superimpositions (a.k.a. multiple-exposure photography). Even the timelines in 'Us' are doubled. And, then, there are mirrors and shadows, which are analogous to all of this, and like 'The Student of Prague' and others before and after it, 'Us' is full of shots of reflections and silhouettes. Moreover, the narrative's inciting incident--where the doubles meet--takes place in a funhouse of mirrors. Perhaps, Peele wasn't considering Hoffmann and the Germanic roots of dopplegÃ¤ngers. But, he surely had a couple oft-referenced pieces of English-language literature in mind with Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' novels. (Another aside and to highlight how common are allusions to these books, another recent movie I saw was 'The Favourite' (2018), which also featured metaphor-infused rabbits.) Of course, the surface/underground dichotomy is already rife in symbolism, especially with the explicit religious allegory here, but surely it's no coincidence that the hole is entered through the looking-glass and is full of rabbits, nor that what is encountered below is the fantastic reversed, the shadow, or reflection of that above.The slasher horror-film and other, general movie conventions that abound in 'Us' may not always be as refined as in 'Get Out' (and its humor hits more than its scares do). The exposition-bursting climactic twists especially have the feel of a James Bond villain explaining his elaborate scheme solely for the benefit or us, the viewers, as opposed to the more-eloquent use of TV for a similar (and, thankfully, simpler) purpose in 'Get Out.' But, again, as in 'Get Out,' the doubling for the control of and the appearance of the characters bring attention, as does the stylistic focus on mirrors and outlines here, to central concerns of film theory, including the cinematic gaze and character identification, and this is felicitously connected to its message--forcing one to look in the mirror, so to speak, and ask who is us?",8,2,6,27 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Auto-Tuned
","The auto-tuned songs aren't bad, whether they be melodic or parodic, but as a comedy-drama, 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,' it's a cluttered series of miscues. Even the title is an overlong and questionable attempt at humor with both the words 'story' and 'saga.' I can can count on one hand how many moments in the movie gave me mirth. Any attempted exploitation of cultural differences becomes a lost cause. Only the anti-American ranting from the American Will Farrell in an American production somewhat works. Trying to poke fun at homophobia in Russia, for instance, is just depressing. Besides, why every hack piece of slapstick needs a love triangle in the first place is beyond me, although, still, the drama here manages to work better than the comedy. The ghost and elves stuff is stupid (albeit, the line, 'The elves went too far,' is kind of funny). A lot of the rest is the usual dick jokes. Perhaps, my favorite gag is Farrell's blasé response to the beauty, leaping wales included, of Húsavík, Iceland. Indeed, 'Eurovision Song Contest' is in stark contrast to the usual cinematic leveraging of nature in the better pictures set in the Nordics. This one spends more time in a pub watching TV than, say, beside snow-covered mountains, more time swirling the camera around actors lip syncing than on any battle between man and nature.Oh well, at least, Molly Sandén can sing--providing the voice for Rachel McAdams's character. Additionally, since the real Eurovision event has been cancelled for the first time in its history due to the pandemic, streaming this movie on Netflix may offer fans a substitute, pale as it may be, to the real thing, including cameos from several past Eurovision participants.",4,1,7,29 June 2020
Knives Out," Murder Written for Actors
","Critics and audiences are right, this is a fun movie. 'Knives Out' is a clever twist on the whodunit, murder-mystery genre. There's a bit of a commentary on immigration and entitlement in regards to contemporary American politics and the inheritance of wealth, but more interesting methinks is how this narrative unfolds around a writer and actors, as well as the usual detective. Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a writer of murder-mystery books (although, ironically, he doesn't allow for them to be adapted into movies), is found dead of apparent suicide, but a detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), suspects foul play. Ordinarily, we might share the position of the detective in regards to solving the crime, with much of the fun being in seeing whether we could keep up with or figure it out before him. All of the others, essentially, are actors playing actors--lying and scheming for various reasons, at least one of which is presumably because they're the murderer--misleading the detective and us during their interviews and interactions. Much of this remains the case here, but it's complicated by Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), becoming the protagonist, the seeming dramatic irony of the early reveal, and her character's seeming inability to 'act,' for she vomits whenever she lies.Turns out, in a sense, Harlan was right to be weary of his books being acted out, as he tries to write (indeed, he makes a written note of the plot of switched medications down during his final minutes) and stage his own death. Marta inevitably proves incapable of adapting or enacting his instructions, though. She's an ideal protagonist, however, as she cannot lie, and although she tries to withhold information from the detective, through flashbacks and other means, she never withholds from us, the spectator. The same can't be said of Blanc, or of other fictional detectives, for that matter. Even Craig's over-the-top accent--at one point, a crack is made that it's 'CSI: KFC'--marks him as actorly. (Personally, I couldn't help but think of Michael Scott from 'The Office' saying 'There's been a murder in Savannah.') Not so with Marta, who also has a common and relatable backstory, of having an undocumented mother, of being self-made and hard-working in the face of the indignities thrown at her by Harlan's spoiled offspring. Although she's a nurse, in one scene, one of them hands her a dirty plate as though she were a maid, while he also barrages her with leading questions about illegal immigration, and as he and the rest confuse from what country she immigrated from. Both sides of the Tronmbey clan play out a parody of a left-right debate over immigration policy under the Trump administration, including a teenage son supposedly trolling alt-right vitriol on social media. They unite, however, upon their shared greed for an inheritance they feel entitled to, been born into and raised on.The irony of the murder mystery is even richer: that there wasn't even a murder at all until the writer, Harlan, wrote it and tried to help his suspect get away with it, as though she were a character from one of his books. He didn't count on a detective seemingly also straight from his prose--indeed, Blanc relates how his father knew Harlan--taking the case, though. All of these writerly and actorly characters play out the whodunit, as we honestly follow Marta, the only honest one of the bunch, trying to make sense of it all. Sure, there are clues, too. I especially appreciate how the mug, that piece of notepaper, and the business with knives come back in the end. But, solving the mystery is secondary here to merely enjoying the amusing, reflexive construction, with all the twists and turns. I was content to remain as informed or as ignorant as Marta to the end, to wait until Blanc inevitably gathers everyone together and explains everything.",8,9,16,13 March 2020
The Irishman," Old Man's Story
","Viewing a movie that runs nearly three-and-a-half hours long, I demand it grapple with weighty subject matter; I have little patience for laborious trivialities. Fortunately, 'The Irishman' deals with no less than issues of life, aging and death, and it's framed fundamentally by the art of storytelling. While the story of Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance has held long-term interest, it's secondary here to the gang of old men who come together again to tell another story about the mafia and brutality, with Martin Scorsese directing a cast led by Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino. This is well-trodden ground for them all; Scorsese previously helmed De Niro and Pesci in 'Raging Bull' (1980), 'Goodfellas' (1990) and 'Casino' (1995), has frequently collaborated with De Niro and Harvey Keitel since 'Mean Streets' (1973), and while this is the director's first work with Pacino, the actor has been in plenty of gangster films made by others, beginning with 'The Godfather' trilogy. This filmic heritage is what truly bears weight in the narrative's historical expanse, and it finally allows for some intelligent use of de-aging CGI--a technology that up to this point has been mostly employed for action, superhero and otherwise stupid flicks.Sure, I agree with others that the reverse-aging process here is more convincing than past attempts. Most recently, I complained of 'Captain Marvel' (2019) (I have yet to see 'Gemini Man' (2019)), that young Fury's inflexible skin transgressed the uncanny valley, which wasn't helped by conspicuously hiding him under various lighting schemes. And this despite such a comic-book movie already being largely animated. One would think for a picture more purely photographic as 'The Irishman' that the technology would be even more distracting, but I didn't find that the case. The one big exception for me has nothing to do with any facial 'sheen' mentioned by others, but with movement. This is most evident in scenes of fighting or other violent actions. A 70-year old Samuel L. Jackson doesn't throw a punch like he would over 20 years ago, and so it looks off when his de-aged self does just that in the 1995 setting of 'Captain Marvel.' In 'The Irishmen,' De Niro and Pacino sometimes look like young and middle-age bodies walking around like the elderly men they really are, but the scene where De Niro throws a grocer onto the curb was the one scene that put me off the effect technically. How to put this not delicately... De Niro looks like the Frankenstein monster, a re-animated body of dead parts stitched together, lumbering after his victim. I was almost afraid he was going to toss his daughter into a lake next. But, besides that, it looks fine.More importantly, the digital fountain of youth is well integrated into the narrative structure. This isn't just about exploiting stars (and, sometimes, long-since-dead ones--looking your way, 'Rogue One' (2016))) for blockbuster time-traveling gimmicks. Here, the plot is established as the remembrances of a disabled and elderly Frank Sheeran (De Niro) sitting in a nursing home, addressing the camera but no other character in particular. Narratively and technically, this is an old actor--Sheeran and De Niro--reflecting on their younger selves. Not as they were when young, either, but how one mutates their current identity into the memory of their past self. And, by extension, the same goes for Pacino and Pesci, all of whom are on-screen surrogates for the film's auteur, Scorsese. In turn, we the spectators bring our own memories of these artists' past films to the process. To only look at this as the story solving Hoffa's disappearance is to not see the whole picture. Indeed, that assumes De Niro's Sheeran is a reliable narrator in the first place, which I'm not taking for granted. This a man nearing death, left with only strangers (FBI agents, a nurse, a priest and, through the camera, us) to confess to. He's either outlived everyone else, including those he may've murdered, or been abandoned by a family revolted by his violent ways. The story itself revolves a lot around gangsters relaying stories to others and through intermediaries, employing code words and speaking in riddles (including the original title, 'I Heard You Paint Houses'). Sometimes these stories are understood, others are tragically not, as with Hoffa, still others turn out to result from misinformation, such as with a 'bad hit,' and still more are lies, beginning with the missing meat, and confabulations. That's what the de-aging CGI and the movie itself are, too, after all: a fiction.Bringing your own memories of past films from these master storytellers makes this something of a culmination of the filmmakers' oeuvres. It's more about the life, aging and inevitability of death of gangster filmmakers (and us viewers) than it's about the gangster characters in the story. Furthermore, Scorsese and his 'New Hollywood' ilk radically changed film beginning in the middle of the last century (around the same time that the story in the movie takes place, by the way). Now, movies are more often digital rather than film. Even live-action pictures that aren't action and superhero fare are substantially animated and made by computers into photorealistic imagery. Although most are made to look like they were made on film, they aren't. These movies, too, are seen less and less in cinemas. Like most viewers probably, I waited out its limited theatrical release, to see 'The Irishman' streamed on Netflix. Heck, even if you see a 'film' in a theatre, it's likely to be from a disc, hard drive, satellite or Internet stream--like Netflix on a bigger screen. Indeed, the narrative's passage of time is further reflected in the style of the picture, down to its TV images, aging and de-aging along with the actors and characters. In the end, perhaps, it's film's mortality that is most striking. As 'The Irishman' indicates, its life to its death has already had a profound impact on our reminiscences and continued storytelling. We're left mostly only with the myth in place of its disappearance.",9,4,12,28 November 2019
Superbad," Only Ordinarily Bad
","I panned 'Superbad' in my review of 'Booksmart' (2019), a movie that's essentially a gender-reversed, politically-correct updating of this teen party flick--not that there's much novelty in a coming-of-age comedy of drinking and sex played to pop music and full of gross-out and otherwise juvenile humor. Anyways, I don't like to dismiss movies I haven't seen in years, so I reviewed 'Superbad,' and it's just as bad as I remember. Unfortunately, it's only ordinary bad, rather than super such, whereby one would've been afforded more laughter at its expense instead of the unreliable intended gags. Why, then, the picture begins by cribbing its title and opening-titles sequence from the blaxploitation film 'Foxy Brown' (1974) is beyond me. What does that have to do with this generic piece on sex-crazed, middle-class white kids plus, seemingly more obtusely, two white cops. Bafflingly stupid.Sure, I chuckled here or there at a few of the other stupid jokes, but most of them are duds. I couldn't care less whether the friendships are mended in the end, or whether the boys hook up with their dream girls--not only because the conclusions are obvious--but also because it's a thin veneer of a plot put onto a picture that follows the chaotic rhythm of partying. And, this is where 'Superbad' is especially, well, bad. Looking back at this, there's a considerable amount of dead space; it isn't propelled forward by the soundtrack in the way 'Booksmart' is, or as with, say, another Michael Cera-starring party picture, 'Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist' (2008). 'Booksmart' also benefits from some creative filmmaking, including drug-induced fantasy sequences and underwater photography. Other than Jonah Hill considering a few possible scenarios if he tries to steal liquor in one scene, there's nothing here that's not pedestrian. The camera views and cutting are entirely straightforward. To cite another film that 'Superbad' references obliviously, the 'Citizen Kane' (1941) of sex comedies, this isn't.",3,0,4,22 November 2019
The Mummy," Raiders of the Lost Mummy
","Since its beginnings, Universal's Mummy franchise, like the resurrected corpse in this one, has often found vitality in sucking the life force from other films. The 1932 'Mummy' starring Boris Karloff did so by reusing the plot and many of the details from the 1931 'Dracula.' The 1940s Kharis series adopted the aesthetics of serials and B-picture adventures. Distributed by Universal, Hammer studios reworked these prior Mummy movies in its pastiche of 1959. The latest version of 2017 tried to imitate comic-book superhero movies. And, this 'Mummy' of 1999 went full circle by borrowing, as plenty of others have pointed out, from the Indian Jones franchise, which in turn the Kharis series in particular has been credited as an influence on, along with other classic adventure films. Parts of the prior Universal mummy movies are also reworked here, though, and the 1999 version put a new twist on things with CGI--well before the 2017 Dark Universe debacle did likewise.Besides adopting and reworking the most popular aspects of Ancient Egyptian history and myth--the Book of the Dead, a hidden Valley of the Kings, the curse of King Tut's tomb and Old Testament stories of Jewish slaves and plagues--the basic story here is taken from the earlier 'Mummies,' with treasure hunters searching for a lost Ancient Egyptian tomb, unleashing a curse, and the Mummy seeking a living female vessel to restore life to his ancient forbidden love, a princess. This Mummy has the same name as Karloff's, taken from the historical pyramid architect, Imhotep, and both characters don't like to be touched, which they explain is 'a silly Eastern superstition.' There's an Egyptologist curator who secretly guards against the discovery of the tomb like in 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940), including by partially destroying evidence of its location--pottery in the original and a map here. The cutting off the tongue business, I think, is from the 1959 Hammer version. And there's an ancient flashback scene, which is placed at the beginning here, which isn't as interesting as the self-reflexive pool visions in the 1932 film, which two Kharis pictures later cannibalized.The 1932 'Mummy,' which is otherwise the best of the bunch, suffers from creaky sound, deathly-slow pacing and stiff acting. This 'Mummy' solves that problem by adopting the mix of action and comic relief from the Indiana Jones movies. Beyond that, it also replaces 'Bugs, I hate bugs' for Indiana's fear of snakes; the assortment of booby traps and secret passages; and the Biblical-level revenge upon those who trespass. At the least, taking the Indian Jones formula and infusing its classic monster story with CGI alleviates any problems with dullness, movement and pacing. As a horror film, however, the repetitive gaping mouth thing is more yawn-inducing than frightening. It could've done without the silly cat business, too.Despite its flaws, one can only wish that Universal's recent attempts at launching the Dark Universe, with its superhero action-movie antics in 'Dracula Untold' (2014) and the 2017 'Mummy,' had someone as competent as Stephen Sommers at the helm. Besides integrating Universal's mummy property into an Indian Jones framework, he created the monster-rally 'Van Helsing' (2004), which blended elements of James Bond, 'Moulin Rouge!' (2001) and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine with Universal's traditional Dracula, Frankenstein and werewolf monsters.",6,2,4,12 October 2018
Brokeback Mountain," Queer Normality
","It's fabulous to reflect on, writing this in 2020, how much has changed in the 15 years since 'Brokeback Mountain' was released. It was singular at the time as a serious film about gayness that was mainstream, and it's the play on cinematic conventions and normality that is central to its aesthetic quality, as well as its societal influence in broadening the acceptance of homosexuality. There are no tropes of flamboyancy here. No depictions of LGBT political activity and hardly any focus on places where gay men might congregate (the entire nation of Mexico, somewhere in which Jack looks for male prostitutes, coming closest). Instead, it's set in the most iconic of American genres, of conservative rural areas and repressive past times, within heterosexual marriages and families, and at the heart of the country's cinematic formation of masculinity for over a century, the Western. Indeed, it's also part melodrama, even soap opera, and almost Shakespearean tragedy, which largely makes for the picture's emotional appeal. It's this plea to the familiar that made 'Brokeback Mountain' a landmark in film history. Fifteen years later, as 'Brokeback' has become slang and lines such as 'I wish I knew how to quit you' have become infinitely quotable and parodied, let alone increased tolerance of sexuality in the world at large, there may be risk of losing sight of how extraordinary this ordinariness was then.It's there in the cinematography, too. Sure, we see a well-composed cloudy, hillside vista here and there between scenes in the wilderness, but intrusion of pretty landscapes here are reserved for the other side of the postcards Ennis and Jack write to each other. These are familiar views for these cowboys and so become so for the spectator. These are men fully shaped by and belonging to this environment. It's in the populated spaces of the West where they sometimes run afoul, where Ennis fights other men out of his frustration, or where Jack suffers the emasculation by his father-in-law or tries to carefully navigate other liaisons. Probably the most conspicuously staged shot in the entire picture happens at a town fireworks show, the explosions of light and color in the background as Heath Ledger stands over a low-angle shot after he's just got into a violent altercation with two men. There doesn't seem to be any counterpoint shots in the mountains for the pun on 'explosive' of this shot in town, or even, say, the contrast of Jack riding a bull at a rodeo before shortly thereafter being ridden by his soon-to-be-wife in a car.The acting is remarkable and subtle, too. Yes, Heath Ledger is great, but so is the supporting cast, including as well as Jake Gyllenhaal, the two actresses playing the lovers' wives, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway. Just as early on, as Ledger and Gyllenhaal's exchange of looks told us all we needed to know about their attraction for each other even before their first sexual or intimate contact, we can see in the faces of Williams and Hathaway how much they know about the affair and how they've coped with it. We see this early on with Williams as a co-spectator to the unfolding romance and how she struggles to remain with us in not interfering or participating in it. Hathaway provides an opposite tract, of a wife seemingly wrapped up in the dynamics of her family business and her relationship to Jack seemingly only extending to his role in raising their son and dealing with her domineering father. But, then, we get that fantastic phone call near the end and an array of emotional indications as to how much she may have known and reacted to it. There's been a lot of discussion, legitimately, about how 'Brokeback Mountain' and Ledger should've won the top prizes at the Oscars, but the biggest snub is arguably that Hathaway was the only one of the four to not even be nominated.But, back to the men, the Western genre here is key to the picture's take on masculinity. Narrative cinema in the United States was practically founded in the Western with 'The Great Train Robbery' (1903) and continued through Hollywood churning out B-picture shoot-'em-ups with stars such as Tom Mix performing riding tricks, saving damsels and gunning down other men--all before the likes of John Ford and Clint Eastwood further defined an ultra-aggressive and conservative ideology of manhood on screen, whether by slaughtering Indians, tavern stand-offs, or street duels, in the name of the politics of Manifest Destiny and the rights to and protection of the leading ladies. It's all of that familiar structure that 'Brokeback Mountain' was intentionally positioned, with a short story originally written by a woman and co-adapted by another, as directed by a Taiwanese filmmaker, Ang Lee, and that is about gay cowboys, one of whom accompanies his wife to see one of those classic Westerns, 'Hud' (1963), at a drive-in theatre. Sure, they're the 'Marlboro Men;' smoking, fighting whisky drinkers eating beans over a campfire, the strong silent types, more John Wayne than Judy Garland. That's the point. It's how 'Brokeback Mountain' upended the entire industry's treatment of homosexuality and masculinity, and it's what makes it, including through the cinematography, a beautiful piece of art.",10,0,0,23 June 2020
About Time," I Want to Go Back in Time to Not Watch This
","See, this is why I shouldn't just play a movie on Netflix without researching it a bit. Had I done my homework, I would've known that 'About Time' was made by the same nitwit behind 'Love, Actually' (2003), a movie which is awful, actually. Perhaps, I could've foreseen that, no, this will not be a clever narrative about time travel; it will ruin the fun of it, actually, and all for the sake of sophomoric sentimentality. Movie rom-com love is a powerful force, I will grant you--it can crush all love and intelligence from just about anything, and Richard Curtis seems to be out to prove that.It should go without saying that the time travel here is nonsensical and breaks nearly every rule it establishes in the first place and invents new ones along the way for plot convenience, or that it's entirely self-centered for the happiness of the creepy hero (no superhero antics for this supernatural egoist; he's content to manipulate the unsuspecting lives of those around him for his own benefit). Even the mixing of time travel with a silly movie romance isn't original (in fact, Rachel McAdams had already starred in another one, 'The Time Traveler's Wife' (2009)), but, then, nothing here is original. This is the same cookie-cutter trifle full of clichÃ©s and stock characters offered to movie-goers over and over again.Oh, and how condescending to have these moneyed filmmakers with their budgets and revenues of millions of dollars preach to us about money being 'a mixed bag,' as the father character claims. Sure, better to drown our minds in lovey-dovey sap at the price of a ticket by watching millionaires tell us what's important in life. Let's trade each other our mixed bags of money, then tell me what's important in life, actually.",2,2,9,30 April 2019
Match Point," Crime and No Punishment: Allen on Dostoevsky, Part II
","Generally considered one of Woody Allen's more atypical films, which being made outside of New York (in this case, London) makes that consideration true, I suppose, 'Match Point' is in other ways similar to his 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' (1989) and later 'Irrational Man' (2015), all of which contest the underlying philosophy of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel 'Crime and Punishment.' The 1989 film only alluded to this with its play on the book's title, but 'Match Point' more noticeably acknowledges Dostoevsky's influence by including a scene where the film's protagonist, Chris, is reading the novel, as well as 'The Cambridge Companion to Dostoevsky.' The patriarch of the Hewett family later remarks that Chris made insightful comments regarding the Russian author. Indeed, Chris goes on to test Raskolnikov's, the book's protagonist, theory regarding getting away with murder. The motive for the crime, however, is more akin to that of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' rather than that of Raskolnikov, and 'Match Point' also seems indebted to the oeuvre of Alfred Hitchcock, especially 'Strangers on a Train' (1951) and 'Vertigo' (1958).As with one of the leads in Hitchcock's former film, Chris is a tennis player who plans to marry up, and both get involved in a murder plot. There's also the attention to symbolic objects: the lighter in 'Strangers on a Train,' for instance, and the tennis ball and ring in 'Match Point.' There's no homosexual coding along the lines of Hitchcock's picture in Allen's, however, regardless of two men enjoying the opera and sleeping with the same woman. Meanwhile, the picture's movie romance and art gallery sequence shadow 'Vertigo.' As for 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,' 'Match Point' lifts the dilemma of a mistress who threatens to expose their affair to the wife. Both also exploit their crime as an atheistic antithesis to Dostoevsky's Orthodox conservatism. None of the comedy and cinematic reflexivity of the prior film is carried over, though. There is the spectatorship of opera, the musical 'The Woman in White,' and an American actress, Scarlett Johansson, plays an American actress, but not much is done with any of that. Much more is made of social class here, however, which is more in line with Dostoevsky's prose and the movie's British setting. The Irish tennis-pro-turned-businessman and the struggling American actress are both the active and suspect characters in the drawing-room play of a life of leisure preoccupying the English and wealthy Hewett family.Shared among Allen, Dostoevsky and Hitchcock are their inclusions of doubles motifs. In 'Match Point,' there's the two players in tennis, the two lower-class foreigners, the two upper-class siblings and their two parents, the two men, as in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,' who both have affairs and marriages, each in this case causing two pregnancies, Chris's, like Raskolinikov's, and as planned in 'Strangers on a Train,' two murders (well, three counting the pregnancy), and even two detectives. One man breaks off his engagement after impregnating his mistress, while the other decides to preserve his union by murdering his expecting lover, which recalls the duality of Allen and Martin Landau's characters in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,' the two protagonists in 'Strangers on a Train,' Kim Novak's doppelgängers in 'Vertigo,' and Raskolnikov and Svidrigaïlov in 'Crime and Punishment.'Although this is all interesting material, 'Match Point' is rather meandering, despite some critics' claim of it being a 'taut thriller.' Without the Dostoevsky foreshadowing, the crime would've seemed entirely out of place. The classism doesn't add anything, and the luck business seems overly simplistic compared to Allen's prior philosophizing. The dreary picture reflects its subject matter. And some of the borrowings here seem trite; there's even a make-out session in the rain, which I know it rains a lot in England, but had Allen just seen 'The Notebook' (2004) or something? Nevertheless, after seeking a bunch of film adaptations after reading 'Crime and Punishment,' I continue to be impressed that Allen more intelligently engages with the text, as well as other films, than do other filmmakers, whether of straightforward adaptations or inspired reworkings such as 'Match Point.'",6,1,2,26 September 2019
Milk," Penn Laughs!
","Many great--and even not so great--actors, it at least seems to me, give arguably their best performances when playing against type. I tend not to be very fond of the comedies of, for instance, Steve Carell, Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, or Robin Williams and others before them in such vein, but their more dramatic work is sometimes excellent. Conversely, Leslie Nielsen was a rather undistinguished dramatic actor before 'Airplane!' (1980). The lovely Charlize Theron won an Oscar for portraying 'Monster' (2003). Matthew McConaughey revealed he could act when he stepped out of rom-coms. There's Henry Fonda as the villain in 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (1968). Charlie Chaplin as a serial killer in 'Monsieur Verdoux' (1947). Or, the rare feat as proclaimed by the tagline for 'Ninotchka' (1939), 'Garbo Laughs!' Well, in 'Milk,' Sean Penn comes across as a nice guy. That he plays the historical figure of Harvey Milk, the first openly homosexual man elected to public office in California, seems less astounding than that he appears 'gay' in the dated sense of the word as cheerful.'Milk' is a solid and well-enacted, if largely standard and by-the-numbers, biopic besides Penn, but he obviously dominates the picture. The other thing I especially like about this one, however, is the exploiting of other art forms or media to form the plot. In addition to the usual oratory found on political soap boxes, Penn's Harvey narrates an audio recording for the framing narrative, which he tellingly says is only to be heard upon his assassination. Then, there's the camera shop he opens, with the film sometimes taking on the appearance of the photography of the era in which it's set, including some 16mm film and documentary style. Finally, there's the opera, which Harvey attends and is framed in the film as akin to Lincoln's assassination at Ford's Theatre. Notice that although that's not where Milk is murdered, it's the place he was shortly before and where he looks in the end.Although that makes it sound as though 'Milk' is a downer, and, indeed, it is in that it ends in tragedy and covers the politics of America's history of homophobia, overall, this is a joyful and positive picture. We see Harvey lose election after election and the gay community abused by police and bigots repeatedly while their rights are taken away city by state, but, eventually, Milk successfully leads the effort against John Briggs and Anita Bryant's discriminatory campaigns in California and establishes the LGBT movement as a political force. And, now, the marriage debate that saw setbacks in California and elsewhere around the time this film was released has become history with the legalization of gay marriage throughout the country and much of the world. 'You've gotta give them hope,' as Milk says. Turns out, he did.",7,0,0,26 June 2020
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Howdy Doody Time
","Added to the clockwork motif from the first Hellboy movie, for this sequel, is puppetry. This is established early on with a flashback of young Hellboy being a fan of 'Howdy Doody' on TV (a puppet show that also featured a clock in its opening) and hearing a bedtime story from his father that is visualized as a puppet show about the Golden Army, which are magical militaristic puppets to their master. Writer-Director's Guillermo del Toro's admitted fetishizing of objects seems to even extend to the supernatural creatures here. The troll market, reminiscent of the cantina scene in 'Star Wars' (1977), may be the best example of this, with a multitude of monstrous creatures serving only as objects of curiosity. The irony is that the story concerns Hellboy and company being ostracized from human society. In a sense, they're objectified for their appearances.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow through very far with this thread and, instead, mostly focuses on the romantic coupling of the 'freaks.' Moreover, the X-Men movie series had already better-developed the theme, as it had better incorporated Nazis into the same framework as opposed to the Indian-Jones-type nonsense of 'Hellboy' (2004). Even the quick glances here of Hellboy's TV showing Universal's classic monster movies such as 'Bride of Frankenstein' (1935) and 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' (1954) come off as lazy shorthand to latch onto what other films followed through on. Otherwise, 'Hellboy II' wastes time setting up another sequel that, as of over a decade since (and a reboot, to boot), has never materialized. There's no other reason, but to setup a subsequent movie, for the sequence involving and leading up to the encounter with the Angel of Death. Additionally, again, as in the first movie, there's a sword-swirling baddie, with all of the silly swoosh-and-whoosh sounds effects. There's also some other twirling about, some slow-motion action, and this sequel seems especially fond of characters sliding backwards on their feet during fight scenes. On the other hand, Hellboy and the merman drunkenly singing is a nice change of pace from the usual clockwork of this superhero franchise, and the creepy tooth fairies were rather effective at making me feel itchy.",4,0,0,8 October 2019
Cloverfield," America's Godzilla
","Although Hollywood has remade 'Godzilla' a few times, it never made much sense as an American monster movie. That's because the original 'Gojira' was an allegory for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 'Cloverfield' is a similar cinematic processing in the kaiju tradition of national tragedy, that of 9/11. Others have done likewise with sci-fi adaptation ('War of the Worlds' (2005), superhero fare ('The Avengers' (2012), Man of Steel' (2013)) and still others merely add robots to combat the kaiju ('Pacific Rim' (2013)), or make the kaiju robotic ('Transformers'). In other words, there's been a lot of movies translating the attacks to an invasion from outer-space aliens--one world fighting another and usually turned into a cinematic universe or, otherwise, a franchise. 'Avatar' (2009) even reverses the trajectory by having Americans as the invaders of an alien planet. Anyways, 'Cloverfield' appropriately enough includes, reportedly, blinking footage from early American monster movies 'King Kong' (1933), 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms' (1953) and 'Them!' (1954) (although the Statue of Liberty head, referencing 'Escape from New York' (1981), is better done).The gimmick added on this in 'Cloverfield,' besides the much remarked upon paratextual marketing schemes of the franchise, is the pretending found footage--a technique popularized in horror movies by 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) and preceded by 'Cannibal Holocaust' (1980). Theoretically, this offers the simplicity of the spectator's gaze, already associated with or directed by that of the camera, to be directly associated with a character or multiple ones--something that classically is done more loosely by a series of looks (e.g. shot of protagonist looking at something or someone being followed by a direct cut to a shot of what they're looking at). Unfortunately, the main character as camera here is portrayed by T.J. Miller. On the other hand, the handheld camerawork putting us in the point-of-view of the character also distances us from him to the extent that he's largely removed from the footage. That the footage is supposedly found further removes them. In a sense, they're already dead even if the characters didn't turn out that way by movie's end.Besides the tediousness, if not downright offensiveness, of making cinematic spectacle out of 9/11--an act of terrorism that was already remarkable, for among other obvious reasons, as a televised spectacle--'Cloverfield' also offers a hackneyed and simplistic setup, of a surprise party and unrequited love--this time, abruptly interrupted by immersive alien invasion pandemonium. Miller's idiot doesn't even provide effective comedic relief, and the other characters are wooden. '10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016) is better simply because it has compelling characterizations, and its black humor rather works.Others have also commented on the obscuring of the view of the aliens, as aided by the found-footage style--as a character more afraid for their life and running away rather than trying to capture the best camera angles, but we get pretty good and increasingly better looks at the monster and monsters and their destruction before that final facial close-up. It's hardly Lovecraftian, and if anything the camerawork is suspiciously too good to pull off the effect. One of many alien-invasion 9/11 movie metaphors and another horror flick to employ the found-footage technique is not a philosophically cosmic exploration of the unknown, either. Regardless, the technique does echo how much of 9/11 was actually recorded and presented on TV, and it's interesting to track how tragic national events, from WWII and before through the War on Terror have been represented figuratively in cinema. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a slew of pandemic parables on screen in the years to come. '10 Cloverfield Lane' already resonates more today with much of the world under shelter-in-place orders. This is the second time I've seen the original 'Cloverfield,' as well, but it hasn't improved as such with age; if anything, what may have been seen by some as novel in 2008 isn't very impressive with hindsight.",5,1,1,17 April 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Trumploitation
","Spike Lee has an engaging dramatic-license-taken, based-on-a-true-story with 'BlacKkKlansman,' of an undercover operation led by a black police officer to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan, and it's ripe for making into a subtle critique of the current Trump presidency and continued violence, including by law enforcement, against African Americans, but subtle Lee is not and, instead, the blunt polemic is hammered into our heads. There's also a nice concurrent theme concerning the mainstream Hollywood white-supremacist epics 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915) and 'Gone with the Wind' (1939) contrasted with early-1970s blaxploitation films, of which Lee's film aptly borrows much of its style.I thought 'The Post' (2017) was too obvious in its paralleling a Nixon-era narrative with current events, but 'BlacKkKlansman' could've benefited from even that level of understatedness. On one hand, the opening sequence is rather good at connecting all of the threads, with clips from the aforementioned 1915 and 1939 films being projected during the making of Klan propaganda-- the hate speech being delivered by none other than 'Saturday Night Live' Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin. But, then, the film continues to make certain no member of the audience is left behind in understanding the message. There's the joke that America would never elect a David Duke type, although that was the only part of this rather satirically-approached picture that received a laugh from the audience I was in. The historical events are pushed back to coincide with Nixon's 1972 Southern strategy. And, finally, there's the epilogue of real footage from the 2017 Charlottesville protests and car attack and President Trump's much-criticized remarks thereafter. It's too much.The cinematic allusions aren't exactly subtle, either, but I think they're sometimes executed better. Although there's a conversation between the lovers debating their favorite blaxploitation flicks, this film also incorporates the genre into its style, including by actually being a film photographed on film. I especially like the brief disco scene, which is energetically compiled. I haven't seen much blaxploitation fare, but of the ones I've seen, they tend to include musical nightclub interruptions to the plot. They also contain scenes where the characters debate opposing sides of the approaches of African Americans to white-dominated America, whether to fight injustices from outside or to reform from within, especially regarding law enforcement. This one does the same thing, including one man becoming a city's first black cop, who, then, poses as white to expose the Klan and another cop, who's Jewish, 'passing' in predominantly-Christian white America and acting anti-Semitic to infiltrate the same Organization. Similarly, they earlier go undercover at a Black Panther speech by Stokely Carmichael.Unfortunately, Lee's anti-racist polemic can't entirely escape the kind of filmic rhetoric that has underpinned so much of Hollywood cinema all the way back to the racist pomposity of 'The Birth of a Nation.' Just as in the film, the black student union's 'black power' slogan forms a sound bridge with the 'white power' chant of the Klan. While surely not hoping for the sort of hooting and hollering of the Klansmen at the racist caricatures of white actors in blackface of the screening of the 1915 film within this film, it may be expected that supporters cheer the message of 'BlacKkKlansman' just as audiences once roared for the KKK racing to the rescue in the climax of its predecessor. More interesting and likely more successfully than whether this affects the political and racial issues in America is whether Lee has changed the course from within of the white-dominated movie business. It's the Organization he's been infiltrating for some time now.",6,55,113,29 August 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," Superficial Spirits
","I gave 'The Shape of Water' (2017) high marks, but I'm not finding Guillermo del Toro to be a very interesting filmmaker as of yet despite the praise he receives from others. The same reservations I had for his Best Picture Oscar winner, I hold for this, 'Pan's Labyrinth,' but this earlier picture also lacks the reflexive inversion of a classic film (in that case, 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' (1954) to partially make up for it. I held out hope, too, finally coming to this due to rumors of it sharing similarities with Lewis Carroll's Alice books, for which I've been seeking a bunch of related movies lately. Unfortunately, besides the rabbit-hole-like entries to a fantasy land, the dress and the business with small doors, 'Pan's Labyrinth' doesn't really have anything to do with Alice's adventures; instead, it's a bland conflation of a generic fairy tale seemingly of del Toro's own design. Girl must solve quests given to her by a faun to become princess. I'm not counting it among the Alice films I've been collecting.So, what does 'Pan's Labyrinth' offer us, then? As in the rest of his oeuvre, the visuals and CGI impress, although they're darkly lit. But, the characterizations and storytelling is exceedingly simplistic. In the home-video commentary, del Toro valorizes the perspective of a child, which seems to be something he's unfortunately internalized. Consequently, there's no complexity, no nuance to his world. The baddies are bad and the goodies are good. The faun and ferries are supposedly a bit more ambiguous, but not by much. As in 'The Shape of Water,' there are nurturing mother figures, good spies, and Sergi López plays the same role here that Michael Shannon occupies in the later production, to play dastardly and even to be physically mutilated. In this one, even the fairytale magic and the historical drama hardly interact, although they're both juvenile visions lacking intricacy. The opposite of a labyrinth.The framework on display here is too facile even for superhero fare, which is why his 'Hellboy' movies suffered, too. Even there, he began to ground their narratives in other movies, by connection to Universal's classic monster movies, which may be one of the more obvious methods to enrich a picture, but it may be all that can be hoped for with a filmmaker of this limited of a vision. 'The Shape of Water' may be the pinnacle of that, and I don't see where he can improve from there without altering this formula For Pan's Labyrinth, set directly after the Spanish Civil War, a conspicuous filmic precedent is 'The Spirit of the Beehive' (1973), which is also about a child looking to fantasy to cope with the horrors of reality (in that case, through the classic 'Frankenstein' (1931) film). 'Beehive' is vastly more sophisticated than 'Labyrinth,' as well as visually richer. It engages intellectually by its oblique stance to its subject and earns its emotional appeals to the spectator by such depth. By contrast, this movie is simple, superficial and spiritless.",4,1,3,14 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Ancestral Forces
","The conclusion to the latest Star Wars trilogy, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is cluttered with characters of trivial interest. I couldn't care less about the new, wannabe Han Solo's relationship with the helmeted woman, for instance, nor his friendship with the former stormtrooper, nor that guy's with another ex-stormtrooper, and so on. None of that is significantly developed or consequential here, so why would I be interested? The series' continued introductions of cute robots (the new one here being reminiscent of Pixar's Luxo lamp, the logo of another former studio of George Lucas since sold off to Disney) and small creatures continues to be a nuisance, whereas moments of humor generally fall flat (e.g. the shot of the guy holding a flashlight next to Rey's lightsaber, I can tell was meant to be funny, but I don't see how it actually is so). The movie is bloated in plot and runtime, with deus ex machina (essentially Lando Calrissian's entire role in this one, besides also seemingly setting up some spin-off or paratext when he suggests an adventure with some other character in the end), red herrings, MacGuffins and plot conveniences abounding. The underlying struggle, too, as with much of the Star Wars universe, between good and evil is the epitome of banality.Try to avoid being distracted in the weeds by that stuff, however, for there is a more appreciable conclusion here in the commitment to building atop and reconstructing the original series. J.J. Abrams and company revived the first trilogy so as to add new characters and storylines, which in turn were reworkings of the original ones. It's as circular and repetitive as the continual chases and stand-offs in the plot. But, there are characters able to pass between scenes and between Star Wars movies. The Millennium Falcon jumps through planets and scenes in space early on. The three stars from the first run--Leia, Luke and Han--all do likewise as spirits, from the dead or otherwise to another space they're not physically present. They are past films remembered onto and sutured into the new ones. Luke's image being projected in 'The Last Jedi' (2017) was another twist on this. Of the characters new to this trilogy, only Rey and Ben share this power. Not coincidentally, these five characters are also the only interesting ones. Even if Rey and Ben's relationship recalls Luke's attempts to convert Darth Vader in 'Return of the Jedi,' at least it develops and is consequential to this narrative, which is more than can be said about all the distractions and road bumps in the plot that are just there.Although the repeated lightsaber swashbuckling may grow tiresome or the constipated looks and raising of hands to battle over moving objects or project lightning or whatever by forced telekinesis may be ridiculous--no matter how gripping John Williams' score--this psychic connection between Rey and Ben is compelling. It's more than a banal struggle between good and evil; it's between ancestral cults, Jedi and Sith. It's the force of past Star Wars films... which, after all, is also what compels many of us to continue to appear for screenings of these franchise additions: the memory of their filmic ancestors. The otherwise distracting side characters tend to be, like the main ones, preoccupied with their ancestry or their past, as well. Heck, even the business with C3PU's memory connects to this thread. The best part of Rey and Ben's duels, too, is that they perform them atop of the old films (thus, suturing themselves and the spectator into multiple scenes and films simultaneously): swashbuckling over Darth Vader's helmet, the drowned Death Star and, ultimately, among the spirits of all the past Star Wars films to harness these ancestral forces.",6,2,8,15 January 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing
","The Queen soundtrack is great, of course, and technically 'Bohemian Rhapsody' deserves the praise. It's a well-paced biopic, too, that hits all of the expected notes, but it's manufactured vapidity conflated by an ahistorical arrangement to create baddies while trivializing the part of drugs, homosexuality and AIDS in the life of Freddie Mercury.Reportedly, the biggest mainstream LGBT movie yet, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' ridiculously makes its gay protagonist's romantic life revolve around a woman, whereby he's not depicted as having a boyfriend until after he's diagnosed with AIDS. There are several references to his apparent sex life with his to-be wife, including them lying in bed and him boasting about it in front of her deaf father, in addition to the overriding theme of their love for each other. Meanwhile, his homosexual relationships are either hardly hinted at with the odd glance or confused with sexual harassment by a forced kiss here and a posterior grab there, until he's outed in the media, for partaking in a series of sexual encounters that were never shown. Tellingly, illicit drugs receive a similar obfuscated approach, with their mostly being only suggested by dancing and partying, alcohol and ashtrays. A PG-13 picture of a rock star is just a mistake, but the apparent shyness and queasiness over sexuality is worse. Hiding the queerness off stage while celebrating Mercury when he struts it in front of a crowd--consequently, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is more of an extended Queen concert than a biopic.A recorded concert, that is--more akin to watching the Live Aid event on the telly if it weren't live instead of being there in the stadium. It's a 'perfect performance,' as one band member quips, when they're told their show for the BBC will be playback, requiring them only to lip sync. Well, Rami Malek won an Oscar for lip syncing his way through the performances of Mercury. Admittedly, he does the part well visually, including the prominent prosthetic teeth. The singing, however, is reportedly a mix of Malek and a professional singer. I suppose, then, that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is even more like Queen recording a record in studio as opposed to concert performances. Indeed, some of the best scenes here are of the behind the scenes of the music industry and recording business. I also recently viewed 'Rocketman' (2019) and was disappointed by its depiction of Elton John's creative process. 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' at least, demonstrates the band's experimentation and genre mixing, and the quarrels they have throughout the picture are largely based in the making of music. The movie itself likewise showcases technical virtuosity--not only in the soundtrack, but also with the swirling camerawork and narrative construction building up to the climax. Too bad it's hollow inside.",6,2,3,2 November 2019
Bird Box," To Gaze, or Not To Gaze
","Seeing 'Bird Box' a second time now, I appreciate it more. Perhaps, upon first viewing, it appeared too akin to 'A Quiet Place,' but primarily based on sight instead of sound, and made worse by its naturey suicides similarity to 'The Happening' (2008). Maybe its popular and social-media appeal at the time, or those nitpicking plot holes and improbabilities, blinded me to what the picture does fundamentally well. I still find the sisters' first conversation as they largely and ridiculously ignore incredible TV reports to be laughable. Regardless, that we're now, as of this writing, living during a real-world pandemic may focus the mind and draw some parallels with the fictional narrative--blindfolds instead of masks. As a horror movie, 'Bird Box' is solidly Lovecraftian, of the fear of an unknown and better unseen monster that attacks the very essence of cinema, to look.Two elements in the movie reflexively point to this symmetry and paradoxical dichotomy, between the spectator (i.e. us, the audience) of the movie intended to fear the horror picture on the screen in front of them, as they presumably sit in comfort before the Netflix streaming (or, you know, a theatre, for those who still and may someday again go to the movies), and the surrogate viewers within the movie whose very lives as characters depend on looking away and running away in terror. Either way, it's the act of looking that matters. How apt, then, that the protagonist, Malorie (Sandra Bullock) is a painter in the pre-apocalyptic world--creating art to be gazed upon. The other reflexive element here involves video-as-surveillance. Greg (BD Wong) is closest to being our in-film surrogate spectator, as he positions himself seated to view a screen of the recorded monster. We never quite share his exact position, however, during the presumably full exposure of the cosmic, monstrous force. To do otherwise, it seems, would drive one mad over its reported beauty or kill the effect.This core understanding of the importance of the cinematic gaze is enough for me to appreciate 'Bird Box.' That gaze, moreover, is further reinforced as character driven by the association of the camera's view (for which the spectator strongly associates, as what the camera sees is what we see in a movie, after all) with the sight of the characters, or their lack thereof, as obscured by blindfolds, closed eyes or otherwise looking away from the unseen menace. Rather the inverse of 'The Invisible Man' movies, by the way, whereby we try to see what can't or doesn't want to be seen, as, instead, here, we try not to see what wants a look. In addition to looking, though, 'Bird Box' isn't bad, either, as a mother-children adventure to an almost-Biblical Garden of Eden, with one boy and one girl, to boot. Speaking of which, this was an odd movie for me to review after also having recently reviewed 'Blindness' (2008). Both are apocalyptic and involve not looking, but for contrary reasons, and the depictions of the blind are starkly different. In their own ways, however, they both employ sight as parables and, more importantly, demonstrate and play with the essence of cinema as a visual art form.",8,0,3,22 April 2020
Justice League," Franken-Justice
","After rewatching 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015) and this, 'Justice League,' it seems that Joss Whedon, who co-wrote and reassembled this, along with being one of the main creative forces behind the former MCU installment, managed to rework Mary Shelley's book 'Frankenstein' into the two biggest comic-book superhero movie franchises. Unfortunately, they're both among the most flawed entries in those respective shared cinematic universes, but it's an interesting similarity nonetheless. It's as though he wasn't content with his stitching together of the horror genre and superhero fare for the MCU sequel, or thought that Lex Luther raising a Kryptonian blood-brother of himself from the grave in the form of Doomsday in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (2016) wasn't enough of an homage to the 1931 film version of 'Frankenstein,' that he had to try again. Too bad this is the worst monstrosity of Franken-supes yet.The production mess has been well reported, but the overriding aim was clearly to imitate the success of the lighter tone of the Marvel movies after the mixed record of Zach Snyder's grim visions in 'Man of Steel' (2013) and, more so, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (2016). Personally, despite the faults of Snyder's prior two DCEU pictures, I'll take them anyday over 'Justice League;' at least, then, we have two distinguishable behemoth comic-book franchises instead of an amorphous glut of repetition at the box office. Sure, when the imitation works, an 'Aquaman' (2018) or 'Shazam!' (2019) is largely indiscernible from an 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' (2018) or 'Captain Marvel' (2019), but what's interesting about that. On the flip side, when the temperament is off and the jokes are flat, you get a bomb such as this, and all that's left of any compelling nature, for me at least, is what sort of Frankenstein monster lurks within all that wreckage.Sadly, even the Frankenstein stuff here is less intriguing and integrated than in Whedon's prior 'Age of Ultron,' where the entirety of the superhero team and their antagonist were part of the creation process and the monstrosities within the story. There were mad doctors (Tony Stark, Bruce Bannon, Ultron's manipulated scientist), monsters (Hulk, a Jekyll/Hyde type character, most obviously, as well as a (scarlet) witch and the AI robots) and even a god (Thor) to provide the spark of life. The mixture of magic and science fiction and, to a lesser extent, that of the horror and superhero genres worked. DC has its alien god, too, which was part of the appeal of Snyder's pictures, although Superman as a Christ figure had been a theme mined since Christopher Reeve put on the cape and tights. That's absent here, as Supes doesn't interact with regular people at all outside of an opening smart-phone interview by off-screen kids and his carrying an apartment building that presumably contains humans. Nope, here, he's merely an overpowered deus ex machina who's a bit confused at first, but then is just happy to be alive and save the day almost effortlessly. Batman and Alfred have the computers and tech savvy, but not along the lines of their MCU counterparts, and Cyborg seems to be content merely to hack into such gizmos and search the web. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman, Flash and Aquaman each have their own personal backstories that the narrative gets into and which have nothing to do with the Frankenstien theme or with anything particularly interesting.What 'Justice League' does have is magic. The infinity stones... I mean, mother boxes are employed for both of the movie's two Frankenstein-esque creation/resurrection episodes. Cyborg's dad, perhaps the only true mad scientist here, used one to save his son's life, who was otherwise legally proclaimed dead, and merge him with robotics and computer stuff in the process. The two of them will later discuss which of them is a monster. The same box, then, is made to bring the corpse of Superman back to life. Cyborg and Flash get tasked with digging the body up, too. The resurrection of Jesus Superman is somewhat intriguing--more so than the creation of Abomination Doomsday in the prior picture. Having the body in fluid is somewhat reminiscent of the Hammer Frankenstein films more so than any of the Boris Karloff versions. Moreover, Flash explicitly references 'Pet Sematary,' for which Stephen King's novel surely owes much to Shelley's work.Curiouser yet, I don't recall the insides of the Kryptonian ship in the previous movies looking so vaginal. Just look at those corridors to the embryonic chamber. In this sense, Superman's corpse is the egg, of course, along with the 'box,' which is already slang for vagina. The spark of life--the penis and sperm, if you will, is provided by Flash. He backs up to the end of one of these vaginal canals, then races through it, past the cervix and uterus, to fertilize the magical super egg in the Fallopian tubes with his surging electrical charge. It's one of the more sexually-suggestive Frankenstein-esque creation scenes I've seen since Kenneth Branagh essentially alluded to masturbation in 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' (1994). And, in the Frankenstein tradition, Flash and Superman play out the myth of homunculi--fully formed humans from which fetuses were formerly misbelieved to develop.It's all downhill from there. The fight between Superman and the rest of the League isn't bad, though, and the speed of Flash allows for the exploration of Superman's quickness, too. Everything else is bad. The CGI vomit that is the bland supervillain (Steppenwolf) and his army of insect clones is excruciatingly generic--proving the usual bloodless warfare for some PG-13 violence. The climactic battle is unexciting, and there's a peculiar focus on a sole family fleeing the carnage. Compare this to the better-integrated fates of civilians in the climax of 'Age of Ultron.' The humor is uniformly flat, including Flash's 'racially-charged' fist-bump fail with Cyborg, and the running gag about brunch only rings true for middle-to-upper-class filmmakers--an unemployed young university student of poverty like Barry Allen would not be concerned about brunch. His pops is in prison, and he admits to having no friends, so who would he be going to brunch with anyways. At some point, it seems they just ran out of things for characters to say and so resorted to such uncompelling interjections between fight scenes as, 'alright' and 'booyah.' Sometimes, the superheroes merely line up and pose for a few moments. Even worse are the several gratuitous shots focusing on Gal Gadot's posterior and the low-angle up-skirt shots while she's wearing her revealing Wonder Woman costume. It reminds me of how the MCU introduced Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow back in 'Iron Man 2' (2010), including a prolonged look at her backside as she walked into a restaurant in one scene. Better MCU installments don't do that. Heck, DCEU's 'Wonder Woman' (2017) didn't do that. But, hey, this was the DCEU's first attempt at being derivative. There are even scenes during and after the credits that aren't worth watching--one of which sets up another movie that may never happen because this one was so bad.",3,2,4,29 September 2019
Split," 24 Frames of Mind
","Although some critics and fans--backed up by box-office receipts--claimed this as writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's comeback, 'Split' is nevertheless an exploitative, derivative and incongruent horror movie. Like some of Shyamalan's other post-'The Sixth Sense' (1999) debacles, one can see how it could've been a better picture had the project not been of such an errant mind--straying all over the place--and, ultimately, relying upon a series of clichÃ©s--most blatant of which is the filmmaker's trademark twist endings.There's a lot of trash here: it's yet another movie about a psycho abducting, holding captive and terrorizing people--usually young women or teenage girls. Dissociative identity disorder is exploited for the fear of people with mental illness (although, I suppose, it's good that filmmakers seem to have finally learned that schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple personalities--good riddance 'Sybil' (1976)). Sexual abuse is exploited for some screwy, Nietzschian moralizing regarding that which doesn't kill you only making you stronger. Both the mental illness and the child abuse are tied into Shyamalan's usual pseudo-religious supernaturalism. And, perhaps worst of all, the supernatural here extends to one of the most flagrantly contrived and tacked-on surprise endings when 'Split' is tied-in to a shared universe with 'Unbreakable' (2000), via a cameo from Bruce Willis in an utterly stilted scene, and setting up the subsequent cap to the trilogy, 'Glass' (2019). The coda of '10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016), another movie about a young woman trapped with a nutcase, almost seems organic by comparison. Perhaps only 'The Mummy' (2017), in failing to launch the Dark Universe, has done so poorly in recent memory to establish a shared cinematic universe and been such an excruciating example of MCU piggybacking.Of all the divergent threads here, the one I think was promising was the potential self-reflexive allusion to cinema. 'Unbreakable' succeeded in this respect by reference to comic books, and 'Glass' extends this further cinematically. Several elements for something similar are presented in 'Split'--beginning with the actor/spectator dichotomy established at the outset with the well-made abduction scene. Although the main girl, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), is first seen as an object to be viewed, as the other two girls and one of their dads look on, the abduction scene places her firmly as the watcher, or the surrogate spectator for us movie-goers. The other two girls are oblivious nitwits throughout. A series of car mirror shots and obscured views from Casey's point-of-view support this. James McAvoy's madman is the actor in both senses: that his actions tend to advance the plot and that his split personalities form a performance for Casey to observe--whether to see his reinterpretation of Norman Bates from 'Psycho' (1960) through a crack in a door or to watch him dance by invitation.He also makes webcam movies of his various personalities, which Casey views. In fact, this is what helps set her free. Yorgos Lanthimos made this self-reflexive connection much better in 'Dogtooth' (2009), another and far-more-disturbing and intelligently-made film about captivity and perversity. In 'Dogtooth,' the captivity of the characters became a metaphor for the spectator's illusion of being held captive by the film itself. In 'Split,' however, one wonders whether Shyamalan even meant to do anything that wasn't entirely superficial. For instance, I doubt the reason McAvoy's character has 24 personalities has anything to do with classic film having been photographed at 24 frames per second--especially given how far removed movies are from such standards (like most movies nowadays, 'Split' is all digital), and, besides, we only see McAvoy portray six of those characters. One could just as well read in an equally pointless exercise in numerology that 24 refers to the number of hours in a day.Additionally, the Beast personality hinted at the promise of 'King Kong' (1933)-like self-referentiality--where the monster's attack from a stage after being captured by filmmakers suggests his being analogous to cinema. Thus, it might have been intriguing had Casey emerged from beneath a movie theatre instead of--of all things--from a zoo. (They're all held captive--get it?) On second thought, for a movie and script that is this crowded and unfocused--like a zoo, as the idiom goes--that may be the most appropriate setting.",4,0,3,7 October 2019
Cold Mountain," A Hill among Mountains
","The romance is more complicated than that in 'The Birth of a Nation', but not so much as in 'Gone with the Wind'. Expectations are rewarded. Slavery is mostly ignored, so there's supposedly no racism, either. A romance struggles against the vast setting of the American Civil War, but fate will reward the wait. Crosscutting between the lovers' situations was enough for me. The climax was the editing in the mollified sex scene. I must applaud any such sex scene for merely not being annoying. Additionally, it helps that the crosscutting is between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.We don't expect Law or Kidman's characters to die, or anything, on any of their adventures, so we get the next best thing after surprise: encounters with many stars, including Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson, Renée Zellweger, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, Giovanni Ribisi and Natalie Portman. Zellweger, who gets her Oscar, and Hoffmann are actually good; the comic relief outshines the leads. Still, director Anthony Minghella has involved me in melodramatic pomp better than this, and Miramax has sold me Oscar-fare better than this.",5,0,1,24 August 2004
Hugo," The Magic of Méliès and Scorsese
","My knowledge of motion pictures is strongest in respect to the earliest silent films, as anyone who looks at the list of the titles I've reviewed for IMDb can tell. This includes over 50 of the more remarkable 199 films of Georges Méliès available on the DVDs from Flicker Alley. Thusly, I greatly appreciate the attention this recent mainstream movie, as well as the graphic novel it's based on, has brought to the early cinema pioneer. Although it presents plenty of historical inaccuracies, this is to be expected in a fictionalization of a historical person, and it's nonetheless commendable how much 'Hugo' gets right and how felicitous the movie's style and tone are to the spirit of Méliès's own films. And it's all the more commendable considering that this is an atypical picture for Martin Scorsese, although he's well known for his appreciation of film history and work in film preservation. This shines through Hugo's best scenes of flashbacks of Méliès making his movies in his glass-ceiling studio in Montreuil and a passionate plea for film preservation during the climactic celebration of his career and screening of his films.That 'Hugo' is a family-oriented picture is appropriate given that Méliès's féeries (fairy films) and fantasy adventures were among the first films ever made largely for an audience of children, although as with 'Hugo', people of all ages, of course, may enjoy them. Méliès also introduced and exploited 'special effects', which in his day mostly consisted of substitution splicing (stopping and resuming filming, touched up by editing, for transformations, appearances and disappearances of characters and scenery) and superimpositions (also known as multiple-exposure photography or matte shots). 'Hugo', likewise, exploits today's tricks of computer generated imagery (CGI) and 3D digital photography. Additionally, although 'Hugo' isn't hand colored the way Méliès's films were offered to be, its digital color grading scheme imitates the early Autochrome color photography process invented by the Lumière brothers--the same guys most often credited with inventing cinema. Although I can't speak personally to the 3D since I've only seen it in 2D, it seems to be almost universally praised as some of the best work done in the field. Reportedly, it's the first movie ever photographed entirely by 3D cameras, whereas earlier 3D movies have all had 3D conversion done in some part in post production. James Cameron said it's the best 3D photography he's seen, and he should know since he's the director of 'Avatar' (2009) and is the biggest pusher of the technology.Critics have also praised or panned the supposed leisurely pace of 'Hugo'. Compared to Méliès's films, however, the pace is frenetic. 'Hugo' and most movies since the adoption of the classical style in the late 1910s are composed of shots lasting an average of a few seconds, whereas Méliès would often leave a shot-scene on screen for minutes, and for whom continuity editing was largely ignored in favor of theatrical imitation. Thankfully, the makers of 'Hugo' don't try to faithfully replicate that theatricality; instead, it begins with swooping camera vistas and tracking shots that truly can go anywhere via CGI. The quick interpolation of clips from Méliès's films in 'Hugo', however, may give an impression counter to the actual slow pacing of his tableaux.The narrative follows a boy's 'adventure' of discovering Méliès, and I'm sure for many viewers 'Hugo' is their own introduction to the cinema magician. That may be the case for some popular critics, too, as it seems they mention the historical inaccuracies of the fictional story as though they were facts from Méliès's real life. For instance, while it's true that the Lumière brothers refused to sell Méliès a camera, it's not true that Méliès's introduction to cinema was from accidentally walking into a fairground screening. In fact, he was at the Lumière brothers' first public exhibition of the Cinématographe at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. And the end of Méliès's filmmaking career happened before and had nothing to do with WWI, although the prevalent view is that his style did fall out of public favor (as well as because his non-business, artisan ethic was no match for the monopolistic practices of his competitors). This isn't so much a criticism of 'Hugo', however, as it's a criticism of anyone who takes their facts from a movie. For more on the history as it relates to 'Hugo' and 'The Artist', see Fiona Pleasance's blog article 'Yesterday's Men' and for that and other interesting observations on the movie read 'Hugo: Scorsese's birthday present to Georges Méliès' by film historian and theorist Kristin Thompson.Regardless, for replicating Méliès's Montreuil dream factory, 'Hugo' is a history lesson that has come entertainingly to life. Not even some otherwise fine documentaries, such as 'La magie Méliès' (1997), do as well at capturing the process and wonder of the film pioneer at work. Given that early histories dismissed the importance of editing in Méliès creating his trick effects, it's great to see its central role in the flashback sequence here. I also liked other details that 'Hugo' recreated, including how Méliès had two cameras shooting at once--one print for the domestic European market and another for the American. And Ben Kingsley very much looks and, indeed, embodies the part. Various silent films of others are referenced in 'Hugo', too, including a visit to a cinema where movie posters are seen and the children see Harold Lloyd's comedy 'Safety Last!' (1923), which is imitated later in a key scene in the outer narrative. 2011 was a good year for fans of classic movies and for those who enjoy movies about movies, with the releases of 'The Artist', 'My Week with Marilyn' and 'Hugo'.",9,4,6,22 August 2013
Van Helsing," Dracula Meets the Wolverine
","Despite being thinly scripted in parts, overly plotted in others, and CGI bloated, 'Van Helsing' might be the best monster-rally movie since the original Universal series, from its initial crossover feature, 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' (1943), to its turn into self-parody beginning with 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein' (1948)--although my favorite may be Columbia's 'The Return of the Vampire (1943), which, akin to 'Van Helsing,' is a Dracula Meets Wolf Man monster rally in all but name. Albeit, being the best monster-rally fare since the 1940s or so, which has included the kiddie 'The Monster Squad' (1987), the prior-year's summer blockbuster, 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' (2003), and a host of B-to-Z-grade pictures, is not a high bar to surpass. In retrospect, 'Van Helsing' also plays a bit like a warm up to Universal's subsequent attempts to launch a new Dark Universe, that being 'Dracula Untold' (2014) and 'The Mummy' (2017), except that the warm up is actually better than the latter results.À la 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,' Dracula has an evil plan for Frankenstein's monster, but, once again, werewolves (and, it could be argued, some other dimwits) are trying to thwart him. In an homage to the classic Universal horror films, the opening sequence of 'Van Helsing' is in black and white and rehashes Dr. Frankenstein's creation of the monster, complete with a pitchfork mob chasing them to a fiery climax in a windmill. For a while, 'Van Helsing' seems rather haphazard in its touching upon other classic monsters, including scenes of Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde (who is more like a mix of The Hunchback of Notre Dame--literally that's his location--and, as in 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' a weak version of Marvel's the Hulk rather than the character from Stevenson's novella), of some werewolf hunters and of a small village being terrorized by vampires. There's also some stuff with Igor, a gravedigger, vampire brides and baby vampire bats. Probably the biggest problem with the movie is that it spends time with too much clutter while not delving too deep into the characters and storylines that really count.Van Helsing merely retains the name of Stoker's character. Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing is no Dutch doctor, but rather an 1880s James Bond type working for Vatican as a hitman of monsters. The friar Carl stands in for the 'Q' character from the Bond films, as he shows Van Helsing the latest in fictional-Victorian-era weapons technology. Strangely, Carl is also more like Stoker's Van Helsing than the actual character by that name in this movie, as he's the one with all of the answers and knowledge related to vampire hunting. Jackman's Van Helsing, on the other hand, at first, wonders why he can't just shoot the Count with his guns. Like Jackman's Wolverine from the X-Men movie series, his Van Helsing is a semi-immortal with memory loss who recklessly rushes into a fight, relies upon the intelligence of others, whether it be a Carl or Charles Xavier, struggles with the risks between heroism and evil capable from his rage-infused superpowers and with the tragic possibilities of his romantic relationship with a female sidekick, whether it be Anna Valerious or Jean Grey.As for this movie's Dracula, I'm fairly satisfied with it. I've been watching a bunch of Dracula-related films since reading the novel, and I'm tired of all of the weak or otherwise lovesick bastardizations of Stoker's titular villain. Stoker's Dracula was pure evil. In the 1931 Universal version, Bela Lugosi added camp to the role. At least, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula evokes some of Stoker and Lugosi's traditions, and he's an especially strong vampire. Whereas Van Helsing is a rehash of Wolverine, I can see a bit of the absurdity of Roxburgh's Duke from 'Moulin Rouge!'--which along with the absinthe in the windmill and the visual excess, 'Moulin Rouge!' seems to have especially influenced this movie. Mixed with the goofiness throughout from director Stephen Sommers, who had already done likewise in rebooting 'The Mummy' series, this one can be fun. The Frankenstein monster, on the other hand, was somewhat of a sympathetic character even in Shelley's book, but he's overly such here. No explanation is given for his eloquent speech, either; even the classic Universal movies, for as much as they departed from the source material, addressed his acquisition of language.The visual effects are well integrated with the the framing and its movement--what is traditionally done with the camera, but which is increasingly being done by computers. Only a few years later than 'Van Helsing,' five movies that relied heavily upon computers for their imagery, 'camera' movement and lighting were seemingly-oxymoronically awarded Oscars for Best Cinematography: 'Avatar' (2009), 'Inception' (2010), 'Hugo' (2011), 'Life of Pi' (2012) and 'Gravity' (2013). 'Van Helsing' is part of a prior generation of combining live action and CGI and camera and digital photography, but at least the 'camera' moves some, including following Dracula as he walks up walls (much more casually than the wall crawler of Stoker, by the way) or keeping abreast of the vampires flying in their humanoid-bat forms. Such a sense of the role of the camera in the mix of live action and CGI was lacking from the prior year's monster rally, 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' so 'Van Helsing' was certainly an improvement upon that, delivering an action movie that's actually visually enthralling.(Mirror Note: Dracula displays his and other vampires' lack of reflections to Anna as he dances with her before a mirror in a vampire ball sequence that somewhat recalls a similar scene in Roman Polanski's 'Dance of the Vampires,' a.k.a. 'The Fearless Vampire Hunters' (1967). A mirror is also used in another scene as a gateway.)",7,1,1,10 July 2018
The Machinist," Dostoevskian Mind Game
","'The Machinist' is a puzzle picture or part of what film historian and theorist Thomas Elsaesser classifies as 'The Mind-Game Film' within the essay of the same name. As he outlines, these movies play games on two levels: that where a character is being played games upon and that where the audience is the one being toyed with. 'The Machinist' is primarily of the latter, but employs the former in constructing the puzzle for us. Elsaesser goes on to list six common motifs regarding the unstable minds of the protagonists in these movies; 'The Machinist' checks off every box: 1) he experiences events whose meaning or consequences escape him, including through a non-linear plot--this one begins near the end of the story, and its beginning is near the end; 2) he's mistaken about the difference between reality and his imagination, and the audience isn't able to tell the difference, either, through any typical subjective filmmaking techniques; 3) he has an imaginary companion (or two); 4) he has an identity crisis--there's even a post-it note in his apartment asking, 'Who are you?,' which he reads while looking in a mirror; 5) he's not even aware that there is a difference between reality and his imagination until the surprise or twist ending; and 6) he's persuaded that he's deluded about the existence of a child due to a past traumatic event.Furthermore, those familiar with the novels by Fyodor Dostoevsky--namely, 'The Double,' 'The Idiot' and 'Crime and Punishment'--may seek out yet another puzzle--one of reference and adaptation. That's the game I came to this picture to play. Indeed, I've been seeking a bunch of films related to 'Crime and Punishment' since reading it, including straightforward adaptations as well as ones such as this that are trickier. My understanding of the other two books is secondhand, though (perhaps someday I'll get to them). Anyways, the mind game here involves the 'delusion,' or even somewhat of a red herring, that 'The Machinist' is about 'The Idiot.' There's a clear and lingering insert shot that reveals the protagonist, Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), to be reading this very novel. Note that in films that are not of the mind-game variety, these inclusions of the source text are straightforward--for instance, when Woody Allen put copies of 'Crime and Punishment' in 'Match Point' (2005) and 'Irrational Man' (2015), it's because those movies are specifically about that book.'The Idiot' is a narrative of innocence and a surprise murder, among other things. The movie begins with Reznik throwing a corpse into the sea. Is he innocent or a murderer is the implied quandary. The epilepsy business here is taken from 'The Idiot,' too, as well as from Dostoevsky's real-life affliction. Again, here's the allusion to reality and fiction. Next, we move to the game of doppelgängers. 'The Double' concerns what it sounds like it concerns: doubles--doppelgängers--duality, as well as the puzzle over reality and fiction it stirs up. This is from the tradition of German Romanticism and Gothic horror, which continued into the cinema with such films as 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (1920), arguably among the first mind-game films. 'The Machinist' is full of doubling: in addition to Reznik's imaginary companions, he sees two women, there are two sets of mothers and sons, he causes two accidents, he's involved in two arms stuck in machines, he reports two hit and runs to the police. This doubling is the unraveling of the delusion, the puzzle. (And was anyone else reminded of 'The Matrix' (1999) here, what with a guy who in the shadows wearing shades almost looks like Laurence Fishburne and the repeated choice between two tunnels akin to two pills for Neo?)He's not the tormented but innocent Prince from 'The Idiot,' nor does he suffer an evil twin--although he may end up where those characters do in the end; it turns out, Reznik is Raskolnikov. It's written right there, too, behind him on his tour through the Route 666 amusement-park ride: 'Crime and Punishment.' Moreover, there's the prostitute-with-the-heart-of-gold Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who like Sonya from the book leads Reznik/Raskolnikov on the path of regeneration. She sees and informs him that he's the one in the picture. Stripping Dostoevsky's tale of its motivations, politics and philosophy and even its dreams (for Reznik cannot sleep), what's left is the redemptive quality of one's conscience--of guilt. That's the punishment. He's saved (for Dostoevsky, this was intrinsically linked with Christianity), he may sleep, when he confesses and pays for his crime. The ending here is taken directly from 'Crime and Punishment' (before the epilogue, but even routine film adaptations rarely include that, either). Whereas Raskolnikov looked across the street to see that Sonya had followed him to the police station, Reznik sees his dopplegänger. He makes the surprise admission to the police officer and finds relief in prison.I'm tempted to try to find a connection here between Bale ending 'The Machinist' in prison and beginning his next picture, 'Batman Begins' (2005), there, and how he went from extreme weight loss here ('If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.' Hey, 'déjà vu,' another doubling.) to superheroic fitness there--besides it all being part of his dangerous devotion to method acting. Regardless, it's doubtless that his performance here is impressive. The spectacle of his body, however, is interesting in itself, and the film spends a considerable amount of time focusing on it. Of course, narratively, this is a manifestation of Reznik's guilt--like his insomnia and other abnormal behaviors. It also seems somewhat contrary to the mind-game film. Elsaesser suggests a difference between the genre, or cinematic tendency, and traditional films that place the spectator in the relatively passive position of voyeur--considering the mind-game film as a reaction for more audience engagement. Thus, this invitation to gaze upon Bale's body stands in contradiction, or it may be the last piece of the puzzle left to solve.",8,2,4,26 September 2019
Yesterday," Plagiarism Spoils Novelty
","'Yesterday' was a promising movie that fails for the same reason its protagonist, Jack Malik, fails as a rock star. Both begin with a relatively original idea, but are increasingly weighed down by pangs over plagiarism. Jack finds himself one day to be the only person who remembers The Beatles and, already being a musician, sets out to pass their songs off as his own. This is an interesting concept that raises many questions more important than character psychology and interaction--almost all of which it doesn't bother to even investigate beyond the fact that Google clearly continues to exist to pay for product placement, as Jack repeatedly employs the search engine to figure out what has changed in the world. Instead, the movie cribs every other rom-com, to suffocate us in cloying infatuation, including retching up yet another climactic grand public display of love. Yeah, I get it, 'All You Need Is Love.' No thanks, copycats.There may be something to the connection between popular music and rom-coms, though. Both seem to rely heavily and sometimes exclusively upon simple emotionalism. There's nothing here about the art or craft of either. Jack merely is already a practiced artisan of music and is seen only needing to remember the words and their order to compose the famous songs. Meanwhile, the movie attempts to play all the tired rom-com notes below detection--hoping we'll be too consumed in feelings to care. Listening to The Beatles for a couple hours is pleasant enough, but if there's no art to the movie's record playing, I could do as well without its existence.In lieu of that, there are character dynamics. I couldn't care less about the love story. I mean, a hero who appears asexual for the first part of the picture and a woman who claims to have waited for a decade or more for a guy to ask her out, with their main conflict being between romance and rock-and-roll fame despite the fact that she was his manager--talk about contrived. Only once does the music even reflect this narrative in any compelling way, when Jack screams, 'Help!' Additionally, the music industry is largely reduced to an SNL skit for Kate McKinnon, and the reported brilliance of The Beatles is seemingly rendered unimportant, as they appear to have had little to no effect on pop music, let alone the world. The oddest part is the inclusion here of a celebrity, Ed Sheeran. I'd never heard of him, but he occupies the same space that LeBron James did in another insipid entry in this genre, 'Trainwreck' (2015). That is, neither one needed either of them. Moreover, they would've been better without them. Providing an audience the opportunity to think, 'oh, yeah, that guy,' is not a valid reason for inclusion. In this one, Sheeran references 'Amadeus' (1984), but 'Yesterday' is chopsticks by comparison.Even worse, I didn't check before viewing this to notice that it's written by, perhaps, the biggest hack of a screenwriter today in Richard Curtis. 'Love Actually' (2003) is a putrid reference point, repetitively so, for every worthless trope in the rom-com book of clichÃ©s, and 'About Time' (2013) was another promising variation (it has time travel) on the same genre that failed miserably. Evidently, Curtis has reached the point where he's merely altering the hook (mass amnesia or alternate timelines, time travel, or what have you) in rewriting the same formula. I'm not a fan of Danny Boyle, either, but 'Yesterday' may be a bit better than those two because at least Curtis doesn't direct it. Ultimately, it's as though we're left remembering that initial, promising novelty here, which seems to have been forgotten by the rest of the movie in its determination to appropriate the same junk Curtis and his ilk have done over and over again. The spectator can imagine a better movie, one where the loss of The Beatles matters and reverberates. Perhaps, even the dearth of the band's juvenile and unrealistic nonsense depiction of love would affect cinema; then, maybe Nora Ephron would never have wrote a fluffy imitation of Woody Allen comedies, which would further lead to Curtis not turning that fluff into insipidness.

Resident Evil," Choppy Recycling
","'Resident Evil,' an adaptation of a video game, is a bad movie in essentially every regard: hackneyed, simplistic scenario (evil corporation unleashing zombies), adulteration by association of classic literature in Lewis Carroll's Alice books, rudimentary acting, perfunctory dialogue, loud music for the sake of being loud, inept style, generic action scenes. Despite all of that, this may have been a more enjoyable action flick, at least on a so-bad-it's-good or guilty-pleasure level, if not for some atrociously choppy editing. The quick cuts to get around actors being substituted for stunt doubles or to otherwise conceal the fact that they can't physically do what their characters can is worse than usual. Alice's fight with the dogs is one of the worst examples. Moreover, these flimsy constructions being passed off as action scenes are cobbled together with unmotivated, silly slow-motion shots. There are far too many close-ups of Milla Jovovich's consistently blank expression in lieu of actual dramatic tension, too. All of this is reflected in the soundscape, as well, which is a shambles of bombastic score and clanging metal.The choppy editing is all the more conspicuous because the blueprint of the 'Hive' occupies a significant space in a scene early on, only for the picture to loose all direction once inside the architecture. One moment, Alice is listening to exposition from some guy whose sister she just re-killed, and the next she's back with the group locked in a room surrounded by zombies. Another moment, Michelle Rodriguez's tough chick (yeah, I know, what a stretch for her, right) is diving for a gun underneath another horde of the walking dead; then, cut, and all of a sudden she's escaped with the rest of the remaining gang from the bitters below. Even some of the CGI is overly choppy, especially when we first see the monster recycled from the 'Alien' series. As with the stunt work, quick cuts are also meant to conceal deficiencies in the visual effects. Play the score and sound effects loud enough and have Jovovich pose in various states of undress often enough, however, and, perhaps, nobody will notice or care, seems to be the logic here. Yet, worst of all are the movie's equivalent of video-game cut-scenes. With two of the main characters experiencing amnesia, the plot takes several breaks from the action to catch up on the backstory--the sort of poorly-directed bits of dullness that a gamer would likely press a button to skip in a video game so as to get back to killing zombies.I knew there was a reason I had avoided this movie for nearly two decades now. I only came to it now for the references to Carroll's Alice books. Unfortunately, like everything else here, these are trite. Besides a protagonist named 'Alice,' who awakens from a state of unconsciousness, there's the AI's little girl avatar, and the AI itself is called the 'Red Queen,' although it really should've been named 'HAL 9000,' for how much it rips off yet another far better film, '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968). 'Resident Evil' is rubbish. I think I'll continue to pass on the inexplicably-made sequels.",2,0,3,25 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Requiem for a Shared Cinematic Universe
","As the culmination of 21 movies, 'Avengers: Endgame' bears a hefty investment from audiences. To merely call this an 'event movie' would be to overlook how much the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ingratiated itself into mass culture over the last 11 years. For better or worse, the filmmakers understand this. One consequence I'm not especially fond of is that much time is spent on send-offs for the retired superheroes. I don't even too much mind the bloated some-three-hours runtime, nor that I listened to a cinema full of sniffling during the movie's sappier moments, but I do think it detracts from any semblance of a self-contained artistic or narrative work that could stand on its own. And, sure, I enjoyed some of the comic relief injected to lighten that mood--even if there were a few too many jokes at the expense of Professor Hulk, or Ant-Man's stupidity, or Thor's newfound obesity (c'mon, 'Cheez Wiz' running through his veins--really?). On the other hand, I am fond of the self-reflexive use of time travel, to, in effect, return to some of the cinematic highlights of prior entries in the MCU. Because that's what 'Endgame' is about: it's a movie founded upon a past of 21 other movies.The scenes with Captain America interacting with his past in the 2012 'The Avengers,' including a nifty reference to a scene from 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' (2014) and of Thor reliving his memories of 'Thor: The Dark World' (2013) are especially rewarding. It's a heritage we share with the movie and with the characters. Despite all of the humorous talk concerning the illogic of space-time-continuum fare such as the 'Back to the Future' series, 'Endgame,' in one respect at least, follows the time-travel rules of 'Back to the Future Part II' (1989). Both movies exploit time travel to relive highlights from and the success of prior movies--whether it's Marty McFly watching himself inventing rock-n-roll on stage from the first 'Back to the Future' (1985) film or Cap fighting his younger and more naive self from the first Avengers assemblage.I enjoyed this part enough, upon initial viewing at least, for it to largely compensate for the faults in other parts. That the final battle almost seems anti-climactic, dark and, naturally, cluttered. Or that while several of the characters have well-defined arcs, others do not, despite having also survived the dust turning in 'Infinity War' (2018). Bruce Banner's lack of development seems especially egregious, as he continues to serve as comedic relief, as well as for spouting science-y exposition, in his last two appearances, which stands as a disappointing departure from the centrality of this character from 'Age of Ultron' (2015) to 'Ragnarok' (2017). Likewise, Thanos, after dominating 'Infinity War,' is reduced back to a run-of-the-mill underdeveloped villain. More minor characters also seem short-changed, including Okoye, the raccoon and Rhodey. Even some of the previously-deceased, like Gamora, are better rounded-out in a shorter amount of time. Perhaps, worst of all is the use of Captain Marvel here as a deus-ex-machina Superman--conveniently flying in at the last moment to save a plot in need. Moreover, the scene where all of the female superheros happen to be in the same spot is such a eye-rolling and self-defeating piece of self-congratulating political correctness or pandering (besides, as if Danvers needs help getting through a battle zone--she just blew up a spaceship by flying through it, for crying out loud). A similar scene, if on a smaller scale, worked more organically in 'Infinity War.'But, I like the quieter moments, especially early on, which are something of a relieving contrast to the relentless momentum of 'Infinity War.' Perhaps, it's the appropriate send-off, too, for the characters who are well-developed here, including ('fridging' aside) Black Widow, Cap and Iron Man. The benefit of such fine acting talent, after all, isn't for their fighting skills; it's commendable that 'Endgame' allows their characters some time to breath and reflect before moving on or saying goodbye.",7,1,5,3 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Pixar's Love Story for Disney
","The 'Toy Story' series has always had a clever double meaning that references itself. The first initiated the revolution in computer animation, but its narrative was fundamentally reassuring of a continuation with hand-drawn cartoons. Traditionally, at least, animation involves a series of still images, invented as opposed to recorded (as with live action), projected as motion pictures--thus, alternately inanimate and animate and created from nothing. Likewise, the 'Toy Story' series features inanimate toys coming to life in the shadows. Like Forky in this fourth installment, from raw materials--in fact, trash--life, movement is created. Moreover, the sequels may be read as partially reflecting the sometimes-tumultuous history between Pixar and Disney.'Toy Story 2' (1999) was a mess: originally planned for the small screen, like Woody's 'Howdy Doody' type TV puppet show, and subject to the merchandising strategies of Disney, and so we get a store full of Buzz Lightyears... and Barbies. Presciently, there's even a memorable reference to 'Star Wars,' another future Disney property. In the last installment, 'Toy Story 3' (2010), the first after Disney's acquisition, took a dark turn and, inevitably, the message becomes one of growing up and giving your toys away--in this case, Pixar being the toy and Disney the recipient. 'Toy Story 4,' by contrast, is a love story. Superficially, it's between Woody and Bo Peep, as well as the usual one for children and their toys and adults and their nostalgia, but there's a hidden romance here involving Pixar and Disney.This is an extensive adoption of Disney's business practices. It mostly takes place in a carnival, or amusement park--alluding to one of the company's most profitable and well-known divisions, theme parks. Additionally, people keep talking about the conclusion to the 'Toy Story' series, but this franchise could conceivably continue indefinitely. Even if it were only on, say, the recently-started Disney+ streaming service. Disney is the champion of the franchise era of movies: Marvel and its cinematic universe, Star Wars, live-action and CGI remakes of its classic cartoons, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones, the Muppets, Pixar and Disney's own animated pictures, the Alien and Avatar juggernauts and everything else 20th Century Fox... plus Mickey Mouse. The Disney name itself is the strongest brand in the industry. Good properties aren't left to die. Toys may change hands, be lost and found. Like Forky, trash is recycled. As with Bo Peep, broken parts are mended, and with Woody and Gabby, taken from elsewhere and otherwise stuffed and stitched back together. Antiques are rebooted and remade. Disney doesn't like to leave good toys on the shelf or in the closet for long.You may choose to see only what you're intended to, like the human characters within the picture, oblivious of the toys' movements. Feel free to enjoy the manufactured cloning of human emotionalism, appeals to childhood nostalgia, or even the funny quips and Pixar Easter eggs, as CGI emotes and Randy Newman sings sentimental in the background, or look in the spaces where they suppose you unmindful to their machinations--where toys breath life and a conglomerate conspires for your affections. 'Toy Story 4' is about us loving Disney. Disney wants you to love them, to hold them close, to take their merchandise home, play their games and enjoy their amusements... at a price, of course.",8,3,5,20 November 2019
The Favourite," Down the Rabbit Hole
","Director Yorgos Lanthimos has gone mainstream, which is not to say that 'The Favourite' is still not a weird and even perverse experience, as is the case with his prior oeuvre. Having recently seen two of his Greek movies, 'Dogtooth' (2009) and 'Alps' (2011), along with his two former English-language ventures, 'The Lobster' (2015) and 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' (2017), he's quickly become one of my favorite filmmakers of today. Unlike those earlier pictures, however, 'The Favourite' wasn't written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, which may be why it also doesn't feature his trademark stilted acting, which I admit was becoming stale by 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer,' undermining what was a promising modern interpretation of a historical myth (in that case, an ancient-to-classical Greek narrative most famously written down as 'Iphigenia in Aulis' by Euripides). Here, Lanthimos and his new screenwriters take on a rather mythologized British history of the court of Queen Anne. The three leads of Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz deservedly were honored on the awards circuit, including each receiving Oscar nominations, as well as an Oscar win for Colman as Queen Anne. Meanwhile, 'The Favourite' is a visual delight, and although it's the most traditional and mainstream--and, in a way, simplistic--production of Lanthimos's career, it's strange enough that its ending and rabbit metaphor seems to have baffled or upset some audiences.Allowing or directing the three leads to perform in a more traditional style of acting is of utmost importance here. And, despite the suspect award stratagem of listing two of them in supporting categories, they're all leads, especially Stone, who is the main protagonist for whose perspective most of the narrative is told, with the story of Queen Anne and, indeed, Lady Sarah being mostly a sidelong look from Abigail's viewpoint. Moreover, according to the only screentime count I could find, from Erick Anderson of AwardsWatch, Stone has over 56 minutes on screen compared to Colman's 47 minutes and about 45 minutes for Weisz. Anyways, the sexual politics of the court intrigue would've fallen flat without allowing for character identification--much as one was unable to connect with the family of 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' because of the abnormal line readings of the performers. On the other hand, the deadpan style worked in Lanthimos's Greek pictures because they were self-reflexive works about cinematic performance, and it worked in 'The Lobster' because it was a dystopian burlesque. Yet, 'The Favourite' deals with a historical subject--even though the filmmakers play very loose with the factual record and are almost obtusely anachronistic at times. Regardless, Colman, Stone and Weisz are terrific in their exaggerated characterizations of these real historical women--all three monstrous and vulnerable, tragic and villainous. Personally, I find it difficult to pick a favorite among them, which is the reasoning behind the studio's divvying the three performances between leading and supporting awards categories to begin with. In other narratives, the characters featured in the sidelong glance are often the more attractive spectacle, but here Stone's Abigail may undergo the most character development and be the most hideous character among them, and the supporting and background male characters tend to be the more flamboyant in costume and make-up.Which brings me to the allegedly strange ending, although I think it's an entirely appropriate piece of irony. The main thrust of 'The Favourite' is the vying between Abigail and Sarah to act in the stead of the head of state, Queen Anne, including by being her lover. The irony is that Sarah may not be entirely upset in relinquishing her role as the favorite, whereas Abigail may come to regret her new role. Abigail has become like the Queen's rabbits: surrogates for the love missing in the Queen's life. And, as Abigail holds a rabbit under her heel, as a disquieting power trip, just because she can, so to does the Queen hold down Abigail in a subservient position to her sadistic power--thus, the superimposed image of Abigail and the bunnies, who are now one in the same.For a splendidly strange picture, I also love the rabbit metaphor because of its allusion to to the 'Alice in Wonderland' books. It also helps that the cinematography is offsetting, including the use of extreme wide-angle lenses (even fisheye views) and natural lighting. And the Hatfield House, where the majority of the picture was shot, is lovely, with doors receding into murals, and the wide-angle lenses accentuating the corridors and candlelight lending authenticity to the costume picture. 'The Favourite' is a fascinating visual piece of art just to view figures moving down hallways or even the camera moving through the spaces--through the resplendent oddities of the rabbit hole.",9,5,7,17 March 2019
28 Days Later...," Infectious Grit
","Credited with reviving the zombie genre, although it reuses the viral outbreak idea from the 'Resident Evil' franchise, and some question whether it's a zombie movie at all--I guess because the infected are alive and fast or something, '28 Days Later' is more remarkable for its gritty style, as aided by the then-new technology of digital cameras, infecting the genre with a low-resolution, guerrilla filmmaking look akin to the exploitation cinema from which zombies were first reanimated on screen in George A. Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968).Consequently, the opening lab scene looks especially grotesque, including a rage-filled primate forced to watch similarly low-res, violent screen images, Ã  la 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971). The protagonist waking up from a coma to discover a post-apocalyptic landscape would later be ripped-off by 'The Walking Dead' franchise, although the shots of him wandering through a deserted London remain unmatched. It's also a stark contrast to the frenetic finale--alternate epilogues aside.",7,0,0,25 March 2020
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," CGI Aping Rises Above Live-Action Acting
","'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a standard franchise reboot, mildly entertaining if predictable. The motion capture for Andy Serkis's performance as the chimpanzee Caesar is more impressive than the rest of the CGI, which tends to vary in realistic motion and weight with the real environment. Moreover, Serkis and his ape army are more compelling than the society of naked apes here, as led by a bland James Franco as a scientist. His relationship with his Alzheimer's-afflicted father is more formulaic than interesting, as if he needs this personal connection to be working on a cure for the disease. His girlfriend is an even more pointless character. By comparison, at least the humans who are cruel to the caged apes incite an emotional response, as we root against them in favor of Caesar and his followers. There might have been an opportunity here for a metaphor on what it means to be human, between the various primates and between live-action actors and the motion-capture ones, but the Homo-sapien characters here are too boring to make for effective contrast.Largely, this comes across as an exercise in setting up subsequent movies at the sake of an interesting, self-contained picture. Viewers familiar with the prior Planet of the Apes series, or other media, will recognize the point of the spaceship launch, the virus spread and such in that vein, and the 'bright eyes' and 'dirty ape' references. It's a blockbuster that meets limited expectations, so it's not surprising that it was successful at the box office.",5,0,0,4 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," (In)Glorious Doubling
","'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is a thoroughly self-reflexive piece of revisionist nostalgia of Hollywood and its motion pictures--theatrically screened, televised and drive-in. That the leads are an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) underscores this. Live-action film (and it's important that this one was actually shot on celluloid instead of digitally) is fundamentally a process of reproduction, or doubling; it's a photographic copy and imitation of reality, which in turn is reproduced manifold in its public distribution. Likewise, Pitt's character doubles DiCaprio's in the films-within-this-film; he pretends to be him while performing manful feats, while the actor pretends those acts for himself. Like film, they are of two characters in one. On top of this, the narrative involves both their past glories and present struggles in the movie industry. Although in many other films, such self-referential doubling tends to play out as haunting doppelgÃ¤ngers or whimsical twins, here we mostly get a buddy picture. Moreover, Pitt is not DiCaprio's exact clone and obviously neither is 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' faithful to the history it enters.I'm so fond of this meta filmmaking--beyond the more limited simple borrowings, homages and recollections that occupy director Quentin Tarantino's entire oeuvre--that I'm tempted to overlook how hollow and self-indulgent much of Tarantino's cinematic insight has ultimately turned out to be. The indiscernibility in style between the outer film and the inner TV episode in a sequence where DiCaprio's aging star plays the baddie is especially well done in the former regard. But while entertaining and well constructed in its mirroring itself, Tarantino often wanders into mere pastiche and even into making a pastiche of his own prior movies. The nostalgia is likewise immoderate--contributing to an often cluttered and meandering trip down memory lane that would've benefited from further cuts. Even the full display of the title, with its ellipsis, is indicative of the roundabout nature of the picture. And after lulling the spectator with series upon series expressing his eclectic pop-culture tastes and sentimental reminiscences, Tarantino resorts to an all-too-familiar Grand Guignol finale to satiate said spectator's, or at least his, assumed lust for ultraviolence.Contributing to the languid pace is the adjacent story of Sharon Tate and the Manson Family. Much of 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is ripe for a film theory thesis in the Laura Mulvey tradition concerning the alleged objectification of women through the cinematic male gaze. And perhaps Tarantino and company cultivated the era placement of this film, sepia tones and all, so much so that they adopted the treatment of gender by the kind of films Mulvey criticized in her essay 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,' published only a few years after this film's 1969 setting. While most of the focus here is on the emotional performance of DiCaprio's actor and laid-back gallantry of Pitt's stuntman, central to the masculine/feminine dichotomy in the picture is the role of Tate (Margot Robbie), who's mostly a mute, idle and passive object to be looked at--by the active male characters within the film and by the spectator meant to identify with those men outside of the picture. There's also the casual inclusion of uxoricide, let alone the fact that this is Tarantino's first film after the public disgracing of his former producer, Harvey Weinstein, to raise the ire of anyone dissatisfied with the picture's gender imbalance. There's also the unmentioned (within the film) subsequent rape by Roman Polanski, although one may suppose that this is alluded to and rebuked in the scene where the stuntman refuses the advances of a girl absent identification proving her adulthood.Regardless, one scene with Tate here is interesting by playing with assumptions about the power balance in the cinematic gaze. In it, she attends a theatrical screening of one of her films--joining in the gazing upon herself and, all the while, reveling in her doubled to-be-looked-at-ness as the audience enjoys her performance on screen. It's a terrific mise-en-abyme that separates the real Tate with her double in contrast to the obliteration of that separation in the sequence involving DiCaprio's actor filming the TV episode. Additionally, it gives an agency to the Tate character that is otherwise denied in the film, including her as an unbeknownst damsel-in-distress for the denouement akin to the victims of Henry Fonda's gang in the film for which Tarantino is presumably giving a nod to with the title of his own quasi-Western and with all of the spaghetti Western references--'Once Upon a Time in the West' (1968)--and denied to her more horrifically in reality by her murder at the hands of the Manson cultists.It's because the victims of injustice were the active agents in Tarantino's prior forays into historical revisionism that his ultraviolent climaxes were more satisfying--from righting the wrongs of Nazis in 'Inglorious Basterds' (2009), to slavery in 'Django Unchained' (2012) and, somewhat, even fixing racism of the Reconstruction era in 'The Hateful Eight' (2015). Plus, at some point, if you keep employing the same gimmick, fatigue sets in. 'Inglorious Basterds' even mixed that ultraviolence with cinematic self-reflexivity, and unlike here it did so by combining them in a theatrical showdown. There, it wasn't just a film where Nazis were scorched in flames (which also happens in this one), nor did it merely flame out in an orgy of brutality; in it, too, the film caught fire. Here, instead, we get smoke, or rather and literally, lots of smoking caught on film.",8,14,30,31 July 2019
Get Out," Not So Black and White
","Spoilers Warning Elaborated: Brief mentions in the second paragraph below (i.e. not counting this one) of 'Being John Malkovich' (1999) and adaptations of 'The Stepford Wives' and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' may contain spoilers for those films, as well.On one level, 'Get Out' is about societal race relations. This is the gist that almost everyone grasps, and it's quite successful in tapping into the zeitgeist of such anxieties in the U.S. at the end of the Obama administration, of a lampooned liberal and affluent sort of bigotry where blacks are coveted for their athleticism and coolness, to the point that the mostly-white characters seek to dominate their bodies by inhabiting them--cultural appropriation taken to the extreme. The beginning and ending scenes, especially, allude to real news stories, with a black man walking in a residential community where he's stalked and attacked recalling the killing of Trayvon Martin to start, and the, at first, seeming appearance of the police at the end posing an additional threat to the protagonist in the form of real-life police violence against African Americans. If that were all there were to 'Get Out,' it'd be fine, but I think there's a deeper level--even, perhaps, subconscious. It's about the representation of race: photographic and cinematic. It hints at the spectre of past and current racism of motion pictures haunting us, but turns those very devices--creating a horror genre movie--to deliver its doubled anti-racism message.Some have compared this to 'The Stepford Wives' (adapted to the screen in 1975 and 2004), but unless you're film critic Rex Reed and misbelieve that all the black men are turned into robots, then I think that comparison misses the mark. Personally, I was originally reminded more of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (adapted in 1956 and a few times thereafter), which also centrally featured a psychiatrist and involved victims being attacked in their sleep--and especially regarding the original colonialist bent of the book. The cocoon metaphor reminded me of the pods, and, of course, the black bodies are quite literally snatched and their bodies replaced by another mind. But, Drew Grant of the 'Observer,' among others, get more to the point in that 'Get Out' shares similarities with the quirky self-reflexive indie film 'Being John Malkovich.' Although it's concerned with celebrity, the death of the artist and artistic creation, as opposed to race, there's a conspiracy to extend and better life behind it, as in 'Get Out.' Plus, there's the little door exposing the mystery in both, the orientation videos on TVs, the 'sunken place' is similar to one being trapped in another's body in 'Being John Malkovich,' and there's Catherine Keener in both. Here, she plays the pivotal part of the psychiatrist who hypnotizes Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) into the sunken place.The clever part of this methinks is the self-reflexivity. From the sunken place, Chris sees a mise-en-abyme--a framed image within a frame, like a movie--a film-within-a-film. Moreover, it's one that marginalizes and subjugates him, as it has other African Americans. This parallels Chris's story of the night his mother died, when he remained inactive, tellingly, while watching TV. The TV is further paralleled when Chris is both physically and hypnotically restrained during the orientation and hypnotic teacup videos. He's a deer caught in the headlights, and, indeed, there's a motif comparing Chris to a deer. Outside his subconscious, the rest of the narrative of whites body snatching blacks recalls, as well as slavery, an extreme form of the blackface employed in film and theatrical history. Although, in reality, it's black actors playing white characters written and directed by a black man, Jordan Peele, except there's no whiteface, but blacks acting as whites acting black and who still have traces of their black selves buried within, spectators of a screen image of their misrepresentation.Notice how Chris challenges this cinematic white supremacy. He's a photographer, with black-and-white images adorning his apartment and gazing upon fellow African-American bodies through the viewfinder of his camera. The blind art dealer (Stephen Root) desires this quality of Chris specifically, which is attributed to his eyes, and the art dealer fancies himself not to be a racist like his cohorts, but he's more than literally blind in this respect. As with the rest of Hollywood history, race is part of the ideology of the cinematic gaze, and who controls that gaze controls racial representations--and shares that gaze with the spectator. In effect, when we're viewing a movie, we're in a sunken place, following a gaze that we don't control. Furthermore, to awaken his racial brethren, Chris snaps pictures of them with his cell-phone camera--although it's specifically the flash of light that's given credit. Chris does within the movie exactly what writer-director Peele tried to do in making it, to awaken the spectator from a sunken place, not only of societal racism, but also the cinematic sort.P.S. I'm glad there's no white savior trope here, either. It's depressing reading complaints of there being no redeeming white characters. Reverse that and see how many movies where there are no redeeming black characters--or any other character of a racial minority, for that matter. Besides, the white cop requesting Chris's ID was no worse than the detectives of other races mocking the abductions of African Americans. Anyways, 'Get Out' focuses on a man entrapped by a cult. The only major outside contact is with his friend employed with the TSA (Lil Rel Howery)--the role that might've been occupied by the white savior in a lesser scenario. There are no good white people assuming the bodies of the racial other here; that movie is called 'Avatar' (2009).",10,2,6,16 November 2018
Velvet Goldmine," Citizen Bowie
","As flamboyant and glittery as its glam rock subject, 'Velvet Goldmine' mines the words of Oscar Wilde, the structure of Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' and the dystopian vision of George Orwell's 'Nineteen Eighty-Four,' but is ultimately superficial, satisfied with its own supposed mystique, but then, I guess, so was glam rock.Like 'Citizen Kane' (1941), it's a thinly-veiled and fictionalized sidelong-glance biopic--in this case, of David Bowie--from the perspective of interviews conducted by a journalist. In part, these interviews are even staged like those in the 1941 film, and the investigative story begins with a film being screened, like the newsreel of Charles Foster Kane, except with the film itself burning up at the end. I guess its Rosebud is the entire glam rock scene, although the supposed mystery involves the alleged mainstream selling out by the Bowie-esque figure, Brian Slade, in the Reagan era--here named that of an unseen President Reynolds. Specifically, in the year 1984, alluding to Orwell, and Slade's transformation is represented by a name change and plastic surgery, which is a secret conspiracy for no apparent reason.In addition to 'Kane,' the journalist provides his own memories as a fan of the rock stars and his own history of homosexual activity. On top of that, there are UFO sightings in the spirit of glam rock's fascination with science fiction, and an emerald pin that's traced back to Oscar Wilde, with the suggestion that Wilde was an extra-terrestrial, I guess, and a separate female narrator for the introduction. Wilde doesn't really factor into the main narrative, though, except to lend his surname to one character and for the script to sprinkle his epigrams about. For instance, Slade will throw in a line such as 'Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders,' from the author's novel, 'The Picture of Dorian Gray,' which the film directly references in a classroom scene.The 'Dorian Gray' connection is why I finally got around to seeing this, as I was seeking out movie adaptations and reworkings since reading the book. I suppose, I've also been somewhat spoiled recently by having viewed two other rock musicals that recall 19th-century Gothic horror and were themselves box-office bombs that later gathered a cult following: 'Phantom of the Paradise' (1974) and 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' (1975). The former, in particular, I consider to be a more integrated and interesting use of Wilde's 'Dorian Gray.' To my taste, the tunes of those actual 1970s rock musicals, as opposed to this trip down memory lane, were more catchy, too. I think the best songs in 'Velvet Goldmine' are the ones that aren't original, and I probably would've liked it more had they received permission to use Bowie's songs. It also surely has a better, or at least more high profile, cast of actors, with the likes of Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale and Toni Collette, but I don't think any of the performances particularly stand out, except for maybe McGregor's flopping American accent... and his other flopping member. That said, this is a visually appealing picture, and the music is effectively used to transition between its scenes of glitz and glamour.",6,2,2,10 September 2018
Hellboy," Like Clockwork
","Stop me if this sounds familiar: a wise-cracking hero combats baddies who are occult Nazis, which leads the hero and his pals into a booby-trapped tomb. Or how about a baddie who seemingly twirls daggers merely for the generic swoosh-and-whoosh sound effects--even Indian Jones couldn't be bothered to put up with that nonsense. (By the way, does anyone else feel that the unlocking of Hellboy's chamber looks and sounds a bit too much like that motif in the X-Men movies for unlocking Cerebro?) Then, there's the typical superhero-action-movie squishy monsters that incinerate instead of bleed, and, to further ensure that PG-13 rating, clothes hardly burn up in fire, either. If all of this weren't predictable enough, there's also the repetitiveness of the fight scenes, whereupon Hellboy fights the same sort of squishy monster three times, each with their own mini-cliffhangers, lots of punching sounds and such, and a combination of wire-work practical effects and loads of villainous CGI. Plus, he also fights another--even bigger--squishy monster in yet another scene. Hellboy even eavesdrops on his paramour with another guy twice. Soap-opera love triangle screenwriting for a superhero movie, c'mon.Along with the nominal romance, most of the characters here are bland. The baddies sure are, and even the merman is more interesting as comparison to the similar Creature from the Black Lagoon that Guillermo del Toro developed more fully later on in his Best-Picture-Oscar-winning 'The Shape of Water' (2017) than he is as an actual character in 'Hellboy.' Perhaps, the most apt character in this one is that dagger-twirling Nazi, because he runs on clockwork--much like the movie does. Mechanical, predictable and repetitive. 'Hellboy' doesn't even manage to do anything interesting with its meta comic-book within the comic-book movie. Years later, 'Logan' (2017) would. Neither does del Toro do anything compelling with all of his stylish characters and cinematic imitations. At least, in 'The Shape of Water,' he played some with expectations by reversing the colonialist message of 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon' (1954). 'Hellboy,' on the other hand, is probably what you'd expect it to be because you've likely seen many other movies that are just the same. It's like clockwork.",3,1,4,8 October 2019
I Am Legend," Will Smith Tries to Save the World from CGI... He Fails
","Never mind the remake of the science-gone-wrong, vampire/zombie apocalypse scenario; 'I Am Legend' seems of more, if still only slight, interest to me as reflecting its own making as a contest between man and computer-generated images. This seems all the more blatant today because the CGI tends not to hold up very well--if it ever did. The deer look especially unrealistic to me. So, in the movie, people and other living animals are turned into largely-CGI-created monsters. They look a bit like living creatures but not quite. Like the mannequins, an especially apt comparison within the movie. The irony is that this junk is supposed to be the attraction of these blockbusters, but this thing is completely carried by the human performance of Will Smith, the hero--plus his dog.As great as Smith is in these popcorn flicks, though, even his heroics are no match for the havoc the CGI virus continues to wreak upon Hollywood. They even made that Batman v. Superman movie seen on a billboard within this movie. This was back in 2007... how prescient.",6,2,2,8 May 2019
Ghostbusters," Phallic Phantasms
","While the three pseudo-scientists of 'Ghostbusters' occupy themselves professionally with the paranormal, their sexual desires likewise are abnormally characterized by paraphilic tendencies. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) takes joy in the sadistic torment of other men, which ordinarily is limited to mere sardonic remarks and poking fun at supposedly less masculine men for their nasal congestion, short height, or what have you, but at its most violent also manifests in his electric-shocking of a male test subject in an experiment of which the validity Venkman jeopardizes in the pursuit of his perverse pleasures. Perhaps, ashamed of his own desires, he also makes excessive displays of his supposed heterosexuality, including flirting with the female test subject and later aggressively, if clownishly, making passes at Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver).Meanwhile, Ray's (Dan Aykroyd) paraphilia extends to a complete displacement of other people as the source of sexual attraction; instead, his spectrophilia appears as a dream where a female ghost signifies further sexual displacement by disappearing before performing fellatio on him. Later, his fantasizing of another non-human humanoid object is made real in the form of the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, a figure from his childhood, which is the time when all of those Freudian quacks like to locate the origins of sexual feelings. And, of course, there's the obviously-symbolic pole he's so enthusiastic about in their repurposing of an old fire station. Egon, on the other hand, seems to be entirely consumed in his pseudo-scientific pursuits, even seeming to not react in the least to the advances of the Ghostbusters' receptionist Janine (Annie Potts). Rather than being asexual, his interests are displaced in the phallic guns or wands of the Ghostbusters' 'proton packs,' which they employ to ejaculate energy streams, trapping gooey ectoplasmic matter into a shared box. Perhaps, like Peter, Egon also fears his homoerotic tendencies, though, and insists that the men avoid crossing streams.But, of course, crossing their streams is what the entire male-bonding narrative is building up to. Being the 1980s, this includes the homophobic government, in the form of the 'dick-less' EPA man, butting in, protesting the Ghostbusters' pollution of ejaculating streams and captured slime and even the propagandic effect their activities have upon society. This backfires, however, unleashing the latent desires the Ghostbusters themselves feared and contained in the 'closet'--the unleashing of them taking the form of flamboyant streams of light and sparkling stars in a rainbow of colors spreading throughout the city. The Catholic mayor's kissing of the Archbishop's ring and turning to him for approval/guidance also plays into the unleashing of the Ghostbusters' phallic powers, but I'm not going to look into that plot point any deeper than that. Now, freed from the closet, so to speak, and after a stint in jail, the Ghostbusters' antagonist takes the form of Old-Testament Biblical proportions in the form of a heterosexually-coded coupling of ghosts: the 'Keymaster' (read 'male') and the 'Gatekeeper' (read 'female'). And reigning supreme is the god Gozer, who takes the shape of the Ghostbusters' gendered 'other,' a woman. The men's triumph is in defeating this ghastly heterosexual and female gendered possession of their city.After the men cross streams, resulting in the explosion of white goop from Ray's latent childhood desires pouring over them, the three doctors quickly resort to their prior postures of homoerotic denial: Peter to the rescue of the damsel-in-distress Dana, and Egon and Ray to the safer confines of the short and daft male subject Louis (Rick Moranis), for whom Egon quickly remarks on his desire to perform pseudo-scientific tests upon. The fourth Ghostbuster, Winston (Ernie Hudson), however, the only normal man among them and who, presumably, has a healthy sexual attitude, proclaims with pride, while covered in goo, 'I love this town!'This makes me rethink what may be underlying the outcry over the casting of women in the 2016 'Ghostbusters' reboot, of what is one of the most, let's say, male-centric of classic comedies. Or... 'Ghostbusters' is just a silly comedy with the best zingers coming from Bill Murray, a catchy soundtrack and a production design and dated visual effects that remain charming.",7,3,3,30 September 2018
Hidden Figures," Equivocal
","'Hidden Figures,' I must first say, is a perfect title; the double meaning encapsulates the two main thrusts of the picture: first, revealing the figures of African-American women whose importance to the space program at NASA has been hidden by historical racial and sexual marginalization and, second, discovering the figures of mathematics and engineering needed for the success of the Space Race. Ultimately, the equation proposed here is that the STEM disciplines are an equalizing and vital force societally. It's similar to the statement in 'Lincoln' (2012) using Euclid to elaborate on equality and truth, except here that proof is derived from differential equations, including Euler's method. Indeed, that's a laudatory message, but the title is not the only factor in this movie to be an equivocality. 'Hidden Figures' also reveals some of the same unfortunate tropes and mischaracterizations seen time and again by Hollywood in dealing with racial and societal issues. Although excellent in theory, many but not every number in this picture adds up.I don't necessarily care about simplifying history with composite characters, fictions to illustrate items of historical relevance and jiggering the timelines to make for a cohesive cinematic narrative, but I detest tropes such as the white male savior and noble bigot--employed to assuage the audience of any fears that their society might not be so much more enlightened now or, perish the thought, they themselves might not be. Such avoidance of challenging the spectator solves nothing. 'Hidden Figures' is certainly not the worst offender in this respect; the last Best Picture winner, 'Green Book' (2018), for instance, is almost entirely comprised of this rubbish and from the perspective of its white protagonist, to boot. Nevertheless, we get ahistorical scenes such as Kevin Costner--the same white savior from 'Dances with Wolves' (1990) no less--integrating bathrooms by knocking down the sign designating one of them for 'colored' women. Other characters who display personal and institutional racism are likewise inevitably redeemed as they help to further promote the well-being of the black women, from the police officer escorting them to work to a workplace gesture of kindness as simple as bringing one a cup of coffee. Outside of a brief library scene, there doesn't appear to be one irredeemable bigot here, which is remarkable for a movie about overcoming prejudice set in 1960s Virginia.Related to this comforting cinematic hand holding is the modern-day aversion to depicting smoking even for authenticity. If you've seen documentary footage of employees of NASA in the '60s and afore, or experienced that era first hand, it becomes apparent that the hidden figures within this picture are smoke and cigarette-filled ashtrays. Instead, we get Costner chewing gum. It takes some oblivious sanctimony to rid one dangerous habit, which in the grand scheme of things has only become proscribed recently, for concerns of their bad influence, only to continue the dissemination of dangerous tropes privileging white characters, which are older than film itself.On the other hand, movies have likewise long assumed that scribbling nonsense could be passed off as real mathematics, but 'Hidden Figures' reportedly hired mathematician Rudy Horne to consult on the equations pictured here, so that even though the specific computations here aren't exact to history, they're arguably more faithful than the depictions of race and sex, let alone cancer sticks. Moreover, some of the best visuals here involve the repetition of the women displaying their STEM-related talents. The picture begins with a scene of a young Katherine Goble solving a problem on the chalkboard at school that is later referenced when Costner hands Taraji P. Henson a piece of chalk at a meeting concerning John Glenn's upcoming mission to orbit the planet. Another introductory scene establishes Octavia Spencer's Dorothy Vaughan as mechanically gifted in fixing a broken-down car, a skill set she later employs to supervise the new IBM mainframe computers at Langley. Some fine acting led by Henson also helps with the intended feel-good entertainment.More impressively, however, this is a nice compliment picture to the white-dominant and overtly-masculine 'The Right Stuff' (1983), and one of the best shots here is of Spencer leading her fellow human computers down the corridor--referencing a similar shot of the Mercury Seven in the Philip Kaufman film. Even the score adds a new facet to the usual trumpeting in space films. The fact that 'Hidden Figures' adds to the representation and the general cosmos of the Space Race picture alone makes it worthwhile. Indeed, despite its faults, it also has the right stuff.",7,0,3,23 July 2019
1917," One Shot for Many
","The one continuous long take (or seemingly so) comprising most of or an entire picture that I've seen in other movies largely seems to me a gimmick--a technically impressive one, but gimmicky nonetheless. 'Rope' (1948), Russian Ark' (2002), 'La Casa Muda' (2010) and 'Birdman' (2014), for example. '1917' has a reason, or at least a rhyme, for it, though. Basically, the narrative is the inverse of 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998): risking and sacrificing the life of one man to save that of many instead of the other way around merely to rescue Matt Damon. There's also the added pressure of preventing a scheduled massacre--the race against time. One shot for one man. One shot for him to save the day. To top it off, the shot ends where it began, as a seemingly unbroken loop, with one soul resting against a tree.So clever is this that I hardly mind that the drama may not be the most arresting, let alone enlightening, I've seen over countless war films, nor that it may not be as moving or as thrilling as I might've expected given the set up. Granted, there is the tree as life motif contrasted with the bodies of dead soldiers and other animals in the polluted war zones and abandoned habitats. The younger brother is knowledgeable about orchards, and these trees also mark the way to accomplish the mission. A similar contrast is made with the scene involving a woman and a baby and the soldiers remembering the families they've left back home.Speaking of 'Saving Private Ryan,' again, though, that Steven Spielberg masterpiece was a technical marvel in several regards, but largely for the horrific chaos of the opening D-Day sequence, as seen through the eyes of Tom Hanks's character. There, the camera's gaze, as linked with Hanks, was something, too, of a hapless, shell-shocked warrior struggling to make sense out of the war and the mission of risking multiple lives to save but one. '1917' shares the symmetry of the camera's gaze being linked with a single character, Schofield. This perspective, however, is unflinching--so much so that it's made to look like a single take (well, except for that brief blackout when the character and the shot itself is shot by a bullet). It's the camera as savior. Note what happens every time Schofield and, thus, the gaze of the cinematographic apparatus, lose track of their partner, Blake. First, he volunteers Schofield for a dangerous mission, and, then, he gets into a fight with other soldiers--twice and with varying degrees of severity--and there's also the trip wire. That two relative non-stars are cast in these lead parts is wise, too, as if to suggest that the lives of their characters are not valued as highly as those of the stars (Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, etc.) marking the path of their journey, let alone the stars who provided a similar purpose within a similar structure in 'Dunkirk' (2017), or, you know, Hanks and Damon. Regardless, the point is that the point of view suggests early on who the protagonist is and who will be protected. The sixteen-hundred soldiers advancing into a trap can only be rescued when Schofield takes the one-shot to them.And so I'll rank '1917' highly because it employs this single technique to effectively harness the power of the cinematic gaze. Someday, perhaps, a picture will come along that will more fully recognize how deep in history the single-shot film belongs, though. '1917,' however, does recall the loop aesthetic of early (or even pre-) cinema, by beginning and ending with the same composition--indeed, back when motion pictures were first screened in rotating instruments based on the phenakistiscope, where a spinning series of still images were given the illusion of life. (In this respect, I also like how Schofield looks at still photographs at the end, as did Blake.) Look at one of the so-called 'first' films, for instance, 'Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory' (1895); it ends where it began, too, with the gates closed. '1917' doesn't actually consist of only one take, though, but is rather compiled to look as though it did by digital editing (and as aided in its effectiveness by a fine score, soundtrack and visual effects). Alfred Hitchcock and company had to move the camera and cut in strategic places for 'Rope,' on the other hand. Further back still, one of the first filmmakers to create the illusion of multiple takes being but one was Georges Méliès, who reflexively employed such tricks for magical performances. These stop-substitutions gave the illusion of appearances and disappearances, resizings, doublings and other fantastic visions. If the one take continues to grow in popularity as a gimmick, maybe someone along the way will reference Méliès's magic. Until then, '1917' succeeds in repurposing the mission of the one-shot film.",8,1,4,22 January 2020
Children of Men," Death and Rebirth on Film
","No other film, perhaps, better captures the seemingly miraculous than 'Children of Men.' The power of it is in taking the most everyday occurrence in living history of childbirth. The depiction of a future dystopia is subtly reflexive, of film as itself a process of death (still images of the once moving and living) and rebirth (as projected moving images) and accentuated by the rise of digital cinema, as motion pictures went through its own process of the death of film, reborn as something different and new digitally. The filming of 'Children of Men' reflects this, too; shot on film, as a few, if continually fewer, pictures even to this day continue to be, it, nonetheless, goes through many of the same digital intermediaries as other films do and before, ultimately, largely being viewed as a digital product, whether by projection in a theatre or at home through disc or streaming. The standout, seemingly long tracking shots here are part of this--combining the power of continual filming, but also largely broken up by sly edits and computer generated imagery. Everything in 'Children of Men,' including the sci-fi dystopia set in the near future, is both familiar and novel--futuristic computer screens next to gray looks at long-standing landmarks of London; war and pestilence, religious and political zealotry beside others going about their daily routines; death and life.Indeed, 'Children of Men,' then, is a great technical achievement at the least. In a history of the greatest shots and scenes ever in film, the seeming one-shot of the attack on the car here would certainly be worth including, as would the later tracking shot of the blood-splattered camera, which in following, but keeping some distance from, Theo (Clive Owen) becomes something of a character itself--visibly included within the action as marked by blood, sometimes dazed in joining Theo in avoiding the battle surrounding them, but also displaying curiosity by looking around and elsewhere besides him. For pure emotional power, the more conventionally edited-together sequence of the cease fire is remarkable, as well. The shaky, hand-or-body-held camerawork, grit and experimental nature of the cinematography, editing and effects here remain more impressive in a way, too, than similar set-ups, including long framings and trackings, but which are more antiseptic in director Alfonso Cuarón's acclaimed and admittedly-still-spectacular subsequent pictures, 'Gravity' (2013) and 'Roma' (2018).Beyond technical and stylistic bravado, I also love what Cuarón and company did here in underscoring the loss of procreation and by inverting some familiar tropes--all of which goes a long way, too, towards accepting the usual white-male savior plot. In this artfully-created world, the loss of children is highlighted well from the beginning with the news footage of the youngest person in the world's murder. Later, in one of the best such twists since 'Psycho' (1960), there's the murder of the then-lead female character, who also happens to be played by one of the biggest stars and brightest talents in the business, Julianne Moore. This loss of children is doubled by mentions of the loss of a child to a flu pandemic by Julian (Moore) and Theo. The loss of mothers, and by extension fertility, furthered by another mother figure being comatose. Fathers die, too. Besides that, this is the best use of Michael Caine and his iconic status as the ultimate father figure I've seen outside of a Christopher Nolan feature.It's all the better that 'Children of Men' also keeps its distance from religion, especially because of its miraculous content. The funniest line in the otherwise dramatic picture is when Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) jokes of being a virgin, with the obvious allusion being to Mother Mary and the birth of Jesus. Although ironically played by a real-life English actress, Kee's status as a refugee also well exploits the white-savior plot and the anti-immigrant dystopia in the film. That the camera keeps its distance, with few close-ups, and retains some independence from tracking Owen, and that characters aren't overly fleshed out and relied upon offers a greater view of society as a whole. Theo is provided habits of drinking and smoking since losing a child, but, otherwise, specific character details matter less here, as do the ethnic, political and religious battles, as all seems to stem from the shared existential crisis. A smaller inversion that works well, too, is that of the gypsy woman and her rebuking the old trope of them stealing babies.Tropes inverted, as with all else in 'Children of Men,' things are familiar but reborn. It's what makes the future dystopia, gray and unflashy, more striking, as a believable extension of the real world (then, in 2006, and perhaps even more so today, as I reviewed it during the real-life pandemic of 2020). It's why the filmic metaphor of life-death-and-rebirth, especially in the age of transitioning from film to digital cinema and effects, is effective. The story of the film is the same as the making of it: ending life to start (again, still images in filmmaking), but through innovation, work, or sexual reproduction, creating life anew. It's why 'Children of Men' is a miraculous and hopeful picture, as well. People and films ultimately die only when there is no future. The many lost silent films, for instance, vanished because of careless lack of foresight of a future market for them (plus nitrate is inflammable, but that's beside the point). The inclusion of the art collector in the film is a brilliant touch in this respect--of a character collecting famous artworks--Michelangelo's sculpture of 'David' and Picasso's 'Guernica'--despite the common belief that nobody in the film's world will be alive to appreciate them in 100 years. As long as their are children, there's a future, and great art, including films such as 'Children of Men' may continue to be appreciated.",10,1,1,21 May 2020
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Pointless Candy
","An exchange between Charlie Oliver Twist and the TV kid here sums up TIm Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' quite well. Riding in the glass elevator through fireworks, Teavee asks sarcastically, 'Why is everything here completely pointless?' To which the cloying simpleton Charlie circularly states, 'Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy.' Stupid telly child, why one might as well inquire as to the point of any Tim Burton movie.Based on the same book, the 1971 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' worked on a couple levels. It was something of a parody of itself in its making fun of the culture surrounding television and candy. Much of the first forty-or-so minutes were devoted to this--even before Willy Wonka was introduced. Such humorous self-deprecation is largely dispensed with here in favor of zany looks, pratfalls and straightforwardly-debasing caricatures. The latter includes restoring some of the book's imperialist attitudes, what with the Indian prince stereotype and furthering the connotations to the history of African slavery with the Oompa Loompas (originally, Roald Dahl wrote them as African Pygmies) being discovered by Wonka in the jungle. And make what you will of this racial other all being made to look alike here.The 1971 film also benefited, despite the name change in the title, from generally sticking with the perspective of Charlie. What we saw in the film, then, was the world as a child might perceive it. One where candy is currency, adults are nonsensical and capricious, contrivances seem magical and factories are amusement parks. In this 2005 movie, however, we also get Wonka's backstory, as remembered by him and as told by Charlie's grandfather, as well as too many other perspectives, which is ultimately cleaned up by the introduction of a narrator. The result is even more saccharine, too. But, the real problem is that the child's perspective is lost; in its place, we get what we always get in Burton's oeuvre: his perspective--unaccountably skewed and made-up to look goth. Oh, plus, there's the CGI, which merely makes the candy look like a cartoon.Yet, I'll gladly rewatch this any day over what Burton did to Lewis Carroll's Alice books. They don't stray far from the source this time. Johnny Depp is at least slightly amusing as Willy Wonka, as opposed to his insufferable turn as the Mad Hatter. Casting Dracula himself, Christopher Lee, as a dentist is fangtastic. There are a few good verbal puns, too. And the candy-as-TV sequence is reimagined relatively well here compared to the 1971 iteration, including referencing '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), 'Psycho' (1960) and pop-music bands. Indeed, there are quite a few references to other media sprinkled throughout--some being other Burton films or the usual gothic and horror-related pictures he likes to imitate. We first see Depp here reprising a pose from 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990), for instance, whereas one unfortunate Oompa is transformed into Cousin It from 'The Addams Family.' But, yeah, mostly it's just completely pointless.",4,1,4,9 January 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Frankenstein's Avengers
","This sequel, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron,' is surely flawed, but it's an interesting mixture of two popular movie genres: the relatively new comic-book superhero one, which has only recently emerged to dominate the box office in this age of Hollywood franchises, and the older genre of the horror film. Both may've been originally (or still) sneered at by many--perhaps, even for good reason, including repetitious and superficial fan servicing--but they've been extraordinarily popular. Last year, during the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's novel 'Frankenstein,' I reviewed a bunch of related films in relation to that book, as well as seeing how such shockers became a Hollywood staple. For some reason, I neglected two superhero pictures that are partly based on 'Frankenstein.' Both are in part made by Joss Whedon, who had already mixed pulpy vampirism with teen drama for TV with 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' and he was behind the meta-horror of 'The Cabin in the Woods' (2012). So why not rework Shelley's creation for comic-book characters, which he's done here and did again, later, with 'Justice League' (2017).The Marvel CInematic Universe has unleashed a whole new monster of franchise building; one need not look far for its imitators to see that it's become the envy of the motion-picture world, but even if one traces the superhero franchise back to the Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batmans, this genre is relatively young. Going any further back, comic-book film adaptations become the pure kiddie stuff of cartoons and serials. The Hollywood horror film, on the other hand, dates back to 1931 when Universal released 'Dracula' and, soon thereafter, 'Frankenstein.' Both based on 19th-century Gothic horror novels, although more so their theatrical iterations over the years. Both were box-office successes, too, but they also received harsher criticism than any recent superhero movie has; they were censored, and the genre was de-facto banned for a few years. Later, these monsters launched the first shared cinematic universe beginning with 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' (1943). Now, they're considered classics, and although 'Age of Ultron' may never be considered that, 'The Dark Knight' (2008), say, or 'Logan' (2017) already are. All of which is to say that these two types of cinemas seem a natural fit. Moreover, Gothic horror such as 'Dracula,' 'Frankenstein' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,' in particular, are about science and modernity, alter egos and supernatural abilities.'Age of Ultron' hints at its scary-movie roots from the start with the Avengers attacking what is essentially a haunted house on a hill. Just look at the way Scarlet Witch (apt name there, too) floats backwards through a door that seemingly closes on its own, as though she were Dracula. Heck, she even has mesmerizing powers to read others' minds and trick them into dreams. The faux Eastern European accent only completes the Bela Lugosi imitation--you know, except she blasts red magic energy from her hands and body. The haunted house also features a mad doctor's dream laboratory where artificial intelligence was being mined from one of those supernatural infinity stones. The two mad doctors of the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man and Bruce Banner/Hulk (the latter of whom has always essentially been a derivative of Jekyll/Hyde, except with smashing replacing Robert Louis Stevenson's original drug abuse and sexual promiscuity), then, take this magical tech back to their lair's lab to, basically, inadvertently unleash a Frankenstein monster, Ultron. This robot creature even stumbles into the Avengers party like he were Boris Karloff freshly reanimated and just learning how to walk and what to think. The Avengers will teach him that 'fire bad'--or at least that laser things shot out of superheros bad for robots--soon enough, too.Furthermore, Captain America reminds us that he was the experiment of a German scientist and was reanimated from a frozen state. Likewise, Black Widow's flashback dream includes remembering that her body was altered, too, to create the weapon that she is today (for feminist critics of this storyline, this is why it exists). The reason Hawkeye is the 'heart' or 'soul' of the team this episode is probably because he's the only one who doesn't think of himself as something of an engineered or otherwise supernatural monster. Iron Man has an electrical plant for a heart and is a man dressing as a robot. Hulk is inching closer to Mr. Hyde entirely out of the control of Dr. Jekyll. The Witch and her speedy brother were also made in a lab. Even Fury is missing an eye. And Thor is an alien god running around with a magic hammer on Earth, for crying out loud.Thus, we have a cast of characters who are something of Frankensteins themselves, who then go on to more blatantly reference the 1931 'Frankenstein' film is giving life to another AI robot (whether with synthetic skin or vibranium what have you or not), Vision. The god of thunder even comes back from his vision quest in a magical pool to provide the lightning bolt of a spark of life to the creature. Indeed, the Vision body was originally planned as the creation of Ultron, who brain washed his own mad scientist for the purpose. So, there is quite a bit of Frankenstein creating going on here. As Tony tells Bruce, 'We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You've got to own it.'I enjoy this stitched-together from various genre and technical body parts aspect even if does lead to an imbalance of dark lighting and production design for talking scenes out of a horror movie conflicting with action sequences shot in daylight complete with interruptions of slow-motion superhero poses and bad one-line jokes. (Cap's aversion to cursing especially pisses me off. He was reanimated from fighting super-Nazis, not from 'Leave It to Beaver;' he should act like it, dammit.) Plus, there's the usual modern-movie dichotomy of live action mixed with CGI animation, which continues to improve. Some of the picture is blandly unimaginative, though. There's too much set-up for future franchise installments. A fight sequence on a runaway train seems particularly to be a rip-off of the better scene from 'Spider-Man 2' (2004). Although James Spader provides an amusingly chatty voice for a robot, the character is very reminiscent of 'The Terminator' franchise; AI awakes, gets into the interweb, manufactures an army of mechanical clones, seeks to destroy mankind--we've seen it before. And the Quicksilver character pales in comparison to the version from the prior 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014).The apology theme for the Avengers' military adventurism is lackluster, as well. It worked better in 'Iron Man' (2008) as a reflection of the War on Terror. And, really, do they have to make up places--'Sokovia?' I'll accept 'Wakanda,' but what precisely is the political point they're dancing around to try not to offend anyone with this vaguely Eastern European country? I sense this militarism of the Avengers, read (Captain) America, should be another Frankenstein monster here, but it's too muddled. Much of 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is alive, but some of the body is dead parts.",6,0,0,29 September 2019
Hotel Transylvania," And I Thought The Monster Squad was Childish
","I'm sure plenty of children and families adore 'Hotel Transylvania,' but not every animated kiddie movie is without intelligence, so I'm not going to cut it any slack. Another animated monster kids movie, Pixar's 'Monster's, Inc.' (2001), for instance, is kind of clever in its use of doors to multiple universes. And, although not animated, 'The Monster Squad' (1987) manages to pay homage to classic monster movies and remain charming despite some childish humor. 'Hotel Transylvania' features many of the same monsters as that film and more, including Dracula and his daughter, Frankenstein and his bride, werewolves, mummies, an invisible man, a gillman and Quasimodo, but they've basically nothing to do with their sources in novels or prior movies. They're more akin to the monster cereals, such as Count Chocula and Frenken Berry--mere caricatures, overly sweet and not very good for you.In 'Hotel Transylvania,' Dracula has clipped the wings, so to speak, of his bat daughter, but he must learn to allow her to fly the coop. He also runs a hotel for monsters. The Dracula of 'Nocturna' (1979) did the same thing, the film also had plenty of music like this one (except it was disco), and Dracula's daughter fell in love with a human. The similarities stop there, though, since 'Nocturna' also had gratuitous nudity and an old Dracula complaining about how his reproductive organs don't work as well anymore (although, here, the Invisible Man defends the size of his in one pool-side gag). 'Hotel Transylvania,' on the other hand, has Count-less butt jokes, including a fart that's let on fire. I'm not sure which is worse, but I know fire is bad.There's a joke at the expense of the 'Twilight' series, where Dracula sardonically remarks, 'This is how we're represented.' Right back at you, Count Chocula; 'Hotel Transylvania' isn't fang-tastic, either. Nor had I ever heard Dracula say 'blah blah blah,' and I've seen well over 50 Dracula movies since reading Bram Stoker's novel. Perhaps, the worst caricature of all, though, is Quasimodo as the hotel chef. Why is he a chef? Because he's French, I guess. That's racist. Anyways, the movie wraps up like a bad rom-com but replaces the father for the girl or boy chasing down the other for a grand romantic gesture. It's kind of like 'The Wedding Singer' (1998) and with the same actor.Another quibble I have with this movie is that when they list off Dracula's vulnerabilities--sunlight, garlic, stakes to the heart--they don't mention crosses. I get that they threw out all of the sex and violence from Dracula--even though that was most of Stoker's book--it's a kid's movie, after all. But the religion? I think that was a shrewd commercial move to avoid offending any audience, except for maybe cranky old Dracula buffs like me. But, they've made millions of dollars off this franchise and, as of this writing, about to release the third movie installment, so they know what they're doing. I don't have to like it, though.(Mirror Note: No mirror shots in this Dracula movie, either.)",4,1,1,10 July 2018
Big Fish," Narrative Threads
","Tim Burton weaves a present story with a narrated past story, which interweaves truth and fiction. The past thread is involving and entertaining. At least four narrators will have told it by the end. Burton usually succeeds with fantastical stories. His presentation often aggrandized by salient photography; so, here, the high-key lighting is nostalgia of old movies. Ewan McGregor masters the lead--threading the nostalgia, offbeat humor and aging, as he must relate somewhat to the Ed Bloom in the present thread. Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and Alison Lohman help. Alberty Finney and Billy Crudup don't, though. Yet, Burton is who completely fails to make the present story interesting in any way. Even the low-key lighting is boring. It's like a TV-movie sort of reality. The inevitable reconciliation wasn't worth my time, only the past narrative was.",6,0,2,19 August 2004
The Mummy Returns," Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Mummy
","'The Mummy Returns' is best when it's shamelessly recycling the story from the prior 'The Mummy' (1999), especially when the characters joke about the repetition early on. Through the double-decker bus sequence, where they fight the same mummified soldiers from the last picture, and after the woman is once again saved from bondage, and after another temple full of booby traps and secret passages, and the kid repeating mommy's domino effect of bookcases but with columns this time, this sequel excels at recapturing the magic of movement and comic relief of its predecessor and the formula that was borrowed, as many others have pointed out, from the Indiana Jones franchise. But, then, there's a tonal shift towards the dramatic, including another kidnapping and some not-so-Ancient-Egyptian nonsense about reincarnated bodies and destinies spilling over from past lives, and, like the balloon of the airship, it's as though all the air was taken out of the fun.There's also an appreciation for the excess inherent in sequels--seemingly reaching back to Universal's past life of monster movie sequels beginning with 'Bride of Frankenstein' (1935), calling for the doubling of everything. So, now there are two mummies (Imhotep and the Scorpion King), two reincarnated women, two flashback scenes (one of which is shared by the two women), two men following ancient codes of protection (the good Egyptian from the last movie and the white American hero sporting a new tattoo), two abductions, two sets of travel and plots (train and airship), two countries, two fictional Ancient Egyptian sites and two real ones, even two black stereotypes (one the good clown, the other the evil buck). Not all of the excess amounts to much, though. The Scorpion King especially gets short shrift, and his CGI creature looks about as realistic as the stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen without an ounce of the charm. There's another curator, too, except he's evil this time, and we're offered hardly any explanation as to his motives and methods. And the whole past lives business seems to be here just so that the women can do fight moves between choppy editing just like the men. I miss the simplicity of the frumpy librarian flirting with the rugged, gun-toting adventurer.In addition to this sequel, like its predecessor, opening with an Ancient Egypt flashback, there's a shared flashback vision after the tonal shift, which elaborates upon the last movie's flashback: from one perspective, it's a pool vision like the one in the 1932 Boris Karloff 'Mummy,' and the other is from the airship. Additionally, there are the visions from the bracelet serving as this one's map. Again, there are bugs and quicksand, and now there's an army of mummified Pygmies and Anubis Jackal-men, all providing disintegrating, bloodless PG-13 deaths and violence. As well as the gaping mouths from afore, this one adds catching thrown weapons. Like the sequel 'Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom' (1984), a kid is added, but fortunately nobody is named 'Short Round,' and nobody eats monkey brains.",4,0,0,12 October 2018
Selma," Politics of Historical Drama
","'Selma' is a movie that seems will remain prominent in popular discourse on history and race for some time to come, at least if screenings of it continue to reappear every Martin Luther King Jr. Day and February during Black History Month, Paramount continues to stream it for free when racial issues are front-page news, or school teachers continue to look for something that seems both educational and a way to keep students quiet while they hardly do any work themselves. It's not as though there have been very many biopics of Martin Luther King Jr., either, or even historical pictures about the civil rights movement. As original and always timely as 'Selma' may be in that regard, it otherwise seems similar to another political biopic, if not hagiography, 'Lincoln' (2012). Both focus on historical figures who've reached saintly proportions in the American imagination, both for their leadership in struggles against racist legal systems, and both movies largely avoid the simplistic good-vs-evil plot of the hero squaring off against the baddie in favor of focusing on the internal politics of the movement, whether in working the votes to pass the 13th Amendment or, 100 years later, in organizing the Selma-to-Montgomery marches to raise the issue of the Voting Rights Act.With less focus on the likes of Alabama Governor George Wallace or Sheriff Jim Clark as evil obstacles to overcome, although that is still there on the margins, 'Selma,' instead focuses on conflicts between King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and John Lewis's branch of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, but most prominently and controversially, there's the picture's battle of wills between King and President Lyndon Johnson. I'm not a historical expert on the matter and so won't get into the weeds on how accurate the portrayal of LBJ is here or whether the filmmakers veered too far in their avoidance of white-savior tropes towards historical inaccuracy. Indeed, it seems odd to me that a president wouldn't be eager to pass a bill that guarantees voting rights to a constituency that reliably votes upwards of over 90% for their party, but, then, this was the same administration consumed by the Vietnam War, so perhaps his priorities were at least questionable. Regardless, there've since been a couple bland biopics on Johnson since, for those interested: 'All the Way' and 'LBJ' (both 2016).By focusing on the likes of King, Lewis and company, at least we get a greater sense of the grass-roots nature of the civil rights movement. One doesn't get the same view from privileging Washington, especially from a president whose FBI director was actively undermining the civil rights movement, including by attacking the marriage of the King family, as seen in 'Selma.' These were rights achieved by activists and civilians, by shocking TV coverage of demonstrations and calls to action from the likes of King to galvanize people of all races to support equality. So, while 'Selma' does partly follow a great-man-narrative with its focus on King, the trajectory of progress is from the ground up. There's a reason King accepting the Nobel Peace Prize shares the picture's opening with the tragedy of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and the everyday discrimination of Annie Lee Cooper (although casting Oprah Winfrey in this part arguably undermines the focus on common people somewhat) being denied the right to vote.'Selma' isn't perfect. Depicting the bombing in slow motion seems tactless. And the filmmakers don't entirely escape the pitfalls of the genre for grandstanding and speechifying even when characters aren't delivering speeches or in front of cameras. Nevertheless, David Oyelowo is outstanding as King--managing to appear forceful without being showy. The backstory of the internal politics behind the marches holds interest, and I like the inclusion of archival footage of the real event at the end. 'Selma' is a palatable-enough treatment of historically significant events to be worthy of its prominence.",7,0,0,16 June 2020
The Happening," Breaking Wind Forces Marky Mark to Value Social Distancing
","I never thought I'd see 'The Happening' again, but since I've been seeking out a bunch of movies of late that may seem relevant to today's real-world pandemic, it's taken on added interest. It's still a very bad movie, though. The plot is the standard game of apocalyptic fiction of running away from disaster. Dialogue is trite to atrocious, including Mark Whalberg trying to remember aloud the scientific method and John Leguizamo reciting nonsense statistics. Little is done with the urban-rural dichotomy, and the Underground Railroad subplot is out of place. Attempts to interject human interest into the main characters are pathetic, including a squabble over the relation of a dessert to marital infidelity--or some such rubbish. Characteristically, Whalberg, as a science teacher, of all things, and Zooey Deschanel, as--give me a break--emotionally reserved, are wretched. With the threat of such an acting couple procreating, it makes sense the world would naturally try to reject it. Heck, it's understandable just as a means to stop Marky Mark from mis-teaching that class.... The bees are dying from environmental destruction; it's not a mystery to never be solved, you self-satisfied ignoramus. There, I said it.The obvious message of the picture is of environmental warning, with post-9/11 threats of terrorism serving as red herring. Beyond plants blowing in the wind, however, this seems prescient given current events as of this writing, as the characters temporarily learn to survive by socially, or physically, distancing from each other. Find yourself in a large group, the wind blows the wrong way, and the virus spreads. Sounds familiar. Even staying indoors isn't entirely safe due to air circulation and due to Whalberg inevitably rejecting what little wisdom he's learned to risk exposing himself and those he loves to deadly contagion. For the safety of one's enjoyment as a movie spectator, it's probably best to stay away from this one.",3,0,0,20 May 2020
The Shape of Water," Creature from the Black Lagoon Inverted
","Perhaps slight for a Best Picture Oscar winner, its cloying simplism extending to its self-reflexivity--that movies are magical, 'The Shape of Water' is, nonetheless, stylishly made and interestingly the inverse of the film it most pays homage to, 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' (1954). The subject of a few plagiarism accusations, including a failed lawsuit for a play I'm not familiar with; I think the accusations of stealing from other movies tend to be overblown (as if it weren't already a prevalent practice) and overlook the dreariness of those cinematic borrowings. Not the obvious superficial similarities a romantic reworking of Universal's Gillman trilogy was bound to have as a gender reversal of 'Splash' (1984) and 'The Little Mermaid' (1989), either. The look, with its greens and golden light colors, not counting the addition of blue to reference water here, and the familiar sense of whimsy, rom-com quirks and simplistic characterizations, indeed, resemble 'Amélie' (2001). By the time a French song plays after the consummation of the central romance, it would seem like the movie is more likely set in the Paris of Jean-Pierre Jeunet rather than in Baltimore, if not for the Cold War and Civil Rights politics providing bearings. Then, there's the bland wonder at movies from 'Cinema Paradiso' (1988). It does sound and look nice, flowing camerawork included, even if it's essentially artful but immature creature-feature fan fiction complete with bathtub moments of masturbation and bestiality.I appreciate the visual effects and how they add to the water theme, including shooting dry for wet for the fantastic underwater scenes, the rain drops and the water dissolves in editing. Moreover, Elisa's daily routine is built around the use of water, from her morning masturbation in the bath and, later, sex in water, to boiling eggs, from firemen turning the hoses on a factory fire to the mood-setting rainfall later, and even her workplace mopping up of men's errant urine and receiving a lecture on the implications on a man's character as to the washing of hands. The time motif, too, bends to water via the daily thoughts of her calendar expounding that, 'Time is but a river flowing from our past,' and 'Life is but the shipwreck of our plans.'The acting is fine, too, but the characters are overly simplistic. The good guys are very good, and the bad guys are very bad. Only the Russian scientist occupies a bit of gray area. Michael Shannon is typecast, once again, as the villain, his Colonel who captures the fish-man lacking about as much complexity and empathy as his General Zod from 'Man of Steel' (2013). Octavia Spencer plays another sassy sidekick in a movie set in America's racially-segregated past, à la 'The Help' (2011) and 'Hidden Figures' (2016). Meanwhile, the gay neighbor appears rather childishly innocent in his escape into musicals and near retreat from the horrors of mistreated minorities. And Sally Hawkins is always fantastic, although the casting of a Brit seems a bit of a sop to the expected audience for a character that seems to be coded as ambiguously Latin American. On the other hand, having a mute character that partially relies on others (gay narrator and black coworker) to talk for her may have come across as too on the nose in alluding to Spanish-speaking immigrants in the U.S. with the casting of a Latin-American actress.'The Shape of Water' manages to be more black-and-white in its characterizations than 'Creature from the Black Lagoon,' despite that film's 1950s sexism and colonialist underpinnings. In that original creature feature, there was one man who was somewhat unsympathetic, but everyone else, the Gillman included, had complex motives, benign and sinister characteristics. Not so here. The pie shop teller isn't only homophobic, but a racist, as well (he even has a fake Southern accent, for whatever that matters). The Colonel doesn't just mistreat 'the Asset,' he defends his actions with Old Testament appeals to bigotry, he's misogynistic in his adulterous lust, and he even becomes physically deformed. The fingers business seems to undermine the movie's message, though, as it's essentially an old ableist trope that villains be physically crippled.Otherwise, 'The Shape of Water' is from the perspective of marginalized peoples: the protagonist, disabled by her muteness, the homosexual, the African Americans and the merman. I like that even smokers are included here--mainstream in the 1960s, but largely discriminated against today--it also reverses the cliché of cigarettes being associated with the baddies. The one here consumes candy, instead (ironic, though, that a movie that vilifies candy and pie is itself so saccharine). This is the inverse of the original Gillman trilogy, where scientific colonialists ventured to the Amazon to capture the monster. The IMDb review by TheKing87 is on the right track in regards to Elisa and the creature being the same species, including by the inference of her backstory of gill-like scars on her neck and Spanish and river-based origins. The implication is that he's human, as he was the racial 'other' to the white American colonizers in the 1950s, as was the giant ape in 'King Kong' (1933) before that. There was always a colonialist ideology underpinning this, and 'The Shape of Water,' headed by its Latin-American director, reverses that doctrine.This is so apt that I'm largely willing to overlook the flaws in story and self-reflexivity otherwise. I mean, the creature being cinema is too obvious--both blandly magical, even godly--culminating in a scene where he's found alone in a theatre watching a Bible movie. Even that's preferable to the Beauty-and-the-Beast love story annotated by musicals, including the fantasy sequence where Elisa dreams herself a voice. Even if not everything holds water, it's so well-shaped, to borrow from the title's allusion, by its container that's it's hard not to be swept up in it.",8,2,6,23 October 2018
Zombieland," Twinkies
","The success or failure of comedies mystifies me sometimes. Why did 'The Hangover,' 'The Proposal' and 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop'--and those are just some of the comedies that outperformed 'Zombieland' in 2009--prove profitable at the box office? Personally, I thought bombs such as 'Funny People' or 'Whip It' (both also from 2009) to be more amusing and interesting. I mean, there've been zombie parodies before, which is also part of the horror spoof genre at large. 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004) is an obvious precursor. Perhaps, it's because the material is familiar and because that it's easily consumed is comforting that helps explain its popularity. Movies such as this are, essentially, Twinkies.After all, part of why 'Zombieland' is familiar and readily consumed is because it tells us exactly what it is. There's no hidden subtext here. Their destroying a store selling Native-American-style wares isn't a commentary on zombies reflecting America's past genocide of the country's native inhabitants. Their making fun of obese people isn't satire; they're plain fat jokes. Anyways, there are four characters on three separate quests amid the zombie apocalypse here: the girls want to visit an amusement park, the boy wants sex, and Woody Harrelson is searching for Twinkies. A thrill ride, a rom-com and junk food: that's what 'Zombieland' is. But, inside of this, we're shown what the movie aspires to be, which is 'Ghostbusters' (1984). Indeed, that film is screened in the middle part as a film-within-the-film, and Bill Murray steals the show in a cameo. This is no 'Ghostbusters,' though. I may have a heterodox take on that classic comedy, but it's a perverse picture--even sexually and homoerotically so. Four guys sliding down fire poles, waving around their wands while chasing a rainbow of ghosts unleashed from their closet and, then, ending up covered in white goo--c'mon. 'Zombieland' is pedestrian by comparison.Sure, it plays around with a fourth-wall-breaking protagonist narrating in a humorous way, but that's merely the wrapper. It hardly goes far enough to upend its genre in the way the same screenwriters' 'Deadpool' (2016) would, or to be as funny as Murray's sardonic quips throughout 'Ghostbusters.' Instead, we get a thrill ride that's not especially thrilling with the sweetness of romantic comedy thrown in, but, ultimately, it's just junk. Like a Twinkie, it looks stupid enough to promise being funny and is mostly sugary, unfulfilling and bad for you, but it's cheap and accessible. Consuming one of them now and again may not do you great harm, but if your diet consists largely of them, you risk being a fathead.(Speaking of stupid, does everywhere in Zombieland have a generator? Where do they think electricity comes from? Why do they assume abandoned vehicles will run or have gas--how do they not have problems getting gas? Why do they not worry about running out of bullets? How has spoiled food not made grocery stores biohazards? 'Maybe 'Garfield.'' How is Murray not certain of regretting being in that movie?)",4,3,4,14 November 2019
Joker," Masked Mirroring
","'Joker' is a controversial picture, although I suspect some of the political criticisms and, more so, the fearmongering over the threat of life imitating art will die down in time, and the latter is surely fueled largely by memories of the Aurora, Colorado shooting during a screening of 'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012) and, due to this movie's similarity to 'Taxi Driver' (1976), the history of John Hinckley Jr. taking inspiration from Martin Scorsese's film in his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. Otherwise, the divisiveness, in a way, suits an origin story of Batman's psychopathic and sadistic arch nemesis. He's not a hero; he's the clown prince of crime. Despite the uproar, there's nothing especially groundbreaking about 'Joker.' It's a darker and more realistic and serious comic-book movie in the tradition of the Dark Knight trilogy, 'Logan' (2017), or some of Zack Snyder's superhero adaptations (i.e. not 'Justice League' (2017)). Other supervillain origin stories have followed different well-trodden paths: 'Venom' (2018) is the usual mostly-bloodless and CGI-intoxicated light treatment, as most successfully branded by the MCU; 'Split' (2016) and 'Brightburn' (2019) are part of the horror genre; and 'Suicide Squad' (2016) is garbage. It's all been done before. The novelty of 'Joker,' then, is that it doesn't feature the usual dual narrative (also common of musicals such as the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film 'Shall We Dance' (1937) that Arthur Fleck watches on TV in one scene) of superhero and supervillain, although a young Bruce Wayne is an ancillary character here, or the focus on an entire team of superheroes as in the other dark comic-book features.While some commenters seem to forget the basis of 'Joker' in that respect, every critic worth their salt has mentioned--and often denounced as derivative--the picture's debt to the films of Scorsese, namely 'Taxi Driver' and 'The King of Comedy' (1983). Most films are derivative, although I suppose 'Joker' goes further with its mirroring those films' storylines and themes than, say, the general genre borrowings of the Dark Knight trilogy with film noir or 'Logan' and the Western. As in Scorsese's films, the protagonist here is a mentally-ill loner with a precarious grip on reality. Like Travis Bickle, Fleck goes on a killing spree amid a political election (in this case, Bruce Wayne's father running for Gotham mayor on the Ayn Rand plutocracy ticket). And, like Rupert Pupkin, he's an aspiring and unsuccessful stand-up comedian and avid follower of a late-night TV talk show--including, inevitably, confronting the show's host. Much has been made, justifiably, of Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which compliments nicely as a character study to the more symbolic role, of a Joker without origins, inhabited by Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight' (2008). Perhaps, not enough has been said, however, of the perfect casting here of Robert De Niro. Obviously, the Joker can and has been portrayed well by different actors (and not so well by still others), but the part of Murray Franklin, the talk-show host, wouldn't work with anyone besides De Niro. The homage to the Scorsese films and De Niro's parts in them as Bickle and Pupkin would be lost otherwise.'Joker' also reminds me a bit of 'Fight Club' (1999) in its 'mind-game' film-type shifts between fantasy and reality, with an inversion of the delusion over a romantic relationship. Both pictures also feature violent, populist retribution being taken upon society by mostly, if not all, white men, although 'Joker,' like most mainstream fare, is intentionally too ambiguous to pin down a coherent socio-political message. Is Thomas Wayne's labelling some people 'clowns' reminiscent of Hillary Clinton's 'deplorables' remarks? Does it recall fellow-proclaimed-billionaire Donald Trump's habits of name calling or his involvement in the so-called 'Central Park Five' case and the term of 'super-predator' employed in the 1990s? Does it matter? The Joker even insists that he has no political views--right before he begins a diatribe on those very views. He's an agent of anarchy and chaos, as was Ledger's iteration. His killing spree is born of self-defence and expands to filling the void in his life left by no romantic love, no friends, lack of social services and medical attention, professional setbacks, mommy issues and daddy issues, repeated abuses, and his socially-stigmatizing involuntary laughter.Stylistically, 'Joker' seems derivative, too, in the gritty look of a mid-budget arthouse production and shaky camera focus on the disturbed head of its protagonist. The Gotham here is decidedly a reflection of 1970s-1980s New York. I'm more interested in the cinematic self-reflexivity, though. The frequent shots of Joker looking in mirrors reinforces the character's psychology, but mirrors may also be considered as analogues to motion pictures, which likewise captures images and reflects them back to us. Ditto the fantasy-reality dichotomy in a movie that aims for realism in the superhero genre dominated by fantasy--and within an art form that already is arguably both objective recorder of reality and instrument of illusion making. The mirror motif is especially apt for a movie that conspicuously imitates other movies and which features films-within-the-film. Besides the Astaire-Rogers musical, the Joker's dancing also reflects back upon Charlie Chaplin's silent masterpiece of the Great Depression, 'Modern Times' (1936)--specifically, the roller-skating sequence. It's ironic, too, that while Joker sneaks into the theatre, in the guise of an employee, the wealthy Waynes sit in prized seats for the Tramp's, the most famous clown of the silent era, comedic social commentary on economic inequality. The other apt film reference here is one that has apparently been around in Batman lore for a while now, which is to Zorro films. Douglas Fairbanks basically became the first film superhero when he put on the mask and began swashbuckling in 'The Mark of Zorro' (1920). For the early '80s setting of 'Joker,' the showing the Wayne family exits on that fateful night this time is 'Zorro, The Gay Blade' (1981).To top if off, this is the most performative Joker yet. He's always been disguised as a clown, which suggest performance, but here he's employed as one. Moreover, he aims to be a stand-up comedian, and he appears as a talk-show guest on TV after spending most of the movie as mere spectator to the boob tube. His killing of three yuppies also inspires others to wear clown masks and, eventually, to make performance art into a riot. Sure, 'Joker' is disturbingly violent art, but art nonetheless.",8,1,3,10 October 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Unfaithful
","Claiming this to be 'Bram Stoker's Dracula,' a faithful adaptation of the novel, director Francis Ford Coppola and writer James Hart must've been banking on spectators not reading the book, because Bram Stoker's Dracula it's not. Although the gall of such claims is insulting, unfaithfulness to the book isn't necessarily problematic. Having seen a bunch of Dracula movies since reading the novel, I'd probably agree with others that the 1977 TV-movie 'Count Dracula' is the most 'faithful' screen adaptation; it's also not especially good. Far better to interpret one or a few major themes, or to create your own, than to slavishly render another story's details. That said, Coppola's 'Dracula' does include many of Stoker's details, as well as material from prior Dracula films and even adds a few things itself, but its main concept or reinterpretation of the story is stupid. They made the Gothic horror novel into a reincarnation romance, and even that is unoriginal (it's lifted from the 1974 TV movie of the same name). Nevertheless, the excessive style and sometimes-brisk pacing helps adapt and update the long-winded Victorian-age novel to postmodern cinema. It also brings the story's sex to the forefront, and the inclusion of the invention of film is apt.In the novel, Van Helsing only briefly suggests that Dracula could be the historical Vlad the Impaler, and Stoker was only partially inspired by the historical figure--not even researching him enough to locate Dracula in his real country of Wallachia instead of Transylvania. Never mind, movies like this one have blown this connection up beyond any resemblance to Stoker's fiction or Vlad's historicity. Here, Vlad's fictional wife is tricked into suicide, and Vlad renounces God in an outlandish scene of sacrilege, which says more about the filmmakers turning away from the faith in Stoker's book than it does about the character of Dracula. In the rest of the film, after all, crucifixes are easily dispensed with by the vampires, and only Van Helsing makes a few passing references to the holy war that consumed Stoker's verbiage. Fair enough, this is hardly the first irreligious Dracula movie.Gary Oldman's Transylvanian Count, with wig and playful shadow, is ripe for parody, and, indeed, he inspires some of the best gags in Mel Brooks's 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It' (1995). The make-up and visual-effects crews did a bang-up job with the gross-out views of a weird, non-Stoker variety of Dracula's transformations: from ancient undead, to cocoon state, to sex-crazed werewolf, to plain-ole wolf, to ugly melting-face crybaby, to giant batman, to rats. The very-non-Stoker, good-looking Dracula is different. He's not sociable enough to be in the Bela Lugosi suave-vampire tradition; he's more of a flaneur or dandy type, with the top hat and sunglasses, lurking about crowds and being a force of surveillance. Oldman mumbles and slurs his lines ('the children of the night' one was particularly flubbed), but, at least, he seems to have attempted an accent, which is more than can be said of the rest of the cast. For a story mostly set in England, its most-prominent British stars (Oldman and Anthony Hopkins) play the leading foreigners, while two North Americans (Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves) play the lead English characters. At this rate, they should've got a Continental European to play the Texan Quincy. And musician Tom Waits must be a reference to the film's music-video stylization; otherwise, his Renfield is pointless, and his metal gloves and the box-cage helmets for the asylum guards are just bizarre.While Dracula is ruined by turning into a sympathetic, reluctant, lovesick crybaby of a vampire, Van Helsing is made more fun this time by turning more devilish. He's a 'sick old buzzard,' as Quincy quips, after he humps Quincy's leg while remaking on the late Lucy's wantonness. For Mina, Van Helsing eyeballs her up and down, sniffs her and forces her to dance with him upon first meeting; later, he's eager to have sex with her before the vampirism gets in the way. I'm all for this interpretation of the Dutch doctor. His lecture in his first scene on syphilis also exposes the vampirism-as-venereal-disease subtext of Stoker's tale and casts this adaptation as a sexual struggle, in addition to the regrettable reincarnation romance.Lucy's the whore; Mina's the Madonna--at least in Dracula's eyes. For all its sex, like most Dracula movies, this one is more regressive in its depiction of women than Stoker's 19th-Century novel. Whereas Mina was the primary hero for Stoker and his surrogate storyteller--compiling the diary entries, journals, letters, etc., that comprised the book's epistolary structure--, here, she spies for the vampire (same thing happened in the sexist 1979 'Dracula'). In one of the vestigial devices carried over from the book's narration to this film, the last journal voiceover is that of Jonathan, not Mina. Meanwhile, Mina's struggle with unfaithfulness is summarized in her horrendous love scene with Drac, where she hits him for murdering Lucy, which, then, cuts to Van Helsing and the boys burning stuff, before cutting back to Mina now, laughably, pawing Drac and begging him to do her.That they display the early-cinema show complete with stag films, a train film on a loop, battle-scene puppetry and a poster for a passion play picture also speaks to the film's incongruity. Ditto the early-cinema-styled shot earlier, which renders people's movements overly jerky. Oddly, Dracula is the one who praises the science of cinema, whereas Mina mocks it. This figures with the rest of the filmmakers' mishandling of Stoker's novel. Stoker's ancient Dracula was defeated because the humans used then-new technologies, including blood transfusions and trains, which this film keeps, and Mina's typewriter, which is just a prop here. Adding cinema to the list of new technologies was apt, especially for a screen adaptation, but making it the province of a shades-wearing vamp is to misunderstand the source.Stylistically, this Dracula is all over the place, too, but, at least, the pure excess, the sometimes-frenzied cutting and swinging camerawork keep the pacing brisk, as though the filmmakers themselves ingested some of Dracula's absinthe or Seward's morphine. I prefer it to the romance, which tends to grind the plot to a halt. Take the ending, where we must endure strung-out testaments of love between Mina and the dying Dracula. 'Our love is stronger than death,' Mina bellows, as I barf. Seriously, why must so many Hollywood movies reduce everything to their infantile notions of love?(Mirror Note: Dracula's non-reflection in Harker's shaving mirror is standard, but his lack of one from a storefront window, as he stalks Mina, is a rare touch of subtlety.)",6,2,3,26 June 2018
Parasite," Geography Classes
","A lot has been made of the social commentary, the message, of 'Parasite,' but I think the picture is effective because the message is not overly blunt and because the structure--largely geographical--supporting it is congruent. Plus, it's unpredictable genre-mixing entertainment otherwise. That's not to say the social commentary isn't obvious, though, and rather nihilistic. There's ambiguity and complications as to which characters are the 'parasites.' While one suspects that our sympathies are supposed to be with the lower-class Kim family, they are the ones conning the upper-class Parks. In one sequence, to deter detection, they even hide, crawl and slither about like the insects that infest their own home. But, then, the Parks often come across as a vacuous family of privilege who tend to hold their employees in contempt. In effect, they're all parasites--even the former workers that the Kims replace by tricking the Parks into firing them. Every major character tries to exploit or debase others in some way or another. The Kims get others fired, forge their own qualifications and take advantage of the Parks' trust. Conversely, the Park parents mock the smell of Kim Ki-taek, and they pretend to be slumming it for sex roleplay. Their daughter is more interested in her tutor as a boyfriend instead of as hired help, and even the young son misinterprets a cry for help in Morse code and is a fan for the cultural appropriation of Native Americans.The only other Bong Joon-ho movie that I've seen thus far, 'Snowpiercer' (2013) is more heavy-handed in its depiction of class. In it, the rich exploit the poor; it's as straightforward as the continuously-running train. 'Parasite' is more steeply layered. The upstairs-downstairs class stratification is reflected in Seoul's geography. The Kims live in a semi-basement in a crowded urban area. We only ever see them arrive home by descending stairs, whereas they ascend them to work for the Parks in their luxurious suburban estate with a backyard. While it rains at the Park's home, that of the Kims is also flooded by sewage, including feces raining on them from the toilet. A drunk urinates outside their window and even tries to literally piss on them at one point. Others of poverty turn out to inhabit spaces even lower--in a hidden bomb shelter below another flight of stairs. This further references the larger line of demarcation separating North and South Korea, which itself mirrors Mr. Park's condemnation of 'crossing the line.' Even the hope of upward mobility is represented in the landscape--by a stone.Besides reflecting the message, all of this geography also serves the narrative. What begins as a black comedy and con-artist film, with actors playing actors, turns into a mix of suspense thriller and old-dark-house horror beginning with one stormy night. Characteristic of the haunted-house subgenre, there's already the aforementioned secret bunker, and there's also a ghostly, mysterious assailant (and the figure of the youngest Park's supposed trauma reflected in his artwork). There's even fantasy in the Kims' son's dream of upward mobility and a grand guignol finale. It's also a well-composed picture, with an exciting score and amusing performances. And, to top off this multi-layered message movie, there's the Morse-code messaging. Messages inside a message... genres upon genres, actors within actors, characters within characters, haves among the have-nots--all underlined geographically.",9,3,7,11 December 2019
Halloween," The Beat of the Stalker's Gaze
","Even for one who isn't a fan of the slasher sub-genre, I appreciate something as well made as this progenitor, 'Halloween.' Director, co-writer and scorer John Carpenter and team pay homage to some of the right horror films to precede it, too, including playing 'The Thing from Another World' (1951), which Carpenter would remake a few years later, and 'Forbidden Planet' (1956) on the TVs--two other monster movies of seemingly unstoppable evil creatures. Moreover, there's the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis in the central role (even though the doctor standing in for the detective part receives top billing), the daughter of Janet Leigh, the star of 'Psycho' (1960), which is often cited as the first slasher film. Like Bernard Herrmann's score for 'Psycho,' Carpenter's one here has become one of the most iconic in horror film--or even general cinematic--history, and it's largely responsible for much of the picture's tension--beginning as the screen is black, even before the picture appears on screen.The role of the camera in conjunction with the monstrous Michael Myers is remarkable, too. Usually in film studies classes when the 'male gaze' is discussed, including in Laura Mulvey's seminal essay 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,' it's illustrated by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, although probably most often with 'Rear Window' (1954) and 'Vertigo' (1958), but 'Psycho' would work about as well with the peeping-Tom antics of Norman Bates and, perhaps, 'Halloween' would be even better. Cinema is a voyeuristic art form, primarily concerned with the spectator's gaze upon its visuals, which consequently rely for their effect on the spectator's identification with the surrogate gaze of the camera, which in turn may be identified with the gaze of a certain character--in this case, mostly with the knife-wielding serial killer, Myers. Indeed, he's merely acting out what we voyeuristically came to the film to see: him terrifying and killing people. In the opening scene, the camera and the eyes of Myers are one in the form of an extended point-of-view shot. From there, he continues to stalk his prey--sharing with us the pleasure of watching them. Meanwhile, his face is mostly covered by a mask, which like the spectator, prevents the gaze of other characters upon him and, likewise, us.Mulvey and her followers get into a lot of Freudian psychobabble, but there's undeniably a psycho-sexual element to the gaze of Myers. There's the by-now cliché plot of his killing promiscuous, mostly female teens--all of which seems to stem back to his simultaneous incestuous desire for and repulsion of his sister. I'm sure any Freudian would also say that the knife is a phallic object, penetrating the victims. Then, there's the virginal heroine, with the story spending quite a bit of time on establishing this fact, who, nonetheless, seems to be paying for the sins of her mother's character in 'Psycho.' More interesting than that, though, methinks, is the playing around with the thrill of voyeurism, via the gaze of Myers, while also experiencing the unease of being gazed upon, which is mostly associated with the Laurie character played by Curtis. One effect to come from these switches from identification with Michael to that of Laurie is the jump scare. If little else, subsequent slasher filmmakers grasped the effectiveness of this trick and, perhaps, too much so. But, it's effective here because it occupies that space between the pleasure and horror of the gaze, all of which is underscored by the terrific beat.",9,2,3,31 October 2018
Marriage Story," Cinema as Theatre; Theatre as Life
","There are a couple potential problems with making such semi-autobiographical, personal pictures as Noah Baumbach does. One, you probably either need to relate to or be intrigued by the familial squabbling of such middle-to-upper-class New York artists and intellectuals, pretentious or otherwise. Having seen a few of his movies now, from one Baumbach episode to the next, I've found that it gets tiresome fast. Second and encompassing the first hindrance is the underlying philosophy of art as simply being a reflection of one's life. An obvious antecedent for this writer-director is Woody Allen, but say what you will about Allen, artistically his oeuvre isn't that rudimentary. Consequently, perhaps, there's no substantial distinction made in Baumbach's outlook between cinema and theatre (that is, besides the either hypocritical or self-deprecating snootiness within the movie)--both are for Baumbach to play life on a stage, including this second installment, after 'The Squid and the Whale' (2005), in his intimately cathartic stories of divorce. 'Marriage Story' is likely his best picture yet, though, because of how it integrates storytelling in life, plays and movies. While the actual story here is about divorce, the structure is about the union of those three stages of narratives; it's a marriage story, after all.Indeed, as the couple's attorneys outline, their divorce battle is over the construction of the narrative. Are they a New York family or a Los Angeles one? Is the theme that he's a philanderer or that she's a lush, he a liar who trapped her in the Big Apple or she a felonious hacker who tricked him into allowing her an upperhand in the custody case over their son? In a relatively even-handed manner, the plot serves both narratives with a dual focus alternating between the perspective of the husband-father (Adam Driver) and that of the wife-mother (Scarlett Johansson). He begins as a director, casting her as the actress in his life, but her move to Hollywood includes her branching into directing, as well, both motion pictures and her life. Legally, meanwhile, the expensive lawyers form the couples' perspectives to be enacted, including on the courtroom stage.While this divorce proceeds, these protagonists introduced as theatrical people, him a director and her an actress, are pulled from (off) Broadway to Hollywood. Aesthetically, there were already indications of this in their ridiculous-looking play, as it included recorded moving images of her beside the actress in the flesh. It's a multimedia performance, which in the larger scheme is a play-within-a-play and a movie-within-the-movie that we're watching. A brief search of Baumbach's biography will suffice to point out the obvious parallels here with his life. Like the male lead, he married an actress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose big break in Hollywood was a role in a raunchy teen comedy ('Fast Times at Ridgemont High' (1982)). Both couples, then, had a child and divorced. Baumbach similarly fictionalized his parents' breakup in 'The Squid and the Whale.'Unfortunately, however, it's not cinema and theatre that divorce in the picture. For the most part, the acting and writing are engaging enough, but some of the blocking and monologues are as conspicuously stagy as Johansson being carried in the play-within-the-play. The long, steady framings and fades to black compound this. Driver's song at the end was ineffective for me because of its theatricality. Likewise, Johansson's first speech to her attorney, what with her walking around while pontificating, came off as especially affected (it works somewhat better when Alan Alda basically does the same thing later in his first scene with Driver). On the other hand, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta are impressive at getting to the point of the story when it's their turn to tell it. The fawning letters the protagonists write of each other that frames the movie's narrative overall is effective, as well. Regardless, it's not the story or the characters here that interest me, let alone how it reflects life and issues of divorce; it's the structure that matters. The case is built and won or lost based on who is directing and how the narrative is constructed.",7,0,3,10 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Springtime for Hitler
","'Jojo Rabbit' follows in the rich tradition of making buffoons out of Hitler and Nazis, from Charlie Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' (1940), Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be or Not to Be (1942) and Mel Brooks's 'The Producers' (1967). And, from the start, it's a hilarious successor to those films. The opening credits roll over a montage ludicrously equating Hitler with the Beatles. Beyond the jokes, however, is where I find the picture falters. While some critics appear to fret over the definition of 'satire' and beg for a lecture that readily applies to today's politics, all of that is rather irrelevant to Taika Waititi's actual movie. Today, we're far removed from WWII; it's no longer the present of Chaplin and Lubitsch's films or part of mainstream living memory as with Brooks. The historical horrors of Nazi Germany are conspicuously absent from 'Jojo Rabbit'--reduced to and rendered mostly by hangings in a town square. Meanwhile, the ground has been softened for a cartoonish Hitler and Nazis recently by re-subtitled videos on YouTube of a scene from 'Downfall' (2004) or a movie such as 'Look Who's Back,' (2015) featuring a Hitler interacting with modern Germans, as well as by everything from 'Hogan's Heroes' to those finer films by Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks. There's hardly anything enlightening or subversive about the humor here, but it's the picture's inevitable sentimentality and derivative style that are the bigger shortcomings.I've only seen two of his movies thus far, but it's striking how much Waititi rips off from others' movies. His MCU entry, 'Thor: Ragnarok' (2017) stylistically plays like the third installment to the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' series, what with the goofball posing to popular music, not to mention the teaming up of misfit prisoners, violent family dynamics and threat of planetary destruction. Now, in this Chaplin-Lubitsch-Brooks-esque black comedy, or satire, or what have you, he lifts the look and sound of Wes Anderson's pictures. Others have aptly compared the Hitler Youth bits and coming-of-age story here to 'Moonrise Kingdom' (2012), but with war-mongering white supremacists. Moreover, actors play cute, are framed centrally for cuts back and fourth or are otherwise symmetrically lined up for the camera, bright colors pop, the mood veers wildly between comedic excess and sentimentality, all underscored, again, by popular music, from the Beatles onward. Ironically, Anderson's own picture to be set in the era of WWII, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' (2014), is an exception musically among his oeuvre. Both directors even include some good cigarette jokes. Jojo's imaginary friend Hitler repeatedly offering the boy a smoke might be the funniest bit regarding cancer sticks that I recall since Bill Murray would suck on up to two of them at a time in 'Rushmore' (1998).Never mind that the real Hitler was the original former smoker turned anti-smoking Nazi. Or that Hitler's vegetarianism is ignored here in favor of his imaginary version feasting on unicorn heads, or that much of Waititi's interpretation of him revolves around anachronisms. This is historical revisionism to the point of pop-culture memes. The bigoted boy scout, Jojo's other secret friend besides silly fÃ¼hrer is, as a Jewish girl living in his attic, helping him to compose a book (in this case, one full of anti-Semitic tropes), a simplistic variation on Anne Frank. There's also the business of dance standing in for freedom here. It pales in comparison to the artistic reflexivity that lifted the works of Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks. Chaplin exploited the duality inherent in cinema and the dramedy of humor and horror of his scenario by playing dual roles. Lubitsch did likewise with the play-within-play structure, of actors playing actors. Ditto Brooks. All included sham Hitlers. Waititi's Hitler, on the other hand, is simply imaginary--reflecting the ideology Jojo has absorbed from the culture and propaganda of Nazi Germany. Minus the bigotry of it all, it's not unlike what Waititi has done in his cinematic copycatting. And, in the end, all we get is a trite moral from the boy's budding friendship with the girl in his attic, to not hate... and dance, or something.Regardless, I still enjoyed 'Jojo Rabbit.' The comedy is naturally not as edgy as when Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks made Nazis the butt of jokes, but even when the humor here is juvenile, it tends to be enough over-the-top to remain fun. Scarlett Johansson is especially a delight in her Oscar-nominated role--perhaps, particularly because hers is the only character that seems to acknowledge the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich, although she, too, frolics about in the spring with her son, Jojo. Newcomer Roman Griffith Davis, as Jojo, is impressive, besides also looking convincingly like he could be related to Johansson. The rest of the cast is serviceable, including Sam Rockwell reprising his Oscar-winning violent racist who performs a redemptive act of kindness for another from 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' (2017). If the characters here weren't mostly reused caricatures, though, and if Jojo running around when the war finally does reach his sleepy village didn't resemble Corporal Upham hiding throughout a recycled set from 'Saving Private Ryan' (1999), if Waititi didn't crib so much from Anderson and others in general and resort to a predictably sugary denouement, I wouldn't be ambivalent in my enjoyment.",7,1,1,29 February 2020
Apollo 13," Everything Goes Right
","This is probably Ron Howard's best film, which although that isn't saying much coming from me (not a fan), 'Apollo 13' is exceptional in its mission focus and sustaining the tension through the slew of problems with the historical voyage to the Moon. In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, I've been viewing a bunch of lunar and space-related pictures lately, and it's become quite apparent that making the most awe-inspiring and challenging feats people have ever accomplished into sustained movie thrills is not an easy task for many filmmakers. 'Marooned' (1969) is an obvious precedent in this case. In fact, there's a nightmare scene here that is said to be based on Marilyn Lovell's real nightmare after having seen 'Marooned.' While the real disaster is that film itself, it's understandable that the disturbance of it would linger for an astronaut's wife. 'Marooned' is a thoroughly inhumane and mechanical exercise where a NASA chief played by an unsympathetic Gregory Peck hardly cares for the lives of helpless astronauts stranded in space. To him and the picture in general, those men floating in a tin can are nothing more than a math problem that he's forced to try to solve because the President of the United States ordered him to; otherwise, his first instinct is that it's not worth it and to give up.'Apollo 13' is still a series of mathematical and mechanical problems to be solved, but the astronauts are active participants in it, and most of the people at NASA actually care about getting them home. More than the famous line, 'Houston, we have a problem,' much of the runtime involves continual communication and teamwork between the men in the sky and those on the ground. Whereas 'Marooned' divorced the spectator from caring about the astronauts, either, by spending the first part of the film treating them as test subjects for seemingly how nuts they could make them with a long stay in space; 'Apollo 13' invests in making their pilots likable. Part of this is just casting proven, well-liked stars: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise. At Mission Control, they put in charge Ed Harris, the guy who played John Glenn in the most-respected prior NASA-related film to that date, 'The Right Stuff' (1983). So good so far, but Howard also spends the early part developing the domestic relationships of the Lovell family, which pays off when the film repeatedly returns to the family at home watching the drama in space unfold on TV. Compare that to the lack of dramatic connection of the conversations between the astronauts and their wives in 'Marooned.' The audience hadn't invested in those relationships or characters, so they didn't care. Here, anyone who knows a bit about recent history knows exactly how the story ends, but it matters because those characters and relationships have been built in the film.It also helps that the visual effects here hold up well nearly 25 years later, while the blatant matte work of 'Marooned' only compound its problems of a picture divorced from its characters. Many shots in 'Apollo 13' were even shot in actual zero gravity. Thus, it's simultaneously a more dramatic and more realistic film. Unfortunately, when Howard was entirely untethered from the real world and offered a space picture based on a mythical cosmos with 'Star Wars,' it bombed. 'Marooned,' 'Solo' (2018) and a host of other movies: those are disasters. 'Apollo 13' is a triumph.",8,1,3,22 July 2019
Green Book," Driving Miss Daisy 2: In Reverse
","After 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989), 'Dances with Wolves' (1990), 'Forrest Gump' (1994), 'Crash' (2004) and, now, 'Green Book,' I guess Hollywood is just going to continue patting themselves on the back for not being racists because they honor pictures where stupid white protagonists are taught to respect racial others as human beings. As opposed to the infamous failure to nominate a racially more challenging and sophisticated picture such as 'Do the Right Thing' (1989) for Best Picture the year 'Driving Miss Daisy' won it, this time, they gave Spike Lee an Oscar, too, for 'BlacKkKlansman' (2018), a film that I think has its own faults, but, at least, it's not simply a message picture of 'racism is bad, but look how far we've come' for the dumb and dumber. And, at least, there's some cinematic flair to Lee's film, as opposed to this modest improvement upon a filmed play such as 'Driving Miss Daisy.'In quite a few ways, 'Green Book' is a modest improvement upon 'Driving Miss Daisy' in that it largely tells a similar story in a similar way without itself coming off as quite hypocritically racist. It's about the least one should expect after 30 years of cinematic and social changes--or lack thereof. In it, another white person who also faces some prejudices against them (in this case, for being an Italian American; in Miss Daisy's case, for being Jewish), and again from that white person's perspective, travels by car with an African American through the Jim Crow South. (Both movies even privilege their 'home' turf, as it were, as not as racist as other places. In 'Driving Miss Daisy,' Atlanta somehow came off as not nearly as segregated as Alabama, and in 'Green Book,' the two are welcomed home to New York by a friendly police officer in contrast with the backwater cops they meet on the way to Birmingham.) They bond, and through their experiences with their black friend, the white protagonists stop being racist. But, this time, the white person is driving, and the black man sits in the backseat!To be fair, Mahershala Ali's Don Shirley is not entirely, or at least not atrociously as much so, the Magical Negro trope that Morgan Freeman's Hoke is in 'Driving Miss Daisy.' The historically-based character of Shirley has a life outside of helping the white protagonist with their character arc, which the movie addresses, if only almost entirely through the lens of the white protagonist and ultimately how it affects him. In a way, it's a traditional sidelong-glance biopic, where the life of the more interesting figure (Shirley) is seen through the point of view of a more common folk (Viggo Mortensen's Tony), as a surrogate for the spectator, for one assumes because that's how the storytellers see us spectators. Additionally, Shirley is not the white writer's fantasy of a subservient African American that is Hoke. Moreover, Miss Daisy's conversion is rather unconvincing, but 'Green Book' leaves little doubt that Tony has transformed. Ali and Mortensen are good actors, too, which helps. Clearly, they were dedicated to their characters (most conspicuously by Mortensen gaining 45 pounds for the role).Nevertheless, a movie that's written and directed by and mostly made by white people, through the perspective of a white character, as a surrogate for an intended white audience, to feel good that they, too, have overcome historical racism doesn't really cut it as authentically anti-racist. This comforting, hand-holding seminar from a narrow view of a vast and historical problem, another whitewashed picture about prejudices against racial others won't transform anyone.",4,8,12,23 March 2019
Da 5 Bloods," History Now
","'Da 5 Bloods' is unmistakably a Spike Lee joint, but what is with Netflix and macho action movies set in a war-torn foreign land and featuring a heist or extraction of some kind. I mean, they comprise a significant block of their original releases of late and usually include a star taking a break from superhero flicks: '6 Underground' with Deadpool, 'Triple Frontier' with Batman, 'The Red Sea Diving Resort' with Captain America, all 2019, 'Extraction' with Thor earlier this year and, now, here's Black Panther in Vietnam where his friends, fellow veterans and 'bloods' are in search of gold to plunder. Oh well, credit to Lee and company for making a better movie than those prior ones. Unlike the others, 'Da 5 Bloods' doesn't have the feel of merely exploiting an exotic locale and racial others, as it largely focuses on the Black veterans detestation of having fought in a war supposedly for freedom while lacking freedom back home, while a couple of the younger characters speak of choosing careers to assuage their guilt for their respective privileges. Moreover, there's a glimpse of modernized streets in Ho Chi Minh City, McDonald's and an 'Apocalypse Now' themed club included, before the brothers in arms proceed into the jungle, with more than token representation throughout of Vietnamese characters, including interracial relationships, as well as of the French, the first Western colonizer of Indochina. Yet, evidence remains that this scenario was originally a predictable action-heist screenplay (the way one character conspicuously walks backwards in one scene--telegraphing what's about to happen especially bothers me) before Lee and company rewrote it for Black protagonists and introduced some rather unpredictable social commentary.Indeed, Lee's racial didacticism is all over the place, ranging from Crispus Attucks to Martin Luther King Jr. and the present-day Black Lives Matter movement and the inclusion of a MAGA-hat-wearing, Trump-supporting member of the Bloods, but this scattered approach is somewhat supported by the premise of the characters revisiting their pasts, as well as by the historically-minded ones played by Chadwick Boseman and Jonathan Majors. As with much of Lee's oeuvre, as well as that of others, I'm less interested in simplistic lectures than in how such morals are supported stylistically. To my mind, such was the redeeming feature of Lee's last joint, 'BlacKkKlansmen' (2018), which I found more interesting as a conflict between racist epics 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915) with 'Gone with the Wind' (1939) against the Blaxploitation flicks of the 1970s, from which Lee paid homage with his film's style, than for any historical racial conflict or commentary on the Trump administration.Something similar is done with the look of 'Da 5 Bloods' sometimes resembling that of footage from the era of the American-Vietnam War, with images at times consequently appearing soft or colors overly saturated. Characters also use their own 8mm motion-picture and a still-photography cameras. Apropos to its subject matter, then, the style, from 8mm, to 16mm, to 35mm and still photographs, is all over the place, as are the shifting aspect ratios. Rather incongruent, however, is that the same actors play their younger selves without the sort of de-aging technology employed for Netflix's 'The Irishman' (2019), although I don't much mind this otherwise if one understands the flashbacks as past episodes as remembered as opposed to being from the perspective of a hypothetical objective observer. Of course, there are also the usual Lee trademarks of raving monologues and double dolly shots (as well as the relatively new addition of casting Isiah Whitlock, Jr. to recite his catchphrase from 'The Wire' HBO series). Meanwhile, the greater cinematic relfexivity of 'BlackKklansmen' is replaced here in part by music and radio, with a Marvin Gaye-infused soundtrack and stinging radio propaganda from Hanoi Hannah (Veronica Ngo). While some critics will be concerned with how Lee captures some current zeitgeist, especially given the film's release during the protests currently taking place across the nation and the world as of this writing, ultimately more interesting methinks is whether this historically-minded film, as with his past work, will stand the test of time.",5,3,9,13 June 2020
Annihilation," Tarkovsky-esque
","As others have pointed out, 'Annihilation' bares striking similarities to the films of Andrei Tarkovsky, such as 'Solaris' (1972) and 'Stalker' (1979). For a picture about an alien 'shimmer' that works as a prism refracting and recreating already established sources, that's rather appropriate. Moreover, the prominent placement in the narrative of video cameras and doppelgÃ¤ngers reinforces this reflexivity--a movie about creation, about movies. Too bad the rest of the narrative, its framing, the psychological problems of the characters and the time-shifting plot is bland. Following a title card introducing 'the shimmer' with a scene of extramarital sex was an especially unfortunate choice. And that's in addition to the unrealistic nature of medical professionals and scientists who don't don gloves to collect samples, let alone hazmat suites to enter a known contaminated area, playing soldiers with automatic rifles that only one of them seems familiar shooting with. The CGI environment looks pleasant enough, though.'Annihilation' has taken on added resonance today, as of this writing, due to the real-world pandemic. The shimmer here is initially treated as potentially radioactive or as a sort of virus, as it slowly moves to cover and contaminate more and more of the world. Such a picture of shared, interchanged DNA, including the particularly horrifying melding together of a bear-like creature with their prey, has become especially relevant in a real world where quarantines, social distancing and personal protective equipment is being widely used to prevent real viral interconnection.",6,0,0,27 May 2020
Moon," Sutured Lunacy
","'Moon' is a clever piece of duplicitous self-reflexive filmmaking. It's less overt in its reference to its own artificial construction than director Duncan Jones's subsequent 'Source Code' (2011), for which the repeated narrative is revealed rather early to be an artificial simulation. It takes 'Moon' longer to unfold, as the cloned doubles discover the extent of their artificial making. Of course, on the surface, this poses as a science-fiction examination on the meaning of reality and being human, but there's a deeper introspection going on here for one who desires, as the Sam Bells here inevitably do, to look beyond that fake existence and to explore how we as the spectator are similarly sutured into the duplicity inherent in cinema.Although not taking place on an imaginary train as in 'Source Code,' the lunar surface here serves about as well of a purpose for most--we know it exists, but we'll never go there. Thus having transported us to this as-good-as-imaginary artificial place, the picture sets about gradually exposing the fraud to Bell and us. Notice that Bell's first clues of the fraud are cinematic--part of a video from his wife is blatantly edited out and another clip of his double appears seemingly by glitch--read: edited--into his own video. It's as though the filmmakers are intentionally calling attention to what film theory describes as 'suture,' a word employed so as to speculate on how the spectator supposedly suspends disbelief in viewing something as utterly unbelievable as motion pictures. A movie is otherwise seemingly disrupted by the artificiality of editing--with jarring changes in camera perspectives, locations and time; techniques such as those of continuity editing suture those wounds. And, I wonder whether the filmmakers didn't intentionally include physical wounds for Bell, such as the business with his hand, to make a visual pun from this.There are also the usual techniques, such as the shot/reverse shot scheme and POV shots, that associate the camera's look with that of the character, which leads the spectator to identify with the character. In effect, we're sutured into the picture. We are the Sam Bells. We're doubled, and they're our doppelgÃ¤ngers--making the scenes of Sam Rockwell's doubled exposure all the more uncanny. That Bell is manufactured in mass to assist an industrialized mechanical process may otherwise signify that he's similar to the basic filmmaking process of copying and the reproduced distribution of the products--in other words, Bells as movies--may be a comment of conflation on the role of cinema in our lives. In control of, or otherwise behind, these movies is Lunar Industries. Indeed, 'Moon' begins with their commercial. The effect of these movies are so pervasive that they enter our minds and dreams. Bell repeatedly awakes with only stitched-together memories supported by photographic (or, more precisely, digital) evidence and is continually pestered by fragmented dreams. Fortunately, 'Moon' includes filmmakers in the form of the surrogate GERTY robot that cares enough to support us in this journey--to deconstruct and unsuture ourselves--and to eventually launch us back to Earth.",9,0,0,24 July 2019
The Runaways," This Movie Rocks
","'The Runaways,' a biopic of the titular teenage girl rock band, may not be a particularly revelatory or substantial film, but, c'mon, neither is the music; it is, however, constructed in such a way that I think better mimics the flow and style of popular music than in other such tuneful biographies. It's a rousing good picture and sound to view and listen to throughout. Doubtless, it helps if you like the music, but the cinematography and montage is as saliently hectic and roaring--even sensitive subject matter such as sexualizing minors, taking financial advantage of them, or drug abuse aren't dawdled upon for melodramatic points. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll. I'll take this over, say, the more recent 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018) or 'Rocketman' (2019), with their pretensions to something more.Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart do well in the leads, too, and Michael Shannon is again entertaining in a role that calls for some showy acting. I've never yet seen any of the 'Twilight' movies in their entirety, and I'll probably be OK if I never do, but I've been impressed with the work of some of the series' actors in other movies. I recently saw future-Batman Robert Pattinson in 'The Lighthouse' (2019), and besides playing cool here, Stewart has earned acclaim elsewhere, including for 'Clouds of Sils Maria' (2014). I haven't seen as much of Fanning, but I liked 'Coraline' (2009) and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). I suppose my point is that it's nice to see youths, like Joan Jett and other members of the Runaways, succeed in showbiz beyond the initial kiddie craze that launched them to stardom.",7,0,1,7 February 2020
Warm Bodies," Romeo and Juliet and Zombies
","Although an adaptation of a novel, 'Warm Bodies,' the book and the movie, are clearly a reworking of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet.' 'Julie' is short for Juliet, and 'R' is for Romeo. Julie and R... are star-crossed lovers, and the feuding corpses and the living are the Montagues and Capulets. This all becomes exceedingly blatant in the balcony scene. Modern rom-coms, however, lack the heart, brains or guts for tragic romance, let alone iambic pentameter, and so we get skeletons, too, and a different ending. Instead of poetry, popular music. The awkward teenage yearning is still there, though. Dreams and monologues, too.I'm surprised to see that some commenters are surprised that they enjoyed this at all. 'Romeo and Juliet' has been revered for over 400 years, and 'Warm Bodies' is 'Romeo and Juliet'--albeit watered-down in its transmutation to the modern rom-com and zombie genres. But, yeah, cribbing Shakespeare works to an extent, because some of it's still as good as Shakespeare. It's just a rather, if you'll excuse me or not, undead version of the bard--grunting more than literate, not original but exhumed. There's a reason the zombie is the protagonist and narrator (other than traditional sexism); it's because this romance doesn't invent culture--doesn't breath life into it--it collects and hordes it: records, snow globes, even red convertibles and a lousy issue of People magazine. It consumes culture and life like zombies do flesh and brains, half-remembered and cannibalistic.",6,0,0,25 April 2020
The Wizard of Oz," Rainbow Reflections
","Oddly, the older I get, the more I enjoy 'The Wizard of Oz.' When a child, what it meant to be a friend of Dorothy was elusive. Now, I see the colorful camp within three queer men dancing over the rainbow with Judy Garland, to expose and inspire an old humbug from the closet, so that he may return the young men's kindness with the knowledge that there was never anything wrong with them in the first place. Nor in youth would I've appreciated what has to be the best ever drug reference in children's cinema, as the posse become pawns of witches, one putting them to sleep in a poppy field while the other stimulates them awake by a blizzard of cocaine. I'm sure there's a lesson in there on what happens when you leave Kansas for the Emerald City.There are manifold paths to appreciating this evergreen paragon to the Golden Age of Hollywood, but as I've recently read L. Frank Baum's book, 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,' and been reviewing a bunch of Oz movies, I'll mainly focus on aspects of adaptation. Besides the glorious transition from sepia-toned black-and-white to Technicolor, the delightful musical numbers, articulately artificial theatrical design, taut quest plotting to go along with the nested storytelling and abiding by the rule of three, memorable lines and iconic ensemble cast, what makes 'The Wizard of Oz' a cinematic marvel is its reflexivity. Very little of any of this was written by Baum, and one could argue Disney's groundbreaking long cartoon, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937), was nearly as influential to the production of this film. Regardless, it's the quintessential film that improves upon its literary source in almost every instance. Come to think of it, I may only miss the puns Baum employed for the Wizard's gifts to the gang (a sharp brain of pins and needles for the Scarecrow, a soft heart made of silk and sawdust for the Tin Man, and liquid courage, if you know what I mean, for the Cowardly Lion), as well as the surprising number of decapitations in the book (although, one may always see 'Return to Oz' (1985) to be enlivened by the removal of heads). Otherwise, despite the protestations of the likes of Michael Patrick Hearn (author of 'The Annotated Wizard of Oz'), Baum's book is not great literature. Even for prescribed children's literature, it's simplistic and generally dully composed; it's slight compared to Lewis Carroll's Alice books, and the Oz series only seems to get worse afterwards. Although, it should be noted, the book was remarkable in its day for the use of color in W.W. Denslow's illustrations, and Baum repeatedly remarked on the grayness of Kansas, but the single hues related to each country in Oz pales in comparison to the Technicolor transition on film.Additionally, the notion that Baum included an allegory regarding 19-century monetary policy (the yellow brick road representing the gold standard and Dorothy's originally silver shoes being the promise of riches of silver from the West, as taken to the land 'Oz,' as in an abbreviation for ounces of those metals) only seems plausible until actually reading the text. Macroeconomic thesis it's not. That's not to say there's no political allegory, but it's nothing that meticulous. Both the book and the film, rather, being intrinsically American and, specifically, set in the West, reflect the dominant ideology of Manifest Destiny. It's important that Dorothy comes from Kansas, part of that once-wild frontier. As soon as she lands on the eastern banks of Munchkin Country, she's killing natives. Traveling west, she meets creatures representing declining states of civilization, from cultivation (scarecrow), to woodland clearing (tin woodman) and, finally, to untamed forest (a lion), before she ultimately reaches the City upon a Hill. Albeit, from which, Dorothy is further instructed to kill another indigenous inhabitant of the land of Oz. The film even excises Baum's episode where Dorothy and company wreak havoc upon a walled village made of china, which makes the commentary on colonialism more conspicuous. The conquest of the West and the rise of American imperialism was relatively recent history for Baum's turn-of-the-century fairy tale, and so Oz was a real place, but by 1939, it had become part of the American audience's subconscious history, if you will--the American Dream.That's not enough to make 'The Wizard of Oz' a cultural touchstone, though, referenced and seen probably more frequently than any other film ever made. It's not only part of America's myth, but also a global phenomenon--the preeminent representative of the country's greatest export of soft power, the myth Hollywood told about itself. It surpasses mere literary adaptation, then, and despite theatrical appearances to the contrary (the painted backdrops, e.g.), the film is hardly just an expanded stage production, either. Besides the framing of dreams being associated with cinema, there is the remarkable exploration through doors and windows here. During the cyclone, Dorothy and Toto become surrogate spectators via the window frame of the mise-en-abyme outside: the superimposed film-within-the-film. And the tracking dolly shot through the door as Dorothy enters the Technicolor of Oz is as purely, even miraculously, cinematic as it gets. A similar, if necessarily less impressive, shot introduces Emerald City. Furthermore, there's the dichotomy of reality (framed as Kansas and our world outside film) and of fantasy and illusion (the inner land of Oz and movies). Seeing this as a political or religious allegory is to miss a deeper meaning methinks and one that is specific to the cinematic transmutation. Note that the Wizard as Professor Marvel in the outer world of Kansas truly is a humbug who cannot see anything from his crystal ball. In Oz, however, he projects a giant, menacing head with special visual effects--smoke and mirrors--besides embodying his doppelgÃ¤ngers outside his movie-palace throne room. Meanwhile, the witches employ supposedly truer magic: the good one transports herself within a bubble, or as a superimposed image over a poppy field, for all to see, and the wicked one does see images inside her crystal ball. In effect, the battle between good and evil and magic and humbuggery is fought over cinema; it's where all of their power lies. Dorothy's journey is learning to decipher the dream reflection of life she's entered--the film she's been transported to by twister's projection, so she may awake and return home to tell everyone about it, which is what I've just done, too, with this review. But it wasn't a dream; it was a place, and you and you... and you... and you were there.",10,0,0,23 January 2020
