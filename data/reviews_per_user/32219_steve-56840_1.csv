First Man," Technical Issues Interfered with the Production
","I just couldn't keep some of the technical issues explained below from interfering with my enjoyment of this film.When a cinematic feature is used sparingly, it can add immensely. In this film, sparingly wasn't part of the vocabulary.The subjective camera is fine but when used with a long lens, the motion is exaggerated. It would have been sufficient to use a camera stabilizer when filming an actor close up. There would still have been a subjective camera but more like we would see if we were actually in the camera's position.Why the extreme close ups? It was overused. What was the point? Imagine what that looks like on a 35 foot high theatre screen--totally out of proportion.When the rockets were firing into orbit, the vibration introduced by the camera/motion rig was excessive. If the vibration really were that severe, the rocket would have torn itself apart.The rocket engine noise (actually a jet engine) was dramatically enhanced to raise our excitement. I understand that. But inside the space suits, the sound was quite small due to the isolation of the space suit.Lastly, as the moon lander gets very close to the landing site, the scene shifts to a panorama shot of the the moon taken from a position of a camera on the surface. That made no sense at all. I suppose that was an editing error where that scene should have been inserted after the astronauts were on the surface.",3,2,2,15 August 2019
