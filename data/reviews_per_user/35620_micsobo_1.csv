Ali," Better than most think
","While Ali is not the greatest film to come out in 2001, it is one of the best.  The plot is very good, well thought out.  It is more a story of the times than of Ali himself it seems, for the first half at least. There are some parts where it moves a little slow, as it is a long movie, but it doesn't really detract from the overall product.  The cinematography is especially great, with the fight scenes the best of the best.  It's really too bad that more people didn't take the time to watch this movie, it is something special.",9,0,0,2 March 2002
