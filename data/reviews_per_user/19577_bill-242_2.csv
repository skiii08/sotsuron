Minority Report," great sci-fi, still hollywood
","Another great sci-fi movie from two of the masters (Spielberg + Dick). Amazing special effects, and very innovative ideas about our lives in the future. But it's got Hollywood written all over it. There is no read-between-the-lines because it's all spelled out for you. Very little is left to the imagination. We are dictated the implications, the situations, the choices, the thoughts of the characters. I guess some would say that's a good thing - the intricate plot and philosophical issues are made accessible. This is sci-fi for masses, readily digestible and coherent. I guess I prefer to be challenged more by science fiction, to do a bit of thinking of my own. But hey, what an entertaining ride.",6,0,0,12 September 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," at the edge of my seat and satisfied
","First, I made a point not to have unrealistic expectations - like wanting to 'figure it all out'. Revolutions explained some things, left others open. The open-to-interpretation dialog was clever and _very_ open to interpretation. For me, that was satisfying, because I still want to ponder the wheels within wheels, as well as the wheels coming off. That makes it fun to talk about the movie with friends, and to enjoy watching it again. (IMAX here I come!)Second, the action was just all out awesome - except, for the last fight scene. That didn't do it for me, but after the entire movie of non-stop bop, how could they possibly bang even harder? I don't care. I don't know how many times I had to retreat from the edge of my seat for a second, say 'Whoa', and then lean forward back to attention. The tension kept taut, with simultaneous action strands - it felt like a double or even triple helix of intertwined action. And the explosive firepower did not feel gratuitous to me. To me, it fed my mind with thoughts about the frailty we are in the shadow of our technology, and made my eyes wide and my heart pump with adrenaline at the same time!Overall, I admire the beauty of the science fiction, the breath-taking cinematography, the sheer mammoth effort to bring this film of only two hours to us, and to be able to deliver 3 movies in a row like this, I just have to say 'Whoa' again and look forward to their next project - not another Matrix, but another cinematic effort that'll blow us away again. Cheers, Wachowski brothers. I really enjoyed them all.",6,0,0,6 November 2003
