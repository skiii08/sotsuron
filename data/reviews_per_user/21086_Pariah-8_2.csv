The Blair Witch Project," What's the big deal?
","I saw this film and it looks like a bad student film. Boring, boring, boring. This is just a case of the Hollywood Hype machine working it's magic.The three friends I was with all walked out - they couldn't even make it through -- one fell asleep.This film did not do it for me -- okay acting, boring dialogue, badly shot, I just don't get it.",1,1,4,12 July 1999
The Mummy," A fun, popcorn film
","Why are the critics ragging? This film is just a mindless summer afternoon flick filled with smart aleck humor and good special effects.The actors are fun, the plot silly, it's a perfect film for a hot afternoon. I recommend it.",8,0,0,12 July 1999
