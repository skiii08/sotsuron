"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Mediocre disappointment, watch if it happens to be on TV
",Fun enough to watch but I have real respect for Simon Pegg's talent and this is a kind of 'nothing' film with no suggestion of the talent of any of his other films or TV projects. The plot is so lacking I wonder if they originally meant it as a shorter TV sketch.It's only the odd Pegg peculiarities that keep you watching a very humdrum film.The plot (can you call it a plot?)is clich√©d in the extreme and of course features an evil American. Why on earth is it called Run Fatboy... when Pegg clearly isn't fat? In fact they struggle to make him look unable to run.OK and worth a free view is about the best I can say!,5,6,10,25 May 2008
The Girl Next Door," Completely unexpected good hearted rom-com
","I was kind of fooled by the marketing of this but it sounded intriguing anyway and I'd learned the lesson that seemingly gross out comedies like American Pie, Old School and The 40 Year Old Virgin can actually be good fun and have a lot more going for them.Do NOT think this is some kind of gross out or tasteless low brow comedy, despite the unfortunate marketing and apparent subject matter. In fact if anything it struck me as a very well crafted old fashioned romantic film at heart (in a good way). This is really probably not the film you think it is.High points. The cast is excellent, absolutely all on top form for every character. The direction, photography and use of music are top notch - everything seems to hit the right note perfectly. You start out thinking you'll see a crass comedy and end up seeing a very skillfully made film, with likable characters and a really good heart at the core of it. It's also extremely funny! Low points. It's very much a fantasy film and very romantic. In this sense it really doesn't touch on it's supposed core theme 'the porn industry' in any realistic way. Porn producers are lovable rogues. AIDS is never mentioned. The whole thing is so wholesome! I don't really think this is a low point as the film is essentialy a romantic fantasy and the portrayal of the porn characters is very funny and in no way meant to be realistic.I really enjoyed it.",10,2,3,26 August 2007
Yes Man," Probably exactly what you imagine it will be.
","Carrey pulls his faces and is occasionally annoying while 'doing his thing' (pulling faces and being 'crazy') as you would expect. Unfortunately this doesn't fit in with his character at all, which is kind of the basis of the film.There is no apparent reason why Carrey is some kind of 'stay at home' life waster as he always instantly charms crowds and attractive ladies wherever he goes and has a bunch of friends.The plot of the film is utterly formulaic and predictable. But you can tell that from the trailer.There ARE laugh out loud moments though, and although Zooey Deschanel has little point ultimately, she really charms you despite the horrible script and unlikely direction her character takes.The whole thing is basically a formulaic Carrey vehicle. WHY is he so popular to the characters in the film? And talented and funny to everyone he meets...while supposedly being some kind of secretive social inadequate outcast? It's an OK and fun film, a formulaic Carrey vehicle and fine for a laugh and to rent and enjoy and then forget.",5,12,18,10 April 2009
Cloverfield," Much better than I expected!
","I had heard various things about this, but not much. That it ghoulishly used the NYC terrorist attacks to it's advantage. That it was pointless because it didn't explain anything.Imagine if someone told you there was a film where a giant monster levelled NYC and it was really scary. You'd laugh right? Imagine those old Godzilla films with a man in a rubber suit and it all caused by radiation.Now imagine watching the film and actually finding it a serious and scary horror film. Told from the point of view of the people being stomped on by Godzilla in an ultra realistic style. With friends and family and real fears. Imagine there IS no explanation for this. It's not a big rubber T-Rex - it's something slimily organic and alien. You are facing death at every turn, no-one knows what it is, nothing is working, society is effectively destroyed as far as you can see and people are dying all around you -it's real. This is what this film achieves.I found the film personally all the more satisfying for not explaining anything. Moving from this or explaining the monster would have distanced viewers from the realism the film had established, to the extent of the whole film supposedly being filmed on a single camcorder by people living through the event.This is from the makers of Lost, and of course a huge amount of speculation has appeared about almost everything in the film, including fake websites and violent fan arguments.Just see the film Godzilla shouold have been or may have seemed to audiences 50 years ago, vastly improved..",8,2,4,1 May 2008
Knocked Up," Way overrated!?
","I really liked The 40 Year Old Virgin but this was more annoying than funny.Firstly it was more a cruddy druggy 'Grandma's Boy' type film than the clever and funny 40 YO Virgin with likable characters.Secondly it seems to purport to be a 'message movie', though for the life of me I can't tell what that message is in the context of the film.Thirdly the premise of the film was utterly unbelievable, even at any level within the world of the film.We are expected to believe that firstly this woman would conceive a baby with this junkie slob, and secondly she would decide she suddenly loves him and his lifestyle while being horribly bitchy about him?? I expected a lot from the funny trailer and just got another annoying 'comedy'.",6,0,1,23 March 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Big moral question, great film.
",Firstly it's hard to believe in the young leads and their crucial standing in the community through the film which is quite an issue.This is essentially a detective story along the lines of Chinatown re-imagined.There are surprising revelations that kind of push the boundaries of the believable and ultimately the film hangs on a the moral choices of the lead character.While I may scream at those choices I appreciate the film making those choices and morality it's focus and leaving the viewer to think.Definitely recommended.,8,3,5,23 March 2008
Stardust," OK film, but great book.
","Sooo many great parts from the book has been cut out for no apparent reason, as absurd parts have been added! I found myself occasionally bewildered in the film and I had just finished the book.I frankly found the Robert DeNiro performance and character an embarrassment. What was the purpose of making him ravingly gay??? Was this such a great idea it justified dropping vast and essential parts from the book, such as the damned MAIN CHARACTERS? The Ricky Gervais character was actually quite an amusing brief addition.The whole thing appeared to be made by someone who had heard about the book 3rd hand and contained none of the understanding of the characters, the pathos or the love that made the book great.Don't be put off the great book by this barely passable film.",6,2,4,25 May 2008
