Alien 3," Alien³ — Gritty, down and dirty fight to the finish
","Alien³ is, to me, the unloved child of the Alien series. If not as good as the other two preceding it, David Fincher's attempt was a successful one nonetheless. It came full circle by going back to 'weaponless' confrontation with the beast. I think that, combined with a revolting dirty low-tech environment, rebuffed most watchers.The good. Imaginative environment. Tight scenario with many chills and thrills. Captivating story. Great photography. Excellent costume and dialogs. Simple and touching relation between Ripley and the doctor. Very interesting characters. Excellent cast.The actors. Sigourney Weaver outdid herself with this evolution of her heroic persona, a truly great performance. Charles Dance seems to be the true complement to our female lead and played it to perfection. The whole lot of convicts and jailers was astonishingly good, I'll just give special mentions to Paul McGann, Christopher Fairbank, and Charles S. Dutton.The bad. Unfortunately, the alien's CG effects are starting to show their age, and it can be distracting at time.The ugly. The intro. It's not logical. There can be no eggs there. The queen had lost her egg producing sac. That's probably what turned off most hardcore Alien fans. It did me. It took me a while to go past that and see the quality of this film. Since this blatant mistake was the basis of the whole scenario, it left very few advocators.The result. A great sci-fi thriller. Should be seen with an open mind if you like the first two installments of the franchise.",8,2,2,2 May 2013
Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream — Human beings exposed in their weakest state
","Requiem for a Dream is about losing a battle against your inner demons, and putting them to sleep with an artificial dream machine.The good. Masterful editing and camera shots giving an incredible inside perspective. A score that plunges us rapidly into that world and its sad story and keeps us there. A well built scenario revolving around weak, but very human characters.The actors. Great performance by the our four protagonist. Jared Leto as the focus point. Ellen Burstyn as his mother. Jennifer Connelly as his girlfriend. Marlon Wayans as his friend and partner.The bad. Tough to watch.The ugly. Things you might not want to think about.The result. A gritty perspective on how fragile humans are, and to what extreme they will go to bury their angst. A must see if you're ready for it.",10,1,2,14 May 2013
Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch — Be amazed, be struck by lightning, see this fantastical sci-fi
","Sucker Punch is totally out there, and probably the only way to combine so many different things in a single story.The story telling is incomplete, in itself, but not the story. Most of it is told metaphorically. You get to imagine the rest. An easy thing to do is to dismiss the movie because of the beautiful women, or the intense and fantastical action. That is a grand mistake. The story is poignant and very sad, yet wrapped in a beautiful cinematographic cocoon. It's breathtaking. I kept wondering when the hammer blow of bad poorly constructed elements would descend upon me and disappointment, break my heart. It never did.The dialogs might look simple, and the story line really quick, but their complementing information is in the magic of the metaphors. It's an incredible ride led by the excellent acting of those gorgeous creatures and genius directorial mind, as well as the superb editing and CGI.Ride the wave, shed a tear, see it.",10,93,150,29 March 2013
Skyfall," Skyfall — A much more personal James Bond
","Skyfall has the basic requirements of a Bond movie, hot women, action, soft intrigue, and easy dialogs, but it's missing many of the other clichés, such as at least one torrid sex scene (we barely have the beginning of one) one or more Bond girls (in the sense that he develops some kind of relationship), a world threat, the villain's second in command, and the gadgets.The villain is there, but he's not interested in world domination, or some such, he's going after individuals, for personal revenge. How prosaic. I imagine it's on purpose, but that's not what I want from a James Bond. The new Q is annoying to say the least, and we're missing the iconic equipment, and they're excessive use.All in all, it's an acceptable movie, and an easy entertainment. Do not look here for the thoughtful camera moves, the interesting editing, the smart diatribe, or riveting story. This is your basic blockbuster, no more, if a well made one.",7,0,5,13 December 2012
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 — An incredible blast or action and Stark technology
","Iron Man 3 is the what a sequel should be, as good as the original. It's better than Iron Man 2, and equals in many ways the original Iron Man. The only reason one might say it's not as good as the first one, it's because the first one had so many original quirks that are only copied in this sequel.The good. Incredible action. Seamless astounding special effects. Lots of good jokes. Great immersive photography. Interesting story.The actors. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow were just as good as in the previous episodes, but Ben Kingsley almost steals the shows as The Mandarin. So incredibly surprising.The bad. The scenario is pretty straight forward and doesn't bring anything new to the table, but who cares? The bad guy is a trifle simple, no depth. No need for 3D, it's just as good in 2D.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A must see, unless you can't stand Robert Downey Jr., super heroes, action or bloodless violence. See it on a giant IMAX screen with the best sound even if it means seeing it in 3D, an experience not to be missed.",9,1,4,14 May 2013
Minority Report," Be transported to our near future for a action driven ride
","Minority Report by Steven Spielberg is by now an iconic science-fiction movie for its vision of all the little things that could become part of our daily life.The good. Excellent concepts and ideas included in the future we're presented. Nice special effects that still hold well today. Very interesting story. A scenario with a great pace. Captivating intrigue. Solid suspense. Lots of action. Some touching drama. Perfect ending.The actors. Tom Cruise is the only actor who's performance is worth mentioning here. The rest of the cast is no more than adequate.The bad. No interface would ever require so much body gesture to work. It's a completely ineffective method. Sean's videos do not have the feel of true family home videos, although the 3D effect is well imagined even going as far as including imperfections.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Excellent sci-fi entertainment for all.",9,0,1,13 June 2013
Unbreakable," Unbreakable — A super hero on a more realistic human scale
","Unbreakable by M. Night Shyamalan is about making super heroes into realistic human figures instead of modern gods. The idea is interesting, and well exploited. You have a good intrigue, if a slow story, a sprinkle of romance, a bit of action, and good dose of drama. A nice mix with good visuals.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver each a pretty good performance. Robin Wright has a small but well played part. However, the rest of the cast is giving us only an acceptable performance.The dialogs are correct, but they do not bear scrutiny. The score is nice, but repetitive. Finally, a couple of logical flaws can be spotted when attentive to the story. Overall, it makes the whole flick unsubstantial, diminishing our enjoyment on subsequent viewing.It is a nice hero tale and is a recommendable film especially on first viewing.",8,0,0,2 March 2013
This Is the End," Brain off, fun on
","This Is the End is a slapstick comedy where fun is based on basest human behaviors.The good. Incredible special effects. Constant ridicule for maximum laughter. Interesting story with an awesome end and some twists. Well paced scenario.The actors. Although I like Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel a lot, I think James Franco here has the best performance.The bad. Very simple and linear story. No smart jokes.The ugly. Danny McBride as his character is incredibly annoying.The result. Don't expect anything intelligent and you'll have fun.",7,2,5,11 July 2013
Two for the Money," Two for the Money — High stake sport betting for an intense ride
","Two for the Money presents us the improbable concoction of a movie about offering advice to sport betters as a high rolling career. It won its bet, this is fine entertainment. It has some sport, lots of competitive male hormones, a bit of touching romance, and drama.Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey play the intense roles of a sport gambling businessman and his protégé. Rene Russo bring in a touch of the feminine flair and sensibility to try to balance things out, even though, this could never be presented as a chick flick. None of the cast lets us down, so it's an overall solid performance.The score, the script, and the editing are all wound tight to give a ride that comes close to a suspense, especially near the end. The sets are lush, as is the wardrobe, and the story is very interesting, bordering on the complex.Very good entertainment.",8,1,2,28 February 2013
World War Z," Strap in tightly because you're in for a hell of a ride!
","World War Z is a zombie movie that mixes a number of sub-genres together. It's global war mixed with survival, gun-ho fights, local low-tech thrill ride, and cure hunting. You'd think that with such a mix, you'd get a mess, but no, Marc Forster pulled it off.The good. Almost everything. I'll just name the best parts. Very realistic approach, nothing is easy, and characters die. Extremely solid tension, your teeth might ache from all the jaw clenching you'll probably do. Very intense and well made action with eye-popping special effects. Lots of attention to details. A tight scenario that gives the ride of a lifetime. A riveting story that avoids a number of zombie clichés. Great score. Very attaching characters. Finally an American movie with a global event that gives more than just a passing nod to other nations.The actors. Brad Pitt offers us his action hero type with a coating of realism. The other solid performance, beside the two daughter (and to a lesser degree the wife), is given to us by Daniella Kertesz. The rest of the cast performed well, but nothing distinctive.The bad. The 'I need credentials before I talk to you' is kind of a little bit much, but easily forgivable.The ugly. Nothing.The result. The best zombie movie ever. Also highly recommended to thrill seekers and action lovers.",10,7,16,3 July 2013
12 Monkeys," Twelve Monkeys — Ready for a slow crude take on a fatal pandemic?
","Twelve Monkeys is the kind of movie that gets much better with time. With each subsequent viewing, you start appreciating something new, understanding the story a little bit more, and linking new plots elements. I'm saying this because the settings and scenes are rather crude and unpleasant to assimilate, even though the final product is incredible.The good. Tight logical story. Engrossing scenario that gets better with time. Excellent acting. Interesting treatment of a fairly common theme. Great details. Nice conception of the future.The actors. Bruce Willis plays the dislocated and slightly unhinged hero to perfection. Great acting. Madeleine Stowe is just right as the unwilling but open-minded participant. Brad Pitt's mad interpretation is pure genius and an obvious precursor of his role in Fight Club (review still to come).The bad. The whole flick will not please everybody for its gruesome take, the slow development, and the logical conclusion, which I must admit is as it should be. It is morally disappointing and a slightly simple considering the circumvolutions of the story itself.The ugly. Nothing ugly there, but the rawness of it all.The result. Watch it. Let a year go by. Watch it again.",8,18,22,7 May 2013
The Impossible," The Impossible — A family caught in the 2004 tsunami
","The Impossible is based on true events, and it has the merit of showing its public how catastrophic that 2004 south-east Asian tsunami was, but there its merits end. I guess what most people liked was the fact that it really happened to a family and it tugged at their heartstring, because cinematographically speaking, it's not worth much. Most of its fault are certainly the consequence of sticking to facts. That better done in a documentary.There's basically no rhythm to the movie, the scenes are just thrown one after the other, just like in real life, but with the polish of a movie, which is a bad dichotomy. I mean, the 'homemade' video sequence is no such thing. We just get jangled around a little bit more. The editing is poor. In some places the reaction times are stretched to push more drama. A big mistake. There's also the failure to capitalize on real drama. At times, the script just falls on its face for logical reasons.The special effects are excellent though.I can't recommend this film unless you love real stories, family drama, and are interested in the 2004 tsunami.",4,14,33,29 January 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead — A silly, yet realistic zombie epidemic
","Shaun of the Dead is a silly zombie flick with strong undertone of seriousness. There's is no doubt that it is meant to make us laugh, but at the same time, it has a number of dramatic scenes. The couple story is the running thread, but it's not the meat on the bone.Most scene are a comic setup never failing to have the audience roll back their eyes in incredulity. Toward the ends come the more dramatic ones, and those are the one who make you think.The dialogs very real and flow at a good pace. The editing is done in a quick efficient manner. The story is very interesting. The zombie threat and its working are imaginative. The acting is good, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Kate Ashfield giving us the best performances.Overall, it's a very solid entertainment in brain dead way.It's a must, if you don't mind zombies and a bit of gore.",9,1,3,11 March 2013
Argo," Argo — A spy suspense set during the Iranian revolution
","Argo is an extremely well built suspense.The subject matter, the American embassy in Iran overrun in 1979, would have made me miss this great movie. It's not the type of thing that I'm interested in, but it won enough acclaim to make me see it.Ben Affleck has my admiration for pulling this off. I'll give him more credit as a director than as an actor, since even though he was playing the main character, it was almost as if he was invisible. I think it's on purpose, though, and extremely well played. The real main character is the tension. He builds it like a maestro, makes you feel it, as if you were there. It is with you like a great weight, until the all clear. Thankfully, he doesn't leave us in such a state, and gently bring us back down with an ending that ties up all the loose ends, while even adding a charming little detail.I'll give even more props to the writers for being able to insert some laughter in such a grim story. I'm not sure exactly how the managed it, but it fits, and it is direly welcomed.If you don't mind a movie set during the Iranian revolution, or all the trappings of the late 70s, it's a great movie. I don't think I'll see it again though. It's just a bit too much for me. I like to evade reality when I watch a film, no relive historical tensions.",9,0,1,24 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Into Darkness — Plunge further into its modern incarnation
","Star Trek Into Darkness is the second adventure of the USS Enterprise since the reset of the series, and it follows its older Star Trek (review still to come) brother in style while accommodating the originals a little bit more.The good. Lots of very funny moments. Slick presentation and dialogs. Interesting scenario. Superb special effects. Nice work with the 3D. Excellent choice of cast making the crew pretty incredible.The actors. My favorites, in order of preference starting with my most favorite, are: Simon Pegg as Scotty, Anton Yelchin as Chekov, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Chris Pine as Kirk, John Cho as Sulu, and Karl Urban as Bones.The bad. The revival lost some of its originality by incorporating a lot more Star Trek lore into its core, but that's forgivable. 3D was totally unnecessary. The show I saw had some blurry scenes because the theater did a bad job with the 3D. 3D is still definitively a gimmick.The ugly. In a scene, a crew member asks dextrous help, yet end up easily yanking everything out: weak. At the end, they went for high drama, yet totally screwed it up afterward.The result. An excellent sci-fi movie with a lot to please the real trekkies. If you like the previous chapter, you'll like this one too.",8,3,8,30 May 2013
The Notebook," The Notebook — Turn back the clock and listen to what romance was
","The Notebook is the pinnacle of romance without getting sickly sweet. It's an early to mid 20th century mentality with a bit of modernism.The good. Very captivating and emotional story. Great acting. Excellent period setting, sets, and costumes. Well paced scenario. Nice slow music. Superb photography.The actors. Ryan Gosling is quite charming, in a very affirmative and slightly obsessive way. Rachel McAdams is sweet, intelligent, and fiery. James Marsden plays the beau to perfection. Joan Allen is just detestable as the controlling southern mother.The bad. The CG geese in the intro as so fake they're blinding. And the 'now' part of the flick is just not as well put together, not as slick, as the past.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A flick highly recommended for the hopelessly romantic.",9,0,1,10 May 2013
The Fifth Element," The Fifth Element — Max fun and max action in an almost burlesque future
","The Fifth Element a sci-fi action extravaganza by Luc Besson.The good. Funny. Outrageous settings and costumes. Wildly imaginative technology and prognostics for the future. Lots of action.The actors. Bruce Willis is in his middle phase. Not his best performance, but still pretty good. Gary Oldman is right as the evil Zorg, the trash of humanity. Ian Holm give us a great performance as the overwhelmed and slightly klutzy priest. Milla Jovovich's role doesn't require much of her, but she's simply adorable. And finally, Chris Tucker is fantastic as the extremely annoying radio DJ. It takes a few times seeing the flick to get used to him, but he's just perfect.The bad. The story is your basic save the world concept, with the ultimate evil, the criminals helping out, and the good guys, which include the army. Nothing inventive there.The ugly. The pet is too obviously a puppet.The result. Lots of sci-fi fun.",8,2,4,6 May 2013
Finding Nemo," Finding Nemo — A great animation adventure to be enjoyed by all
","Finding Nemo is the heroic tale of fishes, and it's excellent. It opens up with a tragedy and quickly leads us to a great adventure and multiple acts of courage. Who would have thought that such a simple idea could result in such a great production?The animation is extremely colorful, brought to us in great details for a breathtaking look at the life under the sea. The dialogs are funny. The script is very inventive and doesn't call on evil or songs. The story is riveting, with each scene a novelty in itself. Voices are chosen to perfection, and the reactions realistic.A great movie for both adults and kids.",10,1,2,11 March 2013
Blade," Vampire fights with techno music
","Blade is an other take on the vampire scene based on a comic book.The good. Lots of action. Great music. Nice gadgets. Tightly paced scenario.The actors. This is not an acting movie, but Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, and Stephen Dorff give us acceptable performances. And you can also see Traci Lords.The bad. Simple story. Some logical flaws in the scenario. Fight scenes look good, but have some slight continuity and timing problems, noticeable when viewed multiple times.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Solid entertainment for action or vampire lovers. Don't expect complexity.",7,0,1,19 June 2013
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days — A romantic comedy about using dating as a work tool
","How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a romantic comedy about dating. He's doing his best to win her, she's doing her best to dump him after hooking him. That means, you'll see a ton of clichés throughout the story.The acting is good. The scenes, editing, and soundtrack are slick, but the scenario is very light, and unimaginative. You even get the friendly down to hearth family that saves the day. All the characters are unidimensional.It's all entertaining, and well done. You can spend a nice evening enjoying yourself, but you can't really look for depth or real quality in this movie.It's a good rent or cheap buy.",6,0,0,16 January 2013
Rise of the Guardians," Rise of the Guardians — Quite an interesting take on children's beliefs
","Rise of the Guardians is an interesting take on some of the major beliefs of children, some of which are geared toward capitalist consumerism. That being said, their spin caught me a bit off-guard. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the preview. It was a very pleasant surprise, especially for Santa Claus. He rocks! The Easter Bunny... well, he's interesting, but his world, not so much. I guess they spent more time on the northman. The others are somewhere in the middle.Now, there's a few weak moment in the movie, where the script gets too predictable and the dialogs a bit lame. If they could have applied themselves to the whole movie and each of the characters as they did on the North Pole and its denizen, we'd have had a masterpiece.I must admit though, that they did a good work on the animation style. Even though it's not highly polished, it has flair, and a certain personality, so there's some good there. It's also touching at time.Overall, it's a good movie to watch. Just don't expect a stellar story line.",7,2,3,8 January 2013
Troy," Troy — Beautiful Greeks in incredible battle and fights
","Troy is an action movie trying to extract all the influence of the gods from the Illiad in an attempt to rationalize the story as an historical event.The action is grandiose, the story interesting, the scenario has a good pace, and the special effects are still acceptable by today's standard.Brad Pitt, as Achilles, is at his sexiest and his most arrogant. Is rendition is probably close to what a invincible demigod would be like. Eric Bana is probably at his best in the role of a good hearted Hector. Brian Cox, as the power hungry Agamemnon, makes us hate his character like only he can do. Diane Kruger seems to struggle in her role lacking some fluidity. Orlando Bloom, as lacking talent as he does, probably did his best performance as the romantic, clueless, charming and cowardly Paris. Sean Bean is perfect as the valiant and cunning Odysseus. And finally, Saffron Burrows moves us with her lovingly tragic rendition of Andromache, Hector's wife.Now, for a few bad things. The fighting, either man to man or on large scale, is not realistic, and neither are the armors, although they mostly respect the style of the time. Also, the rowing wouldn't be functional as depicted. However, most of that is just nitpicking, and the really annoying bit is that the dialogs, while not being dull, are weak for the most part.If you want plenty of action in the time of the Greeks with beautiful people as actors, this should satisfy your needs. If you're a Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom fan, it's made for you.",7,0,0,20 April 2013
Just Go with It," Just Go with It — A romantic comedy about a well meaning escalation of lies
","Just Go with It is one of those romantic comedy that goes the silly way to try to prove that you need to commit to be happy, with the main character chasing the right girl the wrong way getting deeper and deeper into trouble.The story is interesting, but it's a standard escalation of lies and attempts to maintain the fiction. The best acting performance is given by Jennifer Aniston. Adam Sandler does himself credit for making us laugh without resorting to his early career antics, but he has done better. Nicole Kidman is not at her best, but I suspect the role and probably the directorial inputs she was given are responsible for the result. The rest of the cast gives us an average performance, just like the movie itself.It's acceptable entertainment if you like romantic comedy with silly streak. If you're a Aniston or Sandler fan, you should also feel at home. The others should pass.",6,1,1,3 April 2013
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days of Summer — Life is an ironic conflicted sarcastic bitch
","500 Days of Summer is what happens when life puts you in a situation you're not ready to handle, with people of opposite interests.The good. Excellent editing. Great timeline handling. Very interesting characters. Nice moody story. Realistic events, actions, and consequences. Solid dialogs.The actors. The obsessive love sick puppy portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt could hardly have been better played. He gives the role a certain innocence and a dose of logic. Zooey Deschanel, who's usual characters are very sweet, plays an indifferent and disabused, almost callous, version of her usual role. And Geoffrey Arend plays the annoying idiot/clueless well- meaning friend pretty well.The bad. The diverse situations can be uncomfortable to watch at time.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A film that will force you to take position.",9,1,1,10 May 2013
Juno," Juno — A teen gets pregnant and goes off the beaten path for her happy ending
","Juno starts differently and ends the same way.The director gets us in right at the critical moment. Then the decision comes, and we're off into the thick of the movie. So, it's not about the decision, it's about making your own path.This is one of those movies that try to drown us in the 'perfect' world of film making. We follow a small reconstituted family, that's not completely happy, but not at each other's throat. Everyone as flaws as well as qualities. All of the personas have depth, and layers, and you can feel it. The environment they live in is just as rich in details. The script is perfectly novel, the acting is great, without reproach, and the pacing just right.Ellen Page fits her role to a T. The unconventional teen who has thought, almost, everything through, with strong ideas, and a will to enforce it couldn't have been played any better. Jennifer Garner was born the be the perfectionist mom wannabe. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney are the perfect incarnation of the progressive yet simple blue collar parents.There are very few things I would criticize. The first one is the the teen lingo. It's appropriate, but heavily used. The second one is that all of those characters are pretty darn mature. I, for one, am very happy of this change of pace. It's like a balm after the so many face palm I've given myself while listening to your average Hollywood flick. The third and final one would be the slightly sappy music track. Not my style at all. As you can see all of those things are very inconsequential, and I must admit contribute to the flavor of the piece.It's a must see.",10,0,1,28 January 2013
X-Men," X-Men — Super powered humans battle it out
","X-Men is the Marvel super hero movie that finally made it and launched them on a series of quality film. It made it because it was great.The good. Lots of super action. Nice displays of powers. Interesting story. A bit of intrigue. Well done bantering. A few odd references to the comic books for the fans. Great battles.The actors. Hugh Jackman is perfect as the Wolverine, he's just missing a bit of bulk, but the attitude is there. Patrick Stewart is also right on as professor X. Ian McKellen makes a great super villain as Magneto. At that point James Marsden wasn't well known and this role is a little bit weak for him, he can perform better. Although Halle Berry was already a star, and she fits her role to perfection, it didn't stretch her acting talent at all. Anna Paquin plays the sweet Rogue with a good sense of dramatic flair.The bad. The CG are starting to show. They're not too old yet, but we can see them on the edge. The story is pretty basic compared to the intrigue we can find in the comics. And Cyclops never was such a twerp in the books.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Great super hero entertainment.",8,0,1,25 May 2013
Match Point," Solid drama to capture your attention
","Match Point is a drama by Woody Allen, but personally I think it has only very few things that makes it Allen. You can see his style in the score, camera work, and pacing of the story. However, the rest doesn't feel enough like him to put off his detractors. Very refreshing.The good. Slow developing and riveting story filled with details. Tight scenario with an excellent pace. Lush decor. Beautiful photography. Superb acting.The actors. I love Scarlett Johansson and she's great in that very emotional and sexy role, but I have to hand it to Jonathan Rhys Meyers for his portrayal, even though his character is despicable. On a different level, Brian Cox gives a great if subtle performance.The bad. That dream scene is a bit awkward, but it still works.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A Woody Allen that anybody can appreciate. It's a bit dark and can be emotionally difficult, but it's a great piece.",9,1,3,10 July 2013
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris — Do what you love, love what you do, and work on it now
","Midnight in Paris is a charming, surprising, and light movie. It's about being lost, then finding your way by magic and complete serendipity.I think this Woody Allen piece works because of the overt innocence of Owen Wilson's character. The fact that he is trampled by his controlling wife, played by Rachel McAdams, adds to his likability. His strange encounters are put together in a very simple manner with very little fanfare. The result is that we are transported without us breaking our suspension of disbelief. The fact that Paris is almost timeless also helps.The sets, costumes, score, and editing are just right. The well chosen cast also gives us a solid performance.Overall, there's very little negative to say, except maybe that the conclusion lacks a little bit of substance. It's simply that the transition when he finally understand is dropped on us very suddenly and he cuts off his ties quickly. It's very mature and realistic, in a way, but slightly unsatisfying. More over, the beginning of the film is a bit rough, but you get in to the beat quite rapidly.It's good, see it if you like low-key productions.",8,1,2,17 March 2013
The Terminator," The birth of many things
","The Terminator is the father of cyberpunk and is one of the very first movie directed by James Cameron where he really started to build his name. He showed his talent with this small budget independent production. The star rating of this film is mainly due to the fact that its a landmark in the industry.The good. Very imaginative background and setting. Well paced scenario. Interesting characters. Captivating story. Solid suspense. Nice action.The actors. The machine is a good role for Arnold Schwarzenegger at the beginning of his career since it doesn't require much pronunciation. I've always loved Michael Biehn and even if he's not at his best, he did great with what he was given. Linda Hamilton hadn't yet bloomed and her limitations are showing a little bit, yet she gave us a great portrayal.The bad. A few overly simple dialogs. The stop motion animation is good, but nowadays, it's an old technology. The mechanical puppet doesn't have human fluidity it should have. The latex stand-in is pitiful by today's standard.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Everyone should see it because it's a landmark, especially sci-fi fans.",9,0,3,18 July 2013
Ocean's Twelve," The interest lies mainly in continuing the story
","Ocean's Twelve is the sequel to Ocean's Eleven, but doesn't stand up to its predecessor in terms of quality.The good. Interesting story and capers. Nice action and dialogs.The actors. Pretty much the same performance as the first installment except that the script didn't give them parts that were as solid. Simply add Catherine Zeta-Jones to the party with a well played part, and a cameo by Bruce Willis.The bad. Not telling the story doesn't make an intrigue. An intrigue is built by revealing the facts but not the connections. Plus, there's a number of logical flaws in the scenario.The ugly. The whole Roberts and Willis encounter is totally ridiculous and occupies way too much time.The result. Basic entertainment that would interest mainly those who liked the original and wanted to know what happens next.",6,1,3,24 June 2013
The Beach," Very intense and gut wrenching at time
","The Beach is about paradise, what we'll do for it and the consequences. Nothing is perfect, everything has a cost.The good. Intensely dramatic scenes. A modern phantasmagoric mix. Superbly paced scenario with great cohesion and editing. Solid characters, very realistic actions and reactions. Nice score. Superb acting.The actors. I'll just mention the two best ones: Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Carlyle.The bad. That video game overlay. It's not necessarily a faux pas, because it's well tailored to the persona and his psychosis, but it just doesn't fit very nicely with the rest of the movie style.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A must see. Sensible souls should avoid for the drama, and a very gory scene.",9,1,3,26 June 2013
Knocked Up," Knocked Up — About a good guy slob knocking up a career oriented beauty
","Knocked Up is a silly yet serious comedy. You have a mix of the completely goofball and eternal teen played by Seth Rogen, and the very serious and proper career oriented young adult played by the beautiful Katherine Heigl. You could have picked better opposite.The whole movie is like that and makes you alternate between the two world. How they mesh is pretty simple, you'll see. It's very touching, and you'll be rooting for all parties, because they are all right and wrong.There's something for everybody. Emotions, laughters, completely idiotic behaviors, responsible decisions, breakups, makeups, kisses, tenderness, and sex. That movie gives you everything and is the opposite of the dating movie, it goes backward.One thing irked me: at some point, it seemed to be anti-abortion. I'm pro-choice, and that ruffles my feather. Beyond that, it's a crazy setup.The acting is good, mostly silly, the story is excellent, if nothing new, and the soundtrack very appropriate.",7,0,1,15 January 2013
Alien," Alien — This is what all space monster movies are based on, but could never match
","Alien is a Ridley Scott masterpiece. It shook its audience when it came out several decades ago and it still does the same now. Any aspiring suspense director would do well to study this movie in depth.The good. What makes this film as close to perfection as possible is the attention to the setup. It starts during the initial credits during which the simple visuals as well as the score puts you in the mood. It's slow and heavy with chills already. Then you get to know the environment. The crew wakes up, and you get to know them...The pace throughout this flick is perfect. It's a slow climb to an ultimate peak of tension. The dialogs, the characters, the camera work, the editing, the script, the story, the background history... everything is meticulously done. Most special effects still hold the road even now, because they were extremely well done and used correctly.The actors. Great selection for the cast, each member well adapted to its role. I'll simply mention the excellent work of Sigourney Weaver who's career was launched with this title, and Ian Holm who's performance is truly unforgettable.The bad. The only reason I didn't give this movie a perfect score was because some of the technology is getting old. The size of the main computer. The many blinking lights. And the text interface, to some extent. Only two special effect sequences are really getting old. The planet-side landing of the ship. The triple explosion with the sheet of fire.The rest can easily be imagined as some sub-standard rough industrial technology, a bit like what was done in Serenity (review yet to come), the crew having to deal with less than ideal conditions or hardware.The ugly. Nothing. This is very close to perfection, if somewhat old.The result. Horror, shivers, and sweats guaranteed. See it.",9,0,1,29 April 2013
Closer," A razor sharp look at relationships
","Closer is about the key wrong move you can make in an intimate relationship.The good. Nice music and score. Beautiful photography. Solid characters with great depth. Excellent scenario construction which tells a long story in a very short time while making us understand what really makes or breaks a relationship. It mostly follows chronology or otherwise makes it easy to understand, but never shows any time stamp. That makes the viewer's mind work and thus plunges us into the story rather quickly, a fascinating tale of change and turnabout.The actors. Natalie Portman gives a great performance, and shows her talent with a complex yet subtle role. Clive Owen as the clever bastard definitively gave the performance of a lifetime, it's by far his best one. Jude Law as the neurotic romantic indecisive love lorn control freak certainly gave us one of his best. Julia Roberts gave a nice performance, but it just not on par with the others.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Not for everyone, but should be watched by everyone.",9,2,3,6 July 2013
Elf," Elf — A goofy holiday comedy to bring you cheer
","Elf has an interesting premise: a human baby raised by North Pole elves and Santa Claus. The goofy twist to the story fits perfectly with Will Ferrell's acting style. He is just silly enough in a straight and earnest way to make you believe the whole rigamarole.Every new development in the scenario gives the opportunity for more laughters, and the presentation of new aspects of the elf society.The acting, editing, and special effects are simple and well crafted, nothing to detract from enjoying the spectacle.It's a great recommendation if you're looking for Christmas related entertainment.",7,2,3,4 January 2013
Life of Pi," Life of Pi — Be transported on this adventure lost at sea
","Life of Pi tells an incredible, or maybe unbelievable, story of a shipwrecked young Indian, by Ang Lee. Definitively a master piece of imagination and storytelling. You'll be captivated.The 3D, considering the subject, is incredibly well done. No mistake at all there. It is mostly invisible, yet it will take you breath away on a number of occasion, and it helps you dive in to this marvelous adventure.Nothing to criticize on this movie, everything is done extremely well. The 'tell me your story' part is sort of weak and an over used plot strategy, but it works here. The subject matter might not be interesting to all, but it can be enjoyed by all. Open your heart, your mind, and your imagination to this tale, and you won't regret it.A must see. The preview doesn't do it credit.",9,2,5,19 February 2013
Lost in Translation," Lost in Translation — Nothing happens, yet you understand how it feels
","Lost in Translation is one of those rare movie that doesn't need lots of word to make sense. It's all in the mood, the images, and, in this case, the misunderstandings, the confusion. Nothing happens in this film, and that's exactly the point. Nothing goes right, you get literally and metaphorically lost in translation.Sophia Coppola does an incredible job of making us feel exactly how lost and confused the characters are. The script, the story and the few dialogs are just perfect. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson's delivery is impeccable, just as are the camera shots and the soundtrack.Get lost, and think a bit about life, see this movie.",9,1,2,9 February 2013
Full Metal Jacket," Get through the gruesome training and maybe you'll survive hell
","Full Metal Jacket is Vietnam war movie by Stanley Kubrick and it is a masterpiece.The good. The mood is set to perfection with the exemplary score and the smooth pacing of the scenario. The story is done in two part, you get to see the ongoing effect of the training as it happens and its result in the field. It is personal, it is gripping, and psychologically brutal. A clear picture of what it is to become a soldier and what it requires on the field. Great photography and editing. Solid dialogs.The actors. Matthew Modine is in one of his best role, presenting a steadfast young man with the rare quality necessary to get through marine training with all his head. A young Vincent D'Onofrio, almost unrecognizable, gives us a performance of a lifetime with incredible realism. R. Lee Ermey is the quintessential army drill sergeant, a perfect performance. Adam Baldwin plays a shallow role, but gives it his best.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Giving loud orders in an echoing building while sneaking on an enemy. It's the only error of the flick.The result. An excellent war movie. Not for the faint of heart.",10,0,1,8 June 2013
The Devil Wears Prada," The Devil Wears Prada — For the fashion conscious or the goal oriented
","The Devil Wears Prada is about setting goals and achieving them.The good. Nice clothes. Glamour. Well built and well paced script. Very interesting story. Entertaining laughs. Solid dialogs.The actors. Meryl Streep is perfect as the driven cold calculating top editor. It suits her better than mousy anxious mother. Anne Hathaway gives us a very good performance as the wide eyed innocent, and her transformation is very believable. Emily Blunt has the same aplomb as the competitive shallow fashion obsessed assistant. Finally, Stanley Tucci is surprisingly well tailored for the career man with the cold look but soft heart.The bad. Why would she wants grilled cheese in Boston, when he was so unsupportive and refused to understand her situation? That's ridiculous. He acted like a self-centered child.The ugly. Nothing, really.The result. Light and entertaining movie. Recommended to fashion lovers.",7,0,1,8 May 2013
Romeo + Juliet," To perfection from tragedy
","Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance.The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible.The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent.The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward.",10,0,0,4 July 2013
"Monsters, Inc."," Monsters, inc. — A lovable animation where novel ideas keep you riveted
","Monsters, inc. is one of the best animation film ever produced, only surpassed by The Incredibles.The animation itself is incredible, especially if you take into consideration the work that was done on the hairs of Sulley. The world they created is without par, extremely imaginative and full of details, and that's without mentioning the mechanics it uses to get energy, as well as the energy crisis within.Each monster is well thought, wild in design, and nicely rendered. The colors are great, vivid, and cheerful. The humor is plenty, side splitting, and almost non-stop. The jokes are great, and the dialogs complete, natural, and logical.The only negative thing I could say is that the 'evil' part of the scenario was a little unimaginative, but fortunately, it's not the main attraction. The main draw is the relationship between the two main characters and the little girl. It's adorable. That alone makes us fall in love with the movie.A must see.",10,0,1,18 January 2013
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 Things I Hate About You — Fun teen romance with interesting plot ideas
","10 Things I Hate About You is a teen movie with some nice spunk. It is set in a language that most adolescents will associate with. The themes correspond to that group age and are not dealt with in an adult manner, tone, or perspective. Neither are they rendered in a puerile or slapstick way. Overall, it's an excellent balancing act.The characters are interesting and well portrayed. The story captivating, the dialogs believable, the romances sweet and simple. The laughs are aplenty and well orchestrated. The music is well chosen, energetic, and youthful. Finally, the sets and wardrobe are realistic and colorful.It is an easy watch.",7,0,0,11 February 2013
Predator," A truly unique creature for unique entertainment
","Predator is a classic. It's a mix between the action hero style, the slasher flick, and the sci-fi.The good. Excellent design of the Predator, its background, habits, tactics, and equipment. Beyond that, what makes this movie is the initial creep factor, the way he hunts them down one by one, how he takes them out, the various ambush tactics, and the final confrontation. Perfect choice of special effects which still holds pretty well today. Nice action. Well paced scenario.The actors. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura are doing their thing, but the nice performances come from Elpidia Carrillo, Richard Chaves, Shane Black, and, especially, Bill Duke.The bad. All army talk and fighting aren't realistic, they're stylized. Those action hero quip are lame and badly used, fortunately there are only two of them. Simple characters. Lousy intro story.The ugly. The bow and arrows are just crap.The result. Don't take it too seriously, enjoy the style, and then you can appreciate what makes this film good.",8,0,2,16 June 2013
Oblivion," Oblivion — A sad post-apocalyptic world, a wasteland for a technician
","Oblivion is sci-fi hotness. It's not perfect, but it delivers great value.The photography and the special effects are phenomenal. A must see in IMAX. The action is great. The dialogs are good. The acting is just right. Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, and Melissa Leo all performed without flaw. The ideas behind the scenario are great, and the story is very interesting with nice rebounds. I would have like to explored this world to a greater depth. Very interesting.An annoying little thing is that the backstory is not clear, and when an explanation comes from Freeman, it's just a bit too much 'telling the audience'.Now, for the flaws. The end is pathetic. The 'after' should have been cut out, and you'd have a great fade out. It's a scene that's just an unnecessary Hollywood gimmick. Also, the woman should be on the Tet not at the cabin.I removed a full star for the 'after', but beside that, the movie is a rock star. An incredible ride into a strange future.I highly recommend it, especially to science-fiction fans. Do not miss it.",8,2,5,18 April 2013
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Good Morning, Vietnam — How view the Vietnam War from a different angle
","Good Morning, Vietnam is one of the best movie that Robin Williams has made. It's funny, unpretentious, has some real drama without being too heavy, and it brings home some nice open values.Williams' acting is excellent, displaying all of the above qualities, and it will transport you easily into his world. You'll laugh and you'll be touch, even though you might not be able to understand everything he says.It's a very different view point of the Vietnam War, and just that makes the whole film very interesting. It's a must see, even if you don't like movies on that particular subject, because the split between the personal angle and the conflict angle is about even.",9,1,1,24 February 2013
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading — What if you believed you were in a spy movie?
","Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.The good. Excellent acting. Totally off the wall characters, actions and situations, yet completely logical. Story with twists within twists. Well paced scenario. Solid dialogs. Nice action.The actors. George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, and John Malkovich play disturbingly crazy roles stuffed with delusion and heavily dosed with stupidity. While Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons seem almost out of place as the standard bearers of reason.The bad. Since it's so bizarre, it won't please everyone.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Offbeat and cooky comedy. Don't think you'll see your run of the mill kind of film and you'll have fun.",9,15,17,2 June 2013
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity — Tremendous spy action but all in a very human scale
","The Bourne Identity made a splash when it came out and quickly became a reference. The action tries to stay realistic while giving a powerful adrenaline ride to the audience. What makes this spy flick interesting is that the main character is hyper-precise, an unstoppable machine, the settings are unglamorous, and the protagonists and their motivation simple to understand.That being said, the story itself is not simple, it's very captivating, and the main idea extremely interesting. The characters have a certain depth to them, and even though their psychological profile is not complex, it is well done. The camera work is incredible. The theme song is good. The action and editing are tight, and the details all work out logically.Matt Damon definitely plays one of his best role and gets you right into Bourne's skin. Franka Potente is just right as his lead female, You want to slap Chris Cooper's character, almost from the very start. Julia Stiles has a small role but at the time, it was a mature one for her. And Brian Cox wraps it up quite nicely, while the rest of the crew doesn't disappoint a single time.Now, the few little points I found that did work for me. The night sea shots look like a set. Terrible. Fortunately, you only see a few. The dictator is a bit over the top. And finally, the car would never have made it down those steps in driving condition, but that's a common movie mistake. The cars in chases continue to run whatever happens to them. Bottom line, those are all minor problems that you see only after watching the film many times.This is one of the great action flicks. Don't miss it.",9,2,2,23 March 2013
Man of Steel," Astounding with weaker moments
","Man of Steel is a great new beginning for this super hero.The good. Incredible intro on Krypton with superb concepts on technology, society, and design. I love all the special effects related to Krypton. Solid score with very deep bass. Nice explosive action. Well done 3D, if not necessary for enjoyment. Interesting story. The making of superman is well handled. You can understand how came to be how he is. Lois Lane is finally a real character with nice depth and a good role in the tale, well incorporated within the story. Excellent choices of mothers and fathers. Zod is magnificent and really annoying. Nice acting.The actors. Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and Diane Lane are just perfect for their role. On the other hand, Henry Cavill was better at acting Kent before he became Superman, although I have to hand it to him for not making the stalwart figure dull and boring.The bad. When the explanation is given to the child, it is done too quickly. It's just off by a bit, but with a little better timing, they would have pulled it off. Lousy take on the breathing and the atmospheric conditions. Dull way to handle super being versus super being. The ugly. Just a few token shots are given to the nations outside the US. It would have been better just not to talk about them.The result. Excellent entertainment. You should see it, if super heroes do not bore you. A must see on IMAX for the image, but the sound as well.",8,9,17,28 June 2013
Cast Away," Cast Away â€” A lone survivor on a deserted island in the middle of the Pacific
","Cast Away shows you what life would be for a lucky shipwreck or plane crash survivor on a deserted island in the Pacific. It's tough, and very lonely.The movie does an excellent job of showing us that, and also of setting up the character's life, and what would happen after he returns home. It is a drama, but it's not something designed to upset the viewer. Everything is done right: the editing, the soundtrack, the camera shots, the sets, the costumes, the accessories, the scenario, the dialogs, and the story.Tom Hanks is perfect, a high note in his career, without a doubt. He brings excellent dramatic emotions to the screen, as well as incredible poise in the loneliness of his character and his defeated look, not to mention going to incredible dietary length to get really emaciated.The only negative things I've found, are not that noticeable. First, the Christmas family dinner is a bit over done in true Hollywood fashion. Second, the 'sea' during the crash is obviously set in a large artificial basin and the huge waves are CG. Third, the night time scenes on the island don't look real.That being said, it's a must see.",9,2,4,21 February 2013
Armageddon," Armageddon â€” The Earth is to be obliterated and the US save the world
","Armageddon was a blockbuster and still is good entertainment.The good. Lots of action, explosions, heroics, and a taut suspense. You get cool gadgets, astronauts, one cosmonaut, some bad Russian accent, a crazy crew, and an excellent score.The actors. Bruce Willis is still in his action hero phase, not having yet matured, but still good. Billy Bob Thornton is right on target. Ben Affleck as yet to reach his peak, yet delivers a solid performance. Liv Tyler easily tugs at our heart strings. Steve Buscemi and Michael Clarke Duncan are hilarious and perfect. And finally, you don't see enough of Owen Wilson in his small role.The bad. The amount of testosterone contained in this film could put an 80s East German female swimmer to shame. Logic, laws of physics, and general scientific thinking seemed to have been set aside to build the scenario. Nothing holds up to even the barest of scrutiny.The ugly. That's some ultra US-centric flick. It's gag worthy. More over, the word 'god' is repeated so many times, you'd think it's a recruiting video.The result. Excellent brain dead explosive entertainment for the whole family. Don't expect more and you'll love it.",6,0,0,22 April 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Trouble with the Curve — A tenacious daughter and a grouchy mule-headed father
","Trouble with the Curve is a father-daughter movie.The acting is solid. You're quickly taken by the story and the characters who are well developed. The setup is quick. There's no lingering at any stage of the well paced scenario. The story is diversified, rich, and vibrant. The cast is scintillating. Clint Eastwood plays yet an other grouchy old man, but even grouchier, and plays it once again very well. Amy Adams is sweet and lovely with a demanding presence on screen. Justin Timberlake act as hot as he usually does with a role that fits him very well. John Goodman complete the cast of friends with an other good performance. And finally, you just want to slap Matthew Lillard, as the over confident ass hole.However the ending is weak. It should have ended before the boardroom with a simple closing of the chapter on the field. The way it was done is too sugary, and tying all those loose ends treats the audience as a simple minded pink-flavor junkie.There's also a number of big clichés concerning the father-daughter relationship, as well as the workaholic, the hot new thing (and there are no less than three of them), and the quickly slipped in discovery of the unknown superstar.Well worth seeing.",7,1,2,15 April 2013
Pitch Black," Pitch Black — Space monsters with original set ideas, but only for sci-fi fans
","Pitch Black is science-fiction movie with space monsters, and as with every other such flick, it's a bad rip-off of Alien. That being said, it has some strong feature that makes it impossible to ignore. Its flaws make it barely watchable.Let's start with the bad for a change. The creatures are poorly designed with bad CGI to boot. The lighting is wrong most of the time. The characters are at best unidimensional. The 'natural outdoor' set pieces obviously fake when it comes to rock formations. The story is extremely simple, and finally, the scenario as well as its implementation have a number of logical flaws.Then, what has it going for itself? Well, the mood for one is excellent, its strange and tight. The main ideas about the setup, how the characters go there, and the environment, are refreshingly interesting. The fact that the action takes place in the dark and mostly without sets is a stroke of pure. genius. Now, if only they could have made the lighting 'real', to correspond with the light sources available, it would have been perfect, and the mood entrancing.If you're a sci-fi lover, it would be worth a watch, it's different. If you're a real fan of Vin Diesel, then go for it.",5,0,1,13 January 2013
The Shining," The Shining — A classic suspense with incredible atmosphere
","The Shining is by now a classic, and it has the well deserved title of master piece. Stanley Kubrick came up with the a jewel, no less.The strong point of the movie, and one of Kubrick's best talent, is the atmosphere. You get sucked into it by the time the couple settle in as the guardians of the lodge.The young boy really is the meat to the horror of it all, he's the one to give you the chills, helped with some very smart editing and a deeply persuasive soundtrack. The music is great. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is the one to make us afraid with his excellently well played psychotic behavior. Shelley Duvall is the born victim, excusing her husband, bending to his will, doing his job, mostly clumsy, rather clingy, a bit clueless... it's all in her acting, and it's spot on.The film is obviously getting old, but you really rarely take stock of it, like the awkward generic, and a few lousy sound pickups in the beginning. I'll relegate the general stiffness of the introduction, until they are alone at the hotel, as building up the atmosphere.Overall, if you haven't seen it yet, you should.",9,0,2,16 February 2013
American Beauty," American Beauty — A positive drama about life and making the most of it
","American Beauty is the kind of movie that really makes you think about life, about your life, and those around you.This movie is above any reproach. Those who don't like it, don't like thinking about life or themselves. The only reason not to see it is because you would like to see a movie to escape and this is just the opposite. Still, it has a positive message, so it's a positive kind of drama, and dramatic it is, even slightly dark at time.I could just list every aspect of the movie one by one and say it's excellent: acting, characters, camera shots, editing, soundtrack, story, dialogs... but I'm not going to waste more words on perfection.Just see it.",10,0,2,7 February 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A sci-fi masterpiece with action and suspense
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the superb sequel by James Cameron of the original cyberpunk movie, The Terminator.The good. Slick polish to the production. Tons of superb action. Great liquid metal special effect. Gripping score. Riveting story that just won't let you go. Imaginative background and settings, just like the first one. Tight suspense. Attention grabbing intro with some laughs. Absolutely perfect ending. A few funny scenes, with the best line of the film being: 'I need a vacation.' Hilarious. Great acting on the part of all the cast.The actors. By that time, Arnold Schwarzenegger had acquired enough polish to really give some dimension to his machine role, especially one who can learn. Linda Hamilton shed off some of her beauty to better portray an action role, and she did great being finally mature as an actress. Edward Furlong was perfect and very natural as the young John Connor even if it wasn't probably very far from who he was at the time. Robert Patrick played his role so well, that it took years for him to shake it up and play any other with credibility.The bad. A few minor logical flaws and awkward projection screen, but that's it!The ugly. Nothing.The result. A sci-fi masterpiece. A must for everyone.Personal note. I went to see it without knowing any details of the plot. It was quite a surprise.",10,1,1,18 July 2013
Apocalypse Now," The war is not only fought on the field but also in the shadows
","Apocalypse Now is a Vietnam War masterpiece by Francis Ford Coppola.The good. This is an other one of those movie you could list everything here. Once again, I'll just mention what makes it special. The impeccable photography, the viscerally poignant visuals, and the incredible score perfectly emphasize the dark chilling gloom of the situation, the sense of impending doom. The story is a solid tale that exposes the twisted nature of the conflict. The long and slow scenario really lets you sink into the morass faced by the main character, like feeling a centipede crawl across your skin. Unexpected events popup all the time.The actors. Martin Sheen shines and quietly shows his talent as the tortured special force soldier sent on a mission of a lifetime. Robert Duvall is the perfect blustery unshakable commander. Marlon Brando displays all his talent as he portrays a genius commander gone mad. An extremely young and unrecognizable Laurence Fishburne already shows us his potential. And finally, Harrison Ford, fresh from Star Wars, plays a small role as a colonel.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A difficult movie to watch, but a must for anyone with enough fortitude. The redux version should be seen to really understand the whole story. The shorter original version should only be watched by those who want to be exposed to this masterpiece, but are not certain to like it.",10,0,2,10 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver Linings Playbook — An emotional piece that makes it right for all of us to be a little crazy
","Silver Linings Playbook makes it right to have problems, mental problems. This is a big taboo in our society. We all have those kind of problems to one degree or an other. Even if the main characters have heavier symptoms to deal with, this is a way to show that it is acceptable.At first, you'll be uncomfortable with Pat's unusual behavior, but it will immediately feel much better once Tiffany enters the scene. Even though his behavior doesn't change, once there's someone else like him, you feel immediately better. Why? Because it normalizes him. When we meet somebody like us, we immediately feel better, more acceptable, less worried what others think of us. We feel the same about others.In this film, all the scenes, dialogs, and emotions are real and solid. The acting is superb and the story surprising on many occasions. This is definitively the best performance Bradley Cooper has given, and Jennifer Lawrence is his match on every level, we just don't spend as much time with her as with him. Robert De Niro plays a great character, and Chris Tucker fits right in. Everything is perfect.This script even plays the 'lie' right, and the final moment got me yearning for a girl to cuddle and love. It has been a while since a movie made me feel that. I just can't find anything wrong with it. If you want to pick something negative, I'd say that the professional dancers are not good actors. That's it.The only reason not to watch it might be because you don't like that kind of story. It's about average people, with average surrounding, salary, homes, and lives. There's nothing marvelous, scintillating, or stupendous, just normal.",9,1,2,22 January 2013
Save the Last Dance," Save the Last Dance â€” A real touching romance with interesting subjects
","Save the Last Dance is a good romantic movie, and even though the characters are teens, the subjects treated apply as much for adults. So, it's not teen-centric. I'd say most guys will find their groove in it. There are beautiful women, hot dancing, and testosterone fueled conflicts. The romance is real, there's no Hollywood tricks, all of this could happen in real life.The acting is excellent. Julia Stiles really got established in the eyes of a wider audience with this film, and for good reasons. Sean Patrick Thomas is solid. And Kerry Washington seems a natural as Chenille.The story is touching and very interesting. The scenario doesn't run in a straight line, and it touches lot of subjects. The hip-hop and classical music is great. The dialogs are nice and smooth, realistic. The characters have nice emotional depth to them, some complexities, and good backgrounds.Quite frankly, I gave only 8* because there are other movies I'd rather watch before this one, but I can't really find anything wrong with it.If you want to see a simple touching romance that will have men interested to watch, this is for you.",8,1,3,21 April 2013

","Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is an action hero movie set in the dark ages. It's a roller coaster with almost non-stop fighting.The premise of the movie is quite interesting, and well developed. The special effects are top- notch, the sets very immersive, the camera moves just right, and the soundtrack solid.However, the story is weak, the suspense even more so, the dialogs are no more than minimalist, and the characters very shallow, but well acted.All of that being said, it's still excellent entertainment, especially on a large screen. The 3D is very well done, no panning at all. I saw it in IMAX, and I wasn't disappointed.Want your action fantasy fix? That's what it's for.",7,5,10,7 February 2013
Jarhead," A war where soldiers do not fight makes for an interesting war movie
","Jarhead is a good view of what a foot soldier feels like in a modern war with no gorilla warfare or street fighting, which was the case in the first Gulf War.The good. Excellent photography. Solid characters. Realistic interactions and situations.The actors. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as the bright recruit. Peter Sarsgaard is just as good as the guy for whom being a marine is everything. Jamie Foxx once again sets aside his 'thing' to give us a brilliant performance as the career under-officer. Other good mentions include: Brian Geraghty, Lucas Black, and Scott MacDonaldThe bad. The drill sergeant is not credible enough.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A straight face view from the ground of the first Gulf War as well as soldier camaraderie.",8,0,1,12 June 2013
Collateral," Collateral — Slow, moody, and tense, it's a great watch
","Collateral is a crime movie like few others, by Michael Mann.The good. Great score. Excellent music. Solid and logical scenario. Captivating story. Nicely built characters with good depth, except for Felix and the FBI agents. Good camera work, if with some odd choices at time. The mood is impeccably set. It's smoothly done, slowly built up, and it's kept throughout the flick.The actors. Tom Cruise makes his first appearance as a criminal, and he gives us a great performance. Jamie Foxx is not doing his 'thing', and by doing that, he perfectly complements Cruise. His character is the opposite of what he usually does, showing his true capabilities. It's a turning point for both actors.The bad. NothingThe ugly. She keeps running with her high heels. Seriously?The result. A great film with action, mood, intrigue, and even some romance. Easily something a lady could watch.",9,3,4,26 May 2013
Dark City," A bewildering situation full of questions without answers
","Dark City is one of those movies that is very difficult to categorized. It makes us experience something truly unique.The good. Extremely imaginative setup. Very dark. Strong intrigue with multiple parts that keeps us guessing for most of the movie.The actors. Rufus Sewell gives us a solid performance as the main confused protagonist, and we feel just like him. On the other hand, as a watcher, it is William Hurt playing the detective who leads our inquiries, trying to understand the mystery as we would. The ever beautiful Jennifer Connelly is adorable in her gentle role. Kiefer Sutherland gives strange ticks to the persona he is playing, making him seem slightly fake.The bad. The green screen shot are poor, and fortunately somewhat rare. The rest of the special effect imperfections can be viewed as 'stylish' and more easily absorbed. The final fight is a bit too simple.The ugly. That dying critter near the end that looks almost pixelated.The result. Quite a stupefying ride. Recommended to anyone, especially lovers of strange intrigues.",9,5,9,14 June 2013
Ratatouille," Ratatouille — Be mesmerized and transported to a different world with novel ideas
","Ratatouille is the kind of animated movie that mesmerizes you with its details, inventiveness, and story.The subject matter is simply a genius idea. Rats have been used before as animated characters, but never like this. Their world is unreal, but somehow, anchored in reality. The sheer amount of details each scenes has is mind blowing. The dialogs are strong and well thought out. The scenario impeccable and won't let you go once its starts. The voice acting is superb. All of it, pure Pixar.On an interesting note: apparently, they finally got the hang of animating wet fur, and seem pretty close on getting it for wet hair.The only negative thing I can find is that Skinner and Anton Ego are both designed a bit too strongly on the 'evil' side, which is not a habit for Pixar. However, that's very minor, and they both fit very well in the decor.A must see.",10,3,5,28 March 2013
Aliens," Aliens — Colonial marines locked in firefights with alien bugs, a must see
","Aliens is an other incredible sci-fi by James Cameron done in his early days. A thrilling action packed sequel to the original masterpiece, Alien.The good. Action, lots of it. Well thought out characters. Captivating and thrilling story. Very diversified scenario. Many surprises. Same meticulous setup. Even stronger female lead. Dark human ambitions still manipulating events. Spectacular climactic event.The actors. Sigourney Weaver gives us an other great performance as the now legendary heroic survivor. Michael Biehn is the mellow corporal Hicks who grounds us and Ripley in a solid fashion. Paul Reiser manages a great performance where you just love to hate him. Lance Henriksen, as Bishop, shares with us his calm demeanor while looking completely innocent. And Bill Paxton gives an amazing performance as the high strung over-confident braggart.The meh. The power loaders are great, but could have been done just a little better. Some of the special effects are showing a bit of age, but everything taken into consideration, it's barely noticeable.The bad. Apone's pre-drop rousing orders. Compared to the rest of the dialogs, it's a little weak.The ugly. Nothing. It's too good for that.Th result. A horror movie packed with combat action scenes and lots of firepower. It doesn't get any better than that. See it.",9,0,1,1 May 2013
Now You See Me," A great show for the masses
","Now You See Me is about imagination and what you can make out of life if you're willing to take risks.The good. Beautiful. Really makes you smile. Great tricks. Captivating intrigue with good distractions. Solid suspense. Very funny situations and dialogs. Nice slick finish to the production. Excellent special effects. Most entertaining. Love all the choices of actors, they were excellent and well cast.The actors. Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, and Isla Fisher are the top actors. To a lesser degree, but still very much appreciable: Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine.The bad. Too quick an intro. The end lacks some punch. The bridge accident was a bit much. If you pay attention you can predict a thing or two.The ugly. Nothing.The result. See it, you won't regret it.",8,0,2,28 June 2013
Ocean's Eleven," Come for the stars, stay for the entertainment
","Ocean's Eleven is a high stake crime caper.The good. Tight and intelligent scheme with clock-work precision. Well paced, well built scenario. Very interesting story. Funny dialogs and situations. A bit of romance. Diverse characters. Extremely slick finish to the movie. Solid acting.The actors. A slew of well known names. My favorite interactions are between George Clooney and Brad Pitt: professional, dry, relax and hilarious with no excess. To an only slightly lesser degree, their exchanges with Matt Damon. Loved Don Cheadle's work, very funny. So were the performance of Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as the two constantly arguing and slightly demented brothers.The bad. It's not bringing anything new to the genre. A few logical flaws, but it took me several viewing to notice them.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Excellent entertainment, with a bit of everything for everyone.",8,0,1,24 June 2013
The Usual Suspects," The Usual Suspects — Criminals versus criminals, and everyone chasing their own tail
","The Usual Suspects your typical let's twist the tale around to keep you from guessing who's doing what. You get criminals who catch criminals in a bind to get them to do a coup for them. Nothing new.The story is interesting and keeps you attentive. The action is nice, but tame by today's standard. The plot is not too complicated, if confusing at first.However, the lines the characters feed us are a little too slick, and some of the acting is a bit over done, especially on the part of Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin. Benicio Del Toro is unfortunately not at his best, while Kevin Spacey presents the top performance of the lot, and the rest of the cast gives only an acceptable one, but not much better.If you like criminal intrigue, you probably will like it.",7,1,1,13 March 2013
The Butterfly Effect," The Butterfly Effect â€” A sci-fi suspense about alternate life timeline
","The Butterfly Effect is a gripping suspense. I saw it twice in theatre and both time I was in thrall of the scenario, the first time, I even jumped out of my seat. It's imaginative, with flawless logic and powerful character buildup.It puts up Ashton Kutcher as a major actor by showcasing his more dramatic and serious side. The romance leads the story, but remains a side character. What really captivates the audience are the questions: 'What will happen next?' and 'Why did it happen?' What keeps us coming back, is the details and the soulful rendition of each persona. You might love them, you might hate them, but you sure want to see them again.This should be on everyone watch list. Do not miss it. Rent it, buy it, or borrow it, but you must see this.",10,1,2,9 December 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck-It Ralph — Video games have a life of their own, you know
","Wreck-It Ralph was a movie that I was anticipating because I loved the idea behind it. That's usually a bad sign. Too much anticipation can ruin an experience. To my great joy, it wasn't the case. The movie delivered what the preview promised, except for one thing, you spend a greater part of the movie in a single video game world.The animation is excellent, the story interesting, the basic idea pretty novel, and the characters lovable. They were even able to insert a pretty dramatic and heart wrenching scene as well as a hero finish. You can't ask for much else.It's an all around excellent animation film, and if you're even slightly interested in video games, especially those old 8-bits ones as well as how it all evolved and the different types of games, you'll be in heaven.Go see it on the big screen.",9,3,4,8 January 2013
To Rome With Love," Interesting tales about dreams and desires
","To Rome with Love is an eclectic mix by Woody Allen. You find reality shoved in side by side with memory and fantasy for a surprising picture of dreams and desires battling reason and facts. If there's a moral you can take out of it, it's probably: don't take yourself or life too seriously.The good. Sincere and very interesting story that works to make us think. Nicely paced scenario. Solid dialogs.The actors. A star studded cast with nice results. I'll just name a few here: Penélope Cruz, Ellen Page, Jesse Eisenberg, Alec Baldwin, and Roberto Benigni.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A nice change of pace from most films produced these days.",7,1,3,12 June 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit — A true treasure, and now the new top fantasy movie
","The Hobbit has always been the little brother book of The Lord of the Rings. However, in their movie version, it feels the other way around.For one, technology for CGI is better due to a number of years of innovation. Then, each camera shot looks fuller, as if, maybe due to greater CGI, Peter Jackson had stuffed more details everywhere. That's probably not the case, because after reviewing all the work that went into TLOTR, it seems impossible to do better. Maybe he simply got bolder.One thing is certain though, he, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens got really comfortable with Tolkien's work, enough to get creative, and deviate from the book on many occasions. With the help of a new addition to their team these forays completely respect the spirit the original work, as well as pick information out of The Silmarillion and TLOTR. I must warn fans though, that they do play with the original timeline of certain external event unrelated to The Hobbit.That being said, it's a roller coaster of a movie, especially once in the goblin caves. The encounter with Gollum is priceless. The dialogs are fuller than TLOTR, there's no statements of the obvious like Legolas was wont to do, no over-sentimental lines, and no waste of time. I credit the writers and director's heighten confidence.Even with all that, the council in Rivendell felt a bit weak, but it's the only scene that let me down. There's also the annoying detail about Thrain having a mental illness. I don't remember any such thing, he was no different than any other dwarf in that respect, and it adds nothing to the story. Those are the only negative things I have to say about the movie.If you want magic, adventure and fantasy, it's now the ultimate movie. Go see it in IMAX. The 3D has too many panning in the beginning, giving us more blurs than I care for, but it gets better fast.It's a must, for anyone, and everyone who doesn't mind 3h40min at the theater. The IMAX seats are a blessing in that sense.",10,13,24,11 January 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Tough, real, touching, and superb
","Saving Private Ryan is the best Second World War movie ever made.The good. Almost everything could be listed here as exceptional, but I'll just mention what really makes this a master piece. First and foremost, the fighting and how it's depicted. You feel the same stress, terror, and confusion as the soldiers. There are some heroics, but it's normal man heroics. Men die by the score, there's no favorites. It's dirty, it's loud, it's dangerous, it's inhumane. Beyond that, you've got an incredibly compelling story, amazing photography, a rich scenario, very attaching and real characters, as well as interesting thoughtful dialogs.The actors. There are so many excellent ones, and a number that were on the cusp of their stardom. Tom Hanks is of course in one of his best incarnation ever. Tom Sizemore is the perfect solid loyal sergent. Paul Giamatti has a small role, but without contest one of his best by playing his normal edgy style in a war context with a thin veneer of authority and calm. Edward Burns is just right as the loud mouth New Yorker. And you cheer Barry Pepper as the God blessed sniper. Now for a few surprises. Giovanni Ribisi, playing a bit far from his usual role, is excellent as the overwhelmed caring medic. Dennis Farina, which I normally do not like, is a stoic senior officer with an calm aura. You can also see a young Nathan Fillion in a quick cameo. Here, one might argue whether Matt Damon was given a large role or not, but he did carry it out well, if a bit subpar for him. However, the truly big surprise is the appearance of Vin Diesel playing something completely out of his usual affectations with credible results.The bad. It's a near perfect film, but there's one thing that irked me. The family of the veteran was either badly chosen of badly directed. When he starts to cry they all act as if it was a big surprise. Really? What did you think he was going to do?The ugly. Nothing.The result. Be ready for some tough bloody scenes, and you'll love this realistic representation of war.",10,2,3,6 June 2013
Django Unchained," Django Unchained — A violent bloody western by Quentin Tarantino
","Django Unchained is what a western looks like if done by Quentin Tarantino. It's the type of movie that makes you want to scream for revenge.Everything is to perfection, and I mean it. The acting is superb, without par. First, from looking at the preview, I thought that Leonardo Dicaprio's character would get on my nerve. Not the case, it fits in perfectly. Jamie Foxx, ever since Collateral, he's been able to play a greater range of personas, and it shows here. It's too bad Kerry Washington doesn't have more scenes, I love her. Finally, Christoph Waltz is the glue of that movie with his strong character.The soundtrack, the camera shots, the editing, the dialogs, the story, the scenario, all without flaws. When it's slow, it's setting the events in motion, or building background. When it's fast, it's a roller coaster. Those 165min are a breeze.There's a single very small thing that was wrong. You'll see the lady go in the wrong direction when she gets shot. That was weird.If you don't mind blood, and lots of it, true to Tarantino, it's a must.",10,1,4,15 January 2013
Bolt," Bolt — A animation buddy picture with action and fun
","Bolt is a funny animation movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults that are kids at heart. The humor is not multilayered so that you can enjoy it on a number of different levels, but it's hilarious.As far as I'm concerned, Rhino is the laugh star of this ensemble, close behind are the pigeons. Bolt, even though adorable, is the least funny one of the cast, probably because he's such a straight face hero. I won't rob him of his glory though, because we want him exactly like that, he's driving the whole film. Mitten fits right in as the unwilling sidekick.The story is very engaging, if without any surprising ideas. The intro is a blast of super powered action. The dialogs are good. The animation is sweet with bright colors and very effective. Voice acting is nice and without any reproach.I'd say it's a solid animation, just lacking a bit of depth.",8,1,2,26 January 2013
The Incredibles," The Incredibles — An animation movie about a family of super heroes and their trouble
","The Incredibles is the kind of animation you can't stop watching.For one, the number of details is incredible and the attention to them, phenomenal. Example: watch how they aged the parents, physiologically, both of them. That will show you what I mean.The graphics are flawless, except for wet hair. Pixar hadn't yet found a solution to that problem. The dialogs and the scenes will capture the attention of everyone since you can have fun with the slap stick stuff and the action, or see the problems the couple has as well as each individuals. Many parents will recognize recurring household frictions and dynamics.The scenario is rich in adventure, super heroes, and some villains. The architecture and designs will make you think of 'modern' world imagined during the 60s. It's quite impressive. The drawing themselves have a particular style that is very attractive and different from what's out there.By the end, you'd wish to see ten more movies in that same world, that's how interesting it is.It's a must.",10,0,0,14 January 2013
I Am Legend," I Am Legend — The extinction of the human race, zombies everywhere
","I Am Legend is an other spin on the zombie apocalypse. In this one, the emphasis is on the mental state of a survivor trying to find the cure and the ambiance of New York three years down the road.Will Smith does a great job of putting us in the boots of that recluse, and makes us feel everyone of his challenges. The set are well made. The story is interesting. The mood is riveting, especially the first time you see it. You're quickly immersed and taken for a ride.Now for the negative. The CG animals are missing a tiny bit of realism, probably due to the limitations of the technology at the time. However, the biggest mistake is the ending. It should have stopped after the lab explosion. The rest is just post test screening adjustments crap.If you like Will Smith, zombies, or post-apocalyptic situation, you'll be in for a nice ride. The rest of you should at least consider seeing it, it's worth your time.",7,1,2,5 April 2013
The Game," The Game — Tightly woven suspense with great attention to details
","The Game is a great suspense by David Fincher that will keep you guessing until the very end. The quality is evident, because its age doesn't show at all.The sound environment and music are extremely well thought out to completely immerse you in the game. Rich set and wardrobe, as well as smooth camera work and editing will completely cocoon you, keeping your attention well riveted on the screen. The scenario will captivate and won't release you before the movie ends, with a series of intriguing and tightly woven scenes.This is one of my favorite role of Michael Douglas, even better than Wall Street (review upcoming) because he's less of an ass hole here.Watch it for the first time, and you'll see, you'll wish to be able to watch it for the first time again.",9,2,3,17 February 2013
Transformers," Transformers — A lot of bang, action, and special effects
","Transformers, the first installment, brought me back to my childhood right away, especially since they got the original voice for Optimus Prime, my unconditional favorite. With impeccable visuals and special effects, seeing on the big screen was an incredible experience for me.Even without watching it in theater, it's a lot of fun. It's a roller coaster thrill ride, with a punchy soundtrack of epic proportion and likable characters.Now for the bad. The dialogs are a bit too easy, it kept to its roots in that aspect. Shia Laboeuf's character can be a bit unnerving with its over-dialoging, especially in the beginning, since you haven't really had time to get to know him. The story line is unimaginative and the characters one dimensional. Finally, lots of departure from the original stories and robot design can break the mood for hardcore fans. That last was most probably to please a new generation and have all cars of American design, which is really lame.That being said, it's difficult not to enjoy this flick, if only on a superficial level. The men in the audience will certainly appreciate Megan Fox.",7,0,2,21 December 2012
Wimbledon," Wimbledon â€” A sweet romantic comedy with spunk and sport
","Wimbledon is a sweet, unpretentious, high flying, romantic comedy. The humor is intellectual, with interesting British dialogs without slangs or complications, and full of funny expressions.Paul Bettany has a number of subtle facial/body expression that are just the right spice for the tone of the movie. Although I always find it difficult to accept Kristen Dunst has playing a star, she's more suited as an athletic star and perfect as Paul Bettany's opposite, bringing spunk like she can easily do.The setting of the movie is quite interesting, and the shots beautiful. More over, the story has a full figure, and is peppered with interesting details. You can feel the English fever for Wimbledon, and the soundtrack is quite appropriate.Only a few things mar this beauty. First, most court commentators sound like their reading their script, especially McEnroe and Evert. Second, the tennis itself, while well edited, shows flaws from time to time.That being said, it is my favorite romantic comedy because it has everything and does it all right just like I want it.A must see.",8,2,2,6 January 2013
Lincoln," Lincoln — Idolization of an historic figure at an important time
","Lincoln solidly portray the time at the end of the United States' Civil War, specifically concerning the costumes, the decor, and probably the political proceedings. However, idealization of this important historical figure taints the result.The visuals are just perfect, to the point of giving the pellicle a light grainy quality to get you in the mood. The closeness of the 19th century architecture as well as it lighting capabilities are well represented. You get an almost cozy feeling. The acting is excellent. I particularly liked Tommy Lee Jones' character, although it wasn't much of a stretch for him, it was funny.If you're a US citizen, it's probably a must. For the rest of us, it's an interesting subject, done extremely well.",7,0,1,19 February 2013
Empire Records," Empire Records — Mostly marginal kids working in a record shop as solace
","Empire Records is funny and slightly offbeat teen movie. A well built one, which each quirky character having a well defined personality, a set of problems, and realistic interactions with each other. Their personas all ring solidly true, each with deep emotional affects. However, not everybody will see themselves represented here, it is but a thin slice of society.The music is good, the dialogs are interesting just like the story, and it keeps an overall positive tone, although it does talk about some serious issues. It touches each subjects lightly, and keep the focus on the what is happening, on the development of the situation.You will be entertained, if you're looking for a good adolescent flick.",7,8,9,6 February 2013
Garden State," Garden State — A young man's emotionless life being challenged in the face of change
","Garden State is a low key movie about the importance of emotions and living your life.Nice score with excellent editing and photography make for a great ambiance. It's simple, yet effective. You get quickly plunged in the world of the main character and see with his eyes. Life is messed up, but you have to start making sense of yours at some point. The story is a short and important journey in his life, and the details are at times funny, but always interesting.As a writer-director playing the main role of this flick, Zach Braff did an incredible job. I like him as an actor, but I didn't know he had the talent for the rest. Playing opposite him is the talented Natalie Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard, who both deliver a very good performance. I'm not sure about the quality of Ian Holm work's here, it difficult to say, but at least on par with the rest of the cast who did a good job.The only negative thing I could say is that the very final moment, is offbeat from the rest of the movie.If you want to see something different that will make you think and have a few laughs with a touch of romance, this is it.",9,0,0,2 March 2013
Casualties of War," A troubling movie on a terrible fact of war
","Casualties of War shows that war can be ugly for more than the obvious reasons. A great dramatic piece by Brian De Palma.The good. Excellent score. Once past the intro, powerful mood. Riveting story. Well built scenario, very logical and nicely paced. Emotionally disturbing.The actors. Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn are just perfect as antagonist. Don Harvey fits his crazy role very well. John C. Reilly plays the simpleton with convincing clarity. And I'll just mention in passing a good performance by Ving Rhames.The bad. The initial jungle scenes lack realism, as well as some over-acting by the black guy in the first part.The ugly. Nothing.The result. An emotional and brutal movie. Not for the faint of heart.",8,4,4,10 June 2013
Jerry Maguire," Jerry Maguire — Watch it for the romance and be entertained by the antics
","Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. 'You had me at Hello' and 'You complete me' are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances.The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions.The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Renée Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother.The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor.The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines.The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.",7,1,1,3 May 2013
Toy Story," Toy Story — An incomparable animation about toys' secret life
","Toy Story, the first of the series, was a spectacular achievement. Not only was it completely rendered digitally, the quality was very high to equal or better most standard animation, but it was actually excellent fun. On top of that, you had the novel idea of a toy's secret life, a great story, awesome voice acting, lots of jokes, a bit of drama, some suspense, real life conflicts of personality, solid dialogs, and some heroics, all of which resulted in a complete package that anyone of any age can appreciate.The cast distribution was done smartly, each actor corresponding perfectly to their characters. The soundtrack was discreet and avoided a big sing along, which is a blessing.The only thing that could be thought of as negative was the technology limitation at the time. The colors are a bit stiff, lacking a bit of shadowing and lighting, but it's really minimal, certainly not enough to distract from this quality piece.I highly recommend it unless you're not interested in animation at all.",9,0,0,17 February 2013
Toy Story 2," Toy Story 2 — An even better story about toys' secret life
","Toy Story 2 follows up in the steps of a great vision, Toy Story, with the same attention to quality and even better animation rendering. This time, they brought in a bit more drama and adventure. They bring very close to home some very difficult things for a toy, namely when discarded by a beloved child or never being own by a child.Even with this added drama, it is still just as fun and well done. Our characters go off the deep end and into the city to rescue their friend. The story is captivating, and you'll be reunited with all our favorite characters.If you liked the first installment, you'll love this one.",10,0,1,17 February 2013
Groundhog Day," Groundhog Day — A deceptively sweet comedy packed with details and some romance
","Groundhog Day is one of my very favorite movie. I watch it on a regular basis because it is packed with details. It's easy to appreciate right away, but its richness takes a while to seep into you because of the subtle way it's presented to you. Only a year ago I finally understood the depth of the evolution of the main character.It's funny, the laughs are numerous and the humor contagious. The romance is key, but almost secondary. The cameraman and the insurance salesman are the only characters that really tick me off, but they still fit well within the whole movie and do not detract you from appreciating this little marvel.The dialogs, which are Bill Murray's strong suite, are excellent. The scenario is without flaw, none whatsoever.It's a must see movie, even if it's a family movie.Enjoy!",10,2,5,8 December 2012
Jack Reacher," Jack Reacher — The man you want investigating your case
","Jack Reacher is to investigation what Jason Bourne is to spying, he kicks ass.This movie is well built and has a captivating story. The women will be seduced by Tom Cruise and the men by Rosamund Pike. They both play their character very well, and even though these are very stereotypical, their interactions aren't. You'll be surprised.The action is tight, explosive, and violent. No punches are pulled. The bad guys are bad, the good guys are good, but there are no caricatures. The editing is excellent, and at times, surprising.My main gripe in all of this is that a mobster would have an army, not a handful. The minor things center around Jack Reacher. He pulls a couple supreme good guy stunts, but all in all, we love him for it.See it on the big screen is you can. It's a must if you want action.",8,4,11,5 February 2013
Les Misérables," Les Misérables — A movie about a French revolution that failed to match the stage version
","Les Misérables failed to even come close to what a good stage version can be like. We spend the whole movie in close up of people singing. I mean, at that point, why not just distribute the soundtrack and not bother with any visuals.The few wide shots are pitifully staged, rendered in shameful CG for our age, barely give a sense of where we are, and, in the case of the funeral procession, are accompanied by awful sounding crowd singing.I'm not sure the big name actors can really sing or not, I'm not an expert, but what's sure is that it wouldn't have been too difficult to get better results, with lesser known people.Don't see it, unless you have no way of seeing a professional stage version, and even then...",4,2,7,31 January 2013
The Untouchables," The Untouchables — The story of Eliot Ness taking down Al Capone
","The Untouchables, by Brian De Palma, was quite a hit when it came out and for good causes. Action, violence, and blood done with a touch of class, a solid dose of heroism, and some drama.The theme music is excellent. The rest of the soundtrack, though, is not always up to the same standard. Sean Connery is very good, as well as Robert De Niro. The same cannot be said for the others, like Kevin Costner who did give a good performance, but not one of his best.The costumes are great, especially the suits, thanks to Giorgio Armani. The story is uninventive, yet interesting, even if the events seem to move along too quickly, giving us the impression that everything happened at the same time. The sets are great, and detailed. However, the dialogs of the good guys are rather simplistic, to the exception of Connery's.The film is good entertainment, especially if you like old prohibition cops versus gangster flicks.",7,0,0,21 February 2013

","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is all about seeing two sexy actors in action... fighting, not sexing.The good. Excellent action, well built. Very slick finish to the production. Interesting technologies. Funny quips and situations. Nice acting.The actors. It wasn't any acting stretch for Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie and they both delivered what the movie promised. Vince Vaughn did a bit of his thing, nicely so, without going over the top.The bad. Empty story.The ugly. Ridiculous reason to set them one against the other, and executed, by each agency, in a stupid manner. No working business would do that like that, it wastes too much resources. The last big gunfight doesn't work.The result. It's entertainment, but barely. Only for those who like Pitt and Jolie or are action addicts.",6,0,3,23 June 2013

The action, the humor, the story line, the dialogs, and the setting make for great entertainment.Bruce Willis created an incredibly adorable yet truly heroic character. You love everyone of his taunts, his language, the way he pushes himself to beat the odds, and his view on what's right.There are only no real negative things I could find, only small stuff. One is that there are a few 80s elements clearly visible in the film that haven't aged well, like the way the coke snorter is played and some of the female hair styles are done. Two, from time to time, Alan Rickman pushes his acting a bit far on the caricature end.Beyond that, even with age, it's a great action flick.",8,1,2,26 February 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero Dark Thirty — A tracking tale told from the basic ground work point of view
","Zero Dark Thirty is telling the story about a possible series of event that could have led to the assassination of Osama bin Laden. Unlike what the subject matter and the trailer could lead us to believe, this is not a military movie or even a high octane flick. No, this is the relentless pursuit of a single goal by the CIA, and all the ground work it required. The point of view adopted is somewhat unusual, but absolutely excellent.At first, you are shocked by the initial introduction to what it really meant originally. After capturing your attention, the film pulls you deep within the folds of the operation, the paperwork, the interrogations, the videos, the calls, the meetings, the orders... It sounds boring, but somehow, it keeps you riveted.The actual military action is but a small part of the whole scenario and it is treated in the same business like manner, it's not an adrenaline rush. Neither is it a detached affair. You really feel the intensity. The whole flick has very personal feel, you get into the shoes of those working on the whole operation, from every perspectives: administrative, management, investigation, interrogation... It's not just because we follow that one CIA agent, played so brilliantly by Jessica Chastain, but because we get to know everybody, even some individual in the enemy camp.I can't find even one thing to say wrong about it. I've put off seeing it because of the subject matter, thinking of seeing an other American gung-ho blow up the bad guys spectacle, but it wasn't the case. I was incredibly surprised by the treatment.Just see it.",10,8,18,7 March 2013
Love Actually," Love Actually — Watch different kinds of love all inter weaved
","Love Actually is a clever tapestry of different kinds of love, each somehow related to an other, yet independent. That kind of weaving is an art. Too disparate and the piece looses cohesion. Too tight and you can't differentiate the threads. In this particular case, it is done right.Each story is interesting and present us with various facets of love. They are all sweet, but sometimes sad, and a few times funny. You get easily attached to all the characters who are all very well acted in this star studded cast and rendered with depth and subtle emotions.It's difficult not to fall in love with these wonderful stories, and there are virtually no flaws in this film, especially when it comes to the scenario, editing, and photography.The only things that might distract you from seeing it is if you need action to watch a movie, if you can only watch a movie set around Christmas time during December, or if such kind of lives weaving doesn't interest you.Otherwise, it's a must see.",10,0,2,29 January 2013
Wedding Crashers," Wedding Crashers — A fun, sexy, quirky, comedy for all
","Wedding Crashers became an instant classic because of its mix of fun, sex, quirky characters, and light romance. Everybody from womanizers to romantics can find something they like in it.Each persona on the set has its quirks and speak their own dialect. The settings are luscious, the music excellent, the editing impeccable, the women beautiful, the complex dialogs fast paced, and the story engrossing.There are only 2 things I would say pushed the envelope too far. 1) The fact that Vince Vaughn's character has some serious issues concerning food. It just doesn't fit well with the rest. 2) Will Ferrell's character is a tad too odd, although it fits within the story, it doesn't mesh well with the others, especially with his last appearance.Watch it, you'll have fun.",8,0,0,6 January 2013
Hancock," Hancock â€” A drunk anti-hero for laughs and action
","Hancock is the odd super hero flick. You'll get a number of good laughs, some drama, and plenty of action.Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the troubled brooding angry emotional anti-hero who doesn't give a f*ck. The superb Charlize Theron gives us an other great emotional experience. And Jason Bateman is probably at his funniest as the kind hearted, right minded, tries as hard as he can good Samaritan.The scenes are well built, with nice connection between each of them. The dialogs are uproariously funny. The intrigued is well maintained. The action is interesting and diversified. The drama and the emotions are compelling, heart-tugging. And the setup is imaginative.The real problem lies in the fact that the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The action and the special effects are clearly the biggest assets, but the scenario says it's a funny piece, up until the third act, where it changes to a dramatic story. It doesn't have a cohesive whole. It feels like an introduction without the followup story. Most super hero film introducing their main character will have more meat to offer. The worst scene is the one with the French speaking kid. Remove the accent and it works.Still, it's great entertainment, especially if you like super heroes, action, or any of the principal actors.",7,1,2,7 April 2013
Hitch," Hitch — A solid modern slick romantic comedy
","Hitch is a slick romantic movie with two slick main characters. They are hot, beautiful, perfect, and the best at what they do. The only problem? They both have baggage that keeps them from love. Nothing new there.The whole movie is extremely slick. The music, the camera shots, the editing, the script... it's grandiose, and beautiful. It's most interesting feature, though, is the endearing nature of the secondary characters, and the business they're involved in.It makes for a very interesting story, something you want to be part of.The only real hiccup, is the way that she repeatedly snubs him at the end. Had I been in his shoes, she would have had a piece of my mind for being manipulated that way. However, it does fit in the movie, and I'll just lump it with all the Hollywood over exaggeration I'm always whining about.You want to see a good romantic comedy that anyone, even a man, can enjoy? That's it.",9,0,1,8 January 2013
The Terminal," The Terminal — Endearing romantic comedy set in an international airport
","The Terminal is an endearing romantic comedy with a slavic foreigner, played by Tom Hanks, trapped in an international airport due to an uprising in his fictive home country. That is an unorthodox setup. Add to that an uptight by-the-book security officer unhappy with those complications, and a beautiful female flight attendant, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, trapped in her role of mistress, and you get an idea of what's going to happen.It's an improbable, but possible, situation that gives rise to a number of comical scenes, very well played by Hanks. He's very believable in his role, showing a lot of work. Nice camera shot, transitions, soundtrack, and editing. Steven Spielberg knows his work. Zeta-Jones is perfect for her role, and is simply beautiful.The end had a few change in direction, which was appreciable, and even if it got a bit rosy, it was still pretty solid.On a side note, I thought I recognize our Montreal Mirabel airport, and after checking it out, it turned out to be so.Good entertainment, see it.",8,0,2,4 January 2013
Platoon," War is not just bullet flying, and horror is not just about blood
","Platoon is about what it means to be a grunt in the Vietnam War. A masterpiece by Oliver Stone, and definitively the best Vietnam War movie ever made.The good. This is one of those movie you could list everything here. I'll limit myself to what makes it truly special. An incredible score that leaves an indelible mark. Extremely strong psychology built into the scenario and the characters. You get right there with them, you feel the heat, the ants, the numbness... Perfect realism for the firefights, the ambushes, the battles, the camps, the duality, the interactions, and the dialogs. Superb acting.The actors. At the time Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe were big names and you can see why by the quality of their work in this piece. However, the real star here is Charlie Sheen for his portrayal of a and ex college boy and disillusioned volunteer. An other great performance, often underrated, is the one by John C. McGinley as the stringy sergeant O'Neil. This production also feature people that would eventually become much bigger in the industry, namely Forest Whitaker, Keith David and a very young Johnny Depp.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Not for the faint of heart, highly recommended for everyone else. A must for those who want to understand the horrors of war.",10,2,3,9 June 2013
The Croods," The Croods — A brutish family on a surprising and dangerous hike
","The Croods is a good prehistoric roller coaster ride. Think Ice Age, but much better.The good. Incredibly well done and well used 3D. Very colorful and excellent animation. Extremely imaginative world that has nothing to do with our past. Funny action and dialogs. Good voice acting. Surprising story, with a perception twist near the end.The actors. Nice choices of voice. Nicolas Cage gave a surprisingly good performance. Ryan Reynolds was just right for his role as was Emma Stone.The bad. I would have cut the last minute pet race. Pointless candy. The accumulation of pets and their rescue was a bit much. And the flying skeleton? Well, it's a cartoon.The ugly. Nothing really ugly, everything had its place.The result. Something the kids will enjoy a lot, while their parents have a good laugh.",7,1,1,23 April 2013
Any Given Sunday," Any Given Sunday — Can make anyone appreciate professional American football
","Any Given Sunday is the best football movie ever made, a master piece by Oliver Stone.The good. Perfect editing. The way the images are melded just sucks you right in. Great photography. Excellent score and music. Superb football action. Razor sharp dialogs. Complete characters. Solid cast that fit incredibly well together. Very involved story with a good number of sub-story, all interesting and well developed. Nicely paced scenario, with good emotional breaks and powerful action scenes. It's a long film with lots of meat and every minute is worth it, they even used the final generic to pitch us the epilogue. Nicely done. Great ending.The actors. Al Pacino is playing his best role here. He gets away from his usual angry almost psychotic roles into a more mellow and near sentimental human being, but still very much troubled and imperfect. Cameron Diaz, for once, plays a hard nut to crack, tough, nowhere near nice and she does it extremely well. Dennis Quaid plays the hero, again, and does it superbly as he always does. Jamie Foxx does his thing as the cool and bitter professional athlete.Now for the smaller roles that round up this flick and elevate it to greatness. LL Cool J plays the money grabbing star to perfection. Matthew Modine plays a institutionalized game-first team doctor who faces Aaron Eckhart as the do-gooder in a battle over the health of the player. Jim Brown is the perfect tough defensive coach with a heart of gold and a head full of the glory days. Lela Rochon is the sweet intelligent life partner of the third string quarterback. Lauren Holly is the hateful witch trying to control her legendary husband. Lawrence Taylor captures our attention as the bruised captain and keystone of the defensive team. Bill Bellamy plays a young receiver. And Andrew Bryniarski denotes himself as the rough angry offensive line man.The bad. The opposing team design. The costumes look like they were done last minute, not part of a professional football league.The ugly. Nothing, it's near damn perfect.The result. A football movie that's so well made, anyone can enjoy it. See it.",9,0,1,4 May 2013
Tombstone," Tombstone — Gunslinging with a good flair for action
","Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting.The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story.The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers.The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.",8,0,2,18 May 2013
Blade Runner," Is one of those old movies everyone should watch at least once
","Blade Runner is an other masterpiece by Ridley Scott.The good. This is an other production where you could list almost everything here. I'll just mention what really makes it special. The score is marvelous, and with the great sets, the very imaginative environment, and the multitude of details, you get immersed extremely quickly in the story. Again, Scott shows he's one of the best at setting the mood, presenting us with every piece of the puzzle, giving us a good background, and letting us float in his vision. Excellent acting on the part of all the cast. The ending really makes you think.The actors. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer are at the top of their game and it shows.The bad. It's a getting a little bit old, but it's not showing much considering it's been over three decades. Also, the timeframe of the predictions is off, but that's always the case.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A must.",9,0,2,22 June 2013
Monsters University," A must see prequel
","Monsters University is the prequel to Monsters inc., a wildly popular animation by Pixar. It's basically a college movie set in the monster world, but with a nice deviation from the standard.The good. Still the same incredibly interesting world with all its colors, fantastic creatures, and quirks. Interesting story, especially for the twist. Great animation, as usual. Easily enjoyable by adults. Perfect ending. Excellent voice acting.The bad. Lots of college movie, underdogs, and jocks versus nerds clichés.The ugly. Nothing.The result. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too.",8,61,79,9 July 2013
Trainspotting," Trainspotting — Hold on to your hats and be ready for an off-road ride
","Trainspotting is what happens when you chose something different than the rest of society.The good. The imagery, the metaphors, and the camera work plunge us right into what he's feeling, into his world. Incredible scenario. Extremely well told story. Spot on pace and length, with superb editing. Excellent ending, couldn't imagine better. Silly laughs and perspective from time to time to break the gloominess.The actors. Ewan McGregor is perfect in this hectic role. The rest of the cast is almost just as good. I'll simply mention Kelly Macdonald that totally caught my attention. Love her.The bad. The Scottish accent is a tough nut to crack. Some of the characters are difficult to understand at time.The ugly. Some scenes are difficult to watch.The result. Very entertaining. A stark image that everyone should watch.",10,1,2,16 May 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Live Free or Die Hard — Bad guys bringing down the US through hacking
","Live Free or Die Hard is the fourth installment of the franchise and the first of the revival. It is easily the best one since the original Die Hard. This time, however, the threat is much more global.You can see Bruce Willis come back as John McClane. He's still making jokes, playing the hero and recalling past episodes, but now, he's a little grumpier, and somewhat less enthusiastic about his life. With him, is Justin Long who plays a quite funny hacker, and Kevin Smith who cameos as an other hacker. Those three are definitively the best actors of the bunch. Opposite them is Timothy Oliphant who does a pretty good job in the role of the main bad guy, and the very sexy, especially in her FBI body armor, Maggie Q as the martial art babe. The rest of the cast delivers a acceptable performance, if little better.The score has some nice rhythm, the camera shots are good, the editing tight, the action big, and the story very interesting.However, there are some large logical flaws in the scenario as is always the case when it comes to computers. Usually, that's not much of a problem for most audience members. Also, there's that weird projection screen car ride that's badly done for our time, and the inconsistent reactions from the daughter. Finally, some of the stunts are way beyond human capacity, which wasn't so much a problem in the first episode.Excellent entertainment.",7,3,5,26 February 2013
X2: X-Men United," X-Men 2 — A great super powered sequel
","X-Men 2 is what should be expected of a sequel, something the fan of the original X-Men can be proud of. It helps that it was the same director, Bryan Singer.The good. The same action packed super battle, with bantering, a bit of intrigue, and an interesting story. Incredible attack on the White House. As a bonus, we're introduced to new super heroes.The actors. About the same performance.The bad. The CG doesn't show as much as in X1, but there's a bunch of logical flaws in the scenario. Not too bad, but slightly distracting. The Wolverine's hairdo is messed up in the intro and conclusion. The ugly. Nothing.The result. Yet an other good super powered action flick.",7,0,1,25 May 2013
The Sixth Sense," Sixth Sense — A powerful suspense with an intriguing story
","Sixth Sense has a powerful suspense to its story, with eloquent visuals, and great acting.You will be immerse in the drama right away, even if I consider the opening the weakest part of the movie. At first, the subject matter is pretty innocuous and Bruce Willis easily carries you into the thick of it with Haley Joel Osment along for the ride. The boy's role then turns quickly into the linchpin of the suspense, with a number of nerve jarring surprises.Once you're over the horror hill, and you think the movie is over, there's the final piece of the puzzle waiting for you. The only real downside of the whole thing, is that once you know the ending, it looses a bit of its luster, but I still enjoy watching it on a regular basis.A must see. Enjoy.",9,1,1,3 January 2013
The Purge," Turn off your brain and sharpen your machete
","The Purge is an abstract idea given form, a kind of voice for a psychotic fantasy. Gratuitous violence served cold.The good. Great idea for a movie. Well done suspense. A few nice twists in the story. Perfect ending.The bad. Subpar acting for the most part. A few logical flaws, but not too many.The ugly. Characters without any depth.The result. For thrill seekers who like novel ideas. Others should probably abstain.On a personal note, I was not able to suspend my disbelief concerning that future. To me, this is completely impossible. I even find the idea untenable. To me, what makes us human is our ability to go beyond our animal instincts.I think this flick would have been much if they had explored more of this night instead of focusing on a single house. It might have given the opportunity to experiences unintended consequences or other interesting concepts.",6,1,2,13 June 2013
The Truman Show," The Truman Show — Exposing reality TV, and giving a sweet tale to make you think
","The Truman Show is a tale that will tug at your heart strings. It's the movie that showed the world that Jim Carrey could play drama. His wild gesticulating or face distortion barely make an appearance compared to his previous incarnations.The film feels a little tacky, but it's dealing with a tacky subject: reality TV. It rode the wave of its inception as well as initial popularity and at the same time as it was making fun of it. Each character, but the main one, is a caricature of reality TV and its entourage, even its dissidents. It feels as fake as its subject, yet it brings important points. Is happy ignorance better than truth? Do you define yourself, or does your environment?The sweetness of it all will capture you. Truman's predicament will rivet you. The last scene will move you.See it, it's worth it.",8,6,8,11 January 2013
The Matrix," The Matrix â€” The domination of the machine, the enslavement of the humans
","The Matrix, the first installment of the trilogy, is a master piece, not so much in terms of movie mechanics, but in terms of story telling. The ideas it brings, not the concept of the domination of the machines, but how that domination is achieved, are stupendous. They are mind breaking.The first time I saw that film, I didn't know what I was going to see, and it felt like a punch in the guts. I consider myself lucky, because that is a rare thing. Still, it is a piece to catch anyone's breath.The soundtrack is one of the best ever, bar only The Crow (review upcoming). The costume are perfectly tailored and adapted to the tone of each environments. The mood is excellent, at all time. They even applied a greenish tinge when they are in the matrix, a blueish one in the cold real world, and you'll see only normal colors when they are in the training programs.The action and suspense will keep you wanting more, the story will light up your mind, and the fight scenes will push you to the edge of your seat.Some special effects, mainly the CGI, are not aging very well, but the work is still acceptable today.This is probably one of Keanu Reeves' best performance. He's not a great actor, but the role fits him well. His performance as well as Carrie-Anne Moss' are not as good in the following installments. Those two movies are barely good enough to tell the rest of the story, and are not even close to the quality of the first one. I will not be reviewing them.",10,0,0,11 February 2013
Heat," Heat — High stake efficiently brutal holdups and two razor sharp minds
","Heat is the quintessential dark and dramatic cops and robber movie. It puts the best holdup crew against the best lead investigator in high stake complex scores. It's brutal, it's raw, it's crime, pure and simple. There's violence, however, it's a very more of a dramatic piece. The real juice is the opposition of the two mind, it's psychological.The score gives shiver. The photography transfixes. The acting plunges you deeply within the fabric of the movie. The story is ultra captivating. The action is breathtaking, yet simple and very real. The characters are well layered and with lots of emotional depth, yet easy to understand.You spend a lot of time with the two protagonists. You see their daily life. You get to know them. Robert De Niro plays a stone hard persona, efficient and brutally direct when needed. He's the criminal, yet he's almost endearing. Al Pacino plays a fiery angry cop who will stop at nothing, just keeping in sight of the law, to get his man. He's easy to hate, the way he yells and shut out his family life.The star studded cast who performed so well also includes: Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Justine Hanna, Ashley Judd, Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo, plus a very young Natalie Portman playing a small yet powerful role as the step daughter of the main detective. In her portrayal you can already see the great actress she became.It's a must see.",10,1,5,27 March 2013
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Four — Very light but full of action
","Fantastic Four is a worthy representation of those super heroes.The good. Great quips, bantering, and funny lines. Solid action. Nice special effects.The actors. Jessica Alba makes Sue Storm even better, stronger, more intelligent, and with more character than in the comics. A big improvement, and a very hot one! Chris Evans is the perfect Torch, smart ass and spectacular, even though the comic character was much more PC. Ioan Gruffudd didn't give us a great performance as Richard Reed, and presented a weaker persona than in the books. Michael Chiklis is a good actor, but his Thing suit is disappointing. And Julian McMahon, even though he's not a stellar actor plays the arrogant sociopath Dr. Doom brilliantly.The bad. Easy dialogs with little meaningful content. Very light story, it's surprising that it runs over 2h.The ugly. The breakup between Ben Grimm and his wife is too quick, we can't feel it.The result. Nice entertainment if you appreciate super heroes or action.",7,2,3,27 May 2013
Sin City," Sin City — Good versus evil, blood, violence, action, in comic book style
","Sin City comes straight out of its comic book pages with its incredible visuals. It presents you with gritty heroes who'll get their hands dirty to make sure good triumphs over evil, and you'll cheer them on with all your heart. They are confronted with the worst of the worst kind of human beings imaginable.Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez team up, with extra director Quentin Tarantino to deliver a violent and very bloody movie that fortunately doesn't show it too much because of the visual style.My favorite story is gladiator one, then the cop with a heart problem.Mickey Rourke is perfect as the violent yet dame-friendly super killing machine. Bruce Willis is just as good with the cop who will give anything to protect a young innocent girl. Jessica Alba is the sweetest, hottest, most adorable stripper you'll ever meet. Rosario Dawson is spectacular as the valkyrie hooker. Brittany Murphy is right on as the abuse victim waitress. Rutger Hauer has the small part of the cardinal but plays it well. Finally, it's probably Clive Owen's best career performance, since his acting range is rather limited.The dialogs might be a bit weak at times, but it is keeping with the style of the film, so there's no faulting them. Some acting, mostly from the extras is rather unsatisfying, but it's not too distracting.In conclusion, if you want action, violence, and good versus evil, all done in a very special visual style, this is it.",9,2,3,19 February 2013
The Breakfast Club," The Breakfast Club — High school detention and colliding personalities on a Saturday
","The Breakfast Club presents to us the five archetype of high school students. Every kid can find himself in those, if not in true form, by the mix of two of them. Even today, it holds true, if the lingo doesn't. I'm not talking about cliques, I'm talking about personality and acceptability.This is John Hughes' master piece in term of analyzing the teenage mind. You're faced with what makes somebody cool, why you get rejected, the walls that are built between the groups, and how they are built, maintained. You get the different angst they face every day: from parental abuse to parental absence, from peer pressure to bullying, from delinquency to suicide.Those very opposite characters are put together and confronted with each other's reality. As they argue, squabble, and fight, they never forget to form common cause against their oppressors.There's nothing negative about this movie, it's just starting to date a bit, but not too much. Hughes did a great job to keep the 80s out of his film as much as possible. The only thing that can irk, is some bits of youth lingo which is now outdated. Fortunately, very little is used, and the rest is still current.You have to see this, but keep in mind the release date and that it's all happening in the library. A single set.",10,1,1,28 January 2013
Gladiator," Gladiator — A violent and grandiose clash of titans in the ancient grimy world or Rome
","Gladiator has it all. A great story that, even with the old revenge idea, will pick you up and plunge you right in. Gloriously grandiose shots that will fill your eyes and your imagination. Acting that will never take you for granted and just give you real emotions. Dialogs that are well thought, and will only be simple if it fits the scene or the character. Smooth editing and excellent score to be bettered only by the best. And, finally, action with grimy characters that gives this movie the heartbeat of a titan.The opening scene is particularly exceptional. The intrigue gets going pretty quickly putting our unwilling hero in a real and fatal mess. Each piece of the drama is put in place carefully, until everything comes together and the clash happens. It's one of Ridley Scott's great movies.Russel Crowe is the perfect hero, Joaquin Phoenix is truly mad, and both are irresistibly aimed at each other. Connie Nielsen play a very frightened sister that's at the same time courageous, yet worried about her son.This time, I tried listening to it with a very critical eye and I found only the last moment of clarity of Maximus, when he gives his last order, to be a weak and somewhat artificial moment. Beyond that, unlike him, I would have bent my neck right away, and plotted after, but that's a personal decision. It would have killed the whole paradigm right away and made me less of righteous a hero than him.Anyway you dice it or slice it, it's a must see, unless you have difficulty with violence.",10,1,2,21 January 2013
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Supremacy — Get back in the saddle for an other great ride
","The Bourne Supremacy takes place two years after the its very successful predecessor The Bourne Identity. It's the same concept and it picks up where the other left. So, however you felt about the first installment, you'll feel the same about this one.This time, the action is much more global, moving around the world. The stakes are a bit higher. The CIA team is much bigger. The action roller coaster ride is more intense. The romance is out of the picture. The story is less dark and a tiny fraction less serious.Matt Damon is just as good as in the previous episode. I wish we'd seen more of Franka Potente, because I like her and her character. Joan Allen plays her bitchy role pretty well. Brian Cox's character is the one you want to slap around this time. And Julia Stiles is perfect in the reprise of her small role. I love her in that movie, and she has the best line of the whole ensemble.What I didn't like. Those dream sequences, a bit lame and badly put together. There's also that FSB agent that is just too one-dimensional.An other great action flick.",9,1,3,24 March 2013
The Great Gatsby," The Great Gatsby — The 20s of New York in one big spectacular gulp
","The Great Gatsby is the definition of the American dream and its inherent flaws.The good. Spectacular settings. Nice intrigue. Very interesting characters. The wild, boisterous, and almost beyond imagining party scenes are well crafted and meticulously put together. The dialogs are captivating.The actors. Leonardo DiCaprio once more shows the range and quality of his acting. Joel Edgerton plays the snob to perfection. Tobey Maguire is good as the impressionable youth, but his intro felt forced a bit.The bad. The CG details are lacking realism, but it makes for a certain dream effect. There's a lack of depth in the scenario.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Incredible entertainment.",7,0,2,23 May 2013
Warm Bodies," Warm Bodies — Love with a Z as in teenage zombie romance
","Warm Bodies wants to be a new take on the zombie genre. I'll give them partial credit for the result.There's several unique elements about zombie life that really make this flick worth seeing. Its biggest novelty achievement is using a zombie apocalypse as a backdrop for a romance, and casting a zombie as one of the lover. That's definitively well done.However, this movie is fortunate to have a fresh spin, because there are many logical flaws in its scenario. More over, beyond the suspension of disbelief that comes with the concept of a zombie, you have to make an additional large concession for the healing process and how it comes about which is borderline cheesy.If you don't mind mixing teenage romance and zombies, it's nice entertainment.",7,0,2,27 March 2013
High Fidelity," High Fidelity — A movie about a breakup with humor and lots of intelligent inner monologues
","High Fidelity is another of my all time favorite. John Cusack excels at brooding philosophical monologues loaded with sarcastic humor, and this movie really makes him shine.He plays a sort of half-decent asshole which he admits being. However, the jokes and the situation makes it hard to see and kind of love him, which in turn enables you to really appreciate the whole story.The characters are well played, Jack Black is his exuberant early self, and even the other sales clerk provides us with a lovable quiet self-effaced persona (a great balance to Cusack and Black). John Cusack himself is great, if a tiny bit over the top (which makes the movie, I must say), and his sister, Joan, is particularly well casted.The dialogs are near perfect, the montage is without reproach (I especially like the one live mental alternate possibilities), and the soundtrack amazing.See it, especially if you like lots of smart text.",10,1,2,8 December 2012
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talladega Nights — Wacky testosterone charged car racing comedy
","Talladega Nights is a typical Will Ferrell movie. It features him, and his usual antics, but with a more straight face attitude appropriate to Nascar. This time, it's all about driving, good old fashion American testosterone, and dealing with your past.You can't take this flick seriously, if you do, you're missing the point. That being said, I'll have to contradict myself and talk about the French guy. The 'pépé le pew' stereotype is over the top, even for this movie. The actor, maybe at the demand of the director, really went overboard with the accent, without even bringing in anything new. At least, when they mocked American bravado in the crepe scene, they didn't make Will more brave, they fed him counter points by having all the other characters defecting, even himself and his best friends who still told him not to concede the point.Alright, that was too long.The movie is an excellent laugh, and the twist really funny, especially the instant take over of the family, the cougar, and the taming of the young ones.If you love Nascar or Will Ferrell or want to see a wacky movie, it's for you.",6,0,0,9 January 2013
