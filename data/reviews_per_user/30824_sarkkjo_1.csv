Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Disapointmet to the max
","ADHD, ADHD & ADHD. This might be be a very nice movie to the recent generation, but a huge disappointment to the friends of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Lot's of action but non of the brilliant thoughts of Sir ACD. Only action and non of the genius plots. The previous part was an OK experience, but this was made on the terms of younger audience. So if you're expecting some of the mind thrilling moves of the TRUE Sherlock Holmes, please don't expect too much. It was OK to watch, but not OK to enjoy.! Please be drunk before watching, it surely helps...",3,1,3,6 August 2012
