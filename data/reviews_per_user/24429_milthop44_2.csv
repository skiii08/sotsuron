It," Not for me
","There is almost no story in IT. 
I thought the Horror genre was getting back on track especially after watching Get out and another title I can't remember the name but I was wrong.
All the blood splashing, ugly dolls, disfigured creatures, all the nonsensical stuff you usually find in lousy horror movies were in it. 
This movie does not make sense. It's just a mix of 'try to be frightening scenes' put together with many weak connections and zero real explanations. 
The CGI part was excellent, the kid from Stranger Things was good, but it was not enough, in my opinion, to make IT a good movie.
I really thought it was going to be good. Very disappointed. It was not for me at all.",2,2,4,5 April 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Not the best Avengers movie but still okay
","I loved the first two Avengers, I thought they were amazing. I feel like this one suffered inspiration. The jokes were more irritating than funny, there were too many Super Heroes at different locations and the dialogues were poor.
The only people I was into, were Thanos (amazing) and Gamora. It's difficult to be invested in that movie because right from the beginning, you're already in the middle of some actions, and it never stops, feeling like you may have missed something.
There isn't a real plot, more of a philosophical approach that sustains the film, but a pretty good one.
Thanos was frankly genuinely amazing. The dialogues between him and Gamora were the more interesting. The battles seemed too inconsistent, too many effects, too little story. The ending on the other hand was fantastic. It saved the film. I was expecting the usual ending (good thing Thor didn't go for the head lol), and was very surprised. 
Hope to see more of Gamora and Thanos on the next episode.",8,0,2,8 September 2018
