The Ring," Quite chilling, just avoid the Japanese film beforehand (SPOILERS)
","My only advice to anyone going to see The Ring is NOT to see the original in advance. It sort of spoiled my enjoyment of this as I was constantly comparing it, in my head, to Hideo Nakata's version.That said, The Ring is still a very interesting story and manages effectively to create a tense atmosphere- maybe not as tense as Nakata's, but certainly one of the most chilling US horror movies in recent years.Gore Verbinski's take on the original Koji Suzuki novelette 'Ringu' is interesting in its own right- this is not a shot-for-shot remake (like Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake) and it was enjoyable to get another angle on the story. The opening scene, for example, is more subtle in the original, but I like what Verbinski did with it: he extended the scene a bit and ended it very well, I believe. The revelation near the end, delivered by Aidan was also a nice addition that didn't appear in the original.While a bit heavy-handed (showing us a scene in the present then showing us the corresponding scene on the tape) I think Gore Verbinski's effort was quite good.However (comparing it to the original) there were a few things I didn't like during the film (besides it stopping halfway through, the lights coming on and that awful, awful Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi starting to play!). They are as follows [MAJOR SPOILERS]: I didn't like Samara in this one- they shouldn't have shown the face and made us sympathise with her- Sadako was much creepier. And what the hell was with A) Rachel coughing up that long piece of lace and B) the scene with the horse running amok on the ferry? (it was good from a supernatural point of view, but it was bizarre!) Still though, the TV scene was very, very good and the well being under the cabin was a nice twist.The Ring is definitely worth seeing- it delivers some good shock moments with an underlying tension throughout. Perhaps not as unnerving as Nakata's, but a good horror film in its own right.(BTW: I didn't like that they tried to tie in the title with the film. The ring in the original (to the best of my knowledge) referred to the video tape getting passed from person to person not a ring of light like in this one. So I thought that was a bit stupid.)",Null,0,0,22 February 2003
Se7en," Best detective thriller ever
","With Fincher's 'Panic Room' coming out next week, I decided to watch this gem of a detective thriller from 1995. I must say, however, that I watched the butchered BBC version which (for some God unknown reason) was shown pre-watershed AND with an hour's break in-between to show the news. This did not spoil my enjoyment, though, as it's one hell of a movie.I've seen loads of detective thrillers (Kiss the Girls, Hangman, Resurrection, Along Came a Spider, etc.) and this puts them all to shame. It even seems unfair to pigeon-hole a movie this good, but anyhow there's a lot to like about it: <ul><li>The atmosphere created by Fincher is excellent, and the gloominess adds to the dark subject matter of the movie. It always seems to be dark and raining, and the filth of the city is really captured. The atmosphere is like a character all its own.</li></ul><ul><li>The acting is great. While the roles of the jaded-old-cop-near-retirement and the cocky-new-cop-on-the-block are nothing new for this genre, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt bring a fantastic freshness to the characters of Somerset and Mills, respectively. Kevin Spacey made a great John Doe, and Gwyneth Paltrow was good in her limited screen time. Another good thing was the film was never boring, as it's actually enjoyable to see Mills and Somerset interact and follow up leads. My only negative comment about the acting is Pitt goes WAY OTT on the climax. It was a bit hammy.</li></ul><ul><li>Good contrast between Freeman's disillusionment with the job (and with city life) and Pitt's eagerness to make a difference and to catch criminals. There's even a similarity between Freeman's and Spacey's characters, as both are world-weary and sick of the scum on the streets. The difference is Somerset has given up, while John Doe kills the people he believes are sinners. Is Doe Somerset's dark side?</li></ul><ul><li>Doe is a terrific serial killer- calm, rational, patient, but also menacing.</li></ul><ul><li>The ending: brilliant.</li></ul>Anyone thinking of seeing Panic Room (or have already seen it) check this out. Brilliant.",Null,0,0,29 April 2002
Final Destination 2," Good sequel **Minor Spoilers**
","Good, faithful follow-up to the original Final Destination, released 2 years ago.It starts off pretty much like the first one, with a girl [Kimberly-- A.J. Cook; Wishmaster 3] having a premonition of a huge road accident about to happen. She manages to survive, and save a few others doomed to die, but her friends aren't as lucky and she knows Death is coming back to get the survivors...
The plot is basically the same, but it does pull out some interesting surprises: the tie between the new batch of potential victims and the victims of the original is, while a bit convenient, a cool tie-in to the original, one of many.The death scenes are really well done, and the good thing about this film is that there's a lot more 'teasing' in this film from the director, showing a number of ways the victim could be 'offed' before following through with a brutal finish! Good work from David R Ellis. (The only thing missing from the death scenes in FD2 was the cool black shadow that accompanied the deaths in FD1).The acting was good (Cook, Landes and Larter particularly) also, and I only have a few gripes about FD2: Tony Todd's cameo was even more pointless than the original, Michael Landes' character seemed to be a cop merelyfor convenience purposes and the baby plot thread, while being the driving force of the second half, was a bit stupid. Overall though it's well worth seeing- the premonition of the car crash at the start was intense, the death scenes are all great (the guy cut in 3 by the barbed wire was excellent!) and it delivers a few surprises along the way. Better than FD1? I'm not sure, but it's easily as entertaining as the original.",Null,0,0,10 February 2003
Signs," Intense. A good mixture of humour & suspense [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]
","There was a fantastic atmosphere when I saw this film about a month ago. People screaming, laughing, making stupid comments (like 'That's their house!' when we're shown the illustration of a farmhouse in flames), etc. I have never been to a movie with such an amazing atmosphere before, so [on that alone] this is a movie well worth seeing.M. Night Shyamalan directs this perfectly lulling the audience in with humour, then hitting the shock moment. The sense of dread is maintained throughout the movie, as we see the Invasion from the point of view of a widowed minister who has lost his faith, his two children and his brother. It's good to see the effects of an invasion on a small-scale, as opposed to a global scale like 'Independence Day', a vehicle for Will (uh uh Big Will ha-ha ha-ha uh yi-yi-yi-yi) Smith. The effects on the family makes you CARE what happens to them, which is good, obviously, since what good is a movie if you really don't care what happens?Excellent acting all round. Shyamalan really knows how to get the best out of child actors- Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin (who got 'awww' ed everytime she said something cute) were both terrific. Gibson & Phoenix were also good as usual.I don't really see the point of doing a whole GoodStuff/BadStuff that I usually do, as the film is almost flawless. It is easily more suspenseful than 'The Others' and 'What Lies Beneath'. My friends and I started a round of applause when the film ended and, while only about 10 others joined in, it certainly deserved it. Why don't people clap at movies anymore? I can understand people not clapping if a movie was crap, but if a film is good and you've enjoyed yourself why not show your appreciation? CLAP for god's sake!",Null,0,1,8 October 2002
