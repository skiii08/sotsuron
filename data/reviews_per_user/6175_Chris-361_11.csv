Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best so far
","I don't know what all those critics were talking about...this film was AWESOME!  It was completely filled with some great action, visual effects, and plot setting.  It was cool how the characters were introduced, you should have seen how the audience clapped when we first saw C-3P0 and R2D2 (well, who doesn't love love those guys?).  Liam Neeson was great as Qui-Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor was also good as the younger Obi-Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman was a terrific Queen Amidala, although it was a little bogus to find out that the elaborately dressed up queen was actually the decoy.  Jake Lloyd...well, I guess he was okay...he wasn't as good as the others and he seemed to over-accentuate his lines.  But, he is only ten so I guess everyone should just give him a break.  Other character developments were also interesting, Senator Palpatine is obviously the future Emperor of the Darkside.  The film tried not to show this but the audience could tell anyway.  Jar Jar Binks was at times a funny comic relief character, and at other times was just flat out annoying.  The only character that was way too shallow was Darth Maul, who only had a few lines and pretty much had the personality of a toothpick.But other than that the film is a blast to watch.  It isn't very violent except for a few brief scenes at the end, but it is filled with enough blasters, ships, aliens, pods, monsters, Jedis, and Light-Saber action to keep any Star Wars fan entertained.  May the Force be with you, Mr. Lucas, don't listen to the critics.  Once again, you have created a truly masterful film.",3,0,1,22 May 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Not bad at all...
","With the credit 'Directed by Tim Burton' on the film, its easy for it to get much hype. I myself bought into the hype, and to say that I wasn't a little disappointed would be a lie.But nevertheless, this was by no means a bad movie. I was, in fact, everything it was meant to be: FUN. And fun it was.From the very beginning to the very end, you will witness heads spinning, rolling, and flying through the air with the whif of the horseman's sword. Tim Burton definately has fun with this, and really does a good job of turning it into some pretty horrific scenes.The film also had great cinematography, incredible set design, an amazing musical score, and...oh yeah...some pretty freakin' cool special effects. The acting was so so, as Johnny Depp doesn't really know how to make his character a hero, Christina Ricci was good, and so was everyone else. That also includes Christopher Walken, who plays the horseman with a head. He has no lines but just by looking at him he really puts the fear of god in your heart.So Tim Burton does it again. His goriest, weirdest, goriest, action-filled, goriest, scariest, and goriest movie to date. Did I mention that it was pretty gory? Oh, well, that's okay. If you're not of the faint of heart. So if you're not, and Tim Burton is your kind style, go see this movie and have fun.",8,0,0,19 November 1999
The Patriot," Probably will be the best of 2000
","Although (at the time of this being written) it is still the summer with much of the year 2000 to go, its probably safe to say that this will be the best film of the year. Why? Well for starters epics are always the best, this one better than May's 'Gladiator', but of course there's more to it than that.First, Robert Rodat's surprisingly good and well paced script, which was put together a lot better than 'Saving Private Ryan'. Very emotional and unafraid to hold back on the horrors of war, it never lets up. Of course, its still the same 'I'm a leader in a war even even though I didnt choose to be' kind of story, but it pulls you in and keeps pulling the tears from your eyes with every time a loveable character meets their horrible, brutal demise. (Which, as a film-maker myself, loved.)Second, Roland Emmerich's direction. I kind of expected to see flat performances and some-what boring photography, which were trademarks of 'Independence Day' and 'Godzilla', but it was instead very much the opposite. Beautiful lighting was this film's trademark as well as Gibson's great performance, like he always does.This film should definitely garner the oscar nominations this year. And if they don't, well thats because the Academy will once again shun the best of the competition like they always do. I hope that this isn't shut out like a another certain picture from the same producers and writer (you know what it is), because it definitely shouldn't.",Null,1,2,23 July 2000
Saving Private Ryan," The greatest film ever made
","Where do I even begin? Well, maybe I'll start by saying that this is the best movie ever made.  I don't know how Spielberg did it, but this movie captures you like no other.  Maybe it's his brilliant usage of hand-held cameras, but during the battle scenes, you feel like you're there. You feel like you are in the battle.  Veterans who saw the movie said that the only thing missing is the smell of gunpowder.Many have criticized Spielberg's use for making the movie so violent.  They said the film is just too bloody.  Wrong!  Spielberg always trys to go for realism, and that's exactly what he does.  The film is gory because the war was gory.  That's the way things happen on D-Day.The film definitely deserves the Oscar. It is the most powerful piece of work ever put on the screen.  Can you honestly do any better?",10,0,0,15 February 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Beautifully Made Martial Arts Epic
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a breathtaking masterpiece.  On the surface the story concerns a special sword which must be returned, and also weaving in elements of a classic fairy tale: denied love, long-awaited revenge, potions and antidotes.The fight scenes, the best in cinema history to date, are choreographed so amazingly your jaw drops at the first sight of action.  Characters are so light and nimble they can fly, walk on water, and perch themselves on the treetops.But what's even more impressive is what's not on the surface. Lavish sets, along with a beautiful score and splendid photography enhance the feeling of being in another place.  The film's main love story, between characters Jen and Lo, is the real show-stopper.  Not even the brilliant fight sequences compare to the true, hidden romance of this epic.A surprising and tear-jerking ending, along with a great story and top-notch directing, makes this film truly something that sticks with you long after you've left the theater.",Null,0,0,30 December 2000
Schindler's List," Genius
","This film is Spielberg's true masterpiece.  It depicts something that is so hard to describe, a story so hard to tell in true honesty.  But it was. True brutal honesty.  I can definitely see why this film won Best Picture.Besides the fact that this was probably the ONLY film I have seen that has brought me close to tears, it has other characteristics that also make this such a technical work of art.  The black & white tone of the film was not only there to make it seem like a dark and dreary film, but to make other, more important aspects, stand out.  In one scene you see a girl running into a building; the girl is wearing a red coat.  It stands out among all the shades of gray to symbolize something important: the death and suffering of the holocaust.  In another scene, dead bodies are pulled away as Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) watches.  The corpses' blood is pure red, to show the major amount and therefore pointlessness of their bloodshed.  In one of the last scenes in the film, Jews light a bright orange flame which is ignited on the candle.Now, I'm not saying that this is the most spectacular piece of work ever accomplished (after all it was pretty slow and almost 3 1/2 hours long), but it is something.  This is a film that can never, ever be forgotten.  Well done, Spielberg.10 / 10 stars.",10,6,13,16 March 1999
Psycho," The best of the best
","'Psycho' is one of the few horror movies that have actually scared me.  Even against such movies as 'The Exorcist' and 'Poltergeist', this one is the best of the best.Even for a film shot in 1960 and entirely in black and white, the movie's lighting and cinematography are brilliant.  This film invented shots that are used today and some that lesser-skilled directors just don't know how to use.  (The contrast of Detective Arbogast against the house as he walks up the steps.)The shower scene was good, but some other scenes were even better.  When Detective Arbogast is attacked at the top of the steps, you really don't expect it.  So, just as a word of caution, don't try to take a shower after seeing this film.",Null,6,11,10 February 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Good movie? Yes. Overrated? YES!
","'The Silence of the Lambs' is nothing more than just a good movie. That's it. I don't particularly see this film as 'oscar material' or anything of that sort. Kudos surely go out to Anthony Hopkins who did give an incredible performance, and same to Jodie Foster. Can't exactly say the same about Jonathan Demme, who cannibalized this picture, in the same way that Hannibal Lecter would, and threw it all into a clump of messed up garbage. Never, except in this instance, have I seen a director win so many awards that he didn't deserve at all.This film is a good movie, but nevertheless a 'B' movie. And it should have stayed that way.",Null,0,0,10 October 1999
Final Destination," Good start, bad finish...
","Final Destination has a decent beginning, with the explosion scene not being afraid to show what it wants. That was all very real, but sadly to say, it was the only part of the movie that was real. Critics who give this movie the credit of being 'highly realistic' must have their heads screwed on backwards. Please. Only in a movie would some wind or a little crack lead to a highly elaborate and gruesome death.It wasn't a poorly made film, actually it was done rather well. It has its moments (I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the best scene is about a quarter of a second long and involves a bus.) But where is the script? Where's the ending? Where's everything else that was meant to be explained? This movie really left questions on the tips of everyone's tongues. How come Alex, or only Alex, saw before hand what would happen with the plane? And what happened to the guy they met in the morgue? He was intended to be the grim reaper, right? Or maybe I just thought that the script was trying to be clever but in actuality it really was dumb.And as far as I'm concerned, there is no ending. NO ending. Six months later they arrive at Paris, suddenly strike up a conversation about what happened, and then it suddenly starts happening again? And then the movie ends the way it does. Sheeesh. Its almost as if they got tired of writing the script so they just threw something together so they could get it out of the way.Some people said, well they didn't explain it all because there will probably be a sequel. Bad thinking! Sequels are done for commercial reasons, to make more money. If the movie happened to bomb, were they really going to put out a sequel? A script like that could very well have guaranteed  a bomb, therefore not leaving any chance to make a sequel.** out of ****.",Null,0,0,31 March 2000
The Truman Show," Incredible
","How did this movie not get nominated for Best Picture?  This film was very original, funny, sad, and touching.  It proves (along with his Golden Globe) that Jim Carrey can act, and act very very well.  This film was absolutely incredible.  Perhaps the Acadamy should re-think their choices. 9/10",Null,0,0,18 March 1999
The Matrix," AWESOME!
","This film is one of the best I have seen!  I had no idea that Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski could make such high-quality sci-fi cinema!  Not only does The Matrix have a truly inventive plot and amazing special effects, but it has other factors that make it so good.  One of the things few people might not notice is their (the film makers') great attention to detail, especially in reflections!  There are times when there are close-ups of Lawrence Fishburne and when he looks directly at the camera, you don't see crew, camera, equipment or anything.  Another aspect that makes this film such a marvel is the great usage of slow motion.  One of the best scenes in the whole movie is when Neo and Trinity are shooting the SWAT team in the limestone corridor of a skyscraper.  The brilliant slow motion shows debris flying everywhere and really makes you feel like you are part of the action.This is the first film in a long time where I have seen the audience clap at a scene! Action, drama, sci-fi, comedy, and even romance is in this movie.  The Matrix has it all.  If you haven't seen it, you haven't lived.",10,0,0,5 April 1999
