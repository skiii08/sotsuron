Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof
","'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' is an action filled drama that  combines American history and the popular vampire theme that movie  goers have grown up with. With the several vampire movies that have  been released in recent years, this movie has to compete with the idea  that the audience may be tired of the genre. By adding the name Abraham  Lincoln to the movie, this film just may spark a new genre of combining  horror themes with American history.  Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) as a kid witnessed his mother being  killed by a vampire and now as young man before his life in politics,  he gets trained by Henry (Dominic Cooper) on how to hunt vampires. With  this knowledge, he plans to hunt down the vampire who killed his  mother. After calling it quits to pursue a career in politics, he hears  that vampires are helping the Confederacy in the war and comes up with  a plan to eliminate them and win the war.  The acting in the movie was decent and tolerable; that was one of the  few things I wasn't expecting. Benjamin Walker did a good job as young  and old Abe Lincoln. The film had a lot of violence and gore, but the  director's previous film (Wanted) had a lot too so I was expecting  that. The pace of the film was somewhat good. The balance between  dramatic scenes and action scenes is what kept the film going in the  first half. But beginning the second half was a 20 to 30 minute scene  of Abe as President with tons of dialogue and no action and it causes  the audience to lose attention; but the end sequence restores that with  a long action scene. The CGI and effects were over the top; it looked  like Timur Bekmambetov was using the action formula he used for Wanted  and it got really repetitive.  Personally, I enjoyed the film. The 3D was okay, not the worst I have  seen. The CGI is overused but it is tolerable. I like the concept of  mashing U.S. history with the vampire theme and I think the filmmakers  did that well. It's not a film that I'd recommend spending $13.50 on,  but it is not a bad rental. It can easily be enjoyed as a popcorn  flick.  2 1/2 out of 5.",5,12,25,22 June 2012
Ted," Ted - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof
","'Ted' is a slap stick comedy by Seth MacFarlane that asks how far can a little boys wish go. It also asks how far can a comedy go in terms of crudeness. After one box office success, 21 Jump Street, and one failure, That's My Boy. Let's see if Ted can bring back crude comedy to the top of the box office this week and for weeks to come.When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) was a little boy, he received a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas and upon receiving it he wishes that his new bear could come alive and talk in real life. When his wish is granted, his new friend Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) comes alive and they share a bond that they will share forever. John is now 35 years old and Ted, now a celebrity, is still around and living with John. Now John has to balance his life between his job, fun with Ted, and his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) and encounters tons of road blocks in making his life balanced.This being Seth MacFarlane first live action film, I thought the camera shots he used were very good and the comedy was laugh out loud hilarious. MacFarlane's voice work is amazing, even similar to Peter Griffin (Family Guy), his voice went well with Ted's personality and demeanor. Mark Wahlberg was gold in this movie and did a good job acting, especially in scenes with Ted, who was a CGI generated bear. The comedy in this movie was vulgar, grotesque, and racist; but this being a Seth MacFarlane feature the audience should be expecting that. The film had a good pace; it never seemed slow. Near the last third of the movie, the film did a little genre change. It went from crude comedy, then a little bit drama, and then near the end there was a cool little action adventure sequence.Even though I prefer comedies that aren't vulgar and crude, this one was definitely worth price of admission. It was hilarious on all counts. I think there are jokes in here that can be offensive to any type of person, but you knowing Seth MacFarlane you shouldn't be surprised. This is one of the best comedies of the year up there along with 21 Jump Street. This film had everyone rolling. Highly recommended.4 out of 5 stars.bkstaReviews.blogspot.com",8,3,11,29 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof
","'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a superhero film that consists of action, drama, suspense and comedy. The film is a reboot of the Spider-Man trilogy that started in 2002. Marc Webb has taken the challenge of making Spider-Man his own and ready to compete with a competitive comic- book hero summer that consists of The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers. Let's see if the 'The Amazing Spider-Man' has what it takes to compete with the big boys.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is very smart high school student who loses his parents at a young age and lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Peter, being curious, tries to find out why his father disappeared and stumbled upon a cross-genetic that leads him to meeting Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Wandering around the lab, he comes across a room full of spiders and gets by one and soon realizes that he shares the traits of a spider. After learning some interesting stuff about Dr. Connors and his father, he has to balance several things: his high school crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), staying away from the police captain (Denis Leary), and stopping Dr. Connors.Andrew Garfield's performance of Peter Parker and Spider-Man was phenomenal. He had the perfect combination of shyness, awkwardness, and humor. When the scene was supposed to be emotional, he was emotional; when it called for humor, he was funny. Each scene he owned from beginning to the end. Emma Stone was fantastic as Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans was a great villain. And the rest of the supporting cast was solid as well. The thing that impressed me the most was the use of the web sling. He not only used it to swing, but to trip the enemies, use as a bungee cord, and shoot enemies with. The CGI was great; I liked the first person view shots of Spider-Man when he was swinging or running. The 3D was really good too; it didn't hurt my eyes or get me dizzy at all. It was perfect. The pace was good, it got you hooked early and never it never let go.I loved the movie. I loved the Avengers, but I liked the feel of this movie. I enjoyed Garfield's take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Everything was great. If there is one problem I had it was that Peter and Gwen's relationship was rushed and we could have gotten and few more scenes of them building the relationship. I highly recommend this movie seeing this movie. Anyone can enjoy this film.4.5 out of 5 stars.bkstaReviews.blogspot.com",9,3,7,3 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof
","'The Dark Knight Rises' is the final installment in the trilogy started by Christopher Nolan in 2005. In a summer that has big comic book blockbusters like 'The Avengers' and 'The Amazing Spider-Man,' it concludes with the most anticipated movie of the summer. Can 'The Dark Knight Rises' surpass the previous mentioned movies in the box office? Can it live up to the expectations set by 'The Dark Knight?''The Dark Knight Rises' picks up eight years later after the events of 'The Dark Knight' and Batman (Christian Bale) has decided to put away the mask and begin a life without Batman. When a terrorist leader, Bane (Tom Hardy), comes to Gotham and starts his plan to destroy it; Batman and company has to do whatever it takes to put a stop to Bane's plan.*I could go more in depth with the plot, but I do not want to spoil it.*Everything about this movie was great; flawless. The characters were developed well, both previous characters from the other movies and the newly introduced ones in the movie. The Bruce Wayne character had really great scenes that when the audience views them, they feel what he goes through and they get emotionally drawn into Bruce Wayne's character. The same thing goes for Bane; he is such a scary villain and terrorizes everyone and everything. The audience wants to see this man go down and get rewarded with a great fight scene. Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) exceeds expectations; she was wonderful and brought comic relief to the film in the proper spots. Alfred (Michael Caine) as always was fantastic. The was very intense and it had you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. The pace of the movie is slow at times, but it doesn't hurt the film at all. Overall the writing, production, and the score were fantastic. I am not one of those people who say 'that's the best movie ever' after each movie they see; for me, this was the best movie I have ever seen. There is no one in the theater checking their phones to see what time it was or to see how much time in the movie is left. This movie had high expectations, and it went beyond them. I recommend that everyone go see this movie right away. You'll be impressed.5 out of 5 stars",10,4,10,22 July 2012
Her," Her - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof
","When I first read the premise of this movie I said, 'Hmm, did this film really get the green light?' and then it occurred to me that this has the potential to be one the most unique and original films that has came out recently. I still thought it was silly, but I think all the iPhone screenshots of people messing with Siri and trying to get her to say silly things and then it finally came to me that I was really interested and wanting to see this film.Her takes place in the near future where technology has grown and has become an essential part of people's lives. Whether if it is for work, pleasure, or even both; technology plays a huge role. Joaquin Phoenix plays Theordore, a guy who is currently going through a divorce and battling loneliness while not being able to move on stop thinking of his soon-to-be ex-wife. Theodore then comes across the ad for a state of the art new operating system that calibrates itself to understand and help it's user with whatever they need. Theodore soon becomes very fond of the operating system, who gives itself the name Samantha, and continues to talk and build an actual relationship with Samantha and eventually he starts dating her.The first thing that struck a chord with me is the excellent job of story telling. I feel like each scene builds the characters more and more and before we know it we become emotionally involved with them; especially Theodore. With each day, they become closer and closer and Samantha is bringing him joy and helping him move on from his past relationship and transforming him as we view each scene. But not only is Theodore transforming, but also Samantha. Joaquin Phoenix is very impressive in this movie and his performance is definitely one to remember come awards season. I found myself rooting for Theodore because he actually found someone who he can have a conversation with and who understands him and you see him so happy and forgetting the things that caused him stress and pain. But even in relationships with people, it can have its downs and it is really interesting to see how Theodore deals with them considering that she is programmed to meet his every need. Watching the relationship grow and blossom and Theodore react with it is such a sight to see.Another thing that is impressive about this film is the humor. This film delivers some great laughs, both raunchy and sarcastic, and they come in some of the greatest moments of the film. The cinematography of the film is beautifully done and the whole setting and world that this film takes place in is very neat. It shows how much of the world is dependent on technology and how it becomes an actual part of us. The acting all around is superb as well as the voice work of the operating system by Scarlet Johansson. But Spike Jonze is really the reason why this film is so good. His writing and direction of this film spot on and his views on relationships, emotions, and feelings are spectacular. Why can't you fall in love with an OS? If it's returning feelings, emotions, and making you feel good inside; why fight it? This film does have a strange premise, but Spike Jonze and Joaquin Phoenix deliver an interesting film that will make all of us think about not only love, but technology as well and how we use that technology. To be in love, does an actual body need to present? Or can it be just a voice in our ear coming from a computer. I found this film touching, funny, and unique and I definitely recommend that people should see it. If I had to sum this whole movie with one word it would be interesting because with this plot, that is really what it is.4.5 out of 5 starsbkstareviews.blogspot.com",9,1,3,10 January 2014
