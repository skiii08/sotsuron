The Ring," Good for curing insomnia
","This movie was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen in my life. Within 45 minutes of the start, it put me to sleep. The plot wasn't complex; it was totally confusing. It wasn't scary either. It didn't make one iota of sense. If you want to cure insomnia, watch this movie. If you want to see a real movie, I'd suggest watching something else.",Null,0,1,1 June 2003
The Green Mile," A Powerful Film.
","The Green Mile was a powerful film. It is one of the best films of all time. The acting, it was a Oscar deserving performance. Michael Clark Duncan played convicted killer John Coffey and Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb. Duncan delievered a powerful performance. He has that child like look in his eyes, something most actors cannot portray. Duncan also portrays that innocence that only a child would have. In a literal sense, John Coffey was an angel. Hanks delivered an equally powerful performance. Everyone who acted in that film did a wonderful job. This film like a lot of King's other films explore human nature. The Green Mile will be remembered as one of the best.",Null,1,2,30 November 2002
