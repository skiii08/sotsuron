Requiem for a Dream," A powerful masterpiece
","This movie was seriously so good. I never really liked any of Darren Aronofsky's movies but now i'm starting to rewatch them and i actually really like them. But this movie is the best of Darren Aronofsky. OK, first of all, this movie was so powerful and a perfect drama. this movie is about drug addiction and how these 4 people are addicted to them and their lives slowly turn pointless and worse. The reason this movie is so powerful is because it teaches people how drugs are bad and it gets you nowhere. This movie was also really really sad. The lives of these people were so good at the beginning but slowly turned worse and worse. Its sad how these people never really got what they wanted and their lives just got so pointless. I really recommend this movie to anyone and this might change your feeling about drugs. this movie is against drugs. The characters were also so well played and well acted and i think sarah's character was the best and she should've won an Oscar. Story: 10 character:10",10,1,3,25 October 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino is back better then ever!
",I rented this movie and I was so excited to watch it and i had a feeling it was going to be very good movie because it is in the top 250 list. I watched it and i was right. I seen pulp fiction and Roseveir Dogs and this is the best! This movie delivers laughter and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. But this movie is pretty violent even though i'm 18 i got disturbed. A very good film about Hitler and world war 2. Hitler looks so funny! Christopher Waltz did a good job in this movie. At first i didn't who the heck Christohper Waltz was. Brad Pitt is very funny in this movie and i love his accent! The story is well done! A bloody masterpiece 9/10,9,0,9,31 May 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Hilarious! The Best Zombie Movie Of All Time
","Let me say this, this movie was friking hilarious!!! The characters were well acted and i can say that Ed was the most funniest. Although this movie is very bloody and gory, it didn't really freak me out because it was meant in a comical way. I can also say that this movie was very touching and sad when all of Shaun's friends and family died by the zombies. This movies plot is very simple. it is just about 2 friends who teams up with Shaun's family and friends to survive the zombie attack. I really recommend this movie to comedy fans or horror lovers. But i have some concerns about this movie. I can say that this movie was very very very short and if it was a little longer it would've been a lot better. And it ended abruptly. But still, this movie is very fun. so overall, 8/10",8,2,5,26 November 2011
Rocky V," Underrated very much.
","This is the best rocky yet. This is why... This movie is the saddest rocky movie ever.. It's about jealous things, change the people who you love. There was a guy who was in the streets and he wanted rocky to be his manager. He said yes. So Tommy Gunn (The New Guy) came over to rocky's house and had dinner with him. This is where rocky's sun thinks that Rocky likes Tommy Gunn better then him. He gets all jealous. So rocky trains Tommy and he kicks everyones ass. BUt there's this other guy... I forgot his name... Tommy spends more time with him now. This is why i think Tommy is a dick. Rocky is the one who taught him everything and he turns him down??? What a dick head. Then Tommy turns in to the Heavyweight champion of boxing but all the people think he sucks and hes not the real champion. So he decides to fight Rocky. Rocky owns him. He says sorry to his son and spends more time with him. I recommend this movie to only rocky fans. This movie is very Underrated. A very good ending. 10/10 :D",10,6,8,3 June 2010
Public Enemies," Why Johnny... Why?
","This movie is just plain awful. I seen a lot of Michael Mann films like the insider. But this movie is dumb. I couldn't stand 10 minutes of this crap. the castings were awful. The actors didn't fit their characters correctly. Worst movie ever. You guys can go see it if you want to if you want to die. Worst movie ever. I never seen a worst movie like this since Wall.E. Worst johnny Depp movie ever. i feel really sorry for johnny. I seen Alice In Wonderland, Sleepy Hollow, and Ed Wood and this is the worst yet. I almost crapped in my pants. I left the theaters in about 110 minutes since the movie started. I'll give this movie 1/10 D:",1,2,5,4 June 2010
Finding Nemo," Good but no pixars best
","Now, this is what i call an adventure! This movie is fantastic. Animation was good and the voices. I love every time that psycho music goes on it made me laugh real hard. when you see this movie it makes your day stay happy. This movie is filled with sobs and laughs. It is a classic pixar. This movie is filled with exciting adventure. The adventure makes it enjoyable with Dori. She is the funniest character in this movie. I love when she loses her memory like every 5 minutes. This movie is good but not pixar's best. But i recommend this to the people who love Pixar. I'll give this movie a 8/10 Have fun with this movie!!! :)",8,0,2,23 June 2010
Superbad," Comedies are so good these days...
","I don't have much to say about this movie... Well, It's a movie about 2 teens that has to go to a party and they have to get alcohol.. But they are under age. They ask a nerdy teenager to have a fake id and get alcohol.. he does it successfully but he gets stuck with 2 funny and dumb cops. There are more cool adventures in this movie!!! The story/plot was kinda dumb. But a very funny adventure.. If you like comedies such as Knocked Up or Forgetting Sarah Marshell, this is the movie for you! Enjoy and here is my ratingStory: 7/10 Characters: 8.5/10 Comedy: 8/10 Overall: 8/10 By the way... Micheal Cera is awesome in this movie.. same as Seth Rogen! Have fun!!!!!",8,0,2,20 December 2010
Rocky II," Go Go! It's the Italian Stallion!!!
","I didn't really like the first rocky but i had high hopes for the second one. It seems like i was right. It was very entertaining. This is a good movie about boxing and marriage. Sylvester Stallone did a very good job acting out rocky. I loved how Stallone acted and directed this movie.The story was very entertaining. It is about Rocky when he got a draw with Apollo the champion. Then they decide to have a rematch. Of course, You all know who's gonna win, right? I recommend this movie to everyone but please watch the first rocky first. I kind of hated it but it's an introduction. Go watch it right now! Go Go Italion Stallion!!! 9/10",9,0,0,2 June 2010
Forrest Gump," Tom Hanks Masterpiece
","Touching, Sad, Romantic, Happy, Wars, Friends, Marriage, Family, and most of all love. Forrest Gump. Made me cry. Made me feel good. Forrest Gump is a loving person. He got friends. He joined a war. He is good at running, Has a girlfriend named Jenny. They marry and they have a son. Jenny says goodbye. 'Life is like a box of chocolates. You Never know what you're going to get.' There is a lot of people. But there is only one Forrest gump. He is helpful and a good friend. He taught himself how to run. He was friends with Jenny since he was a kid. This film delivers. Watch it now and you will be proud. Tom Hanks best movie. Go watch it.",9,2,3,20 June 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," Well... Of Course this is what you expect from Pixar :)
","Well, I liked this movie. It's full of excitement. I love the character that John Goodman. I was scared of him when i was little. And now when i watch it i'm just saying... Why the hell was I scared of this monster? Labowski is very very annoying. He sure did a good job of making people annoyed. The baby was annoying to but very funny. This movie is very entertaining. But could've been better. I just didn't like the idea where monsters were afraid of children but they scare children... That's the part i hate about. But kids will love this movie. some babies might cry... Because of the 'scary' monsters. But this movie is family fun! Pixar is the best! but i think this movie is a tiny bit overrated. I don't think this movie should be in the top 250 list. But... anyways... I'll give this movie 8/10 :D Have fun!",8,0,1,2 June 2010
21 Jump Street," Extremely Clever and Hilarious
","I'm starting to really love 2012. After watching many great films (including this), I am actually starting to believe that 2012 is a really great year for movies. 21 Jump Street was a very awesome movie with very creative and humorous script. This movie is about 2 guys (cops) and they are accepted in to a 'club' called 21 jump street. They are assigned to investigate who the drug dealer is and who the supplier is and arrest them. One of the things i really liked about this movie is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. They were both great and really funny in this movie. Surprisingly, I'm going to say Channing was a little funnier than Jonah. But this movie was really really good. It is a really great time in the theaters watching with your friends. I absolutely had no problems with this movie and it was a great start to 2012. It actually is one of the funniest movies i've seen. If you are looking for a great entertaining movie, watch this",10,1,3,10 May 2012
The Bourne Identity," Action Packed Matt Damon Style
","This movie is very good. The story goes well and Matt Damon deserved to be Jason Bourne. The movie is filled with action and a lot of car chases. When Jayson has 2 bullets on his back, he can't remember anything about the violent past. Jason Bourne sees that he is a very dangerous man who is very skilled. He needs to find the truth and his identity. The truth is that he's an elite government agent. When you watch this movie it's gonna have Non-stop Action! Go see it now! You will be very entertained and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I recommend this to everyone. Have fun with this action packed movie :D I'll give this movie a 9/10",9,2,2,9 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," I was Very Surprised
","I thought this movie was going to be a very big disappointment because of the horrible movie Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince. I thought this was going to be another 'unlike the book and boring crap.' But I was wrong. It was very good. I'll tell you why. It had this suspense in it that made the movie masterful. I love how Harry, Ron, and Hermione has now grown and they are fully youth. Voldemort is my favorite character because his acting is so good. This harry potter was different. It wasn't like the other harry potters where they always go on the train and go to hogwarts. I personally thought this was a bit similar to lord of the rings. Where in lord of the rings they have to return the ring back to the Mount Doom, this is similar. In this, they have to find the Horcruxes. I recommend this to all the harry potter fans.. but people who don't like harry potter will not enjoy this as much. Story: 9/10 Scenes: 9/10 Character: 9.5/10 Overall: 9/10",9,0,2,1 December 2010
The Shining," old fashioned type of scary movie
","THE SHINING = Beast, Boss, Excellent, scary, sexy, and annoying... (Jack's wife.)I love Kubrick's movies except 2001 odyssey.. And this one was the best... i had awesome scenes that makes you jump like crazy. I liked how the kid is not normal.. that made the movie even more scarier. jack Nicholson was so scary. His expression was awesome and freaky. I loved the story too.. It is about a family who moves in a hotel and Jack is always typing at the hotel because he needs peace and concentration. Then slowly and slowly he becomes more possessed with evil and tries to kill his family. Before, there was an old caretaker that was at this hotel and he got mad and he killed his 2 daughters... My rating: story: 10/10 effects: 9.5/10 Character: 9/10. (I should've gave the character a 10 but the wife was so annoying.. i wanted to go in the movie and just stab her in the head.. HER SCREAM IS SO ANNOYING!!!)",10,0,1,1 January 2011
Rocky IV," Awesome! A new song...
","I really like the old rocky song. But the song isn't in this movie... T.T This movie was good because it is about how the character feels. When Apollo died, he wanted revenge. Revenge to have a boxing match with Draco. This movie will be enjoyable to rocky fans. This movie is about when Apollo wants to fight Draco and Rocky gives him a chance. Drago is so powerful that he knocked out Apollo and killed him. Rocky got really angry so he decided to have a boxing match with Draco. Adrian didn't like Rocky's idea since the thing that happened to apollo. He kicks Draco's ass. it gives a hook to the next rocky that he's going to retire. 8/10",8,0,2,3 June 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," This Weird.. But Awesome Movie Made My Day!!!
","Wow. What a Movie. This Director is so creative and smart. I loved Hot Fuzz and Shaun of The dead. But this is A Masterpiece. But I've got to say, this movie is not a normal movie. It has Billions of Effects and I love Every Time SCott Hits the Evil Ex's it says 'Pow' Or 'Boom'. It's like playing a video game. I loved The Story and the acting was Brilliant. It's about Scott Falling in love with a girl named Remona and to date her farther, he needs to defeat her evil Ex's. (You'll Find out why she calls it Ex's Instead of Ex Boyfriends..) So yeah... This is my rating: Character: 9.5/10 Effects: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Overall: 10/10. Enjoy and Have Fun!!! :)",10,6,15,18 December 2010
Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan Your awesome!
","This is one of my best superhero movies ever! I really liked how the story goes! First Bruce and Rachel was a child and Bruce fell in a cave.. Since then he was scared of bats. Then he becomes a hero with bats called batman! Awesome! I really love the director Chistopher Nolan.. I saw prestige, dark knight, memento, Insmonia and i really want to watch the new movie inception. But anyways this is not boring. The story goes on really fluently and it felt like the whole movie was an hour. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves superheroes. I hate when people give these movies a 1.. it breaks my heart. This movie is 10/10",10,0,0,31 May 2010
Cars," Pixars Worst... :(
","This movie is awful. The animation is good but i don't get the whole point of this??? It's about a car who's trying to win the race. Come on??? Is this really Pixar? I'm okay if this was Dreamworks because in my opinion Dreamworks sucks except for Shrek 1 and 2 and how to train your dragon. The story was bad, the plot looked like it was unfinished. Horrible movie. Just plain Horrible!!! >:{ come on Pixar you can do better then this. I don't recommend this movie to anyone except if your a very very huge Pixar fan. This movie is overrated it 7.5 stars? This movie should be about like 6 stars. Anyways, I'll give this movie a 2/10 because of the graphics.",2,4,7,9 June 2010
The Incredibles," Action fun
","I love Pixar because their animation is so good and the movie itself. Incredibles is one of them and it's one of my favorite movies of the year. It is a great movie about keeping your family safe and protecting your family. Dash is awesome he makes me laugh a lot! Violet is pretty shy but she is very helpful. Mr. Incredibles is funny every time that kid in the bike stares at him. This movie is action packed. Its filled with laughter and edge of your seat moments. Everyone! Go see it now. Everyone will like the awesome animated movie. My rating is an awesome 10/10 Have fun with this movie. If you don't like it, you don't have a life.",8,0,1,4 June 2010
Children of Men," Meh...
",i am beginning to not believe the IMDb top 250 list. This movie was alright. it was a decent action movie. but why is it in the top 250 list? this movie felt like it was 3 hours and i was so bored. It is just stupid to just see the people talk in foreign languages and just scream. the story seemed a little stupid. this whole movie is about a guy trying to help a pregnant women go out of the country. I also don't get why it says that Julianne MOore is one of the important actress in this movie. she is only in like 15 minutes of this movie... Its just sometimes annoying when there are gun sounds everywhere and people screaming and running around... it's so annoying... there is nothing good about this movie except the effects. don't bother wasting your money on this movie.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Another Mr. T masterpiece
",Quentin Tarantino is back with a fresh masterpiece. This movie was a blast and i'm not even joking. The story went fluently and Uma Thurman was PERFECT for her role. The fighting scenes were epic and had a hell load of blood but thats what makes movies fun!I loved every single part and some people say quentin Tarantino's movies are boring!!! But they are definitely not... There were some funny moments in this movie too. I loved when Uma Thurman pwned all the Asian soldiers. (I love when she fights all the main bad guys.) I can't wait till i see volume 2. My ratings: Story: 9.5/10 Effects: 9/10 Character: 10/10 Overall: 10/10 have fun with this movie!!,10,1,3,24 November 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," kubrick's worst...
",This movie was rated very high so i decided to watch it. After i watched it i thought.... HOw was this movie rated so high???? It was quite boring and dumb. It showed a dumb picture of animals for like 20 minutes. I almost fell asleep. I tried to enjoy it.. but i failed. Don't ever watch this movie. It's a waste of money. I enjoy a lot of Kubrick's movies such as The Shining and The ClockWork Orange.. BUt this is something different. Even 'meet the spartans' is better then this piece of crap. But people who are really in to it.. might enjoy it. Story: 3/10 Character: 2/10 Events: 1/10 Effects: 2/10 Overall: 2/10,2,3,13,12 December 2010
Toy Story," Cool A MUST see
","I saw this movie when i was 5 years old a long time ago and I was so obsessed with Buzz Lightyear! I had toys of buzz Lightyear and carried them around anywhere i went.I saw this movie yesterday again and it was fabulous! plain fabulous. The story was amazing and the characters were well made! Nice job Pixar, You done it again! Tom Hanks did well doing a voice of Woody and same with Tim Allen with Buzz. I didn't really like Wall.E i almost fell asleep but this movie kept me awake the whole time with excitement! I recommend this movie to anyone no matter what age you are because this movie Just Beautiful! An fantastic awesome 10/10",10,1,1,31 May 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Pretty good graphics but horrible story
",I was shocked after i saw this movie. This movie sucked. Though I was pretty amazed with the graphics. Alice goes in to another journey in wonderland where she reunites with her friends such as the Mad Hatter. They have to stop the red queen and it is said that Alice slays the Jabberwocky. The end battle scene was poorly made and poorly epic. This is a typical Tim Burton film but i'd say this was his worst film including planet of the apes. If you want to watch a true Tim Burton movie watch Sleep Hollow or Edward Scisssorhands. Anyways... It is a disappointment for Johnny and Burton. Kids will like it the most. I'll give this 5/10,5,0,4,16 June 2010
The Artist," Finally! Something new
","When i first heard about the Artist, I knew it was going to win best picture in the Oscars and i knew this was going to be great. I was sooo right. This movie was so interesting and boy it sure was a success! This movie was so fun and entertaining. Although, i didn't love it or it isn't one of my favorite movies of 2011 it was still very good. This film takes place in the 1920s to the 1930s about a popular actor named George Valentin. He only does silent films. One day, he meets a women named Peppy Miller who is a BIG FAN of George. She is really good at dancing and decides to dance in films in George's Studio. Slowly and slowly she gets popular and popular and rises to the top by doing talkies which was the new evolution to films.George only wants to do silent films and slowly and slowly get's abandoned and lost and loses popularity. People should check this movie out. The performances WERE SOOOO amazing. and man i'm glad this won for original score because the songs in this movie were great. I was completely engaged in to this movie the whole time. You guys should check this out sometime. I would give this movie a 8/10",8,1,4,1 March 2012
Up," To sad to be a Pixar.
","This is the saddest pixar i've ever seen. I sobbed throughout the movie. I don't really like sad movies and i don't really think this movie is for kids. What kind of pixar movie have blood in it? This movie barely had any laughs. I tried to laugh a little but it didn't work. This movie is not pixar's worst or pixar's best. It's sort of in the middle. I just loved the character Russell. Whenever i sobbed, he made me smile. Kids might enjoy it, but this won't be their ordinary film. If you had a sad day or tiring day, don't watch this movie. It'll make you more tired and more sad. But it was a happy ending :) I'll give this movie a 7/10",10,1,4,23 June 2010
The Fly," this is not scary.. IT'S DISGUSTING
","At first I have to say that this is not scary. it's disgusting as hell...This movie was a masterpiece. this is the first movie i've seen by Cronenberg. it's about a guy named Seth Brundle who tries an experiment and fails and slowly and slowly turns in to a Brundlefly. It's very disturbing as he turns to a brundle fly. His 'girlfriend' is deeply in love with him. She tries to help him, but ends up killing Brundlefly at the end. this movie is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'll give this movie a: 9/10 = Story. 9/10 = Effects. 9/10 = character. Please watch this movie! :)",9,0,2,27 February 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," this movie is so Terri- good
",this movie is so awesome. I brought my cousin with me to the movies and at the very end scene I looked a her and said 'What are you doing?' and then a second later she started to cry and she said 'This movie is so sad! I don't want to see this!' (she's 5 years old) But the story was amazing. THis is why i love animated movies! The characters were well made! THe best dream works movie ever! The dragon is so cute! he reminds me of my dog. This movie is family fun for everyone! It's a good movie of friendship. This movie has a lot of feelings of laughter happiness and sadness. Go watch this movie now before it's too late. hurry! 9/10,9,1,2,1 June 2010
Rocky," It's OK....
",My dad told me to watch this movie. he said it was a really good boxing movie. So i decided to watch it. Of course all movies has an introduction in the first movie. Like batman begins. Thats the boring part about it. The introduction. It has stuff that the watchers don't need to know about. The last 25 minutes is when he does boxing... and this movie is almost 2 hours long so it has 100 minutes of just talking and having introductions... I don't like those movies. I don't know about you all but i don't like those.. and its my opinion. I didn't watch the other Rocky's but i hope they are better! :) I would give this movie 7/10,7,0,2,31 May 2010
Titanic," Underrated this movie is best movie ever
",this movie is the best movie i seen in years. This movie is about 3 hours long and it felt like the movie was only 1 hour. Leonardo DiCaprio did an awesome job in this movie. So as Kate Winslet. James Cameron is the best director ever. This movie made me cry. The very last part is very sad. A very good movie about a titanic ship and about a women's life. All the people who think this is a f*** sh** think again... Cause' If you hate this movie you have no life. Anyways very sad and good movie. This movie is very underrated. It should be in the top 250 list. I recommend this movie highly. Please go see it now! My Rating:10/10,10,1,3,2 June 2010
Rocky III," It's the eye of the tiger!
",This is the best rocky yet. I love how rocky's life changed from the beginning. He was very poor and then he got a wife and then now he's the heavyweight champion of world boxing! I love it! A new challenger comes up. He is very strong and scary. Rocky fights him and loses because his manager Micky dies (Almost Cried) But something surprising happens! A new manager comes up. Guess who he is... It's Apollo Creed. He gets rocky to know the eye of the tiger and he learns a new style of boxing. He doesn't do left hooks anymore... He uses his right hand now. So he fights the challenger and he kicks his ass. Everyone go watch it! but you need to watch the first and second one first! 9.5/10,9,0,0,2 June 2010
A Beautiful Mind," wonderful
","This was a wonderful film. It was a fantastic story of John Nash's life. I recommend this movie a whole lot. I'm going to start off by talking about the characters in this movie. Russell crowe: He was brilliant in this film. he was perfect for john nash, and his acting was so real-life. Jeniffer connelly: She was a good actress in this movie. Ed Harris: ed harris was breathtaking and suspenseful and made the movie more better. The Plot was very good. At first, the movie was a little slow but it got better and breathtaking. Ron Howard did good at directing but ron howard makes a lot of good movies and bad movies. such as the dilemma which was horrible. so i hope you enjoy this movie. My ratings: story:10/10, plot 10/10 A beautiful Masterpiece",10,0,0,8 May 2011
The Departed," return of the Scorsese movie is not great. but its good.
","Here it is. The Scorsese's movie i've been waiting for. THe Departed. I love Scorsese and his brilliant work and his movies and i was so excited to see this movie. I was so confident that i was going to love this movie. And I actually loved it, but it wasn't what i expected it to be. But this was Leonardo Dicaprio's best role. Jack Nicholson was good and so was Matt Damon. But Mark Whalberg was a cussing machine. Well, that was the problem with this movie: The cussing. There is like 2 or 1 F bombs in every 2 sentences and it got really annoying. Why so many F Bombs??? Although the story was fantastic. But it's just not what i pictured it would be like. Some scenes really bored me too and i didn't really need to know about it. The Actions were OK. But people who like action packed movies such as The Matrix or The Bourne Series are gonna get bored and hate this movie. This is my movie rating. Story: 9/10 Picture/Scenes: 8/10 Character: 9/10 Overall: 8.5/10 BUt i decided to rate it a 8 or a 9 because There is not .5's in IMDb. Thank you and this was just my Opinion.",8,0,0,26 November 2010
Die Hard," Bruce Willis Best Movie!
","This movie is so awesome. It has non stop action and it is not boring. This is probably one of the best movies i've ever seen this year. Bruce Willis is sure a cusser. F*** that, Fu***** Eat you. What the F***. I love it when he says Yippie Ki Yay Motherf***! Anyways, The castings were great. Alan Rickman did a very good job of being a terrorist thief and Bruce Willis did a good job of being a NYPD. The fighting scenes are well made and very bloody. i recommend this to everyone highly! A must see movie. Go see it now! Very good movie you will be very entertained 10/10. Yippie Ki Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome! have fun :D",10,1,1,6 June 2010
The Wrestler," It's decent
","this movie is a movie directed by darren aronofsky. This movie was a decent movie. first, i'm going to talk about the characters. the characters in this movie were wonderful. Mickey Rourke was a pretty good actor in this movie. In my opinion this movie shouldn't be on the top 250. this movie was a little enjoyable. this had no plot and i didn't know what darren aronofsky was trying to point out. he wrestles and then he retires and wrestles again.. there is no plot. i think only viewers who love wrestling will like this movie because it disgusted me. there were so many sexual strip club parts. this movie bored me in a while and got repetitive. but if you are a fan of wrestling, you might like this movie. this is my rating: Characters: 8.5/10 Events: 4/10",6,1,2,8 May 2011
Inception," Yep. Inception.
",This movie was very good. i knew from the start that it was going to be a very good movie.. of course.... it's christopher nolan. This movie was confusing at times.... Especially the parts where they go from dream to dream. But i liked the story and the effects of this movie. It was well delivered.I also liked how all the actors fit in with their characters. especially Leo Dicaprio and Ken Wanatabe and Joseph Gordan-Levitt and Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard and Everyone!!!!

WALL·E," How! How!
","I'm sorry to say this but this movie was a disgrace. How can Pixar make a stupid crap? The Story sucked and it was pretty stupid making everyone fat. This story is about when our world ended and this poor robot that doesn't have a life cleans up trash. Then meets his girlfriend! Oh wow! Anyways, then he meets all these bunch of fat people and they don't even know what pizza is ( how stupid of them) So this movie sucks. You guys can watch it if you guys want to. Kids might like it. But i'm a huge fan of Pixar! How can they do this! (Up is the best Pixar! My opinion) I would give this movie a bad and very poor 3/10",3,1,9,31 May 2010
Despicable Me," The Funniest Animated movie of the year!!!
","Based on from the trailers, i thought this movie was going to be knee cracker. When i saw this movie.. it made my day really happy. When you see Toy Story 3, it makes you cry and the story is dark. It is better to see this movie after Toy Story 3. The story was kinda stupid but hell, it's an animation. The stealing the moon part was really stupid. Another thing about this is that, there are mixed stories in the movie and there just going on at once. 1. Taking care of the girls. 2. Stealing the moon 3. Vector. You see? there are so many stuff going on at once. But this movie was insanely funny. Especially the yellow minions. When the credits are going on, there is going to be a funny part. It was funny but stupid. I'll give this movie a 8/10",8,4,8,10 July 2010
Toy Story 3," Wow I'm surprised
","I am a huge pixar and toy story fan but when i saw the trailer for this movie, i thought it was going to be another lame sequel. So i just decided to watch how good it was. Then, I was so surprised!!! The animation was good, the voices were good, the new characters were good, and everything was good!!! I like this toy story better then the others and i gotta say, this is the best pixar movie i've ever seen. There were a lot of people in the theaters and there were a lot of laughs and sobs. this is the best movie that's out in the theaters right now. So go watch it!!! This is one of the best movies i've seen this year.. No matter how old you are Toy Story will never get boring! 10/10",10,2,4,20 June 2010
The Truman Show," Awesome, Timeless
","This movie Jim Carrey's best performance. I just couldn't stop watching this movie and i could't take my eyes off of the screen. I have never seen a movie like this in a long time. The beginning was a little slow but it got more exciting and exciting as i kept watching this. What i really like about this movie, is that the whole movie is a show of a person. The plot was brilliant. I wouldn't think of anything like this if i was a movie director/writer. It was a little cheesy though. The whole town looked like a video game. The effects were a little off. This movie was also sad and funny. I recommend this movie to anyone. You will like it. My Rating: Characters:9/10 Effecs 8/10 Story: 10/10Overall: 9/10",9,0,1,11 March 2011
The Matrix," The best!!! I repeat: The best!!
",OK... I watched it and it was good... There.. I said it right now... it's good... BUT WAIT..... THERE'S MORE I HAVE TO TELL YOU. (That was retarded..) This movie was awesomely action packed. I just liked the story. it's about This guy named Neo who is 'The One' and has to fight these bad guys. He joins the fight with Trinity and Morpheus and all these other retards. And he fights the bad guys and Pwns them. Oh yeah! Also i liked how trinity and neo were at the airport and dodged all those bullets.. That was the coolest part ever. OK here's my rating for The Matrix... Story: 10/10 Character: 9.5/10 Effects: 9.5/10 Overall: 10/10,10,0,2,28 October 2010
Gladiator," Scott/Crowe Masterpiece
","i was shocked when i saw this movie. Just shocked. This is the best movie i've seen this year and Crowe did a fantastic job in this movie. Scott did a good job directing this movie.This movie is just plain epic and sad. I loved the emotions going on throughout the movie. Maximus was a slave and he became a very very skilled gladiator. Do you notice a big change going on throughout the movie? i recommend this movie to everyone. I think this movie is better then all the movies i reviewed in IMDb. This movie is terrific art. It seemed timeless throughout the movie. 10/10. If it went up to 20, i'll give it a 19/20 Have Fun With This Movie :)",10,1,5,16 June 2010
Goodfellas," A MasterPiece.. This is worth of your time!
","MArtin Scorsese. My favorite Director... He has put all his work in to this movie. It was brilliant and breath taking. This movie is one of the best movies i've seen in years. The Scenes were perfect and Robert Deniro did a very good job. You are going to be thrilled and amazed when you see this. AFter Seeing this movie i want to be a director just like Martin Scorsese. This movie is like a piece of art. If you didn't see this movie, your missing out all the fun. The story was great. It is about a little boy who wants to be a Gangster.. and now he's all grown up and his wish has come true. He hangs out with Joe Pesci (He was the best in this film) and Robert DeNiro. He robs places and he gets a girl and marries. I'll rate this film a... Story: 10/10 Character: 10/10 Scenes: 10/10 10/10. I'll rate it 11 if i have to...",10,1,2,26 November 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," overrated and disappointed but still good.
","this movie wasn't very good as the Bourne Identity. Of course some people say the first movie is always better! This story doesn't go that well. It doesn't really fit together. I see that Paul Greengrass is directing Bourne Supremacy and same with Bourne Ultimatinum. I haven't seen Bourne Ultimatinum yet but i have high hopes for it. This movie still has plentiful of action but it was pretty boring and they say things the watcher shouldn't know about. Pam did a good job in this movie. She was the perfect enemy to Jason. So anyways, if you guys watched the first movie you might want to see this.. But it was kind of bad for me. :( 6/10",6,0,2,9 June 2010
