The Legend of Bagger Vance," I expected much more
","This isn't the type of movie I expected from Robert Redford.  This is such a formula flick.If this had been any other director, it would have been an average effort, but for Redford it is a diluted story and offers very little in terms of character.Maybe it was meant as a feel-good movie, but that would be a first for Redford.Overall, not a bad movie, but for those of you who are expecting to see some class, don't bother.",4,0,1,7 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Amazing movie
","I went to see LotR not really knowing what to expect.  I have not read any of the books nor am I a fantasy fan.  I had heard many great reviews and hype about the movie so braced myself for disappointment.It was amazing.  From start to finish I was drawn into an unbelievable world that seemed to be real.  The effects were totally seamless and seemed to belong to each scene.  The acting was faultless and directing and editing was tight and kept you enthralled.The thing that stops me from giving this movie a perfect score is that it had no closure.  Not having read the novel, I assume that it stayed true to the ending of the book, but does that constitute an entertaining movie?  A documentary about ant farming might score highly with ant-farm enthusiasts, but it doesn't make it appealing to documentary lovers.All in all, it is a visually pleasing feast and one that I will be adding to my DVD collection as soon as I can.",7,0,0,13 January 2002
Face_Off," Very disappointing
","Maybe it was because I was filled with so much anticipation from two great actors that this movie was more disappointing than it otherwise would have been.The plot is not strong enough to sustain the whole movie, the acting was unconvincing and the story was so predictable that it could be seen a mile off.There's not much more I can say other than; only watch this movie if you really have nothing else to watch.",3,2,5,6 April 2001
American History X," Unbelievable
","I think a lot more could have been done with this movie.  The scenes were very realistic and really got the audience to experience what was happening. Edward Norton is brilliant as he moves from one segment of his life to another.  The use of b&w and colour was effective, albeit not very original.My major disappointment is the total unrealistic change of heart of the Vinyard brothers.  In a matter of four months (from the rape to the parole), Norton's character goes from full-blown Neo-Nazi racist to mild-mannered boy next door.  The same goes for the 'daddy breakfast' scene.  Norton goes from one opinion to a totally contradictory opinion in a matter of minutes. How are we supposed to believe this?Maybe the story should have been played out over a longer period of time and the events swaying the characters opinions more dramatic.",5,4,10,26 October 2000
The Usual Suspects," How did this movie make the top 250?
","I have no problem with the movie as a form of entertainment, but to say that it is one of the top 250 movies and a brilliant thriller is taking it too far.  The plot is smart and well disguised, but the ending just reminded me of an episode of 'Murder, She Wrote'.  All you have to do is make sure everyone has a motive and then randomly pick on at the end.Maybe it's because I'd heard so many good reports about this movie that I found it so utterly ordinary, but when I logged on to find it has scored so highly I was totally flabbergasted.  I'm beginning to think that I might have missed something critical that everyone else has seen.  Doubt it, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.",5,8,14,15 August 2001
