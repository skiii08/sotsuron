Requiem for a Dream," total waste of time , skip it !!
","Again , I don't know what's wrong with imdb top rated movies ! how this boring movie consider Top Rated Movies #81 !? for what ? for the awful story or for the bad music , this must be in top bottom . I can't hold my self to the end, so I turn it off after 30 minutes . because I didn't find any good story in it . it's only about people taking drugs , most boring movie I ever saw . not recommended to all .",1,1,7,23 August 2018

Captain Marvel," not bad, not good either!!
","The story was good , the 90's music was good too. the acting was somehow good ,Samuel was great , Brie larson had good moments and bad moments too , in my opinion they tried hard to force us to like her , but I don't think she is a good choice for captain Marvel's character. so , the movie in the end was watchable, I enjoyed watching it, but the other Marvel's movie were more better .6/10",6,0,1,26 June 2019
Us," a big disappointed !!
","What a big disappointed to me , I watched it with high expectations , but it all gone . the story started perfect , but after the first 20 minutes, it flawed misrebaly. the acting was good but the point is , i was so confused because I found a lot of humor in a movie that doesn't including comedy in it , it's supposed to be a horror , but it failed in both of them. i think this movie was overrated and overhyped too much .what a waste of time .2/10",2,5,7,25 June 2019

La La Land," most overrated movie of all time !!
","I heard about this movie from many people and friends , a mix of positive and negative thoughts , so I decided to watch it and make my own judgement . after I saw it I was really shocked, I think this movie deserves only 3 stars for only 3 thing nothing more :
 1- Ryan Gosling act was perfect I think he was so comfortable with good voice unlike Emma Stone she had the most annoying act . 
2- the camera work and the colors was so good.
3- the music was good, although I am not a big fan of jazz , but i like the whole music scene.but the rest of it was so boring to death , nothing new , nothing convinced me that this movie deserve 6 oscar , and I believe Emma stone she must win a razzie award for her performance and for her terrible voice. overrated 3/10",3,0,1,9 August 2018
