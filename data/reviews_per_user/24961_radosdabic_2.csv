The Lobster," Total waste of my time!
","After watching the movie, if this deserve to be called a movie, I came here to read the reviews. This cannot even be called weird, because than it would be overrated. Total waste of time. Pointless to watch, except if you want to see how deep our society has mentally fallen, and I'm not talking about the story, but about the fact that this movie has even reached the theaters. Not to mention viewers vote mark 7.3/10. I must notice that everything that comes from America (except Starwars this year) does not deserve any penny to be spent on it, nor call it a movie or even spend time to watch. For me, mark this high only shows how sick and perverted viewers have become nowadays. To bad for not having 0 or -1 as a vote mark.",1,15,25,11 January 2016
Children of Men," Not worth it, bunch of famous actors won't make a good movie of this one. Sorry for them, pathetic move in their careers.

What kind of a sick pervert you need to be to use a baby and immigrants to collect points from even sicker audience?
Man kind has fallen, so is theater. With this audience, extremely brain washed, I wouldn't be surprised to see this in Britain or USA even before 2027.Good luck to us all.
Before using your brains, feel free to shake your heads a bit. You'd be surprised how helpful can it be and how clear can you see.",1,1,10,22 July 2018
