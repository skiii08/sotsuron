","A lot of people told me this movie was really good and really scary before I saw it.  Of course, I did not believe it would be scary, but I was in for a real surprise when I actually saw it.This movie was one of the least scary movies I have ever seen.  First of all, it is a ridiculous premise for a movie, a killer videotape?In fact, the scariest thing about the movie is probably the colors.  It is so dark and dreary, everything seems to be a sort of metallic blue shade....not hugely appealing, although I suppose a good bit accurate for a film about the Pacific Northwest.If you are looking for a scary movie, this is not it.  It does not even have the sort of 'shocking/jump out of your seat' moments that even bad horror movies have.  I would call it a huge disappointment overall, and unless you are eight years old, this movie will not scare you.The only good thing is the fact that it stars the beautiful Naomi Watts.",3,1,2,3 September 2003
