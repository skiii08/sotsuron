Ford v Ferrari," Thoroughly enjoyable
","Great, entertaining, feel good movie--and so much more. Wonderful acting.",10,1,1,13 February 2020
Darkest Hour," Riveting
","Fantastic. Best movie we've seen this year, and we've seen most of those nominated for awards. The acting is great--of course Gary Oldman is wonderful and certainly deserved the Golden Globe. A must see this season.",10,1,8,11 January 2018
Dunkirk," Thankfully watched at home so I could get up now and then
","This is what is good about the movie: it's a very good history lesson and depiction of what happened in Dunkirk, and I might add was very useful to see before seeing Darkest Hour, which is a story about what led up to Dunkirk. This is what was not good about the movie: It was a very LONG history lesson to watch very little happening. I can't believe this movie was 2 hours because it felt like 4. I can see why none of the actors were nominated for awards, because there was very little dialogue for them to demonstrate their abilities. The way I've described it to friends is: its 45 minutes of watching men try not to drown under water, 25 minutes of watching them stand in line on the beach or on a bridge to get on a boat, 20 minutes of watching men try to climb INTO boats and either being successful or thrown out, 15 minutes about a guy and his sons, and then several guys mobilizing to save the men standing on the beach and the bridge--maybe a little more including the 'guy's' sons--one of whom remains perfectly coiffed through the end despite the circumstances, and 15 minutes of watching fighter pilots slowly drop to their death or in need of rescue in the ocean. Must say, my husband liked it--but he's a Vietnam era army veteran and history major and likes anything having to do with war or history. He probably would have rated it a 7.",3,0,1,11 January 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Made for Hollywood....
","....that is literally. This, I believe, is one of those movies that will do really well because it's about the field of acting. Every director who does a major movie about acting or Hollywood featuring many actors they can throw in, always seems to do well. I'd say, as a 'user' of movies, while interesting with a good premise and wonderful ending, some parts were just TOO long--evidenced by the movie being 2 hours and 40 minutes. But, in the end it was a great buddy movie, with excellent acting--and although very long (I noticed people--including myself on occasion, nodding off), the dramatic ending--last 15 minutes or so-- is worth the wait!!!",7,2,6,1 August 2019
The Lion King," Loved it!....Realistic and warm
","Having read some of the reviews of the critics we thought we'd be disappointed, but this movie and the new animation really tugs at the heartstrings in a different way than the 'old' animation could. We had read in critics' reviews that the animation left the animals expressionless. I'd say quite the opposite because it didn't have the exaggerated visuals the old 'cartoons' showed and the approach resulted in great empathy with the characters and their kingdom, and the animals looked like real animals. My suspicion is that those who felt the technique left the animals expressionless 1) have never had pets to understand the nuances of their feelings and/or 2) believe animals have no 'soul'. or have no imagination. This movie was wonderful. My husband, who's not a fan of what he deems 'kids movies' even enjoyed it....I didn't get old side-eye while we were watching it. (And by the way, we do not have kids and therefore, did not have kids with us.) Also, on the user reviews, I'm not sure what all the comments about voiceovers being bad and Beyonce voiceover being sub-par are about. Maybe I was just riveted by the animation, but there seem to be more than an abundance of those kinds of comments? Makes me wonder if some out of work voiceover specialist sabotage or other anti-Disney sabotage going on since they have produced so many block busters lately. This movie is well worth seeing--and seeing in the theatre.",10,1,6,23 July 2019
Mudbound," Could have been shorter
","Good story and acting was very good by all--thank goodness. It was very, very, very slow. We watched this On Demand, thankfully, so I could get up a couple times and do something. It's definitely worth watching for the acting, the photography. Just be prepared for a very heavy heart at many times throughout and a slow pace.",6,0,4,11 January 2018
Wonder Woman," Great of its kind--a nice surprise
","We watched this on On Demand lately. For some reason, I get roped into watching these comic movies because my husband wants to watch them. Typically, I suffer through. Aside from the lack of content in most all, the overuse of moving graphics and sound usually shut me down on the experience because they give me a headache! I was pleasantly surprised by Wonder Woman--throughly enjoyed it. Worth watching if you want to see a 'fun' movie some night.",9,2,3,11 January 2018
