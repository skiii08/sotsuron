Captain Phillips," Fantastic Movie, Poor Dialogue in Beginning
","Captain Phillips was a brilliant movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. The storyline is so powerful and emotional that I thought that it would be incredibly difficult to create a movie that could convey the emotions and feelings. I am happy to say that the movie surprised me in that I felt the emotions and really connected with the characters. The movie portrayed Captain Phillips very well, and the ending scenes were so packed with raw emotion and pain that I began to tear up (which is quite rare for a movie).The sole reason why this is not a 10/10 for me is that in the very beginning of the movie there is a dialog scene in the beginning that is awful. On the ride from his house to the airport or dock, Captain Phillips and his wife discuss how the world is changing and their kids' lives. I guess that this was meant to foreshadow the plot and make us see another side of Captain Phillips, but this is not just the worst dialogue in the movie, but it is some of the clunkiest dialogue I have ever seen. As a person who really focuses on the dialogue when rating movies, this left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the film. For nearly every fantastic conversation in the rest of the movie, I would think back to this scene and wonder why it was so horrible. The worst part was that the scene could have been cut out altogether and the story of the film wouldn't change at all.As nearly every other review will tell you, the movie is great as a whole. The rest of the film is beautiful and full of important moments. I would be hard-pressed to find a spot that could have been cut out without harming the movie's plot line. The characters are well developed and there isn't a person who doesn't belong in the story.All in all, it's a great film.",8,0,1,28 August 2015
