Sucker Punch," More than I expected
","When I saw the trailers (and came across a few reviews) . I was ready for a dumb movie with hot girls and overdone action . which was fine by me :) but while the movie does have AWESOME fantasy action scenes and beautiful girls it surely is ain't stupid .I don't know , maybe people do only 'see what they wanna see' . but they miss out a lot of things by doing that . the whole movie is treated like a music video , with beautiful artistic shots played on the soundtrack . and it was hard for me not to feel bad for the main character , and the other girls in the so called 'asylum' . I could identify with the fear they felt from being supervised by that master douchebag that runs the place . and the movie delivers a depressing feeling overall ... until 1 girl stands up for herself and brings hope to the rest .And it's funny how this movie is accused with putting women down when the whole idea of the movie is to talk ABOUT how they used to be treated , their struggle against it , and in the fantasy world she built in her head they have so much power and freedom (while still looking sexy - and there's nothing wrong in that) ,as they weren't treated as just sex objects by the story , they were breaking away from that tag someone put on them , making it possible to care for them as people . and while these adrenaline packed scenes put a smile on my face they were also emotionally charged and made you wonder - how do they effect the real life in the meantime .Suprizingly enough - the movie wasn't over sexualized , or violent . (maybe people are disappointed because that's what they wanted it to be ?) and I'm glad it didn't , weather it's for rating reasons or not , it managed to produce some of the most amazing action scenes we ever had in a movie to date , without being too bloody . and while sex was a big theme in this movie , it wasn't just randomly put there (like a lot of movies do) but was part of the story , and even there it was merely implied , bringing focus to whats really important . I would even go as far and say there was something 'feminist' about this movie . as 99 percent of the male characters were just hateful . well , except that old guy ...so remember , don't believe any review you read before you judge it by yourself ...oh and one more thing - the movie starts and ends with a great message . so don't let that go over your head ...",9,2,3,18 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Epic movie
","I remember when I first watched it , the whole 6 movies in one DVD set in fact . a very long time ago in a ... never mind . anyway , I found the original trilogy to be a bit boring . but the new one really captured me , especially this epic conclusion chapter . and made me realize something : star wars is not just for 'nerds' .Well , unless you take it too seriously ... but how can you? the robots and aliens are kinda comical . the acting is very 'shakespeare' like , and overdone , and even some of the effects are outdated . and what I'm trying to say is that you need to light up , and see it for what it actually is : a fantasy adventure story in a sci-fi world .And what a world it is - George Lucas created something huge , allowing other people to expand that universe by telling their own stories in it , from video-games , comics , and TV series ... although it does sometimes create 'holes' . for example : General Griveous . while he was supposed to have his first and last appearance in this movie . someone probably saw the potential in him and turned him into a big villain in the Clone Wars series . and I'm glad they did , because he is awesome . so that is forgivable . fi anything really bothered me though , it's the way too easy deaths , but that's about it ...The whole movie is full of wisdom , and memorable quotes . some epic battles . and to be honest , I had NO IDEA originally that (SPOILER ALERT?) Anakin is about to become Darth Vader . so this whole thing came as a surprise to me . him tearing apart between the Jedi and the Sith , doing some terrible things , along with the extinction of the Jedi . and lord Sith's identify finally being revealed (though come on...we knew who he was all along) and the birth of Luke and Leia ... made this movie not only really meaningful . but really emotionally powerful as well , heck I admit , some manly tears were shed when I first watched it .So in conclusion , I'd say that while some things in this movie are a bit outdated . it set a new standard in it's time , and to this day it remains entertaining and EPIC . if you like science fiction and adventures it's a must watch .",9,0,2,4 May 2013
