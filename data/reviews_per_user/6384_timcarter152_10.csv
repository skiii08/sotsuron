Alien 3," Quite possibly the most disappointing end to a trilogy ever made
","This is my first film review on IMDb, so I'm going to brief you on how I'll write my reviews from now on. First, I'll go through the positive attributes of a film (if any), followed by the negative attributes (if any). Then I'll end the review with 3 choice words that describe what I thought or how I feel about the film. With that out of the way, I'll start my review of the third (and what should have been the final) installment of the Alien franchise.The positives: -I like the look and style of the film, even though some of the areas of the prison look the same. Since this is a David Fincher film, though, that's to be expected. -I still love Ripley, and I like all the moments of the film between her and the characters that actually get developed (except the warden, he's just annoying). -I love the musical score of the film, and it's possibly the best score of all the Alien films. It's officially dented into my brain. -I think the film's ending is great, with the exception of the chestburster coming out of Ripley while she takes the Nestea plunge into molten lead (How can she grab onto it? She should be dead the instant it bursts out!).The Negatives: -Not a single moment of this film is frightening. We see all the 'scares' coming, when they should be unexpected. It seems that the filmmakers instead decided to make the deaths more graphic, which just makes these scenes repulsive (I find the chestburster coming out of the dog very distasteful). -WHY DID THEY KILL HICKS AND NEWT AT THE START OF THE MOVIE?! I realize that I'm sounding like a whiny fanboy right now, but this is a slap in the face to James Cameron, the numerous fans of 'Aliens', and me! They had all of this potential by keeping them alive, but they flushed it down the crapper anyway. What a waste. -The new characters other than Clemens and Dillon are one-dimensional bald guys with no character definition. They only seem to be there so they can get killed by the alien. -The visual effects are a mixed bag (how they got an Academy Award nomination is beyond me). While some effects look pretty good, others look obvious or below average, and the aforementioned chestburster coming out of Ripley almost looks cheesy.My 3 choice words: Frightless, Mediocre, Stylish",4,398,418,6 October 2007
Alien: Resurrection," This is one alien that should have stayed dead
","My eighth review for IMDb is for 'Alien: Resurrection', a forth installment that was made despite the fact that the franchise WAS SUPPOSED TO END WITH THE THIRD ONE. Oh well, I'm just gonna get this over with.The Positives: -Sigourney Weaver. Without her, this film wouldn't even deserve one star. -The CG looks good, with one glaring exception (I'll get to that later).The Negatives: -The actors that aren't Sigourney Weaver. Winona Ryder seems lost, and she doesn't belong in this movie. Ron Perlman is a great character actor, but the character and dialogue that he's given robs him of any opportunities to stand out. And who were the other characters in this movie again? I can't remember any of their names. -There are a lot of glaring plot holes in this film. How did they clone Ripley in the first place? Couldn't the company have gotten an alien some other way? How does Ripley have the alien inside her still? How could it take 200 years to clone her? And I thought that the aliens didn't kill one another. What gives? Trust me, there's a lot more where this came from. -Characters keep falling victim to horror film clichés, even after 'Scream' came out a year before this. How could a scientist smart enough to clone Ripley be stupid enough to look down the hole where the alien just went? -Random, stupid things happen in this movie. So that guy is a traitor? So Winona Ryder is dead now? So after a fight with the aliens, Winona Ryder is suddenly outside that door? So Winona Ryder is actually a robot? Huh?? -The alien/human hybrid child of Ripley is one of the worst visual effects creations I've ever seen. Not only does it look incredibly fake and silly, but the whole idea was stupid to begin with.My 3 choice words: Garbage, Letdown, Winonastrophe",2,1,2,8 October 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the greatest action films ever made, and I mean it
","My seventh review written for IMDb is on a film that everyone is familiar with, that everyone quotes, that is hailed by many as a classic action film. And I'm one of those many people. This is my first review on this site where I give the film in question 10 stars, which is only awarded to a film that has virtually no flaws whatsoever. And Terminator 2 is one of those films that deserves it.The Positives: -The acting is great all around. Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play the terminator, and Robert Patrick is effectively threatening as the T-1000. Linda Hamilton gives a fantastic performance this time around as Sarah Connor, as she convincingly conveys Sarah's pain, fear, intensity, and so on. And Eddie Furlong does a commendable job as John Connor, as he makes us genuinely care about the character. -The digital effects were revolutionary at the time, and still hold up today. Every effects shot still looks as convincing as ever. -The action sequences are outstanding. I don't need to give you any examples, because you know how good they are already. -The humor, the score, the famous quotes... need I go on?The Negatives: -What? Unless you nitpick (and I don't), then don't expect anything here.My 3 choice words: Exhilarating, Masterful, AWESOME!!",10,3,4,8 October 2007
Aliens," This film demonstrates just what a sequel SHOULD do
","The following review is my... oh God, don't tell me that I've already lost count! The Positives: -The acting is superb throughout the film. I don't feel the need to go into how great Sigourney Weaver's performance is, considering that she got an Oscar nomination for it (unheard of for the science-fiction genre). Also of particular note is Carrie Henn as Newt. It's too bad that this was her only film appearance, considering how deftly she avoided joining the long list of annoying children in grown-up movies (even with all the screaming she does). -The movie (very thankfully) avoided becoming a rehash of the first film, instead opting to become more of an action film with thriller, horror, and sci-fi elements mixed in. And boy, was James Cameron (the director, for those ignorant people who don't already know) ever successful! After the first hour, which serves as setup and character development, the film becomes an extremely intense, frightening thrill ride (sorry for sounding like the critic from Maxim magazine). -The visual effects hold up very well, even though the film was made in 1986. You can hardly (if at all) notice any of the puppetry, stop motion, or models. It looks realistic. On a different note, the sets and atmosphere also contribute greatly to the film's success.The Negatives: -The Marines seem a bit too jokey at times, but considering how much better the film is with the humour they contribute, you can't honestly cite that as a problem.My 3 choice words: Intense, B**ch, Newtastic",10,3,5,24 October 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Logic vs. Stupidity-You know which one will win, so I'll tell you: we lose
","Before I begin this, my fourth review on IMDb, I must get some sort of answer to this question: how on earth did this film get a PG-13 in the U.S.? If we see people get stabbed with blades and have aliens burst out of their chests, along with aliens having their heads sliced off and Predator blood flying everywhere, then shouldn't that get this movie an R? Honestly, Fox must have bribed the MPAA through the nose to get this movie in theaters with a PG-13. Just goes to show how corrupt the MPAA is nowadays. Anyway, I'll get to the point: this movie is garbage.The Positives (I'll have to think hard for this one): -Well, the 'honour' stuff with the Predators was...okay. -The Aliens and Predators fight...an hour into the movie.The Negatives: -The plot should have been nonexistent, because the one they have here is laughably stupid. And when they try to explain it, you'll probably go 'What the ****?' I'm not going to go into it, because I'd steal the laughter from you. -There are too many logic and plot holes to count, let alone to tell you about in detail. Even a 7 year old could notice these plot holes within a fraction of a second. -The first hour is character interaction between characters we don't care about. We have a second-rate Ripley and Lance Henriksen's Bishop. Those are the only two people you'll remember from this movie. And when Lance Henriksen can't give even a decent performance in a movie, you know it's bad. -Cheesy slow-motion, the ending shot, a complete lack of entertainment... I can go on and on about this.My 3 choice words: Idiotic, Illogical, Boring",2,0,3,8 October 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A solid piece of summer entertainment. (and the kids can see it too!)
","This, my third review on IMDb, is on a rarity: a pretty good sequel to a pretty mediocre original. The Positives: -The Silver Surfer is a great visual effects creation, and is partially what anchors this film far above the first film (being voiced by Laurence Fishburne and played by Doug Jones definitely helps). Oh, and the rest of the effects are solid as well. -The film revels in humor, and provides a solid amount of genuine laughs (I even found a good amount of Chris Evans' quips funny). -The portrayals of the characters are closer to the source material this time around, though Jessica Alba needs to make Susan Storm at least a bit more intelligent (I'm not saying she's an idiot, though). -Most of the action scenes are pretty entertaining, especially the chase between the Human Torch and the Silver Surfer. -With a PG rating and a 90 minute running time, the film is a great matinée movie. -You'll have a good time if you keep in mind that this is supposed to be as silly as it is. The Negatives: -Julian McMahon's Doctor Doom is back, and more lame and insulting to the character than ever! There really is no reason why he should be back, as the film would have been just fine without him. -The drama and romance moments are a mixed bag. While some work fine (especially those between the Thing and his girlfriend-I think her name is Alicia), others just come off as cheesy and unconvincing. -Chris Evans in still annoying at times (I know the character is supposed to be, but I think Mr. Evans is pushing it). -Product placement. At least they poke fun at it.My 3 choice words: Solid, Flawed, Surfertastic",7,2,4,6 October 2007
Beowulf," 'Are you not entertained?!'... whoops, wrong movie... 'THIS IS SPARTA!'... okay, one more go... 'I AM BEOWULF!'
","(Note: If the film is in IMAX 3-D (as I saw it), then this film gets a 9).I AM BEOWULF! Man, I couldn't even count how many times he shouted that in this movie. Anyway, for my latest review, I'll take a look at the new film from Robert Zemeckis, 'Beowulf', which is based on an old folk tale that I've never read. Fortunately, you won't have to have read that story to enjoy 'Beowulf'.The Positives: -Visually and aurally, this film is phenomenal. It's unlike just about anything you've ever seen before, and it's a masterful showcase of motion capture technology. Plus, you know that problem with 'The Polar Express' where the characters occasionally looked creepy? Well, they pretty much fixed that here. -The performers all do a very good job of playing their characters. I especially liked Crispen Glover's portrayal of the monster Grendel, and I actually felt pity for him when he was put to rest. -The action scenes are great, and are by far the best aspect of 'Beowulf'. The climactic battle between the aged Beowulf and the dragon is absolutely breathtaking (and yes, I do realize that I sound as if I'm begging to be quoted).The Negatives: -The story itself is good but not great, and for a fantasy or epic battle film, I often expect the story to be great. This isn't a huge problem, mind you, but I simply felt that the story was missing something (which, yes, I can't put my finger on). -The movie doesn't start all too strongly, and the earlier half of the film has occasional jokes that come close to being groan-inducing. The acting also seems a bit weaker at the start. Fortunately, the film's quality improves as it goes along, and it reaches true greatness once Beowulf prepares to encounter Grendel's mother (played by Angelina Jolie... but you already knew that, didn't you?) -This is a small quibble, but when Beowulf decides to fight Grendel... er... naked, other guys in the audience (myself included) may feel uncomfortable.My 3 choice words: Revolutionary, Exhilarating, Gorgeous.",8,3,10,19 November 2007
300," A very blood-soaked work of art
","For my ninth review for IMDb (this includes ones that weren't posted), I'll tackle the smash hit film '300'. I was looking forward to this film quite a bit, and fortunately it didn't disappoint me.The Positives: -The film looks drop dead gorgeous. I just can't describe with words how stunning this film looks. Like Frank Miller's 'Sin City', the frames of this film look like they were ripped right from the comic book. -The battle scenes (which take up most of the film's second half) are great, as they're both stylish and entertaining to watch. The final one is actually moving, as the 300 Spartans sacrifice their lives. -The acting is solid, even when the dialogue isn't (though that's not too often). Gerard Butler and Lena Headey stand out the most, and Rodrigo Santoro makes an effective Xerxes.The Negatives: -The plot is very simplistic, and we know from the beginning that the 300 Spartans die. However, it doesn't seem as if the film needs a more complex plot, and the graphic novel had a simple plot to begin with, so I'm not going to be overly harsh about that. -Like the graphic novel, historical accuracy is thrown out the window, so don't be surprised when you see rhinos, giant elephants, and the uber immortal.My 3 choice words: Beautiful, Bloody, Abmazing",8,0,3,8 October 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The funniest film I've ever seen, and I don't think it's going to lose that title anytime soon
","For my tenth review on IMDb, I've chosen one of my all-time favorites. It makes me laugh myself silly throughout, even after seeing it numerous times. Is it 'The Birds'? Is it 'Airplane!'? While the second one would be close, the answer is no! It's...(cue intermission)The Positives: -The movie wears its low budget with pride, and gets as many laughs at its expense as humanly possible. -The sheer imagination in this lunacy is apparent from scene one, when King Arthur and Patsy are using coconuts to make it sound as if they're riding horses. From Sir Belvedere's methods of finding witches to the hideous black beast of arrrgh, every moment is truly inspired. -The Monty Python troupe perform their multiple roles with hilarity, and give the impression that they're making you laugh yourself silly without really trying. My favorite one scene characters: John Cleese's black knight and Michael Palin's Dennis. -This movie got a dozen laughs out of me with the opening credits alone. Isn't that enough to convince you how funny this movie is?The Negatives: -You've got to be joking.

The Wizard of Oz," Easiest... review... EVER.
","My 14th review for IMDb will be by far the easiest one I'll ever write. 'The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has endured for 68 years (as of 2007), and will undoubtedly continue to live in people's hearts long after you, the dear reader, ceases to live. To point out a flaw in this film is the equivalent of finding a flaw in the Mona Lisa: you just can't. And even if you do, you'll never be able to shake off your enduring memories of it.The Positives: -Everything. And I mean EVERYTHING.The Negatives: -You're kidding, right?My 3 choice words: Classic, Magical, Rainbow.",10,6,9,24 October 2007
