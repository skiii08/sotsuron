Requiem for a Dream," dream of a movie about a nightmare, for a world that needed such a wake up call
","This is one of my favorite movies and I always suggest it.  The response I frequently get is how they didn't like it to which, after asking why they didn't, they respond, because it was horryfing or depressing, shocking, or something of the sort.  I think that is exactly what is so wonderful about it.  Aronofsky's Requiem shows to mercy to three kids who mind as well be faceless.  We live in a time of addiction and abuse to drugs and finally there is a film which sugar coats nothing.  What is most impressive about Selby's writing is how he's not just examined teenage drug use but adult drug use as well and in as much, knowing the problem is universal is all the more terrifying- no one is free from the clutches of addiction and uneccessary need and no one, at least should say, I can do it, I have a resistance, I can take just a little bit more.  Its about pushing lines and being stuck on the other side of them.  With special effects sequences which for once, don't take away from the movie but greatly add to its objective. Aronofsky throws life in our face, and we catch--in an almost welcomed discomfort--a problem, so real you feel your heart breaking for these characters everytime you watch. Leto, Wayans, the beautiful Connelly, and the wonderful Burstyn make the cast--cast rather well--and act circles around circles- wonderful performences, along with movie all unappreciated. Philip Glass provides the empowering tear-jerking requiem for a dream of a movie about a nightmare, for a world that needed such a wake up call. Definate A.",Null,0,0,14 June 2003
Amadeus," Really good.
","I love classical music and while you don't have to to enjoy this movie, true lovers of music, especially classical will enjoy it all the more.  Amadeus is a masterpiece of spectacular performances, a great story, and music, heavenly music.  The costume and make up art is incredible in this movie as is the score which takes the place, truly of a third character in that when the main characters feel a certain way the music truly portrays it in a sympathetic fashion that hits you inside. A bit long, but wonderful, and a classic.  Top notch direction and cinemotography to match.  It will make you laugh, perhaps even cry, most importantly think, and if lucky, inspire greater things.  Winner of 8 1994 Academy Awards.  Rated: A-",Null,2,4,22 June 2003
When Harry Met Sally...," when harry met sally they made a timeless classic
","One of the greater things about this movie is the reality it, at the very least aspires to.  Harry, the leading male is based in no small part on Director Reiner while writer Ephron gives basis for Sally.  Of course, Woody Allen is the king of the genre, but he has one flaw: his relationships are his relationships and while memorable and fun to experience are still his to call his own.  The wonder of When Harry met Sally, besides how wonderful it is, is how generic it is. This could have been any man, any woman. The problems are universal. It was a cornerstone and remains one of the greatest bibles to the relationship, conquering issues and questions no greater than 'can a man and woman just be friends,' and 'what do we want' both as humans and individual men and women; a movie which changed the way men and women think, act, and date, to this day. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are the perfect pair with chemistry, such chemisry, watching them act is treat enough. But the movie takes the cake and it is sweet. The mixings of Reiner and Academy Award Nominated Ephron cook up a timeless classic. You'll laugh, you may cry, you'll think, hopefully learn something, and laugh again. A-",Null,0,2,14 June 2003
