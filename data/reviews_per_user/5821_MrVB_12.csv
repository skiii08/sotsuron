Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pleasantly surprised
","Caveat:  I do NOT worship the 'Star Wars: Trilogy'.  I appreciate the SUPERB special effects but I also appreciate a well thought out story-line, good dialog and acting, which I felt were sorely lacking in Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.I waited 6 weeks before seeing the Phantom Menace and was expecting to react the same way I react to a new James Bond movie; all that money and no movie!Well, I was shocked.  This is not only a very good sci-fi movie but a damn good movie in general.
Good points:1] The movie moves the characters from local to local for good reasons.2] the direction is well above average, with Liam Neeson turning in a superb performance (he has an amazing presence which at the same time doesn't keep telling you, 'Hey, isn't that guy Liam Neeson?').3] The dialog goes well above, 'We are conquering your planet because our guns are bigger than yours'.Star Wars fans complain about Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) being so 'proper' compared to Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher); that's like comparing Captain Kirk (William Shatner) to Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart).  In real life, Princess Leia would be a COMPLETE anomaly in regards to the way a princess, so to speak (Oh man, I'm actually taking this nonsense seriously!), would behave.The movie does have several weak points:1] The absolute funniest moment in the movie follows when Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) realize they are about to be ambushed in the conference room.  There's a sequence where they are seen, from a distance, jumping from a hole in the wall into a large warehouse area.  It looks like two jelly beans being abruptly plopped.  I mentioned this to several hard-core Star Wars fans who, in retrospect, remembered the scene, and went into convulsions laughing.2] Jar Jar Binks is a one dimensional, and very NOT funny, joke, and completely unnecessary (I really didn't want to have to translate his broken English while I'm trying to sit back and enjoy a movie).3] There's way too much time spent on Anakin Skywalker's home planet (but then George Lucas would have had to cut at least 40 minutes out of the movie).4] Samuel L. Jackson's acting is completely embarrassing (really, look at him staring blankly into the camera during the Jedi council meetings). Samuel L. Jackson is quoted in People as begging George Lucas to cast in him in the Phantom Menace; I guess by the time the cameras started filming, George Lucas was too embarrassed to tell him how bad his acting was and that he should leave while he's ahead of himself.5] The special effects are VISUALLY impressive but, overall, not IMAGINATIVE.  There's no object morphing that made me say, 'Wow, I wouldn't have thought of that!'.  One possible exception is the Federation Council room consisting of floating platforms.The 'Star Wars Myth' aside, I enjoyed this movie.  In MY opinion, a movie has to stand it's own merits, and not be held up to a 'cult following' status.",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
Citizen Kane," A Great Movie!
","A brilliant plot whereby a reporter seeks the soul of a man who it ends up doesn't have one.The drive to abandon a childhood of poverty and gain the world devours Charles Kane in his endless pursuit of wealth, fame and self-indulgence.The direction is natural, the dialog is sharp and the cinematography is brilliant, even by today's standards. Orson Wells packs each scene with visual and sound effects, which grab the viewer and stimulate the imagination.This is a character study meant to stimulate the intellect, not the emotions.This is a great movie and certainly was one of the most daring movies ever made in its time.As an aside:  I saw this in film studies 18 years ago (egads, am I getting old!) and it's stunning on the big screen.",10,0,0,8 September 1999
12 Angry Men," Black & white, no special effects. Just Brilliant!!!
","The plot, production, direction, dialog, acting!  90 minutes of brilliance!!!  I have seen this film 10 times or so in the last 35 years and it is without question the greatest film ever made!See it!!!",Null,0,1,8 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Best of the Star Wars Trilogy
","If you think Star Wars is one of the greatest movies ever made, read no further. If you enjoy well made films of the sci-fi genre as well as other genres, read on.One of the things I look for in a film is progression. Why are the characters moving from one place to another? How are the characters developing throughout the film.Star Wars and The Empire Strike Back FAIL on both counts. Yes, they have great special effects but to a person looking beyond the visuals; for plot, character and dialog they are both MAJOR disappointments. Return Of The Jedi succeeds FULLY in plot development and PARTIALLY in terms of character development.The hero, and by far the most likable character, of this series winds up being Hans Solo. Luke Skywalker is rendered as an ineffectual emotionless cardboard character who accomplishes virtually nothing in both The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi. Star Wars fans hate hearing that Luke Skywalker is useless in this film; they defend him by offering his redemption of his father.  Ooh, how original!  How many PIRATE films have used this plot device countless times? Darth Vader is a COMPLETE wuss as he is TOTALLY subservient to The Emperor.Most people argue that the opening sequence is a waste of time and has nothing to do with the main story. Well perhaps, but then the film would have been 20 minutes shorter and everyone would have complained about THAT.  I propose that Star Wars has at least 30 minutes of boring footage (Sand dunes, sand dunes, sand dunes. YAWN!) and The Empire Strikes Back should have advertised as 'Sci-Fi Fans ONLY Need View'.The Ewoks are fine.  Remember, George Lucas had lots of cash to spend and you see it on the screen.",9,1,2,9 September 1999
Fargo," Yawn!!!
","The interwoven 1/3 of the movie that deals with crime and pursuit is OK. The plot is on the level of the average weekly cop show, the direction is so casual you can slip into a coma, the acting is OK and the dialog is uninspired. There's a bit of violence.A VERY average made for TV movie.  I really don't know what all the fuss was about.",Null,1,2,8 September 1999
The Hills Have Eyes," 'Wrong Turn' gone Wrong
","As the film is 'spoiled', so is my review full of Spoilers.I must admit up front that I gave up after an hour. Of course, I was hoping the family would be massacred before my boredom threshold was reached, but no such luck.There is nothing subtle about this film regarding character development, plotting or 'creation' of suspense, of which there is absolutely no suspense whatsoever. We are deluged almost from the start with interactions between family members and all too soon get to meet, in daylight, the evil radiation diseased coal-mining monsters.First of all, I don't really give a hoot about this boring family, but the director apparently coerced the screen writers to pad this film to the hilt giving us all the clich√©d characters under the sun. The family is a caricature of the generation gap and political polarization which has existed since before the Constitution was written up.Let's see, the dad's a private eye who haphazardly fires his gun at oxygen molecules and then gets into a vehicle during a duress causing scenario, in the dark of night, without looking in the back seat first. Brilliant screen writing, but I was bored to tears way before this scene.Oh yes, let's not forget that mister private eye, whose job it is to find people, has led his family into a completely deserted desert which was used by the government for atomic weapons testing.The son, influenced by his father's gun-toting antics, is portrayed as freaked out after finding one of his dogs guts ripped open and yet wanders off the main 'camp site' alone, at night, without his gun.The mentally deranged gas-station attendant has, gasp, almost no teeth and looks not at all affected by radiation poisoning like the others of his ilk do. Mr. gas-pump spends about 10 really dull minutes with the family pumping their vehicle with gasoline, and telling them exactly how to proceed to their destination. After an impromptu scene where he suspects they might find out he's a deranged gas-pump attendant with cannibalistic tendencies, he then proceeds to guide the family in the direct opposite direction. And Mr. private eye listens!By the way, who delivers the gasoline to the gas-station in the middle of an area abandoned by and forbidden by the U.S. government? Who delivers the food and drinks to this diner in no man's land?The nuclear coal-mining victims are portrayed as wild, mindless cannibals, yet know how to fire weapons, gut out dogs and outwit stupid families who listen to the gas-stop attendant who thankfully finally shoots his brains out almost half-way through the film.The son-in-law is a peace loving democrat who sells cell phones and won't pick up a gun, but will venture out, at night, without a gun, to search for mr. private eye with mr. private eye's son.Apparently, my suspension of disbelief failed me.",1,1,3,16 May 2007
Duck Soup," The 2nd funniest comedy ever made (after Horse Feathers)
",I apologize up front.  My comments for Duck Soup will be the same as Horse Feathers and The Coconuts as these are the 3 funniest movies ever made the by the 3 funniest people ever to grace this planet.What's there to say?  Three brothers wield their TIMELESS comedic and musical GENIUS before the cameras.  In this film The Marx Brother go to War. The Marx Brothers go to WAR (Duck Soup)!?  The Marx Brother go to COLLEGE (Horse Feathers)!?The Marx Brothers take over a hotel (The Coconuts)!?  Who CARES?  The story-line DOESN'T matter.  The Marx Brothers INGENIOUSLY twist any phrase or object into HILARITY.Duck Soup and The Coconuts are SLIGHTLY edged out by Horse Feathers (the most brilliant display of the Marx Brothers genius).If they made only these three films they would still be hailed as the greatest comedic geniuses of all time.,Null,0,0,10 September 1999
A Hard Day's Night," Brilliant film captures brilliant artists
","Excellent production, script, acting and what BRILLIANT music composed under the duress of filming and touring!  John Lennon's tour-de-force (he wrote 11 1/2 songs on the album, Paul McCartney wrote half of 'And I Love Her' and all of 'Things We Said Today').  The script captures perfectly the joys and draining madness of Beatlmania.  The Beatles prove in this film that they are deserving of the fame and adulation.",Null,5,5,12 April 1999
The Producers," Among the most brilliant comedies ever
","Brilliant comedy produced by Mel Brooks (his first production), starring Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder and Dick Shawn.  An ingenious concept, produce a flop Broadway play and embezzle the investments.  Songs 'Flower Power', 'Springtime For Hitler', 'Prisoners In Love' are catchy tunes with hilarious, yet intelligent lyrics. The funniest movie you will ever see.  A gem throughout.",10,0,1,12 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Overrated and BORING!!!
","I watched Star Trek the first time around from 1966 to 1968.  Then poof. Low ratings.  No more Star Trek.  Every now and then an oasis (such as 2001 or Soylent Green) would pop up and temporarily satiate my apetite for good sci-fi.Then...Star Wars!!!  Man, was my adreneline pumping!  I went to the theatre, plucked down my money and was blown away by the special effects, the story, the FORCE!!!Well...it's 30 years later and I realize it takes about an hour and a half for Star Wars to start.  The effects are still great (I judge movies by when they were produced, not by today's standards) but the script is drawn out (how many sand dunes do I REALLY want to see), the dialog is not quite as witty as I remember (though some of the quips between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are still quite amusing) and the space battles are very badly editted.Yes, Harrison Ford became a mega-star which I do not at all attribute to Star Wars because Mark Hamill's career went absolutley nowhere and Carrie Fisher only managed to pop up in a Woody Allen film (sorry, can't remember which one).All in all, it's not Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane or 12 Angry Men. It's just an average movie that was produced when the genre was considered too risky for studios to pump money into it's production.See Return Of The Jedi or Phantom Menace;  they're more fun.",Null,0,0,8 September 1999
Apollo 13," A Masterpiece
","The danger of a really big film is the more a producer and director try to accomplish, the larger the opportunity to miss hitting the target.This film hits one bullseye after another.  The production, direction, acting and dialog are nothing short of brilliant.  After all, Failure is NOT an option!What blew me away was the portrayal of technology while making the audience truly care about the characters and even though we knew the ending, the audience still gasped when we heard Apollo announce a safe entrance into Earth's atmosphere.",10,1,1,10 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Live Comic Book for Sci-Fi Lovers Only
","A good live COMIC BOOK SCI-FI film as opposed to a good film.  Lots of special effects, costumes, aliens, sophomoric dialog and cardboard acting. Great, daring film in its time.  Great film for sci-fi lovers who will watch anything sci-fi because it had a tremendous budget and didn't skimp on production values.Boring to a mature viewer who enjoys other genres as well as sci-fi. Overly violent, illogically sequenced; this is the weak link in the Star Wars saga.",4,6,41,9 September 1999
