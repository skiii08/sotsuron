The Ring," What Suspense and Horror should be
","When I first watched the film I was incapable of sitting and watching the whole thing the beginning had scared me so bad. A couple months had gone by and hearing everyone continue to talk about how good the movie was, I decided to give it another shot. I now own the movie, once I was able to get past the parts that terrified me, I was able to observe the film for what it was and the elements used in the film that made the scary parts of the film truly scary.The outline of the story surrounds the 'urban legend' if you will, of a tape that was made that if you watch it, exactly seven days later you die. Naomi Watts plays a news reporter looking into this story after a group of teens all die at the same night and time after visiting Shelter Mountain a week earlier. She does her investigating and uncovers more and more about 'The Tape' and realizes that is more to it than she originally thought.A well paced movie, with great acting, good tension build-ups and good 'Jump' moments. The music does a great bit of help in the film, without Hans Zimmer's quiet, creepy music, the film wouldn't have been anywhere near as dark without it. It helped carry the flow of the movie all the way to the climax where you might as well be chewing on the edge of the couch because of the thrill it gives with its twist ending.Great horror film with no gore or blood which is how horror films should be made, highly recommended.",9,1,2,1 April 2008
The Shining," What to say....
","Don't get me wrong, the originality of the story is great, mainly because it was done before all of those abandoned but 'haunted' hotels, motels, houses, whatever kind of building scenario. But I thought the movie moved at a time dragging pace, the whole shot of Danny Torrence rolling around on his tricycle left me wondering...'What was the director thinking?' A lot of the things that happened in the movie made no sense to me really. The book I thought was much more clear and less abstract on the transformation of Jack Torrence. I also thought the betrayal of Jack Torrence's character was wrong. We essentially knew nothing about him or his family, other than Danny was having bad dreams, then it starts with the Torrence's taking over of the hotel for the winter and Jack has lost his mind.I loved how it was done in the book, you got a good feel for who Jack was and where he had come from and you felt good about him. When they go to the hotel the symptoms Jack experienced where eye widening. He was chewing on the aspirin, losing his temper and getting major headaches, all conclusive to when he was drinking, but he wasn't. I thought the movie missed a little on that. The movie by itself however seemed to want to breath a life of it's own rather than paying homage to the novel it came from. I guess when it came down to it, I really had no care for the wife and child. Danny walking around saying redrum was really one of the most annoying things I have ever had to watch. But because the film was so slow to progress that when the climax finally showed up it failed to make up for lost time and attention.All in all, an O.K. movie, but I really don't see what the hype was all about in the this other than the famous 'Here's JOHNNY!' line. Watch it if you wish, obviously it has a 8.5 on IMDb for a reason...",5,43,70,31 March 2008
The Happening," Something Different
","I am a big Shymalan fan, The Sixth Sense was well done, and Unbreakable was something different all together with his take on the comic book hero. Signs was a brilliant film, sure there were some parts that were 'quirky' but it still delivered. The Village was a buffet of great actors and proof that you can make a great movie for an hour and ten minutes. Lady and the Water was a pretty good flick, regardless of others have said, it is one of my favorite fantasy films I have watched since 'The NeverEnding Story'.Now comes The Happening, an apocalyptic film about a family that goes on the run after what is initially reported as supposed terrorist attacks in New York. The first bit of it was very intriguing, it helped build suspense for what was going to happen next. Then came in Mark Walhberg's character, a high school science teacher who starts a open conversation with his class about disappearing honey bees. While I never thought Marky Mark would fit all that well as a ordinary guy in a flick but for the first half hour or so, he pulls it off quite well. But something happened, maybe it was the time schedule, or maybe a combination of both wanting to get this film out the door and the time schedule. The acting for whatever reason seemed to slip gradually as the movie progressed, the visual presentation of the film was still top notch. Then came in the gore, people jumping off roofs or shooting themselves in the face and many others, it begged the question if it was Night's idea alone to push the film to an 'R' rating. It just didn't seem in place for a director that exploited on showing you so little.There is no twist ending, and I don't expect to ever see another one from another sham flick again. The idea and concept of the movie as a whole was something amazingly different and unique in it's own way, but yet it still rang as another 'we need to watch out for the environment' flick. You can argue that this film was a less action packed version of 'The Day After Tomorrow' but with better science....I suppose.But in the end, for what it's worth, I still enjoyed the movie, I feel that the message of the movie could have been picked up without the extra violence. It is by far Night's weakest film, but when the Avatar trilogy is done, you can guarantee that I will be at the theaters to watch his next film.",4,7,13,20 June 2008
