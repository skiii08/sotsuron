The King's Speech," This Was Very Meaningful...
","I watched this movie a long time ago, with my parents, when I was still smaller. But I didn't understand the concept at first, because I had a small, innocent mind. Then, I watched it previously, and it warmed my heart. It was a simple movie, some people say bland, but I say brilliant. Reality isn't always so sweet, full of great photography and cinematography, the photography to me, was very marvelous for this kind of theme, more of a black and white concept. I liked this movie. It was very touching, showing how hard people can work. I recommend this movie to people who have not watched it, because it's a very heartwarming and meaningful movie.",9,0,1,8 April 2019
The Sound of Music," MY HEART IS ALIVVEE
","When my friend told me she was inviting me to go see a musical, my heart soared. It would be great! When I arrived at the Hollywood Bowl to watch the Sound of Music musical film, I was completely hooked, more than I thought I would ever be. Soon, me and my friend were singing along, waving our flashlights and flowers in the air, laughing at Sister Maria's antics. This classic is certainly to be remembered. Everyone should keep this dear in their hearts. This shows that miracles can truly happen and this is something we should closely appreciate.",10,0,0,20 March 2019
A Star Is Born," Amazing Story...But Some Tweaks...
","A Star Is Born is a romance, and it is not sappy whatsoever. It is true, and it shows what fame and fortune can do to you. This story was very meaningful, but it sometimes cannot make someone cry, depending on the person you are. I'm a person to easily cry, but this film did not make me cry. This film was deeply moving and everything is well put and the music is very deep and can hit back home for many.
But...if you don't want spoilers, do not read this! After Jack, (Bradley Cooper) hangs himself in his garage and dies, Annie, (Lady Gaga) is, Yes, very sad, but I wish that she could've come to a realization that fame was not important anymore, and that she should sing things that mean everything to her, and that push her to keep going, and to not be manipulated by other people to become someone she's not. It focused more on Jack's death other than Annie's change through time. It was a great story and film, but it could've been improved.",7,0,1,12 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel is a big Avengers Debut
","This is a beautifully crafted movie. Stan Lee and the rest of the crew did a spectacular job filming. I see some bad reviews of this movie, most of them unreasonable. But I can accept outward opinions. Brie Larson, who stars as Captain Marvel, did a wonderful job of filming. It was also very unexpected, having twists and turns here and there. There are kid-friendly jokes that will make even the older of the crowd laugh out loud. Even I couldn't trust the alien species at first, wondering if they were trustworthy or not. It's a very touching movie, if you think about it. When she and her best friend reunited, I almost cried. Was it just me? Alright, then. But enough of that. Captain Marvel is such a good role model for girls, and everyone else. As you can see, it's not saying that Captain Marvel is perfect and can do everything. She has to gain control of it. Without control, she would be useless, with or without her powers both. So let us embrace this movie together and wait for End Game, but until then, watch this movie, and enjoy your time with Carol Danvers!",7,1,3,12 March 2019
The Hunger Games," What Did I Watch?
","This film, yes, is a tribute to the amazing trilogy that Suzanne Collins has crafted into an intriguing, heartbreaking series that is very raw and real about what might happen in the future and the pain it feels to know that you're like chess pieces on a chessboard, moving knowing that you'll have a risk of dying just for the sake of entertainment for the Capitol. But the movie? It made me so disappointed.
Yes, many films that are based off of books are not as interesting as one should expect them to be. The Hunger Games is a great story, and the movie brought down my ratings. It was basically Katniss taking naps everywhere and teasing Peeta, killing people, and it's basically as dull as a diary entry, for all I know. This bland film bored me to death, except for when Rue died. I'm sorry, I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy the film.",4,0,2,27 May 2019
Knives Out," Impressive
","This was a fantastic film! A classic, your mind wandering to every single detail. This film was certainly a memorable one, hilarious as well.",8,0,1,21 December 2019
Moana," Moana Is Her Own Kind Of Princess
","Moana is a very determined young lady. She's the princess that everyone should look up to. The ocean is beautifully portrayed in this animated film and it doesn't need to be live action to be a great Disney movie. Yes, people are complaining that as Disney grows and the years pass by, and people's expectations get higher and higher, new Disney movies are not as good as the old ones. But Moana definitely lived up to everyone's expectations and this movie is full of fun music and a beautiful story about a young, determined and brave girl.",8,0,3,23 March 2019
The Book Thief," More Like Heart Thief
","This story stole my heart. A true and wonderful classic, Book Thief is a film that everyone should watch. Liesel is such an understandable character. I can feel the fear and the bravery and the curiosity. Every child needs to see this film, and every adult needs to see it even more. Even though there are sadnesses, this brought me tears of happiness, not only sadness. It shows how lucky we are to have the lives we have, and how much people suffer for the sake of us. Book Thief is one of my favorites and always will be.",10,0,0,23 March 2019
Tangled," Rapunzel is Intriguing
","Rapunzel is a noble and a very brave princess. This isn't only about a princess and a thief falling in love, but it is also about following your dreams but respecting your elders as well. Mother Gothel, even though she was a villain, had me laughing. It shows, to other mothers, not Mother Gothel in particular, how much mothers can care for their children. They want to protect them. Especially mothers and fathers. Even though Mother Gothel only loved Rapunzel for her magical, long hair, other mothers probably don't. The songs were touching and fun and exciting, and everything about Tangled was a magical expierence for me.",10,1,1,23 March 2019
Interstellar," A Meaningful and Breathtaking Movie...
","My math tutor, Mr. Lee, actually recommended this movie to me. He told me it was one of the highlights of his movie experiences. I laughed and told him I would watch it, due to his sake. And when I watched it, it was breathtaking. My eyes were glued to the television screen. I didn't even notice my dad walking away to grab a cup of coffee. I was completely trapped into the movie. This movie not only tells a breathtaking story of space and has beautiful photography, it tells about the bond between a father and his family. Cooper is such a strong man. It gets us thinking about what it would be like to have to leave our family and everything we love and care about behind to save all of humanity, only to find that it was all worthless and to hope for the better. It made me cry, seeing Cooper watch the videos of his son growing up, and seeing his daughter all grown up, Murph, for the first time. It was so meaningful. It's a simple and beautiful story. And as a daughter, I thought about what it would be like to not see my father for so many years, as he struggled to save the world. Please watch this movie. You'll be captured by everything it has to offer. This was one of the futuristic stories that actually made my hairs bristle. If we don't do our best to conserve our resources, many people would have to give up everything they need. Thank you for listening.",10,1,1,12 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Freddie Is A Queen
","Everything about this film is intriguing. Do not listen to the bad reviews. If you scroll, many of these reviews, most of them, are good reviews about this film. It has an interesting storyline, and has a tint of humor, not too much humor that it makes it a huge comedy that comes clingy and try-hard, and the music is well presented. Everything is so raw and real, and if someone smiles, you smile with them. If Freddie cries, you cry and bear with him. If Freddie is angry you feel angry with him. Everything makes you feel. And it proves that Queen is not just a band, it is a life-changing group of musicians. This movie is surely a queen, and his story is as intriguing as his music is. Start getting some tissues ready, and start drumming your head and humming to the beat as these rock stars make their debut.",9,1,1,12 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Queen's Days Are Not Over
","We will...we will rock you. It's still ringing in my head to this very moment. Bohemian Rhapsody might be hard to understand or explain at times, but that's what makes it so special. This story is so intriguing, and it shows how difficult but how much love really counts in life. Everyone in the theatre was singing, waving their arms around, and hollering. It was a flash mob of our anthem. Bohemian Rhapsody is a breathtaking story about Freddie Mercury, and it's certainly something that you can't take your eyes and ears off of.",9,1,1,24 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," This Movie Will Rock You
","Queen is one of my favorite bands. Their songs are clearly something different from other songs, and how they do it absolutely intrigues me. I still listen to them and awe over them to this day. Their songs enlighten everyone, bring out joy, sadness, and excitement. This movie was beautifully crafted about Freddie Mercury and his band. This movie can hit back home for everyone, especially those people who are more afraid of being alone than others, and those people who have went through pneumonia and aids. But still, this film was absolutely Oscar-worthy, and I can see why it earned an Oscar.",9,0,0,31 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Queen Rules!!!!
","Bohemian Rhapsody, I didn't have many expectations for this film, but after I watched it, I wouldn't mind watching it again. With amazing lights and acting, the performance was absolutely my style. The music was simply life-changing, and Queen has been my favorite band ever since. This story and the film has made my mother cry, and it made me cry in my heart. If you haven't, you need to watch this film. You'll be singing the songs for two months after that, I tell you. The scene effects, and the raw and real of it all, the rock and roll, the pressure it puts on people, how much it hits back home, it'll surprise you. Long live Queen!",9,1,2,12 April 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," FANTASTIC FOR FANTASTIC BEASTS
","I loved this movie. It doesn't matter what other people say to me, everything J.K. Rowling creates and loves is amazing. Before someone pounces on me, this actually interested me as much as Harry Potter did. Fantastic Beasts was a humorous, adorable, and full of majestic and magical creatures. It was a wonderful experience watching this well-known movie.",10,2,2,21 March 2019
Inside Out," Bing Bong, Bing Bong
","No matter how old I grow, or how many wrinkles I have on my face, or even if I have a husband or kids already, I will always cry when Bing Bong dies. Always. When he falls off and into the bad, fading memories, his beady eyes blinking. It always gets me. I'm the only one who cries, but I don't care. It gets me. Inside Out brings back so many childhood memories, of our joyful times and our sad times this story says that even sad moments and memories can be okay, because they help us grow stronger. And imagination should never leave us and that we should hold on to as many memories as we can.",8,4,6,15 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," I Love This Film 3000
","This film was a beautiful ending to the saga of Avengers, although we do not know if there are more films awaiting us. It was such a meaningful film, with so many touching moments that make us think back to the old times of Avengers, one of the most iconic groups we will ever see in this generation. Avengers made me cry, which was not expected. Not one single superhero adventure saga movie has ever made me cry. But this one did. Infinity War left me breathless, and Endgame left me even more speechless. Iron Man's death was so well crafted, so deep and meaningful. This film portrays everything Marvel ever had. Everybody. One huge entire family. The film unfolding every step of the way. This film is truly an unforgettable one.",9,2,6,5 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Left Me Amazed
","This was a breathtaking and amazing movie. It's a wonderfully filmed movie, and it proves, in my opinion, again, that Marvel has aced it again, dominating DC. It isn't your typical action-packed superhero movie that's cheesy and is only about getting the villains. It shows meaning, and it shows how far they've come, how much they are willing to save their people. It made me cry...when they all charged out from the portals, and it made me tearful when there were lost ones. It was breathtaking, really, it is one of my favorite films by far, and it is full of amazing scenery, and action, and amazing music, with a beautiful passage behind. It was truly very meaningful...and this is why I want to remember Stan Lee forever, and Marvel itself. Everyone has done amazing acting, and it truly warms my heart to see how far everyone has come. Marvel makes a change in everyone's lives. This was the movie I was most excited for this year, and I was not disappointed. It went even higher than my expectations. Even higher. And even though there might be sad woes, it is true and hits back home, and it will leave you speechless.",9,1,3,25 April 2019
Toy Story 4," A Beautiful Film
","I did not expect much from this film at first, but I was completely in awe of this fascinating film. This film was quirky and hilarious, and it's a film made for everyone, even adults who are not prone to laugh. This film was simply heartbreaking and beautiful, in every corner and every detail. It is a great sequel. This film did not need to be made, but it was, and surely many people are glad for that. This film contains amazing memories, memories that make all of us tear up, old pals, never ending friendship, difficult decisions to make, change, and new modern characters that make this film so much more lively as well. It's one of the best Disney films I have ever seen, and I had to admit that my eyes were reflecting under the light with tears, because of how far we have all come, how far Disney has come, and how lovely they have made this film, how simply relatable and loving it is for everyone. A reminder of simple and hard childhood, heartbreak, understanding. The villain of this story has a backstory and is not just a scary doll for everyone to fear. Although some people are broken inside, Toy Story 4 proves that friendship is everlasting and that they can make this film such a wonderful experience.",9,4,7,9 July 2019
Toy Story 4," A Heartwarming Sequel That I Definitely Canada Watch Again
","I was worried when I came home after the movie to see bad ratings for this film, because for me, I didn't spot anything bad.
I was exceptionally relieved when I found that the film received 8.6 stars. This film made me and my cousin laugh, it made me smile, it even made me feel tears in the back of my throat. This film was one of the best. There were jokes and parts where everyone laughed at, understanding. I don't remember a time where I've laughed so much during a film.
There were so many childhood memories from this, and it's honestly sending a very strong message for every child throughout the world, and especially adults. I'm hoping to watch it again and I hope that many other people enjoy this film.
I came back feeling happy from the film and that's something very intriguing. Thank you for giving me this. It has been a great experience watching Toy Story 4.
P. S. I ship Woody and Bo!",9,0,3,23 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Leaving You Wanting More
","I watched the film Endgame, just the day before today, and it was amazing, so I gave it a brief but powerful review. Then, I realized I had forgotten to thank the film that led to Endgame, the one that broke my heart and warmed it at the same time. This film made me laugh, made me sit on the edge of my seat, made me cry, and made me infuriated for some people, making me want to throw a punch. This film makes you feel all the emotions: heartbreak, happiness, humor, and even fear. This will leave you wailing and complaining, needing more to satisfy you. Endgame is certainly more emotional and powerful than this one, with the topping 9.2 ratings, while this one is conveniently sitting at 8.5. This film and Endgame both made me confident, standing up to cruelty in my school, and letting me embrace how far Marvel has come.",9,0,1,25 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Beyond My Expectations
","Infinity Wars was a breathtaking film. It knocked the wind out of me, on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I needed to know. It was very exciting and intriguing to watch them. Almost everyone started breaking into sobs while the ending happened, now, I'm not going to tell what happened, because I hate when someone spoils a film for me, so I won't do that for other people. It was intriguing, and packed full of action. It was amazing to see all the Marvel Avengers group together and reunite. Some things were completely unexpected, which made it so worth it to watch. If you haven't, watch Infinity Wars.",9,0,2,12 April 2019
Aladdin," This Movie Is A Whole New World
","Yes, there are a few cliches, but very little, and things that Disney changed a bit, tweaking and offending some of the old Aladdin fans, but very truly, this film was very enjoyable, quirky in its own fun ways, and full of music and wonders that one could never imagine. The actors and actresses performed very well, and Will Smith made an impeccable, hard to beat genie. I did not know why, but this film almost brought me to tears. Perhaps it was because it brought back fond childhood memories from the old Aladdin. But the costumes and the music from this spectacular Disney musical were all masterpieces. I enjoyed it very fondly and very much. Jafar was not as menacing as I thought he would be, but I could see that everyone put effort in, and I liked the feminism of it all, and Naomi Scott as Jasmine and Mena as Aladdin are very suitable matches, and they were truly amazing to see on screen.",8,4,13,25 May 2019
Aladdin," I Completely Do Not Understand
","I enjoyed the film greatly. I do not understand why others did not.
The magic was raw and so true. I was expecting to like this film much less than I did. Will Smith portrayed the genie I was looking for, with his wits and charms. Everything was such a beautiful experience. I expected much more from the critical audience. What do they think Disney is going to do? Take the original and as well gorgeous Aladdin film and reincarnate it to a completely the same film, just with real people? I appreciate Disney for now. It is trying to bring the good into the world. Too bright? Too cliche? Too dark? Too picky is much more of the word for it. Naomi Scott was such an actress, I believe she is going to accomplish much more. Adding a piece of music for her, that was extremely talented and clever of Disney. This did not ruin anything for me. The new Aladdin film has not failed to impress.",8,1,3,6 September 2019
The Theory of Everything," A Very Touching and Clever Movie
","This is a great movie to appreciate the wonderful works of our beloved Stephen Hawking. This movie is beautiful. It makes me and my mother cry in our hearts. It is a very touching movie, explaining not only Mr. Hawking's success, but also explaining his sacrifices for his wife, Jane Hawking, and letting her go meet her one true love and pursue her dreams. He loved her so much, and for that reason, he was willing to let her go for her own reasons and for her health. This movie shows that even though Mr. Hawkings was a disabled man, he conquered his disabilities and let his happiness kill all those negative thoughts. He's a wonderful man, and I can't wait to see the reviews of other people who watch this touching, and so true and raw movie.",10,0,1,12 March 2019
Frozen," Just Let It Go, People
","Yes, Frozen is full of cliches and all kind of cheesy humor. But that's life for you, full of cliches. Olaf will melt your heart, and the bond between Elsa and Anna is certainly indescribable. No wonder this movie gets so much praise from small children. Love comes in different ways, and the songs were absolutely wonderful. They had me singing for days. Frozen, other than the name title, will melt your heart.",8,3,5,23 March 2019
Room," Leaving You Breathless...
","Room is such a touching movie full of curiosity. Imagine being a small child, and you've never been outside before. Never. You've only seen a dim light. You don't know that there's more to it than just the wooden walls and a bed and toilet and Room. That was how this little boy felt. His mother, (Brie Larson who acts for her) is going through a rough time. Many mothers can feel her pain, even if they haven't experienced such a horrible experience before. This is a passionate story, a story that humanity will never want to forget.",10,2,4,15 March 2019
La La Land," Something Magical
","The affection and the magic of this movie touched me. It was clean comedy, without any gutter jokes or any crude references. It was an extremely amazing musical, one of the best I've ever watched. It's real, while comedic and full of amazing vintage style and memories that would should never be lost. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have aced it together. Emma Stone is one of my favorite actresses, and her La La Land has touched my heart. Oldies and newbies, all of you watch it.",10,2,2,10 April 2019
La La Land," Full of the Joy and Sadness of Reality
","La La Land is an amazing film starring one of my favorite actresses, Emma Stone, and another big celebrity, Ryan Gosling. This love story is simply not just a love story. It's not always so romantic, even though it's mainly about romance. But this is the movie I've been looking for. No wonder this film earned an Oscar. This movie was full of joy and sadness, and good costumes for the characters, showing how time changes, and how magic sometimes fades, but comes back again. The characters were so true, and I could feel the emotions throughout the way. This film, La La Land, should be watched by every adult in America.",10,2,2,31 March 2019
How to Train Your Dragon," An Amazing Movie...
","Do I even need to say that I enjoyed this movie? The visual effects were breathtaking, especially the hidden world, and the light-fury. It was a moving story, with empowering love. This movie was probably a delight for children, and probably surprised adults as well. I heard a man in the theatre proclaim that it was trash and didn't deserve his money. Well, many people told him that it was worth it, and even his wife gladly replied that it was one of the best animated films she'd ever seen before. Needless to say, How To Train Your Dragon, not surprisingly, has earned many good reviews. Thank you for taking your time to scan this review. If you haven't, watch this movie.",9,0,0,31 March 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Yes...Yes...I'm Speaking Up
","1...1....2...2...4....2....1....it's a clear pattern of hate and criteria for Beauty and the Beast. Yes, it is truly miserable that everyone thinks this way, but before everyone attacks me for stating my opinion, I think this is a very magical and intriguing movie. The costumes and the scene effects are beautiful, and I think Emma Watson did an amazing job of portraying Belle. Belle is a beautiful character and the Beast is very relatable. A tale as old as time...but a tale so breathtaking that I, with very high expectations, am standing up for it.",8,4,6,23 March 2019
Green Book," Green Book is Oscar-Worthy
","This was the movie I had been dying to see for weeks. And then, I watched it. I was not wrong about this movie being a comedic and hilarious movie, but it also left something unexpected. The story was meaningful, thoughtful, and tears were brought to my heart. It's one of those movies that made me laugh, that made me cry, and that made me sit there in shock, in wonder and awe. This movie is simply about a black man and a white man, and a friendship, an unlikely friendship tying them together. With all the challenges that they face, and the obstacles in the way, they face them, and you'll see what happens next. The story of Tony Lip and Doctor Shirley is surely a story that we want our children to know, their children to know, and our great grandchildren to know, and the entire generation passed down before us; to show people what really matters in the world, what reigns over racism and electronics and following what the society does, letting reputation get the best of you. These are all the least important. Friendship can tie us together. So let us appreciate it. It doesn't matter what other people do, it matters what you do. What you do, make it right. I was not surprised when this movie received an Oscar, and it surely is a beautiful movie that everyone should watch in their free time.",10,1,4,13 March 2019
Me Before You," Proved Me Wrong
","When my mother clicked on this movie on our TV, I was more than unwelcome. Oh, great. Another sappy love story. But as soon as I started watching it, I was hooked. It gave me another idea of love. Clark made me laugh and Traynor made me agree and nod in reason. This quirky, heartbreaking movie is something special.",9,4,5,16 March 2019
The Pursuit of Happyness," Happiness Comes in Many Ways
","This film was unmistakably amazing. About quiet strength and fatherhood, Will Smith has done it again. It really brought me to tears, my heart aching for every minute. The pain and the love and the pursuit of happiness are not always so understandable, but this movie aces it. This shows a father and his son reigning and conquering their poor lives, and starting from a new beginning. The Pursuit of Happiness is certainly an Oscar-worthy movie.",9,0,0,23 March 2019
