Minority Report," More Thought Provoking Than You Would Ever Expect From Spielberg
","This film addresses many profound issues on many different levels; more than just your average summer blockbuster film.I found it to be very interesting in that it portrays the prophetic ('pre-cogs' or pre-cognitives in the film) in their ability to dream reality being very much like what it is like unto in real life.  I personally believe that we already know what is going to happen; that the time essence forecast is in our DNA.  Just the mentally ill are more able to tap into that than others because of some faulty wiring that brings the 'visions' to the forefront--often in their dreams.  It is no mystery that we only use 10% of our brains actively, at best.  If we were able to actively use the other 90%, predicting the future (which we currently measure with a measurement we call time, but is a measurement nonetheless for something we try to grasp) would be easy since we could bring this information to the forefront of our consciousness. Now the question is: if we could do this, would we still have free will/choice/agency?  That is a big question that the film tries and succeeds in answering (IMO).Something interesting about this film:  Set in Washington DC, the murder capital of the world, with approx. 180 murders per 100,000 people, due mostly to the reason that gun ownership there is illegal (except, paradoxically, for politicians, celebrities, cops, the gov't, military, etc., ones who champion gun control the most and also control the public most).  This sets the stage for invoking a crime-prevention idea of stopping the crime before it happens, thus stopping the crime [!]The most powerful message that runs through to the core of the film is that the harder you try to control something, the less you will be able to do just that. (There are many other smaller threads that run through also, but this is definitely the most potent one, and the many issues covered could probably fill a volume.)Lastly, this film has tons of special effects and action.  It really is something to watch.  Kind of like a cross between Tron and The Fifth Element.  But this film is very violent, so leave the kids at home, it will probably give them nightmares.  Five years ago this film would be rated R (just for its adult content alone), not PG-13.  Not to say that it is bad, just very violent.  I would give this movie 10 stars instead of 9 out of 10 normally, except I don't think it has much of a resolution.  Or maybe that is what makes it good--that it leaves you uneasy with no real answers, and definitely makes you think.",Null,0,0,10 August 2002
Dawn of the Dead," Watch the Original and Skip This Crap.
","How they could f*ck up such a classic movie like Dawn of the Dead (1978) is beyond me. Stick with the 1978 ORIGINAL, which is actually worth watching and an excellent movie. All of the cast is unsympathetic in this one except for the last guy to die. The chick that looks like Britney Spears should have died in the house, her acting is about enough to turn ANYONE into a zombie. The worst parts of this film is that they lost the funny element of the original, in fact, the only elements of the original in this one is zombies and a mall, everything else is changed and RUINED. The other worst thing they did was try to make this, what was an underground film, into an MTV video. So do yourself a favor and skip this crap and go with the George A. Romero ORIGINAL 1978 Version. You can't lose with that one. 4/10",Null,1,3,4 December 2004
Apocalypse Now," Version vs. Version
","I have to admit, the first and only six times I saw the original version of this film (not 'Redux'), I fell asleep during the film. I was convinced that the original film was made catastrophically unwatchable by the muddled and misguided editing. Several of my friends were angry to the respect that I could actually fall asleep to the 'best film ever', in their opinion. As a result, I was relieved when I found out that there was going to be a release of a new version to theatres, a 'director's cut', if you will. I purposely waited until it was released on DVD to watch it, and turned the English subtitles on, and I was glad, because I remember lots of the dialog being lost in the original mix (as I think it is also in this as well), but I feel the subtitles help you get through it. You see, I am the kind of person who likes director's cuts, uncensored versions, restored with new footage films, and even letterbox versions, basically the best way a film is intended. There are some exceptions to the rules, like when different editing processes are used, such as 'Star Wars: A New Hope', which I still think was a mistake that George Lucas didn't correct some of the very noticeable errors in digital vs. analog editing and prints (i.e. he really should have either re-filmed the original Jabba-the-Hut & Han Solo conversation, instead of a digital re-creation and insertion/replacement of an analog filming of someone different {Jabba}, or just kept the scene cut indefinitely), or when studios take control of films and try to make their own edit and commercial cuts, which is almost always monstrous, just as I've heard with Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. To summarize, it is possible for someone who has issues with this original film to like the 'Redux' version, if it is for the reasons as I stated, because I feel that 'Apocalypse Now Redux' actually is a better film than the original 'Apocalypse Now'. Yes, I am bold enough to say it. I am positive that this will offend people who think the original cut is the 'best film ever', and I know it is even probable they won't like -this- version, but I don't care about that, just like I didn't rate this version 5-stars, or even think of it as the 'best film ever'. This film clearly travels the waters between pure evil and insane genius. This is the only version worth watching. 8/10",Null,2,2,16 July 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," I understood this film.
","The above comment might seem like a generic one, considering the amount that Hollywood has dumbed itself down for the masses on the majority of the movies it releases.  There are, occasionally, exceptions to this rule, and The Matrix 2 is a fine example of this.  No doubt, there are probably masses of belief systems out there that proclaim that The Matrix is a testimony for their type of belief or whatever, ie. Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam; even occultist groups and philosophies.  But it is in my viewpoint from all of the knowledge that I have searched that there is a book that explains the matrix (lowercase), ie. What the Matrix is (whatisthematrix). I didn't realize that this wasn't obvious to everyone until I read what other people have said about this film and the one before it and it is apparent that they really don't have a clue.  It is a pictorial metaphoric film which is written in code, and to fully understand, you must be well versed in many disciplines (i.e. programming/hacking, philosophy, mathematics, neuro-physiology, film theory, psychiatry, and sociology, for starters).  Thus, it can be understood why it is difficult for the masses to understand a film like this one, even less than the one before it, calling it just 'sci-fi' or 'comic book' or 'action' film, which is not doing the film justice.  Although it may be any or all of these, the viewer cannot possibly understand what is the matrix until after reading the book 'The Neo-Tech Discovery' by Dr. Frank R. Wallace.  This book must be read from start to finish to understand the book.  It is much like this film, but in written form.  The book is also written in a Matrix puzzle form and you won't understand how it relates to the movie/s The Matrix until this book has been read.  So that is the best information I can give you without writing volumes, as I'm sure there are many factions writing books on these films, even as I write this.  Also, one more thing: This was a very cool movie to watch.  Go see it.",Null,0,0,11 June 2003
Amélie," One of the best films I've seen in a long time.
","This film is amazing, and it will make you want to be a better person for having seen it.  I'm sure it will never get the recognition it deserves, though, because it is a French film that is subtitled, not dubbed.",Null,0,1,12 March 2002
