Deepwater Horizon," I will give 11 stars if I could
","I didn't breed through the whole movie. Is one of those movies that I arrived in the cinema by mistake just because there was nothing else that I haven't seen. Beautiful mistake. I enjoy this movie so much that I cannot remember last time that I have been so touched buy a movie. It is not just powerful and full of action, but also makes you think twice about the decisions you make. I strongly believe that we all should see a movie like this every now and then. Well done Peter Berg and to all cast. If there are more people like me, that you move, I think you brought back what actually a movie means. And God bless you Mike Williams, we are so grateful that there are still people like you!!",10,4,11,18 October 2016
Passengers," a perfect love story?!? :))))
","Wakening up on a giant spaceship, entirely alone, save for an android bartender which can only simulate empathy and serve man's favorite liquid: beer, he decide to wake up, knowing is no coming back, Aurora, a women that he never saw before, but is beautiful enough to spend the rest of his life with. Alone, and I really mean alone! just the two of them for the rest of their life. Obviously just a  male screenwriter( Doctor Strange)  and Prometheus' Jon Spaihts – cooked up an idea like this.  The movie itself is definitely worth your time. The acting is one of the best you've seen, but again, Jennifer Lawrence, always gives the best of her in each movie, and the story is lovely and a bit funny. Lots of messages and quite a bit of action too.  What I do think they could do a bit more is answering  a few more questions. I understand you want to let some question marks after the movie, so the movie stay in the peoples head longer, fair enough , but, come on!!! this movie lets a whole story of questions.",9,1,3,14 January 2017
Lion," must see
","I was quite late on reviewing this movie just because I was not sure I will find words that will be good enough to describe it!  Not many movies can move you as this one will. The story is so touching and so nicely done that will melt even an ice-cold heart.Lion is a true story about a 5-year-old boy who is trying to grow up faster than he should and work to put some food on the table. Unfortunately or fortunately he gets separate from his family. After cruel lines of events he gets adopted by a lovely family. A mother is a mother therefore 25 years later he   will do everything in his power to find the woman who give him life...just to let her know he is alright.  This movie did was not just touching, was a life style changing.",8,0,0,19 April 2017
Baby Driver," Babydriver- action, drama and live story
","The story is told through the eyes, and, most importantly, the ears of Baby (Ansel Elgort) the youthful getaway driver who relies on a pulsating beat in order to perform. Working behind the wheel to pay off a debt to a crime boss, Baby is a young man of few words, but very sweet. Due to unfortunately events in his life, he ends up working for a criminal. What I did find quite interesting was the fact that the good boy, by staying next to a criminal, by the end of the movie, he does not find it so difficult to press the trigger, and the 'crime boss' becomes a carrying friend. It is not as colorful as I taught it will be and the story line is not the best I saw, but it is something about this movie, because I really want to go back in cinema to see it again.",6,10,21,20 June 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them-they've done it again!
","The biggest dilemma you will have before going into this movie, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter, and the curiosity how can you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Borrowing its title from one of the textbooks Harry studied at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them' marks the first screenplay written by J.K Rowling herself. Though the world-renowned novelist had always kept a tight rein on how those adapting her Potter stories went about their task, this assignment gives her the unprecedented ability to address her massive global fan base directly, while current events have given her something more substantive to say. For those that haven't seen Harry Potter, do not worry! From minute one the movie gets you on a journey with great visuals, very recognizable music and great performances. Every now and then you get the, sometimes funny, sometimes smart references to Harry Potter, but this is a movie that can totally stand on its own. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them stands perfect on its own and doesn't need Harry Potter or any of the planned movies to get you invested in its story and yet it is an obligation for every J.K. Rowling wizard world-fan to go see this movie. The director David Yates found this perfect balance and ended up with a result that has to be seen in theaters by everyone.",10,24,46,29 November 2016
La La Land," Another Titanic
","Another lost love story. People that know me, will confirm that I maybe don't know to cry, but this movie really touched me, if I knew how to cry, this was my moment!! She didn't say hi!?!?! WTF?!?!?Is definitely a sad movie, and probably his purpose is to remind us, the humans, how stupidly we choose money and a job over love, the feeling that many pretend is the focus of their life. It is sad to forget what is really important and lose someone over a job choice. I find it painful to have the 'what if' in your shoulders, but again we all have a different understanding of what happiness means. The first part of the movie is quite slow, so be ready to give it a chance, it is worth it! Is not much auction there, but again you know you're going to a romance.I loved the fact that the story started and ended in winter, like the two main characters probably where feeling. He, hitting the rock bottom, trying to find a way to make some money without giving up on his dream, and she is training to keep her smile up while at every single audition is rejected and ignored. The beginning remind me of Bewitched, they keep running into each other like they were supposed to be together. The moment the movie starts you will think they hate each other so much they have to be together! Is like they are made for each other which by the half of the movie the story line proves you were right they do belong togetherLa La Land is a triumph on so many levels, and hopefully a lesson for many single people to think twice before they decide their life. This guy give up his career, because she asked to, and she.... She didn't say hi!?!?! WTF?!?!?",6,5,8,19 January 2017
Sausage Party," Totley waste of time
","There are not enough words how bad this movie is. I never been so bored in cinema as I have been tonight. Funny? When? I fond nothing funny on it, not even a line in the whole movie. No action no lines no anything. If you don't have anything to do, find something but do not go to this movie. There is no reason why you should.such a waste of time. Is like a chip xxx movie. Absolutely pointless i went into this movie expecting to at least enjoy something? i wanted to like it. but more than anything it was just underwhelming and mediocrewouldn't recommend to anyone who enjoys good movies, would recommend to anyone who is easily amused n thinks its funny when dudes are high and kids cartoons say f)ck a lot",1,6,14,6 September 2016
