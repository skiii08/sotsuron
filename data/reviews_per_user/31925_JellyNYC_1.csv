Minority Report," Good for 3/4 of the way but falls short
","Firstly, I'm shocked by the number of raves posted about this movie.  The first half of the movie did intrigue me and even seemed like this really is a movie w/good story and action as well.  I think on the whole I did enjoy this movie somewhat, but it was the disappointment I felt in knowing it had the potential to be a lot better.*SPOILERS AHEAD*However, in the second half, it seemed like the writers decided to throw in their hats and give it the cliched let's-expose-him-at-his-own-fundraiser/birthday bash/conference and then, of course, have a final private dialogue w/the good guy about why he did it.  What a disappointment.  First, we already had to make the leap to believe that the pre-cogs saw the 'premeditated' murder by Cruise while premeditated would imply Cruise should have been thinking about killing this guy already.  Cruise would never have gotten to that guy without first seeing the vision and then taking Agatha out.  But he would never have taken Agatha out without having seen the vision first which really makes no sense if you thought about it.  Plus, if the pre-cogs only see the future as it will happen instead of let's say, people's thoughts and intentions, there's no reason why they can't see crime of passions as early as they could see premeditated murders.But I digress.  I was willing to make all of these leaps, and then I get that cop-out ending.  2 1/2 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,0,9 July 2003
