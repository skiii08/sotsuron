Black Swan," Dark Descent into Madness
","'I just want to be perfect.' This line illustrates the themes and hardships the main character faces in Black Swan. Fortunately, it also mostly tells of the quality of the film. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a gifted dancer who desires the role of the Swan Queen in a different version of the ballet Swan Lake. Right when she seems to have the role in the bag, along comes Lily, an effervescent dancer new to the company, portrayed by Mila Kunis. She reveals to be subtle, controlled, and free while she dances. These qualities are needed in order to play both the White Swan and the Black Swan in the dance. Shortly after, Nina is overcome with the desire to be perfect, and starts to hallucinate. She sees a double image of herself, drawings which become animated, and other shocking imagery as well. Black Swan is easily one of the best films of 2010. It functions well as a horror film, a psychological thriller, and a showcase of brilliant dancing. The chemistry between Portman and Kunis is seductive and shocking. Their performances convincingly reveal the power and eeriness of 'the dark side.' Both deserve to be in Oscar contention for their work, as does a scene-stealing Barbara Hershey as Nina's controlling mother. Black Swan will make you question whether the events and characters in this film are imaginary or not, and will leave you wondering for hours. This is a horror film for people who don't like horror films.",8,4,10,25 December 2010
Spider-Man 3," An Empty and Boring Action Flick
","Spider-Man was a surprisingly entertaining action flick with touches of humor and suspense. Spider-Man 2 was one of the best films of the past decade, with its alarmingly believable emotion and fantastic characters. But then came this disaster. This movie brings back plot details from the 1st film, making it feel as if the crew ran out of ideas for the story. This then results in Spidey hunting down Flint Marko, played by Thomas Haden Church in a talent-wasting performance. The love triangle between Dunst, Maguire, and Franco has zero sizzle. The action sequences are merely attention-grabbing instead of tense. Spider-Man's dark side is not terrifying, mainly consisting of stealing other people's girlfriends and wearing thick black eyeliner. Instead of being emotionally complex, the subplots this time feel sappy, forced, and manipulative. Church and Topher Grace (as Venom/Eddie Brock) are talented, but not as effective as Willem Dafoe (as the original Green Goblin) and Alfred Molina (as Doc Ock). The endless story lines and melodramatic speeches make this film bland, excessive, and boring. Even the behavior of the characters (leaving boyfriends, assaulting friends, not calling the police) is implausible. If quality ran the box office, this film would not even cross $100 million.",4,1,5,30 August 2010
The Last Song," By the Time You Start to Care About the Characters, It's Much Too Late
","This movie may as well go down as one of the worst films of 2010. The Last Song features Miley Cyrus in an uneven and whiny performance as a teenage girl experiencing the love of her life during the summer. There is also a church fire, a pyromaniac, family problems, and other things which you probably should but won't care about. Cyrus does have fantastic chemistry with her co-star Liam Hemsworth, but the movie's pluses truly end there. Characters and plot-lines seem to be pulled randomly out of a hat, and scenes which should be emotionally powerful are paired with conflicting music. The scenes between Ronnie and her father are particularly manipulative and forced. Ronnie and Will seem to be on and off, seeing as they are constantly arguing and apologizing instead of having their relationship develop. It is never said why Ronnie (Cyrus) is in love with Will (Hemsworth). The last third saves the film from receiving a 2, but doesn't save the film as a whole. Ronnie is supposed to be unlikable, but you are eventually supposed to feel for her as well. The supporting characters are supposed to be just as interesting as Ronnie, but aren't developed at all. The film is very superficial, underdeveloped, and empty, and fans of the surprisingly well-crafted novel will be disappointed.",3,5,8,1 October 2010
The Town," Suspenseful and Exciting
","Ben Affleck directs his second film after Gone Baby Gone. The Town is a thriller surrounding a group of robbers, a bank teller, and the FBI agent out to capture the bank robbers. At a laundromat following the most recent bank robbery, Affleck's character falls in love with the employee who they took hostage, played by Rebecca Hall. His accomplice, played by Jeremy Renner, immediately lashes out at him. With his accomplices, former girlfriend (played by Blake Lively), and his disguised-as-florist boss all confronting him, he must make the decision to either leave with Hall or continue his life of crime. The first hour of this film is stunning and phenomenal. The characters pull you into their minds, and you feel as if you are one of the characters in each scene. Every member of the cast delivers a solid-to-exceptional performance. Affleck, Hall, Renner, and Lively are particularly breathtaking, but it's the third of the quartet who deserves an Oscar nomination. Renner infuses the viewer with fear, pity, and so many other emotions. However, the second half of the film feels less authentic. The plausibility of the film takes somewhat of a nose dive, with the story struggling to deliver more character nuances and plot development. As a result, the ending underwhelms especially in comparison to the rest of the film. For what it's worth, The Town is one of the best films of the year and the best thriller of 2010.",9,0,1,17 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Darker With Less Action
","It's the beginning of the end. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a major departure from the previous films. This movie is a lot darker, more violent, and thankfully, scarier than most horror films out nowadays. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are finally seventeen. They are now ready to take Dumbledore's mission to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, which hold his soul. As the trio tries to hunt down all of the Horcruxes, they mature and discover just how much they've grown emotionally and romantically. The numerous scares work thanks to the wonderful visuals, musical score, and cinematography. Like the other Harry Potter films, there are few action scenes, but when present, they are well-choreographed and completely engaging. The characters are further developed, revealing new relationships as well as some intriguing secrets. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson deliver their best performances yet. Each one of them gets their moment to shine and prove why they deserve to have great careers after this franchise ends. The director and screenwriter were terrific in making this film more mature then its predecessors, but several flaws place it below the best of the films (the 3rd, 5th, and 6th in my opinion). Too many awkward scenes are present, and the usual touches of humor are placed in the most inappropriate moments of the film. The plot as a whole will feel tricky and confusing at various points throughout the film because far too much is happening at once. Additionally, the pacing feels a little off. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a solid but uneven penultimate entry to the deservedly popular franchise.",7,1,2,27 November 2010
Salt," Tense and Exciting, But Uneven
","At a first glance, Salt may seem like another run-of-the-mill action thriller. However, it is much more than that. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, an agent of the CIA who is outed for being a Russian spy out to kill the U.S. president. The movie features Oscar-worthy sound effects and some surprisingly tense scenes. Jolie delivers one of the most sizzling performances of the year as a woman dedicated to her husband and job but holding many intriguing secrets. Her performance and the script prevent the film from being anything resembling a completely boring slog. There are still some flaws with the film. Action sequences involving trucks and buildings border on implausible, and the ending feels very forced, predictable, and uneven. Plot twists can be predictable and overwhelming. Overall, Salt is a multifaceted story that is well-acted and reasonably entertaining.",7,1,3,1 November 2010
District 9," One of the Best Films of 2009 Features Frightening Aliens
","District 9 has shown us that a first-time writer-director can make a great film if he has the talent. A mysterious alien spaceship flies over South Africa and freezes in midair. After a while, several people inspect it and find prawns, shellfish-like aliens whose appearance will remain in your mind forever. Agents of MNU steal their advanced weaponry to use for their own benefit. Eventually, one of those agents has his DNA contaminated with that of the prawns. He begins to turn into one, losing teeth and growing claws. Wikus, the name of the worker, escapes to the one safe place for him now: District 9, where the other prawns are kept. The prawns then make a deal with him that if he can help them fix their spaceship, they will find a cure for him. The movie is terrifying throughout. Gory as it is, it is never gratuitous and many people will be impressed by the semi-documentary aspect of the film. The ending is emotional and, thankfully, refuses to take the route of satisfying and pleasing. Not only is this an unbelievably original sci-fi flick, but it also mixes politics and aliens in an effective way. The gore can be over-the-top, but once you get past it, District 9 proves to be a wonderful addition to the sci-fi genre.",8,2,8,1 November 2010
The Hurt Locker," A Fantastic Film
","Kindly ignore the negative reviews for this film. This movie is better than Avatar, has a better script and performances. After its shocking loss at the Golden Globes, I decided to rent this to see how good it was. Every minute of this movie was tense, emotional, and gut-wrenching; the way a war film should be. There are no false moments and you believe the hardships that the bomb disposal unit faces. Jeremy Renner's deservedly Oscar-nominated performance is another reason to watch the film. His facial expressions, display of range, and intense voice elevates his performance to that of Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan. Even though there may be some inaccuracies, this is after all a general idea of a bomb squad and without the inaccuracies in the story and with the characters, we would have little of an idea about who these brave soldiers are and why they are even there. In other words, this movie deserved to win Best Picture at the Oscars.",10,11,18,28 August 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Disappointing Fantasy Film
","Alice in Wonderland was one of my most anticipated of 2010, and I wish I was still waiting. The film, while somewhat solid, never seems to hit its stride. It moves at an extremely plodding pace and the plot is very uneven. Mia Wasikowska does a fine job as the soon-to-be-married Alice, but the screenplay lets her down. Oscar nominees Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne Hathaway also deliver solid performances. The climactic showdown is sketchily choreographed with uninteresting action. A lazy ending and sinister tone ruins what should be a fun, interesting romp through Wonderland. Tim Burton does prove he can deliver a well-executed backstory and fabulous visuals, but this is one of his weaker efforts.",5,1,2,28 August 2010
Avatar," James Cameron Offers Wonderful Visuals in This Effective Sci-Fi Film
","Avatar is not a sci-fi masterpiece, but it is a good film. Several marines are sent to Pandora to discover the whereabouts of a precious mineral. Jake Sully is one of those marines. While being transferred into the mind of his avatar, he meets an alluring alien named Neytiri. The two fall in love and later endure conflict, mating, and the ways of her colony. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances and have great chemistry as Sully and Neytiri, respectively. The story is clichéd, but it is executed so well that it is able to draw you in for most of its running time. The final action sequence is enthralling and tense, the way an action sequence should be. James Cameron proves to be an amazing director; it is very difficult to make a film as complex and visually captivating as this. Despite its over-length, Avatar is a gripping, surprising, and genuinely romantic sci-fi film. It isn't the best picture of 2009, but it certainly is one of the best. These visuals will inspire other filmmakers for ideas in the future.",7,1,8,1 November 2010
Up," A Cute Movie For Everyone
","Up is a very creative film that will win over many young children. The film begins with a captivating montage about the protagonist's times with his wife, up to her death. He then decides to meet her promise of visiting Paradise Falls, located in South America. A young boy scout accidentally follows him during the journey. When they finally get there, they discover a rare colorful bird who must be protected from a vicious poacher and his dogs. This is one of Pixar's more mature efforts (indicated by the PG rating). The movie knows how to be charming, personal, and observant all at once. Visuals are colorful and engaging for the entire film. Pixar has again crafted a beautiful, funny, and entertaining animated film for the ages.",9,1,2,1 November 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Wildly Cluttered But Saved by Visuals
","How to Train Your Dragon is a fun but somewhat empty animated film. The film's premise is very inventive: a Viking's son who is reluctant to kill dragons befriends one and tames it as his own. The Viking's son is our narrator for the film. He is a plucky, very clumsy boy; one cliché to start with. When he discovers the dragon he thought he killed in a field alive, he panics but eventually decides to train it. The movie is filled with visual splendor. The flight scenes of the protagonist riding the dragon Hiccup are so beautiful, brilliant, and amazing. However, the story itself is very thin. This film is a perfect example of style and visuals over substance; kind of like an animated version of Avatar. The first half of the film is wildly uneven and cluttered that you wonder how the screenplay wasn't edited. The second half is a vast improvement, especially with its epic climax and last emotional five minutes. As a whole, How to Train Your Dragon is more of a entertaining diversion than something totally memorable.",8,1,6,27 November 2010
Crazy Heart," Brilliant Music and Lead Performance Elevate a Wonderful Drama
","Though there is nothing wrong with the typical action film, it's always nice to see a well-made drama which features strong performances and an awards-worthy script. Crazy Heart is a film about an alcoholic country singer, played by Jeff Bridges, looking for a second chance in his career and his life. Part of this second chance arrives in the form of Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays a sweet, earnest single mother who works as a journalist. During an interview for her magazine, the two fall in love with each other, even though she knows that enduring his alcoholism and irresponsibility may hurt her in the long run. The various concert scenes throughout the film are vibrant, engaging, and make you feel as if you are actually there. This first-time writer-director transforms a clichéd, somewhat bland story into an uplifting and meaningful film. Of course, the real highlight of this film is Jeff Bridges. He portrays the country singer near-perfectly both musically and acting-wise. He clearly knows how to avoid turning an over-the-top character into an over-the-top performance, making his on-screen presence seem natural and unforced. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also strong as the love interest, especially during the film's climax. Crazy Heart is a wonderful drama that deserves your attention.",8,3,4,5 November 2010
The Blind Side," Slightly Overrated by Users, but Still Entertaining
","The Blind Side tells the inspirational story of an unfortunate teenager who becomes the ultimate football star. The film, unfortunately, is filled to the brim with scenes resembling those from T.V. movies of the week. The film tries too hard to go for tears over detailing the racial controversies, but the film benefits from strong source material and an inspirational ending. Sandra Bullock, while strong, does not have a single Oscar moment in this film that blew me away. The first half is very well-executed, the second to a lesser extent. I do not think this deserved its Best Picture nomination over (500) Days of Summer, Star Trek, or Crazy Heart, but it is an uplifting tale about the fascinating sport of football. The Blind Side may focus too much on Bullock's character, but as a Thanksgiving/family movie, it is worth seeing.",6,2,5,1 September 2010
Toy Story 3," Pixar Can Add Another Masterpiece to Its Resume
","The long anticipated second sequel to Toy Story delivers what it promises: clever humor, vibrant animation, and a talented voice cast. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen voice the protagonists of Toy Story 3, who haven't changed much since the previous film. Owner Andy is finally heading off to college. He now must decide what to do with his remaining toys: donate them to a daycare, toss them out, or store them in the attic. Unfortunately, the toys face a misunderstanding and end up inside the daycare. There, they meet a bear who smells like strawberries and a charming male Barbie doll. Discovering that they are mistreated at the daycare, the toys plan a jailbreak for Andy's house. The movie is emotionally resonant and heartbreaking. Many people in the audience were in tears by the ending. The first two-thirds are hilarious and tense. Toy Story 3 is unpredictable and more tense than most thrillers these days. It is the great ending to a beloved franchise and families will not be disappointed.",10,1,1,1 November 2010
Easy A," One of the Best Teen Comedies to Come in a While
","Easy A is a brilliant teen comedy. The first half of the movie is extremely hilarious and attention-grabbing. It draws you in with its opening intro of a web-cast, and Olive (the main character) tells you her story of how she ruined her flawless reputation. It begins with a lie about her losing her virginity on a weekend, with that lie turning into a rumor. Then, a gay classmate asks her to fake having sex with her to keep her new found reputation consistent and to have bullies stop disrespecting him. You may think you know where the story is going, but it pulls the rug out from under you and under itself; it takes risks that other similar films nowadays would be afraid to do. The story is very original, with several great performances, especially from Emma Stone who plays Olive. She has superb comic timing and is able to carry the movie. Penn Badgley and Aly Michalka are funny and believable as her love interest and best friend respectively. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are particularly funny as the quirky parents. Dan Byrd plays the gay teenager with believability and humor. The only criticisms I have are that the film reaches its ending but runs out of things to say, and that the parents seem a little TOO perfect for a girl who is faking sexual activity. However, it is so well-written and acted that it would be completely worthy of a Best Picture Academy Award nomination. I highly recommend this movie for all teens, parents, and teachers.",8,0,1,1 October 2010
The Social Network," Inspired and Marvelous
","The Social Network is my pick for the best movie of 2010. On the surface, it may seem to be just a movie about Facebook, but it is much more than that. Its script weaves together eloquent conversations about friendship, betrayal, jealousy, and intelligence. Jesse Eisenberg masterfully portrays Mark Zuckerberg, a gifted student at Harvard with a brilliant idea. Little does he know that his brilliant idea will throw him into two lawsuits which ask for a great deal of money. The film moves back and forth through a timeline of a few years, with events ranging from the later involvement of Sean Parker to a fantastic canoeing race. The directing from David Fincher is remarkable, with each scene of speedy, expertly crafted dialogue seeming like cinematic heaven. The performances of Eisenberg, Garfield, and Timberlake are gripping and awards-worthy. The Social Network, with its phenomenal script, breathtaking direction, and demanding performances help make it the Best Picture-worthy film that it is.",10,1,2,11 March 2011
The Fighter," One True Knockout
","The Fighter contains what is possibly the best acting ensemble of 2010. With Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo in the central roles, you will be in for a satisfying and emotionally exhausting time. This film showcases the amazing true story of Micky Ward, a talented boxer looking for a second chance at his career. His brother Dicky used to be a talented, promising boxer himself. Unfortunately, Dicky succumbed to drug addiction and spends most of his time out smoking crack. Micky's manager mother doesn't always book him with the best opponents either for his career or health. His barmaid girlfriend Charlene is supportive but also tends to clash with him. Fortunately, he is able to get back on track and proves himself to be the talented athlete that people once knew him to be. Director David O. Russell creates a marvelous and intense drama that captivates you with each montage, acting moment, and boxing scene. The script fills each scene with raw emotion and intensity. As mentioned, the acting from all four actors is terrific. All four of them deserve Oscar nominations. Melissa Leo and Christian Bale are deservedly the favorites to win the Best Supporting Actress and Supporting Actor Oscars for their authentic and rich performances. They prove why it is often difficult to portray any real-life person. The Fighter is an extremely well-acted and rousing drama that everyone should see.",9,3,4,22 January 2011
Up in the Air," An Absolutely Phenomenal Movie
","The mastermind behind Juno has prevailed once again. Up in the Air is a near-masterpiece that people will turn back to even decades later. This script reveals the tough and somber reality of life during a recession, and the direction is meaningful and strong. George Clooney and Vera Farmiga give sexy and believable performances as blooming friends in a slumping economy, and Anna Kendrick steals the show as a recently hired downsizer drastically affecting Clooney's career. The film knows how to be serious, heartbreaking, and funny all at the same time; it's a shame it went empty-handed at the Oscars. If your are looking for a perfect date or Friday night movie, this is your best bet.",10,0,2,28 August 2010
