The Devil's Advocate," I loved this movie so much. The plot is very strong and rolls on faster and faster until the breaking point. Keanu Reeves did an excellent job in it...
","This movie is such a great work of art.  It was craftily directed by Taylor Hackford.  The actors and actresses in this movie all did a great job and were believable.  Al Pacino always does a wonderful job, there is no question about that. (See The Scent of a Woman) Charlize Theron was also wonderful as Mary-Anne Lomax, pulling off her southern accent (although very thickly pronounced)splendidly.  If you liked this movie, I would suggest reading 'The Devil's Advocate' by Andrew Neiderman, which is what this movie was based on.  It has its differences with the movie, but all books do. Great film.",10,1,2,22 January 2004
