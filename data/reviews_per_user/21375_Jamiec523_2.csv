Changeling," Strong Film
","When I saw the previews to this film I wanted to see it as soon as I could. This film was very well done. I enjoyed the whole story and I think Angelina Jolie did a GREAT job for her role. The one thing I loved about this film is through pretty much the whole thing you could feel what Christine Collins was feeling through the horrible ordeal. I don't have children but I can't imagine one of my children Vanishing! I recommend seeing this film as soon as you can if you haven't already, its a great film and I believe it is well worth your money to definitely see it.9/10",7,4,6,8 August 2009
Castle in the Sky," Another creation from Miyazaki that will live on forever
","This is the second Miyazaki film I have ever seen and it was a experience I will never forget. I am so grateful that my friend forced me to watch my first anime film (which was Spirited Away) because it got me so addicted that I had to see as many of Miyazaki's films as I possibly could. After Spirited Away I came across Castle in the sky and as I said, it will probably be one of the most memorable experiences of my life. This film captivates you in a way you could never imagine. The way Miyazaki makes his films is like he knows what fascinates everyone. The voice acting in this film is amazing and it makes you feel very connected to the characters and their emotions. Miyazaki's films taught me to do things I wouldn't normally want to do because if you don't, you could be missing out on something amazing. I was taught this because I had absolute no interest in anything anime except for Pokemon, but as I said my friend got me to finally sit down and watch some of Miyazaki's films and to this day I am in their debt as they showed me what real magic is. I recommend EVERYONE to see Castle in the sky, even if you are not a animation fan. I promise that you will be happy that you did. Not only will you witness beautiful drawings and an amazing story, but you will feel like anything in life is possible more then ever. This is only ONE of Miyazaki's MANY beautiful films, so please check them all out as you will be making your heart and soul more happy then you could possibly imagine!!10 STARS OUT OF 10!!!",8,1,1,30 March 2010
