Black Swan," 10/10
","I've watched this film twice and both times I was mesmerised. The film flows perfectly, the evolution of the main character is shown in detail, the mystery is captivating. I can't say anything bad about this film. The music, the characters, the camera work, the unsettling scary moments, everything just fabolous. This is a mix of ballet, drama, thriller and even some horror, all precisely measured out.",10,2,3,4 March 2019
Alien 3," For TWO VERSIONS my average rating is 8/10
","Just so you know, there are two versions of this film: one 1h 54min long and another 2h 24min long. Some scenes in the longer version are completely different and there are also additional scenes, the characters are more established and there is a plot twist which is missing in the shorter version.Actually, there were so many changes to the film and the filming process was so harsh, it's a miracle we have the third film at all. I recommend watching the documentaries about filming all four films. For a big fan of the franchise it was a real treat.",8,2,3,20 April 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," So thankful for this film :) 10/10
","This week I've decided to make a Star Wars' week. I watched all 8 episodes and the last two (7 and 8) left me feeling betrayed and utterly disappointed. Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you.",10,37,43,18 January 2019
Alien," 6/10
","Three great things: the creature, the alien spaceship and, of course, Ripley. Not great: the plot, disposable characters (except Ripley) and the beginning of the film is too long. Definitely watch it if you are a fan of Alien franchise and Ripley. IMHO, if you're new to this series of films, start with the second film 'ALIENS', it's the best, and then if you want, watch the first one to see the beginning of the story...P.S. Not really a SPOILER but, just in case, you've been warned. One of the characters was too emotional and sweaty, a sci-fi fan can't accept this. People who have seen the film will understand.",6,1,3,9 March 2019
Hugo," 1/10
",The visuals are beautiful but it is so strangely unwatchable..,1,1,3,22 February 2019
Aliens," Awesome 10/10
","I think, this is the best film in the franchise. I've seen it more than 10 times and it's always interesting. The action is outstanding, the characters make you emotionally involved. To cut the long story short - you gonna be on the edge of your seat.",10,1,6,28 March 2019
Alien vs. Predator," 9/10
","Yep, 9/10, and I'm a big fan of Aliens and Predator. I loved the film, I've seen it three or four times now. It's action packed and has interesting ideas. Aliens and Predators, Predators and Aliens.. awesome! BUT! Stay away from the sequel, AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem. I could manage watching only two thirds of the film and I rated it 1/10. You can't even compare them.",9,1,1,20 April 2019
The Illusionist," Rather boring film about quite cruel people (but with beautiful visuals). 4/10
","Heavy spoilers ahead! There is this 'happy, sweet' ending. But is it really happy? And is it really sweet? What is the moral of this film? That you can't be happy until you kill the rival? Really appalling!! The couple could have run away after she had been found 'dead'. Why did they have to completely destroy the prince?.. Yes, he slapped her, but is it a worthy reason for crushing someone's life? We don't know if the prince had done something more seriously wrong (there were just rumours) or would he be an awful ruler of the country.. IMHO, the plot just doesn't make any sense..
And yes, it's not about the magic, don't get overexcited. It's more of a romantic melodrama. I liked the way another reviewer called this Prestige Light XD I would add that it's Extra Light XD You will do much better watching The Prestige ;)",4,2,4,12 February 2019
Toy Story 3," Very dark.
","Be careful! This is not for little kids. If I had watched it when I was very little (4-6), I would have had nightmares. It is depressing as well as scary and gets scarier with every minute. It builds a feeling of doom and despair using everything possible - music, visuals, plot filled with betrayal and violence.. I got tired, stressed watching this film. Last ten minutes are nice but the damage has already been done.",4,1,10,3 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Why?
","How can this film have 8 stars on IMDB is beyond my understanding... Really sad. I had a Star Wars weekend and watched all six first films. Some I rated six and some nine. Especially I liked the Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). It connected the old trilogy with the new one perfectly, no plot holes!!! It was packed with action, emotion, meaning.. everything! This... I felt betrayed. The beginning wipes out any meaningful connection to the saga immediately. Just another action film with some super powers. We have a new one every day now.. SAD... And I thought I'm gonna enjoy it! I watched it till the end, hoping. When it was too boring I let it run on the background while writing some posts.. It didn't get better. 2/10 stars",2,12,15,15 January 2019
Happy Feet," Difficult to rate.
","I disapprove of too much of mating topic, some songs are not appropriate for kids but hey, we can hear them on the radio, in the shops etc. Sad but true. What I liked in this film is that it raises awareness of our actions on this planet, and maybe kids who have watched this, when they grow up, will think of the planet and creatures on it a bit more than we do. How they solved the problem was too fast and unbelievable but for kids this optimism could be OK. So, difficult to rate. Could have been done much better. 6/10",6,1,1,7 January 2019
Her," 1/10
","This is not really a Sci-Fi film. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi like I am, don't be mislead. It is some kind of a romantic social study that I have found extremely boring and disconnected from science.",1,1,12,3 March 2019
