Angels & Demons," worth watching but could have been done better
","This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.",8,46,64,25 July 2009
Changeling," An Extraordinary Movie
","Let me start by saying if you are not into slow movies, this movie is not for you. This is a very intense movie with good acting and brilliant dialogs. It is about the drama of a mother and the drama of a society because of corruption and misuse of power. The atmosphere is given very well and Eastwood did a decent job from the beginning to the end. This is one of the few movies where Angelina Jolie had the chance to act without the need of using her physical attraction. She was not bad but her face was lacking emotion most of the time. You do not get an Oscar with this performance and she did not indeed. On the other hand, the movie and story is so good that performance of an individual can neither ruin the movie nor make it better. Definitely worth watching.",10,4,7,10 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," nothing special
","I regret to say this but this is the most overrated movie of 2009. Such a waste of talent, money and time. I am pretty sure a lot of the people vote here did not even watch the movie. I have no doubt about the talent of Quentin Tarantino as a director and the directing of the movie was great, but as a writer, he does not have the same qualifications I am afraid and this was his weakest movie. Brad Pitt is normally a great actor but the role he was playing in this movie did not demand any talent. Christoph Waltz, on the other hand had a great performance. Now, let me share my humble opinion on the story. The movie is so long and it is full of never ending conversations. From the trailer, it looks like a war movie but it is not. Very little action and so much dialogs. I am not against this kind of movie making but there was just nothing special. I don't know why so many people find the story so genius. I didn't see anything that was not done before. Besides, even the idea of creating a special brigade to kill your enemies violently is as cruel as burning them in concentration camps and I found making a movie on such an issue quite disrespectful to the memories of those we lost during the war.",7,1,4,24 December 2009
World War Z," A zombie movie with OK additions to the concept
","Well, this was a zombie movie with OK additions to the concept. The collaborative scenes of the zombies (such as the scene where zombies use each other to climb a wall) were quite good both from the CGI side and the idea side. On the other hand, the virus spreads ultra quickly. This was not a good idea from my point of view. A whole city gets sick in a few seconds. Acting was not that great I am afraid. A lot of characters just pop up and than turn into a zombie. The directing and story telling was not that great either. I believe the biggest success of the movie was the good advertising. Just to sum up, the movie was not boring and had some positive contributions to the zombie concept. But, it is not a movie that I will remember as a great zombie movie.",7,0,8,29 June 2013
Shaun of the Dead," boring and not funny at all
","OK, I am really not one of these 'the worst movie ever' gang member but this one was really bad, I mean it. I tried so hard to enjoy a little bit but I didn't smile even one time. I don't know how this movie can be rated 8 but first time in my life, I am giving such a confident 1 and if there was a chance to give something lover, I would. From the beginning to the end, it is so slow and the jokes are so bad. If you really want to watch it, fasten your seat belt not to escape screaming and drink one liter of coffee so that you don't sleep. It is not only the plot, the acting was bad as well. I didn't find the characters funny. Overall, bad, bad and plain bad.",1,85,196,12 March 2010
Terminator Salvation," Lets make a movie...
","I gave a 7 to this movie just because of the good CGI. There is definitely nothing else. You can guess the end from the beginning. They seem to use everything in the trailer. The story they are telling is something you can tell in 10 minutes. Anyways, this movie just buried the Terminator franchise which was killed by the third movie. It starts good but after the first action scene where I could count the number of hair and holes on the faces of all characters since the camera was used so so badly, I started to worry. There is not so much to criticize about the story since there was no story. But even in their non-existing plot there were so many ridiculous things. Yes, skynet can make these ultra advanced robots but can not listen simple radio communication. You can shoot anything with a rocket from 5 meters, the blast has no effect. When you jump into the ocean, there is always someone to pick you up and escort to a submarine. Meanwhile, you don't need any diving equipment or something like that if you are Christian Bale. The concept of John Connor is also totally destroyed after the third movie and the TSCC. He is supposed to be a leader not a prophet. It is quite clear that they made the movie just for money. If you have any respect to good old Terminator, don't watch this one and don't kill your good memories. I hope they will not be back...",7,2,4,12 June 2009
Hotel Rwanda," a true master piece
","The movie is about a man trying to rescue Tutsi refuges during the very sad incidence in Rwanda where Hutu militia committed one of the biggest genocide in modern times. This movie is certainly a true master piece, a corner stone in movie history. Don Cheadle is in general a great actor but his performance in this movie is far more than excellent. Character development, story telling, directing and acting is truly professional. You can feel the drama as the story progresses. It reminded the cold face of the truth. Our humanism, democracy and all other nonsense that we like to talk about is nothing but a pile of lies. We all watched millions killing each other and we did nothing.",10,0,0,15 August 2009
Shutter Island," certainly beyond imagination
","This is a movie I can recommend anyone without hesitation. I haven't seen such a strong movie for a long time. A great atmosphere combined with great acting, great story and great directing. Especially if you don't know the book, you are very likely to enjoy it till the very end. A mental hospital is a quite good place for strange stories and Shutter Island is a prison for mentally sick people that are casting great danger for the society. The story is about an investigation of a marshal on mysterious disappearance of a murderess who is believed to be on the island. A chain of unexpected events reveals the truth that one would have difficulties to imagine. A remarkably good movie indeed, don' miss it.",10,0,3,20 March 2010
Oblivion," Derivative of the movie Moon
","Frankly, the amount of joy you will get out of this movie depends on how familiar you are with SciFi. If you have seen a lot of science fiction movies, you will get bored as hell. The scenario is basically a derivative of the movie Moon. A guy doing some work on a deserted planet starts questioning his existence and past. Then he finds out what he knows as truth has nothing to do with reality. I am not saying the movie is bad but it is too long and I didn't see anything original. Visuals are good. Acting is OK. Story is fine but very predictable. No twist, no surprise. It ends as you would expect and you can guess the end after first ten minutes.",7,1,4,24 April 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Movie with Overrated Rating.
","As a person that read the book and watched the Swedish version of the movie, my first conclusion is people rated this movie without watching. I am not saying the movie is bad but considering the book, it is just fine (even at the edge of fine). The character development phase is ultra lame. I watched the movie with couple of friends and at the end they had a lot of questions in mind. Considering the length of the movie, one can easily judge how bad the script was. There were so many useless details (and yeah, I read the other two books as well. I know what I am talking about). If you sum up the time spent on details neither necessary for this movie nor the rest of the series, one could use that time to tell the story properly. Lets talk about the positive sides as well. The script follows the book in an OK manner (but towards the ending I guess the script writer got bored). On the other hand, everything is so rushed. I must say, the scenery is well portrait. Lastly, I need to warn you about the adult content as well. This is simply not a family movie. As a conclusion, an OK movie but not a masterpiece or what so ever.",7,11,22,21 January 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," the pointless spider-man
","OK, if you are wondering why they made another spider-man movie, there is actually no concrete answer. The story is mostly same and there is no amazing fight scene or whatsoever that could make this movie or the spider-man character amazing. So if anything at all, you can call this movie as the pointless spider-man. I am sick of watching remakes of great movies. Just that you can shoot the movie in 3D (and the 3D of this movie was the worst I have ever seen) doesn't mean you should make another movie. I mean it, I don't want to pay to see the same things over and over anymore. Here is my grading for this movie. -1 for the originality, -1 for the acting, -2 for the super super bad 3D.",6,3,8,12 July 2012
District 9," A very unorthodox science fiction
","This is certainly not a normal science fiction we are used to. It is discussing what would happen if unprotected aliens come to earth and need help from us. Off course they would be treated as refugees and in the movie, their possible future is shown. They are treated as garbage, they are put into districts, they are given animal food, they are forced to migrate, they are killed wildly and much more. Some people may find this very provocative and may claim we wouldn't do that but thinking about it, this would exactly be what could happen. It reminds all the suburbs of big cities, filled with people coming from poor countries who are treated almost like this. First put the different to somewhere isolated, restrict their movements, slowly reduce their rights, treat them as natural born criminals, force them to move from their homes, kill them randomly for nonsense reasons and then declare them as the enemy of state. Sounds kind of familiar. This is really the most controversial movie of the year. You won't regret watching it.",10,3,6,10 January 2010
Twilight," not more romantic than a love story between a cat and a mouse
","Let me start by saying I like vampire movies and I don't have any prejudice for a human falling into love with any creature. The movie is about the love between a vampire which is quite different than all the vampires I have seen so far and a human girl. The first problem with this setting is the abilities the vampires have. They can walk in the sun light, they don't die by silver, they are fast, they are ultra strong, they are unbeatable. I think they confused the vampires with super heroes. The problem is, all these upgrades they made to usual vampire kind make them a strong predator and a love story between such a predator and a human is certainly not more romantic than a love story between a cat and a mouse. During the whole movie, I was waiting for a scene where Robert Pattinson eats Kristen Stewart. If this is your understanding of love, go ahead and watch.",6,1,5,15 August 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," definitely the best movie of 2012
","I must say I was very skeptical since I know the book and it might be very difficult to make more than one movie based on that story. But they simply managed to make a great movie even from the beginning of the book, which was kind of boring. So, I would say the movie is actually better than the book and this is a very very rear thing. The story telling is amazingly good and simple. The visuals are stunning and acting is simply amazing. I think this is like the first movie in years I am giving a 10 without thinking twice and I am really willing to see it one more time. Moral of the story, this is definitely the best movie of 2012.",10,5,15,22 December 2012
Django Unchained," Blood, violence, boring conversations and a story that has nothing special
","Frankly, this was a really boring movie with too much unnecessary violence. But since the director is Tarantino, criticizing this movie is some sort of taboo. If you have seen some of Tarantino's work, there is nothing new in this one. Blood, violence, boring conversations and a story that has nothing special. Heads explode, bodies tear apart and people dies. That is the one sentence summary. I am not even mentioning the references that would be counted as racist. Moral of the story, this movie is not my cup of tea. Neither the action justifies itself for such a long period of time nor the story is interesting enough to compensate for the violence which was totally unnecessary.",6,6,11,12 February 2013
2012," Hollywood needs to find another way of story telling
","Given the greatness of the idea and all computer graphics investment, is this what you came with? Come on. This movie had such a great potential but they managed to ruin it quite successfully. The Jackson Curtis character was actually the most ruining factor from my point of view but I didn't find the story convincing as well. Especially, escaping from tectonic crack was pathetic, the airplane scenes were ultra unrealistic and the flood was certainly not studied well. How on earth a flood can reach Everest. Hello, tsunami and flood are different things. Even if you shut down your brain and try to enjoy, the plot is drifting from one little irrelevant point to another. A shorter version with less characters and story from the eyes of Adrian Helmsley character could have been much better. I am sick of this crazy genius author who has the most advanced intellectual skills as well as the physical strength of a super hero character. Hollywood needs to find another way of story telling. We don't buy this anymore.",7,1,2,24 December 2009
Gran Torino," a very intense movie
","Eastwood has proved himself once more to be a great director and still one of the best actors. The movie is about an old man who has an angry perspective to life. After he looses his wife, he starts to care about other people that he always hated. It is a very intense movie with very sad and silent moments. The story is well written and the character development is pretty good. Although the movie is around two hours, the time is used very wisely. The only thing I may criticize about the movie is the acting beside Eastwood. I didn't find the performance of Bee Vang so good. On the other hand, as a whole, the movie is certainly worth watching.",9,0,8,29 August 2009
Avatar," This can't be the movie Cameron was working on for years
","Avatar (3D version) is certainly a different experience, a visual show but nothing more. I still can't believe Cameron came with such a weak story. I really started to believe CGI is destroying the whole concept of cinema. Recently, directors are spending a fortune on technical things and don't care about plot or other things that make something a movie. I wouldn't regret watching the Avatar but there is really nothing new except the fancy visuals. The story is a combination of The Last Samurai, Pocahontas, Matrix and Dances with the Wolves. It is so predictable that I felt insulted. This can't be the movie Cameron was working on for years. This movie will get a lot Oscars, no doubt but I hope directors don't get the wrong impression. We do care about other aspects than fancy visuals and we won't buy such a weak story again...",9,1,2,23 January 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Great visuals ruined by bad directing and cheesy acting
","What a sad result for such great visuals. I hereby congratulate Michael Bay for his great achievement of ruining this movie since it really requires some talent. Lets start with the actor selection. The only difference between lumber and Shia LaBeouf is Shia LaBeouf can talk. Given this fact, I really don't see any reason for his existence on this (or any other) movie. I mean it, this guy has no talent at all, he doesn't have an attractive physic or anything that can justify his presence in a movie. Also, the female characters made the plot more cheesy and they were totally unnecessary. Lets put some sexy girls and silly jokes to make a teenage movie. Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. I have never seen a classical movie with cheesy plot. Especially in sci-fi, this cheap tricks are just ruining the movie. I don't want to hear a stupid joke when there is an action packed fight scene. If you want to make a remarkable movie, you should be serious (I prescribe the director some James Cameron movies so that he may see how sci-fi is done). The last battle was really great in terms of visuals but overall, there is plenty of room for improvement. It is so sad that the third one will be done by the same director.",7,0,5,15 March 2010
Dark Shadows," somehow not that good
","My overall opinion is not negative but I feel like the idea is wasted a bit. The movie started pretty good. But after twenty minutes, everything became predictable. It was not boring but it was not very entertaining either. I don't even think this movie is comedy. There are very few jokes. Overall acting was kind of OK but Depp is becoming a very one dimensional actor by playing always similar characters. The scenery was pretty good and I must say, visuals were quite good as well. At the end, I wouldn't watch this movie once more but at least I didn't regret paying for it. If you didn't like the other Depp and Burton movies, don't even think watching this one.",7,16,31,6 July 2012
Sherlock Holmes," much better than I expected
","After watching the trailers and reading some comments, I was actually expecting a mindless action movie that has nothing to do with Holmes. But it turned out to be quite wrong. The movie is very nice and it is actually reflecting Holmes as much as possible. It is not a Doyle story but there is nothing contradicts with the Holmes portrait by Doyle. There is some action but it is nothing exaggerated and the dialogs are satisfactorily crafted in an intelligent and logical way. The sense of rationalism what is the main part of the character Holmes is always there. The only part I found strange was the involvement of Irene Adler. In the original series, she had a different role in the whole story. Also, Holmes is supposed have an accent but it was simply not there. Nevertheless, much better than I expected.",9,1,2,28 February 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart
","It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart.",10,2,3,4 October 2009
Prometheus," are you kidding me...
","To make the long story short, this is nothing like Alien. It seems Ridley lost his touch for sci-fi as well. Let me point out why.The gravest part was the story. It starts with an expedition to a distant planet with a couple of people that are least suitable for the job. Come on, they are going for the man kinds biggest expedition and a couple of clueless idiot, a weird robot, a captain that acts like anything but a captain, a woman whose function was not even clear and so on. Would this be your crew for a scientific expedition? And some of these geniuses act like they saw a pet dog when they see an alien life form...The badly chosen characters were not the only thing annoying about the story. There was almost no tension. It was like watching a B rated sci-fi channel movie. They encounter alien species and they act as if they see tigers in a zoo.Now lets come to the acting. It was cheesy, mostly annoying and very unprofessional.Overall, lower your expectations if you will watch it. In the end, I am not going to watch this movie one more time, ever. Shame on you Ridley Scott...",6,1,4,6 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," a real trash...
","Frankly, this review doesn't contain any spoiler. All I will say is, Force Awakens is a very bad summary of the previous Star Wars movies. There is nothing new, not even a single moment. From my point of view, telling this is not a spoiler but a sign that the movie is a real trash.The story is very predictable. Honestly, after the first five minutes, the movie lost me. There is no character development phase. If you don't know the previous movies, there is no way you can get the story. If you know the previous movies, you can predict each and every moment of the movie. In any case, bad plot, even worse story telling. What were they thinking? Lets make a bigger death star. Put Ford in the center of the story. Make good advertisement and everything will be OK. Everything went OK for Episode 7. They made quite some money but I don't think incoming episodes will get any of this attention. Moral of the story, overrated pop corn movie with nothing (I really mean nothing) special. Don't destroy your good old memories.",4,30,41,27 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," do not trust that super positive reviews
","I actually was not going to write a review but after reading all those 'best movie ever' comments, I felt the responsibility to write something. I watched the movie at an IMax (where even the worst movie looks OK) but there was nothing visually spectacular. Character development phase is not that bad but there was no character that I could like (including Katniss. Actually especially Katniss). There was nothing special about the performance of Jennifer Lawrence to say the least. She really needs to work on acting and expressions. She was really boring. The other characters don't even have an impact. When it comes to the story, it is somewhat not so believable. I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantastic movies but the story of Hunger Games has never been appealing to me. Anyway, do not trust that super positive reviews. This is an average movie with an average story and average acting.",6,35,73,1 December 2013
Moon," The idea was good, effects were OK but story was week
","The movie is about a space man, working on the moon to harvest some sort of energy source. After his three years of serve, he finally deserves to return back to home. Right before that, he realizes things are not as they look about his life. After this short summary, let me write my humble ideas about the movie. In general, I enjoyed the movie but reading some comments on IMDb, it is ultra over-exaggerated. First of all, this is one of the most boring movie I have ever seen. It has a nice idea but a bad plot. I would prefer more action and the story could have been much more interesting. I know a lot of people will disagree with me but honestly, if you are a hard core science fiction fan like me, you expect a good idea, good plot and nice CGI. The idea was good, effects were OK but story was week. Especially end of the movie was pathetic.",7,2,7,21 November 2009
