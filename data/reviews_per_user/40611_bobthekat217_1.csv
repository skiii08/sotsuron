Howl's Moving Castle," I've actually read the BOOK and it's great
","I haven't seen the movie because it comes out in select theaters, which i expect i am not near one, but i read the book on which this is based called Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones, and i loved it. It's one of my favorites and i encourage you all to read the book, along with it's sequel, and the other works of Ms. Jones. I was thrilled to learn that they would be making a movie, and although a live action feature would be nice too, i am still glad for it. I hope they make movies of the Chrestomanci Chronicles, but then again i like that it's sort of a secret with myself since i don't know anyone else who's read the books. Maybe now you all will.",Null,3,11,7 June 2005
