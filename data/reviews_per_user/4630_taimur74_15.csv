Scarface," Still makes Goodfellas look like Mary Poppins
","My God .. what a film. Forget every gangster movie u have ever seen . If you ever wanna see a movie that truly shows the nastiness of the Gangster life style this is it . It doesnt have the opera of the Godfather or the visuall dazzle of Goodfellas but what it does have is a truly no holds barred approach to its subject . The chainsaw sequence is the most nerve shredding scene i have witnessed in a gangster movie . And of course Mr. Pacino once again confirming my suspicions that he is the big screen's most intense actor , it is a testament to his skill that while Montana has hardly any redeeming qualities we are still rivited by him . This is a film for purists of gangster movies and u either like this movie or u have no taste .",10,0,0,13 August 2001
Insomnia," take a bow Mr.Pacino
",for giving probably the best performance of the year in this riveting thriller by Christopher Nolan . The man acheives a level of acting talent unheard of in recent memory and thankfully unlike the rest of his generation he hasnt become a one note joke ( Robert 'showtime' DeNiro anyone ?? ) All i can say is that this is without a doubt the best thriller of the year and way above panic room and murder by numbers.,10,0,0,6 July 2002
Insomnia," The best thriller of the year
",This is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year . christopher nolan proves himself again to be one the best directors around . Al Pacino yet again reinforces his legendary reputation as the most intense actor around . Williams is astounding as his quarry and alter - ego . All in all a must-see film .,10,0,0,31 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," To call it a sequel is a travesty
","This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.",10,512,636,9 May 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Intensity
",What makes this movie phenomenal is the performance by pacino . Famously hospitalized for exhaustion after this movie . His Micheal Corleone is a masterpiece fo characterization and undoubtedly the greatest performance ever . Do yourself a favor and watch this movie SOON !,10,0,0,30 December 2001
The Godfather: Part II," The Greatest performance ever
",We all know that this is an incredible movie adn the greatest sequel but this movie also has the greatest performance of all time in Al PAcino's Micheal . I have never seen any actor use his eyes to such devastating effect the way PAcino does and i have yet to see Pacino ( or any other actor ) better this performance .,10,0,0,3 December 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Pacino in his prime
",If you want to see the most intense actor in cinematic history give the most intense performance in cinematic history look no further than this movie . Pacino is absoulutely magnificent as a tightly coiled don and creates the greatest character ever portrayed by any actor ever . Watch this movie !,10,0,0,5 September 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Intensity
",How can i even begin to describe the impact this movie had on me . Absolute perfection. The entire cast is perfect . DeNiro is great as the young vito corleone in his first major role as well as Duvall and Diane Keaton but it is Al Pacino who dominates this picture . His emotionless stare is possibly the most chilling gaze i have ever seen in any movie and he completely blows every other actor in this movie off the screen . DeNiro won an oscar but he isnt fit to lick pacinos boots by comparison . All in all the finest sequel ever made .,10,0,1,31 March 2002
Dog Day Afternoon," Pacino in his prime
","Watch the world's most intense actor give one of his best performances in this Lumet Classic which is one of my top 5 movies rite after Serpico . See this move ! . One of the most amazing points of his performance is that it came rite after his cold ruthless performance in The Godfather Part 2 and he's completely changed . No makeup , no stupid deniro method gimmicks . His whole mannerisms , his style is different . Kudos",10,3,5,9 September 2001
Donnie Brasco," Al Pacino's Unforgiven
","What a movie and above all what a fantastic performance from PAcino . unlike the other actors of his generation ( DeNiro , Nicholson ) he still knows the diff. b/w a good movie and a dud . This is truly a thinking man's gangster movie and in my opinion ranks rite up there with the godfather trilogy and scarface . SEE IT",10,0,0,24 August 2001
The Insider," Best movie of its year
","Fantastic film . First time i saw it i was bored but the second time i was riveted by its purposely slow pacing and brooding atmosphere . Russel Crowe is magnificent as the shy , introverted Jeffrey Wigand , a man who dares to blow the whistle on one of america's most powerful companies . Al Pacino .. what can i say about this actor . He's the big screen's most intense actor and while other actors of his generation have become parodies of themselves he is still giving classics like this one . Cheers .",10,0,0,29 September 2001
The Godfather: Part III," One of the great performances of the decade
",Yeah yeah everyone knows the gf3 is not as great as the first 2 but dont see this and you're missing out on one of the best performances by any actor in the 90's . I'm talking about Al PAcino reprising his legendary role of Micheal Corleone .He is absolutely magnificent in this role . Hunched over and seemingly defeated but still emanating that intensity and power that was in part 2 . This is surely micheal corleone's saga and pacino does full justice to his role even if the movie does not serve him well . It also has one of the greatest delivered lines in movie history 'Just when i thought i was out they pull me back in ',Null,0,1,13 October 2001
Heat," Pacino steals the show
","For me Al Pacino made this movie with his hysterical , over the top turn as the obsessed , drugs addicted cop whos hell bent on catching DeNiro's ice cool robber . One particulary memorable scene has him screaming 'CUZ SHE GOT A GREAT ASS ! ' in a sleazeball's face . The expression on the guys face is hilarious . This movie is a little overlong but worth seeing just for his performance alone .",Null,0,0,6 October 2001
Heat," Simply Riveting
",I saw this movie for the so called clash of DeNiro and Pacino and was rivited . This is truly a movie given extra weigtage by its two acting titans . DeNiro is subtle and understated .. at times a little bit too understated . Pacino is wild in this one giving one of his awesome flamboyant performances. To those who have criticized his performance as being over the top i must tell them that he character is addicted to drugs which explains his uncontrolled mannersims. I was disappointed by the coffee shop scene though Pacino is good in that scene using his incredible emotional range to show his character's complexities while DeNiro just keeps giving his 'the look' . Truly a great movie which can be viewed numerous times .,Null,0,0,13 August 2001
Heat," THE GREATEST COPS AND ROBBERS MOVIE OF ALL TIME !
",Truly a movie of tremendous proportions this is an epic in the true sense of the word rather than the hollow movies like Gladiator that scream EPIC but do not achieve epic status . First of all it has got not one but two of the greatest actors of all time Pacino and DeNiro . Pacino the king of intensity and DeNiro the master of subtelty . To see these two acting great's styles clash against each other is truly an awe inspiring sight . Has there been a more electrifying scene in the 90's than seeing these two masters sitting at a coffee table exchanging dialogues ?? i think not . Do yourself a favor and watch this . my favourite line after watching this movie has become ' CUZ SHE'S GOT A GREAT ASS !! ' you'll see what i mean .,Null,0,0,6 June 2001
