Walk the Line," Walk the line is neat
",Walk the line made me realize the stuff Johnny Cash went through in his life. I enjoyed learning about his ups and downs in fame. It showed the workings of what show business was like back then and how it can and did affect a persons life.,8,2,2,24 January 2019
42," A good representation of a messed up time
","42 does a good job at showing the struggles not just Jackie Robertson went through but what all African Americans went through in that time. i like how it stayed enjoyable to watch while not really censoring much, that was probably hard for the film makers to do",9,2,3,5 February 2019
Rocky IV," Love this movie
","This is an 80s staple, with the perfect amount of birthday robots. This is one of those movies i quote daily. Lines like 'You gonna ring the bell?' and 'If he dies he dies'. Definitely one of my favorites. The fact that it made Creed 1 and 2 possible makes it the gift that keeps on giving",10,0,0,3 May 2019
Remember the Titans," YES
","Its a Fabulous movie about a bunch of dudes learning to ignore skin color and care about each other as family, it reminds me of times when i was on a team at school, and how we all spent time together and created memories.",10,0,1,11 April 2019
Selma," great
","I found this movie to be very interesting, it deals with a very important time for human rights and the two playing Malcolm X and Martin Luther King do a wonderful job and really look the part. It doesn't hold back on showing the brutality of the stuff that went down back then, which makes you realize the strength those folks had",10,0,3,1 March 2019
Thirteen Days," Well made but not my type of flick
",Thirteen days depicts a very interesting time period for the United States. With communism scaring everyone and suspicions about spies. Its a well made movie but i found it a tad boring. The guy that played John F. Kennedy didn't really seem like JFK. I can see why people can enjoy this movie and its a good movie to show in a history class.,7,0,1,13 February 2019
Apollo 13," Intense stuff
",This movie does a good job of making you feel the danger and terror that these three astronauts went through. This movie made me look at space exploring and NASA differently. Not only were the astronauts stressed out but the people on Earth were sleep deprived and working non stop to get these guys home.,7,1,2,3 May 2019
Back to the Future," Very good movie yo
","Back to the Future holds up, and probably will forever, The cast is perfect, Michael J Fox is a likable cool dude, Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is always enjoyable. This is a very enjoyable movie overall.",10,1,1,30 January 2019
