Blade Runner 2049," Great Visuals!
","The movie was great. All the visuals were very epic and especially color the palette. The only thing to mention is that towards the ending scenes I've imagined that there will be more action.
This movie is definitely an addition to my inspiration list.",8,1,3,8 January 2018
