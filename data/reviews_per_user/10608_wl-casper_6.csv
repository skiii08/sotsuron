Blade Runner 2049," Beautifully made & sure to be a future classic
","With the original being one of my all time favorites I had been skeptical when I heard a sequel was in the pipeline. The skepticism I had was long forgotten after watching Blade Runner 2049. Firstly, the movie is a visual masterpiece. Every shot is like a painting. It manages to retain the dreamy atmosphere of futuristic LA while still bringing something original to the table. I enjoyed the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch although it's not quite up there with that of Vangelis. In terms of story it might seem a bit underwritten in parts but I felt the central characters were emotionally resonating and any subplots would have distracted from the more important aspects of K's story. Ryan Gosling is excellent in the role of K and for the short time that Harrison Ford is on the screen he gives his best performance I've seen from him in a long time.For some of the few downsides to the film. As much as I loved this movie I was surprised with the ending. I felt that it ended in a way that suggested too much towards a Blade Runner 3. I would have preferred if all the loose ends were tied up and with a running time of close to 3 hours you'd expect that to be the case. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys noir sci-fi and liked the original. It's definitely not going to be for everyone and the pacing is slower than most movies of today however, that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion.",8,0,3,11 October 2017
Dunkirk," No soul and void of compelling characters
","I had very high expectations for Christopher Nolan's latest offering as I'm a big fan of his previous work but Dunkirk is the first of his films I really don't care for. For pros I would say the cinematography, sound mixing and soundtrack are excellent but Dunkirk was missing the most important elements for any film; Characters and a story!!I was blown away by the opening scene and thought this would be another masterstroke by Nolan but there are so many problems with it. Apart from the lack of any interesting characters, the script feels so aimless at times and while watching the film I felt like someone was constantly pressing stop and rewinding. I also had a problem with the dialogue. The lines between the characters were very rigid and did not move the plot along. There was very little emotion in Dunkirk and while I did like the soundtrack I thought too much emphasis was placed on trying to convey tension through the music, be it the ticking of the clock or harsh synths building to a crescendo in the background. The strangest thing and most disappointing was that the film feels like it is building to something bigger the whole time like a grand finale but it never arrived. I had no problem with the fact that the story was non-linear but it doesn't matter what pattern the story is laid out in if there are no people at the centre of the story. I really don't understand how the ratings are so high so far because it doesn't deserve the plaudits it's receiving. I expect the rave reviews to continue as film critics don't seem to be able to judge a film for themselves these days.Very disappointed.",5,42,77,24 July 2017
Now You See Me," Now You See Me ''All style and no substance''
","This has to be one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory. Even now I'm still trying to think of the good things to say about this film if any. If I was to pick a highlight in the film it would be Woody Harrelson, whose on screen presence adds some interest and comedic value to the story but apart from that this film was pretty much downhill from the moment it started.The motives for the characters are half baked and there is no build up to any of the plot points. Everything is rushed and gives off a this film is too smart for you to understand vibe when it really isn't. Every scene consists of constant blabbing and for the amount of dialogue in each scene none of it is worth remembering. The main problem I had with the film is the over all story or lack of. Maybe the screen writers ran out of ideas and just thought to themselves 'Lets throw in another plot twist for good measure'. It's surprising that such a good cast would agree to be in such a poor film and that so many people on IMDb gave it a good review. If you want to see a good magic themed film then watch the Prestige or the Illusionist as they are well written, tense and enjoyable films compared to Now You See Me, which is just a mess. Don't waste your money on it.",1,90,174,8 July 2013
Insidious," Terrible, over-hyped film.
","I went to see this film the other day and for some reason I wasn't surprised at how bad it was, considering how much people over-hype films these days.Where to start with this film?.The pacing is all over the place, the film is too slow at the start and by the end you feel like you've sat through an hour and a half of a cheap home movie.The acting is another negative point to this film.You can't connect with the characters and as a result you don't care what happens to them.There are some good things about this film if very few.The film makers try to use creep factor instead of giving the audience blood and guts and the premise of the story is decent but the end result should have been so much better.As for the scary parts, its one least scary films i've ever watched.There are a few moments that make you jump out of your seat but nothing more.People are saying this is the scariest film they've ever seen - How many films have these people watched? not many I guess. I would strongly advise people to wait for this to come out on DVD and have it for a Saturday night shock because it's not worth the money or the trip to the cinema.",1,53,96,8 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Disappointing Mr Nolan *Minor Spoilers if any*
","After seeing what are arguably two of the best films in cinematic history in Inception and The Dark Knight I had very high hopes for this film. I have followed the Batman films and the TV shows from an early age and I think that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director, however after paying through the nose to see this conclusion to his trilogy on the opening day I felt he could have done so much more with this film.I'll start with the good things about this film. 1) Anne Hathaway was surprisingly very good in the film. She offered something new and fresh not seen before and the on screen chemistry with Bale was exceptional. Her character is also a lot more intriguing than that of Tom Hardy's Bane whose muffled, almost in inaudible voice nearly ruins the film by itself.2) John Blake played by JGL is a strong addition to the cast and his performance as Blake does not go unnoticed.3) The production values and cinematography are second to none and that is to be expected from a Nolan film.4) Michael Caine is nothing short of brilliant. He offers raw emotion and substance.Two things which are otherwise lacking in the film. And sadly that is about all the plus points from this clunky, pretentious, overlong mess of a film. I have the feeling that Nolan's heart just wasn't in this one unlike its predecessors. The script is poor, the pacing is terrible, Tom Hardy is completely wasted in his role and worst of all it doesn't feel like a Batman film. There is no tension or suspense and the story lacks flow and direction. The film offers short glimpses of excellence such as the chase scene between batman and the police and the scene between Alfred and Bruce where Alfred tries desperately to try and convince Bruce to hang up his cape for good. The second fight scene between Batman and Bane is also pretty entertaining as is the last ten minutes. But for a film that clocks in at nearly three hours these scenes are not enough to save it.Another annoying thing about the film is the action or lack of. Most of the action scenes are given away in the trailers and none of which are that original apart from the scene at the start. Big explosions and lots of guns and that's about it. Batman doesn't even get that much screen time. But the most disappointing thing is the weak script and cheesy dialogue both of which are not something that Nolan usually gives us. Way too many things going on and every character for some reason feels the need to give their own Harvey Dent style declaration along the lines of ''you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain''. It is so disappointing for me to be writing a bad review for this film and as for everyone saying it's brilliant or it's just as good as the others they are simply in denial or they're flat out lying. It is neither terrible or brilliant. I will of course buy it when it comes out on DVD as it is a good film and deserves a 7 out of 10 and should be viewed more than once and I expect my mind to wander on second viewing as some parts are boring. Just don't go into this movie with high hopes or expecting to see a masterpiece because it simply isn't.Massive Disappointment.",6,5,10,20 July 2012
The Great Gatsby," The Great Gatsby Review
","The bad reviews this film has received is surprising but everyone to their own I suppose. I thought the first 40 minutes was a bit messy and jumped from one thing to the next and the constant playing of Jay-Z was kind of annoying but once it settled down and got into the story I really enjoyed it. The cinematography is brilliant and the script is fairly close to the book which I also liked. As for the acting, Leonardo Di Caprio is immense in this film. He really does the part of Jay Gatsby justice. Baz Luhrman couldn't have picked a better person to play Gatsby. One thing I had a problem about before seeing the film was the fact that Tobey Maguire was playing Nick but this was the first film I have watched him in where he didn't make me want to pull my eyes out from cringing. There is some parts where he just stands there with that blank expression on his face but overall I think he did a good job. Other actors worth mentioning are Joel Edgerton and Elizabeth Debicki who both bring the characters of Tom and Jordan to life despite Jordan only having a few lines. I would be surprised if Joel E doesn't get a lot more roles now after this film. Carey Mulligan does her best as the selfish and naive Daisy.I'm not going to into specifics but I'll just say for anyone who has read the book you'll enjoy the film. As for anyone who hasn't read the book it is a brilliant story and I think this film does it justice.",8,1,3,19 May 2013
