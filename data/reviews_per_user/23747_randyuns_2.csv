The Legend of Bagger Vance," One of Redford's Best
","This ranks right up there with Field of Dreams for a mystical, sports being more than sports, and learning life's lessons type of movie.  The scripting, characterizations, and photography are nearly flawless.  Very even handed, low key and well played.  Brilliant casting, right down to the narrator (or Chorus) in Jack Lemmon.  Not to be missed.",10,1,3,3 May 2003
Cars," Excellent
","Not to be missed. Awesome graphics, humor and plot line. Bravo. The voice talent does an excellent job, and the insider touches such as the exact paint scheme for Mario Andretti's car, Richard and Lynda Petty as the King and Ms. King with the right shade of blue for his SuperBird and, of course, the ending credits are simply not to be missed.This, undoubtedly, will be the blockbuster hit of the summer and it deserves to be so. Yes, Virginia, Hollywood can turn out a multi-gazillion dollar hit and not have it be R rated. Gee, no sex or profanity but entertainment value instead? Maybe all Hollywood executives should be required to see Cars but, you wanna know something? I think they already have.",10,1,2,20 June 2006
