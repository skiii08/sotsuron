The Lobster," The weirdest movie i've ever seen, still amazing!!
","The movie is so weird, yet very thought provoking and mind-binding.
The plot and the events are so clever, and so are the characters. 
 Definitely worth your time!",8,1,3,23 January 2018
Last Flag Flying," Not as expected
","As much as i love Steve Carell, i didn't like the movie at all.
I expected the movie to be more funny as Steve was in there (that's why i decided to watch it btw). This emotional and sad type of role is not the one we're used to see Steve play, it doesn't fit neither his character nor his career full of humor and foolishness where all the movies he had starred in were ranked the most hilarious.
As for Bryan Cranston and Laurence Fishburne, it's a good choice though.",4,3,9,26 January 2018
