Lucky Number Slevin," A Must See
","I'll be honest i cant say much about the movie, even the slightest vague detail would give away entirely too much about the plot.This is an edge of your seat, unpredictable, amazing movie. I don't care what else comes to the big screen this year, i would vote this as the best movie of 2006. Not just 'so far' i mean i cant foresee anything better then this movie.There are good movies, and then there are great ones. Lucky Number Slevin is better then words can describe. It's a movie that will leave you saying 'that was a good movie' for hours afterword. Deffenitly worth going to see.",10,2,9,8 April 2006
