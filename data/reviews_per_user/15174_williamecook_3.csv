Blade Runner 2049," Worthy sequel that's very good, not great (just like the original)
","Absorbing, but too long, the final action sequence is boring and leaves the viewer desperate for it all to be over. The ending is overly, and mistakenly sentimental. Same problem many sequels have: just too many threads being packed into a story that can't contain it; they didn't know where to go with some of the excess so it just sits there, leaving you to wonder why it was in there. They all make some sense in the context of the film, but looking back, I expect that they're staging a sequel or two (because that's how Ridley Scott rolls).But...absolutely visually and aurally stunning. Same brilliance of the first one, done better. Some innovative CGI--it falters here and there but is well worth the price of admission. They did a great job of referencing the original in many ways without making it a copycat or seem stale.Overall, very successful. Will win the Oscar for Visual Effects for sure. Maybe the sound awards and cinematography, though it'll be race against Dunkirk.It will do pretty well in the theaters, I think.",7,3,11,6 October 2017
Rules of Engagement," What a disappointment!
","Although it's been a top rental in the stores, I couldn't remember Rules of Engagement being in the theatres. Now I know why. This easily goes into the worst movies of the year list (along with Romeo Must Die). Some specific complaints:1. The opening scene where Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson play twenty-something Vietnam War soldiers (Jones by cleverly pulling a hat down on his head). We then join them thirty years later, where they look exactly the same.2. Somehow, we're supposed to feel compassion for a soldier that not only order the killing of soldiers as well as women and children, but also presumably lost the lives of many of his own men. Now, I'm no military expert, but here's my question: Why, since they were vacating the embassy anyway, didn't the soldiers take a _safe_ defensive position to protect the workers while escaping via helicopter. Let the Yemen's shoot at the building all they want, for goodness sake. I would guess they would get bored and stop eventually. Ridiculous.3. The plot just seemed to be a random sequence of scenes that only loosely made sense.4. Most of the other criticisms have already been noted. I'll repeat just one: How, in God's name did they find the Vietnam guy from 20 or 30 years earlier for the trial?Friedkin, Jones and Jackson should be cause for excitement in a movie, not a constant rolling of the eyes!",Null,0,1,5 December 2000
Black Hawk Down," Successfully walks a difficult line...
","Black Hawk Down could easily have devolved into a flag-waving Rambo-type affair very easily. All the elements are there: Good-looking, young, white American soldiers, faceless black Muslim enemies, a Vietnam-like setting, hyper-violent film-making, a young idealist Sergeant, an experienced heroic Colonel, a stern General, etc. One can imagine the damage that would have been done to this story in the hands of the wrong production team (say, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay instead of Jerry Bruckheimer and Ridley Scott).Like all *great* war movies, and most war movies in general, Black Hawk Down is an anti-war film. It does this by telling only one overall story: the true story of these soldiers in a fight against their 'assigned' enemy. Whether the fight is just, or necessary, is basically irrelevant to the story. For what reasons things go awry is also generally unimportant. The fight is shown form the perspective of the American soldier, leading to a `good against bad' conflict. Within the American ranks, there are no `good' or `bad' players. Mistakes are made, to be sure, but there is no intent behind it. What matters is the ferocious fight the characters find themselves in and what it feels like to face that terror.I'm not sure that Black Hawk Down is a great war film, but it can pack an emotional wallop on the order of All Quiet On the Western Front and Platoon, and its action sequences are as realistic and direct as those from Saving Private Ryan. If you saw it and didn't like it, reconsider why not, as you are depriving yourself of a powerful experience.",6,0,0,12 February 2002
