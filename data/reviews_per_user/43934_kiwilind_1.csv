The Avengers," Mindblowing
","This movie is the work I've ever seen. I'm not kidding, after this, I don't want to see any more films in my entire life. I have seen everything that can be possible in a film. Mindblowing, fantastic, thrilling, funny, excellent, Marvel has done something no one else have ever done before, putting together all these different superheroes, in one fantastic franchise, and making it work wonderfully! It might seen a little 'over-powered' but the feeling you get, watching all of these personalities fight together, makes it work. Marvel have actually made me do something I've never done before, write a review (kind of) on IMDb, and you have got to deliver for me to do that kind of things. Just the best movie I've ever seen 10/10",10,17,33,27 April 2012
