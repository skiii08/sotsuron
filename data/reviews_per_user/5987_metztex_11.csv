First Man," Comprehensive but difficult to watch
","This film appears to be an accurate portrayal of the life of Neil Armstrong, his wife and his two surviving children. The film focuses much more on the family life and how they moved from the X-15 project to Gemini to Apollo, rather than on the space missions themselves. There are very long periods of family development and character development with significant emphasis on how Neil and his his family felt with very short periods of the mission development.If you like films that focus on the people directly involved in historical events, then this film is for you. If like films that are more into how the events unfolded, their planning with some insight into the people that were part of them, then I would avoid this film.For me, this is was a difficult film to watch as it made Neil Armstrong seem very distant, unfeeling and in many ways, unlikable to me. I found myself waiting for the film to end. That said, I also think it is a good portrayal for Neil Armstrong and his family. This point of view of the these events are just not my cup of tea so to speak.",4,1,2,24 April 2019
The Death of Stalin," Surprisingly good dark satire but close to historical naritive
","Bottom Line Up Front: This dark satire takes some liberties with history but does stay rather close to the facts. Depicts the hysteria and the overwhelming fear instilled by Stalin and Beria in the late 40s and early 50s up to Stalin's death. If you like docu-dramas you will like this one. If not, don't bother.No spoilers if you know your history.I was pleasantly surprised by this film thinking it was going to show a lot of comedy with an intent of making light of the tumultuous time following Stalin's death. Instead, this film in many ways accurately depicted what it, quite possibly, like to be in the inner circle of Central Committee members at the time. It also showed the difference between Beria, who was a sadistic and a very sick individual, and who would become the next leader of the USSR, Khrushchev.What made this film compelling was the depiction of the fear and the sense of urgency to ensure control of an extremely centralized form of government. It also shows the trust between Khrushchev and Zhukov (head of the army) as they both served in WWII and played pivotal roles in the war. They understood one another and trusted each other to protect the state.Thankfully Khrushchev became the next leader and not Beria. If Beria had become leader, I don't think the Cuban missile crisis would have turned out well for either side. While Khrushchev was ruthless it was necessary under the Soviet system to ensure Beria and the NKVD were removed permanently (was eventually merged into the MVD and KGB). This cleared the way for many of Khrushchev's reforms (not depicted in the film as Khrushchev's reforms were so 'progressive' for more freedoms, he was removed by Brezhnev and reversed many of Khrushchev's reforms).",8,0,0,13 January 2020
Creed," Good but recyclecd plot
","Bottom Line up Front: This is a good coming of age story and a story which shows that anyone can achieve greatness provided they take responsibility for themselves. Additionally, they have have to work at it and not blame others for their failures. If you liked the Rocky movies, you are likely to enjoy this one.While this film does use a similar plot to the original Rocky, there are some differences but the story is basically the same. The main difference deals with the reasons the two different fighters chose to fight. In Rocky, Balboa fights because he really can't do anything else. In this film, Adonis is driven to fight. While he was not born with a 'silver spoon' he did have a predominately sheltered and good up bringing and did get a good education. He dose not need to box to earn a good living. He seems to be driven by something inside. Not sure what message this sends to people but to me, it may be the wrong message. I don't see the need to fight when you don't have to.Anyway, the good parts of this film clearly show that everyone, young and old needs to be responsible for themselves. Fight the fights that need to be fought (physical, mental and medical alike). Avoid the ones that you don't need to engage. Both Adonis and Rocky come face to face with some of these issues.I also did like the some of the similarities this film had with original Rocky. Especially with Rocky coming full circle in training Adonis. That was important to show.",7,0,0,8 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Be wary of ratings below 4 and above 7
","Bottom Line Up Front: This final installment of the original saga to me is two films in one. It had a number of scenes that should have been in Last Jedi (which fix the damage done there) and then seemed rushed at the end to complete the story.I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and saw the original Star Wars in theaters in 1977. I have a hard time calling this film a worthy ending to the saga but it is a very good attempt. This film is jammed packed with changes and plots. I do not recommend anyone leaving for any period of time during this film. You will miss something important.This film is also a stinging rebuke of Last Jedi as this film puts the final nail in the question of Rey's origins. While Last Jedi clearly stated that Rey's origins were insignificant, Rise of Skywalker shows Rey's origins are extremely important and falls inline with all other Star Wars films and books. This is a complete and utter rebuke of Last Jedi. I will not say what Rey's origins are to keep the surprise to those who have yet to see the film. There are also a number of other items in the film that are much more Star Wars/Lucas influences which really help the film. However, I feel there should have been a lot more of Lucas' influence in the film. I feel this would have helped the film even more. One area where I think Lucas' influence was placed was the scene in which Luke finally comes full circle. This is a prime example of a scene that should have been in Last Jedi (All Jedi must come 'full circle' to ensure they know themselves and their capability).There are a number of issues I do have with the film, specifically dealing with the progression of Rey's powers and how her training was conducted. Granted, this was forced on Abrams due to the disaster Johnson produced with Last Jedi but it is still annoying and does not help the film. Unfortunately, these issues have to be looked at through the lens of 'required' (much like a lot of Phantom Menace). The only saving grace on these aspects were the fact much of it was indicated in past Star Wars films and literature. So it is passable.In many ways, I think this film should have been split into two. A part one (to fix the disaster of Last Jedi) and part two (to finish the saga). I think this would have helped the story telling and really help explain why the final scenes occurred. There is a lot in this film which is why I think a number of folks called this film 'convoluted'. I can see that argument. This is this the reason I rate this film a 5. It is a good recovery, but just did not have the time to fix everything.Now that the saga is complete, here are my final rankings on the best Star Wars Films to date (keep in mind these are my opinions and not everyone agree and my opinions are based on a lifetime of Star Wars Fandom):1): 10/10 Empire Strikes Back2) 10/10 Return of the Jedi (Very close second)3) 10/10 New Hope (Very very close third)4) 10/10 Attack of the Clones (Not nearly as close but still a 10)5) 9/10 Rogue One6) 9/10 Revenge of the Sith7) 8/10 Force Awakens8) 8/10 Phantom Menace (Very close to Force Awakens)9) 8/10 Solo10) 5/10 Rise of Skywalker11) 1/10 Last Jedi (So far behind I don't even own this one)",5,1,13,24 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Surprising and Entraining
","Bottom Line Up Front...If you like comic book based films, you are likely to enjoy this one. Plot is different, not cookie cutter. Voices are well chosen and the pace of the films is about right after an initial slow start.I usually don't like films that use this type of animation but in this case, it works. The plot is different which helps tremendously and the occasional use of 'pure comic book' animation brings some nostalgia to the film. At times I felt I was watching the old Adam West Batman show but with A LOT less 'cheese'.The use of a different villain was also nice for this installment of Spider man. The diversity of the spider'people' was also well balanced and was the use of each spider'person's' special ability.This film surprised me. While I am not likely to buy the film, I found it entertaining and worth watching.",7,1,1,31 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Entertaining
","The final installment of the the Avengers was a good and entertaining ending to the series. While the plot line was predictable for the most part, there were enough plot twists to keep you entertained. CGI is first rate and there is plenty of 'eye candy' in this regard. Pretty much what you would expected from this type of film and Marvel. Those that like the MCU are likely to 'love' this installment. While I enjoy these films, I didn't think EndGame was 'awesome' but definitely a movie I would watch again.Character's stayed within their expected lanes so to speak with some differences with a few of them (will leave them out here to prevent spoilers). I would have preferred to keep all the Marvel characters in their lanes. While this was annoying at time, it was didn't distract too much from the film. I also would have liked to have seen more of Captain Marvel but she was brought in a the correct times to support the story. Just not a major part of it.Again, if you like the MCU or the DCU, you will like this one. If you are more into strong plot lines and characters, you might like this one.",7,0,3,17 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Why??!!
","It is hard to write this review due the massive and honestly, this very perplexing new addition to the Star War universe. Before I begin, here is my history with Star Wars. I first saw Star Wars in the theater in 1977 and was completely mesmerized by what George Lucas had created. The cast not only had chemistry but both strong male and female characters working TOGETHER as equals (with some friction at times, which makes it all the more interesting). I was also enthralled by the canon of the Star War Universe which Lucas created. I read many of the books that followed as well and found many of them equally entertaining. So that is my 'starting point' so to speak.What I liked about 'The Last Jedi'Rey....A wonderfully directed and very compelling character that is both inspiring and humble at the same time. She is desperately seeking where she comes from and just as importantly, is humble enough to know the raw power she can wield is not only frightening but dangerous if she is not taught how to control it. This makes Rey and outstanding addition to the Star War Universe!Finn...Great growth is seen in Finn in this installment. While he is still very afraid of the First Order to start out in this film, he realizes, with the help of Rose, he must face and confront his fear. This is a great addition to Star Wars. Rose...a very down to earth character that shows that everyone can make a difference and the importance of working together as a team. I just would have liked to have seen a little more development with Rose in this film.Yoda....Very good use of the Star Wars canon here. Yoda was introduced at the right time for Luke and his character and is critical to motivate Luke out of his over obsessive brooding funk induced from his prior failure (which in the canon of Star Wars, would have turned him dark but somehow didn't). Leia...I loved the fact a director finally had the courage to show that Leia is Skywalker and has the ability to use her inherent Jedi power. However, I feel it was poorly executed. While I put this as a positive, I would have liked this to have been better. I always admired Leia's strong female character growing up. Effects/CGI....Top notch with plenty of 'eye candy'. It is very apparent great effort and care was used to make this film visually stunning in larger scenes of the film. What I didn't like about the film (why it got only 3 stars from me)Luke....While I did not hear of Mark Hamill's misgivings about the direction the director, Rian Johnson, decided for his character until after I saw the film, I have to say I agree with Mark Hamill. Rian Johnson took this character off the deep end to the point where Luke would have become an agent of evil. How this did not happen is mystifying when you look at the Jedi lore. Guilt of past failure leads to fear of trying again which was shown in Luke many times in this film. Yoda said many times in past Star Wars films, 'fear is a path to the dark side'. This is a major break of the Star Wars canon that makes this film difficult to watch.Snoke...By far one of the most interesting charters in the film but Rian Johnson just tossed him aside like trash as if he was unimportant. In this film, he is hugely important. Where did he come from? Who instructed him? Was he another 'secret apprentice' that Palpatine had during the reign of the Empire like Mara Jade from the the book 'Last Command' by Timothy Zahn? This book by the way, if you have not read it, is part of an incredible trilogy which I am now wishing Lucas had used for the basis of Episodes XII, XIII and IX.Vice Admiral Holdo...This character seem forced, clunky and in some ways like a bull in a china shop. For a military commander, she does not act like one. I am prior military and have been in the presence of high ranking military leaders when making critical decisions. In close quarters when senior leaders are with other mid level leaders (like Poe's character) they always ensured their mid level leaders had a basic idea of the plan to ensure they believed it would work. Holdo showed none of this trust and was overly and unnecessarily secretive. Holdo character showed no trust in anyone which made her look very weak as a leader but this did make a good plot twist for Poe's rightly actions later (I found this twist distracting from the story). Rian Johnson, next time make sure you have a military advisor on your staff. It will make your film much better. Poe....I was very disappointed with the direction this character went. Poe was established as valued and trusted member of the resistance. He has followers that respect him to the point they would follow him to their deaths if needed. While they do show him as a little bit of a 'lose cannon' which Leia reels him in, the fact that he is callously ignored by other leadership clearly shows a lack of teamwork and disdain for what his character can provide (until Leia returns to command) is nearly shocking. Additionally, very bad for military morale (Rian, get a military advisor next time!)Kylo Ren....This character has so much potential but is not explained well at all. We know where he came from and the source of his power, but we don't know why he is obsessed with the dark side. Rian seems to try to explain it with the retelling of Luke's mistake but Rian does not seem to give us the core reason. This is again very important in the Star Wars universe that Rian seems to ignore. The source of evil needs to identified to the light or good side so they have a target to eliminate. The battle scene with the Dreadnought....Okay, this where the scientist in me nearly had a conniption! First the bombers are way to slow for a fast paced and advanced space battle. Bombers today make the bombers in this film look as maneuverable as hot air blimps. Second, you are in space, you don't 'drop' bombs. They have to have some sort of propulsion to move. (again, you need a military advisor and in this case, a scientific advisor as well).The utter disrespect for the Star War cannon....This can be summed up in Rian Johnson not really understanding what Jedi are. In all previous films, Jedi strength is passed down via genetics. Meaning you have to have either a father or mother with a preponderance of Jedi traits present. For the raw power which Rey possesses, you have to be descended from a very powerful Jedi line. In this point at time, that means she would need to be a Skywalker. The only other way would be for the force itself to create a 'vergence' to create Rey as was the case with Anakin which was set in 'The Phantom Menace' (I don't like this too much but it was the precedent set by George Lucas so it needs to be respected!). Rian Johnson blatantly thumbs his nose at this precedent indicating Rey's parents were unremarkable and insignificant to the story. This is an unforgivable break with the Star Wars cannon. This is disrespect for the canon is further shown by Rian Johnson with the death of Luke (which occurs due to, admittedly, one of the most incredible feats of Jedi power by anyone). However, Luke's passing leaves a massive problem for J.J. Abrams in the Episode IX. How does Rey learn to use her power? In all previous Star Wars films, there is ALWAYS a Master to teach the apprentice. A teacher, mentor and guide is absolutely required to guide Rey on her journey. One of the guiding principals Star Wars taught is EVERYONE needs a teacher, mentor and guide so they grow and learn to control their frightening power. So this leaves a very important question, how is Rey going to learn? Hopefully they will not imbue her with miraculous virtue. When one has this much power, it must be tempered with experience, otherwise, the wielder will become corrupted (just a fact of life, power corrupts without guidance!). It does not matter who you are. If this is the direction they take in Episode IX, the film with make Rey 'god like' which would be the ultimate show of disrespect to the Star Wars canon. I do not envy the task J.J. Abrams has in cleaning up the mess Rian created. All of these issues now cause some of the other issues with 'The Force Awakens' which were relatively minor then but now look much more problematic. First; how did the First Order gain such a large army, navy, equipment and personnel under the New Republic's nose? How is that possible if the New Republic was the ruling body? Why would the New Republic let the First Order develop so much when they were such a threat? Second, why would the New Republic keep their entire fleet in the inner systems? This is foolish thinking many many levels worse than the mistakes made at Pearl Harbor in 1941. There has to be some significant remnants of the New Republic fleet out there. It make zero sense all the fleet would have been destroyed by Star Killer base in one shot. I could go on for hours but I have hit the main points with this film. As a life time Star Wars fan, I have to say I was immensely disappointed and in many ways 'crushed' by this film.",1,1,2,26 December 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Not great, but not that bad either
","Bottom line up front: This adaptation of the classic Agatha Christi's book is a decent who done it story and is very exacting in the details. While the film does not seem to follow the original book too well it still follows the book enough to allow the viewer to be engaged. This film also has a spread of characters filled by many cultures, which Christi did not do in the book, to appease the PC police, it is passable in this case.While I am not an Agatha Christi guru I have read this particular book and felt this film was a decent adaptation to the original story. The detective was exacting and in some ways compelling but that is pretty much where it ends. The suspect's, which many are played by well known actors/actresses are good but felt their talents would have been better spent on other projects. This was evident by the lack of character development in many cases. If the character development had been better I think this film would have benefited greatly but probably would have suffered from time limitations.Cinematography is pretty good and the effects, when needed were well done and complement the film. Plot line follows a Christi like line but does take a few liberal turn to appease the PC police. This is usually annoying but is not as bad in this film.If you are an ardent Christi fan I would avoid this film as it is likely to upset you. If you are a mystery fan more than a Christi fan, you may find this film worth watching.",6,0,1,16 January 2020
Creed II," Recycled plot again but teachs all must have fear, no fear you get hurt
","Bottom line up front: Like other reviewers, I think was rooting more for Drago. Creed goes into the first fight with no fear and not concept of the consequences. Result, he was a serious danger to himself and anyone around him. He then is nearly overwhelmed and must fight his way out. If you liked the Rocky movies, you might like this one. I had a hard time with it.I hope they don't make another one of these. I just don't see the point in a fighter who just 'wants' to fight and does not seem to understand this is not the way to approach this sport. You have to have something else driving you. My take anyway.The directing was good enough to take the characters in the direction they needed to go in order to for Creed to realize he has to have fear but have the courage to face the fear in the end and not be overwhelmed by it. The big difference in this film, Creed's fear is self inflicted as he rushed into the first fight that was unnecessary. No way around it.The Drago family shows some bitter realities of the Russian life and culture but from what I have seen (I have actually been in Russia), it is not the 'common' narrative. Ivan does what a father must and he did what Rocky couldn't do. Viktor was fighting from the same place Rocky was fighting from. While this may not have been the director's intention, this is exactly what it showed.",6,0,1,26 January 2020
Midway," Respect to history good, Acting, okay...Definetly a must see
","Bottom line: if you like historical dramas, you are likely to like this film. If you don't, avoid and save yourself several hours.Spoilers are minor (if you know your history).For intents and purposes, this film does do justice (for the most part) of the account of the Battle of Midway. This is a very fast paced film with little character development. In this case, it really does not need it as the director concentrated on McClusky and Best. This fine but in many ways it may not be needed. Harrelson does a decent job as Nimitz and Quaid did very well as Halsey.As stated above, this a very fast paced film which starts with the reason why the US carriers were not at Pearl on 7 Dec 41, then moves quickly through some other actions to include the Marshalls, Dolittle Raid, Coral Sea and then on to Midway. Considering the amount of action in this film, I feel the Dolittle Rain could have been omitted and the scenes from China should also have been absent. That said, considering there was a Chinese production company putting money into this film, I think directors and writers were forced into this. The main reason I feel the Dolittle Raid should have been eliminated was there was A LOT omitted about the planning from the Japanese side and US side that was very important and the 'fog of war' issues that dogged Nagumo during the battle itself. These issues really could have helped the understanding of the decisions the commander made during the battle.There is on BIG issue I took with the film. During the first attacks on the Japanese carriers, a B-25 was hit and nearly hit Nagumo's carrier, which the pilot was trying to hit the carrier because he could not return to base. The film portrayed Nagumo reactions to the apparent attempt by the American pilot to ram the carrier as a coincidence saying 'Americans are not that brave'. In reality, Nagumos writings indicate that incident shook him to this core and made him reassess US forces as whole. This film did not show that.All that said, this film is very much so worth watching.",8,4,5,24 November 2019
Annihilation," Intresting premise but badly executied
","This film is based on the premise an alien presence, ship or being, which is never really explained, lands on earth and spreads. As it spreads, it creates an area in which every known biological and some physical laws are changed. Why, is unknown. Portman goes in to follow her husband to find out what happened.This is an interesting premise but the film does not explain major points at all and leaves it up to the viewer to make sense of it. In addition, the director chose to constantly jump from the present, to the past and to the future of the story in such regularity that it became extremely difficult to follow. I found myself thinking way to hard to understand this film.Bottom line, if you like films in which you have to think really hard to understand, this one is likely for you. Otherwise, stay away.",3,1,2,28 May 2019
