Catch Me If You Can," A Well-Told Story
","This film was clearly not a star vehicle.  It was three guys getting together creating a solid piece of work.  Spielberg is a great storyteller. No loose ends.  Everything is tied together neatly. Tom Hanks is a good actor making everybody else look good, too.  Leonardo DiCaprio is still growing as an actor and this film catches him in that growth between teenage fame and adult power.  Tom Hanks helps him with wisdom and Spielberg blends the two of them into respect.  It's clear all three men respect each other's work.  I do to.  I smiled throughout the film.  Thanks guys for a great matinee!",10,0,0,27 December 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Whoa is me.
","Whoa is me.  Johnny Depp didn't take this film very seriously.  I know it's not a serious film but actor decisions are and either he or the director made some very bad choices for the Captain Sparrow character. He was so swishy.  Who is the hero in this film?  No one.  I didn't care about any of these people.  In addition, this is a two joke movie: 1) Look mom. The pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight at least 1567 times.  Isn't that fun?  2) Look mom.  An eyeball has a fork in it and it rolls along the ground and it falls out of that guys face and...Isn't that fun?  Nope. It isn't fun or funny or interesting after the first time.  And although the combat scenes are well choreographed - ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!!  I fell asleep twice.  I was sooooo disappointed.  I really wanted to like this film.",3,3,6,13 July 2003
Cold Mountain," Irony and the Fabricated Ending
","I know that happy endings don't necessarily make good literature, that irony is the hallmark of excellence, and that happy endings can be trite and fabricated.  I know these things but I really wanted things to be happily-ever-after in this film.  I think also that endings are always fabricated.  Life goes on in some form while movies and books have to end somewhere, sometime. Anyway, there is a happy ending here that is just as fabricated as another choice. Since all endings are fabricated, why couldn't the author have fabricated differently?",9,1,1,1 January 2004
"I, Robot"," Did I miss something?
","Was something offered in the script to tell the audience why Spooner has a bionic arm?  Did I miss something?  What's the deal with the bridge?  I thought we were crossing into 'Mad Max' territory.  There were some nice surprises in the film that heightened suspense and I'm so grateful this wasn't an all action flick.  They bore me to tears. There was an even distribution of action, detective story, mystery but weak character development.  Although, there must have been just enough to make me like the characters and root for them.  On the other hand, they were stereotypical. I think Will Smith is a better actor than he is directed to be.",7,0,0,20 July 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Middle of the Pack
","Starts slowly but recovers and finishes in the middle of the pack. There are some nice features to this film: inhabiting his younger self, rising action is full of tension, irony is present throughout, all of the loose ends are tied up except for one.Whenever he succeeds at changing the past, his brain changes and heals itself of past memories. He becomes a new person. If he changes so completely why doesn't everyone else change to the same extent? He not only changes his life but every other person with whom he has had contact.True love wins this race with the idea that having never known a person is better than unrequited love or having that person die.",6,5,8,21 June 2005
28 Days Later...," A quick pulse interrupted by fast and furious camera work
","Independent fright films are not my cup of tea but when I read a review that said there was great camera work, a real story line, AND scary, I thought, 'What the heck.  It's summer.  Go for a laugh.'There are no laughs here and this film is truly scary.  I didn't jump out of my seat.  Nor did I jerk, cover my eyes, and knock my glasses off my nose. What I did was grip the arms of my theater seat and I don't think I blinked during the entire film.  This movie had a quick pulse interrupted by fast and furious camera work.  Sound is as important to this film as the visuals. This movie is visceral but also philosophical.  What is survival?  What is friendship?  Who are the bad guys?  Is it possible to love when you're in survival mode?  What is trust? It is dark though and I'm getting tired of films made in the dark.  Film Noir?",8,0,0,28 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Anakin Gives In Too Easily
","I've been disappointed over the years with many of the Star Wars films especially the secondary characters, Ewoks for example. Silly stuff that did not help me suspend my disbelief. The Revenge of the Sith does not stoop to silliness. Thank you, Mr. Lucas. And, because of that I liked it. Ewan McGregor does a little acting at the end. Natalie Portman is radiant but has seriously outgrown the role. It's always a pleasure to see Jimmy Smitz but anyone could have do his role. The one reason that kept me from completely liking this film is the lead character, Hayden Christensen, as Anakin Skywalker. He is very weak, two dimensional and comes off as an inexperienced actor rather than naive Jedi. He has two facial expressions: See-me-smile-because-I-love-Padme and See-me-stare-through-the-top-of-my-eye sockets-because-I'm-moving-to-the-dark-side. He is predictable and boring even though the audience knows what will happen. I would have liked to have seen him put up a much bigger fight before he was taken over to the dark side.",9,2,7,3 June 2005
Bruce Almighty," Fluffy
","I liked this film and I'm not a comedy person.  I like films with some meat to chew on.  This film is a little fluffy around the edges and there is nothing here I haven't pondered before but there might be something deep for the general audience. I was pleasantly surprised that Jim Carrey did not go over the top!  Thanks God.  Of course, Morgan Freeman is good in everything he does.  He is a human, believable actor who is always appropriate.  This is the first thing I've seen Jennifer Aniston in and I liked her scenes with Jim Carrey--they were truly having fun together.  Jim Carrey was handsome, modulated, and mature in this film.  Thanks God.",Null,0,1,21 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," No Loose Ends
","When I saw the third part of this trilogy, I realized it didn't need to be a trilogy.  The second part could have been left out.  It had way too much fighting in it.  I would say the same thing about this one but there was enough plot, setting, and character development to make this the best one of the lot.  While the Fellowship of the Ring laid the necessary groundwork, the King Returns tied all the loose strings together rather nicely.",9,0,0,26 December 2003
