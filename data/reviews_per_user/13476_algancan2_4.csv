Gremlins," No CGI (Computer Generated Image)
",The thing I love in Gremlins is that they created everything by hand. The monsters look very humanly. I mean their movements and their responses to certain scenarios. It really gives the movie a good look.,8,1,2,28 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not Entirely on Topic 'Empire Strikes Back'
","Basically the whole movie was about a general called Snoke ruling The Empire and he is trying to use the power of Kylo Ren. Meanwhile, Rebels are trying to forge a new colony and find a new planet to message other rebels for help on their adventure forming their empire from the beginning. Also Rey travels to the secret Jedi Island in a secret planet where Luke is located at. Rey asks for Luke's assistance on controlling her powers to fight with the Empire. Snoke knows this and connects Kylo and Rey with the force to find Luke and kill him. His plan is to kill the last Jedi and take the whole control around all the major galaxies. After Rey gets her training she goes to meet up with Kylo Ren and change his side. Snoke captures and tries to read the mind of Rey to find Luke's location. Kylo kills Snoke and tries to change Rey's mind and recruit her to his side. Rey refuses and fights with Kylo. And the war continues... All in all, we see many familiar faces in this movie like Princess Leia, Luke, Yoda, Chewbacca and many others. I thought that the visual effects in this movie were great but the storyline is bad and needs more work in my opinion. The concept 'Empire Strikes Back' is nowhere to be seen in this movie. Personally I didn't quite liked it because it seemed childish and a little off story.",5,12,22,14 December 2017
Avatar," People Think This is Creative...
","I actually liked it at first. The CGI effects and graphics were beautiful In my opinion. After watching it for the second time I started to find it 'cliche'. The storyline was bad. But I also don't agree with people who rate it 1. Because this film is clearly not a movie which should be rated 1. Also, this is a 'must watch' film in my opinion because of the major changes in graphics and acting in that time that the movie was published in.",4,0,1,21 December 2017
Happy Feet," Not a Very Good One
",People think that this film is a great animation film but there are many other animation films out there which are way more creative in terms of storyline and characters. I hate to see those films being rated down because some 'kids' didn't liked it or didn't understood it...,4,0,0,21 December 2017
