Hereditary," Really a disappointment
","Like several other recent horror films - 'The Visit', 'The Babadook' and 'The VVitch' among them, this one stars out strongly but drops off sharply when it stops just suggesting what's happening, and crosses the line into being way too explicit about what's going on. When the mystery starts to evaporate and we're watching chalk write by itself or bodies floating through the air, the actors are left looking a little silly trying to make us believe they take this stuff seriously. By the climax what should have been seriously creepy, and could have at least approached Polanski-like levels of dread, only left me wanting it to end so I could go back and look at those amazing miniatures again.",3,1,2,31 October 2018
Quantum of Solace," Big Disappointment after 'Royale'
","This has been a year of huge disappointments for me at the movies. 'Dark Knight' depressed me, 'Crystal Skull' made me want to knife George Lucas, 'Mamma Mia' to poke out my eardrums... And the dozen previews before this one made me want to stop going to the theater at all.The director and editor of 'Quantum' obviously had no idea what makes an action sequence work, what pace is, how to tell a story, or how to make an audience care what happened to these characters. Shots during the action fly by so fast you have no idea what's going on or even where characters are in relation to each other in each scene. However the exposition all drags by so slowly that you lose interest in even trying to untangle the plot. Not that the plot itself is so interesting. Far removed from the careful character work and set-up of 'Casino Royale', 'Quantum' is perfunctory and Bourne-by-the-numbers. It could just as easily have been Craig's last Bond; his 'View to a Kill' or 'Die Another Day', the one that kills off his slice of the franchise and makes the audience want to see someone else take over.The worst offense for me, speaking as a fan who has loved almost all the previous Bonds, is that 'Quantum' is so totally lacking in any sense of fun. This relaunched Bond doesn't enjoy what he's doing, as others before him have, and doesn't seem likely to grow into a man who will. He has no rapport with the other characters, least of all M or the superdull villain, and his motivation to hop from location to location -revenge - is so one-note that I started to miss the complexity of Roger Moore's later work.If nothing else, 'Quantum' should be huge selling point for new Blu-Ray players; I don't doubt it will drive people into stores to buy the newly re-released Bond collection so they can remind themselves what made this series so fantastic in the first place.",1,8,11,17 November 2008
Mamma Mia!," The musical to end all musicals...
","...Because once it's done you'll never want to see another one for the rest of your life.As you watch you won't be tapping your foot, you'll be kicking yourself in the shin so the pain and blood will distract you from your headache. You won't be taking in the beautiful scenery and rambunctious choreography - you'll be wondering how a movie so expensive could look like it was shot on Universal's backlot and choreographed by a straight man. You won't walk out humming the music or singing the lyrics, you'll be cursing the screen and screaming for your money back.I'll put it this way: 'Mame' is better.",1,9,13,11 March 2013
Taken," Miserable...
","Liam Neeson has made so many movies in which he's miserable you would certainly think he'd have the expression down by now. And throughout 'Taken,' even before the action starts, he proves it like never before. From the first frame his face is screwed into a look of discomfort you haven't seen since John Boehner's last interview.There's nothing to say about plot here - or character development, logic, or anything else new to the genre. The movie is as generic and bare-bones as possible: hero, victim, bad guys, death. It moves, and that's good in an action movie, but to say it moves is like saying Glenn Beck cries. Of course it moves. It's supposed to.The better question is whether it's different from anything else you've seen in the last ten years. That is, since digital manipulation of editing, special effects, stunts and now apparently screen writing has become so prevalent. The answer in my opinion is no.It's exactly the same, with the popular new twist added that the hero is completely invincible. He feels no pain, has no emotions, never gets injured, is prepared for everything and can get out of any outlandish situation. So not only is 'Taken' generic (and sexist, and xenophobic), it's also dull and very predictable.Which might explain Mr. Neeson's more incredibly pained on screen expression. Could he be picturing his foreseeable future in movies? Not as the brooding leading man of intelligent, well-written pictures, but as Jason Statham's new daddy.",4,3,7,24 February 2011
Pitch Perfect," The perfect box set
","If you liked 'Mean Girls,' 'Easy A' and especially 'Bring It On,' here is the perfect final movie for that box set you've been building of smart, very well-written, insightful young adult films. Possibly - barely - just a step below the rest in quality because each one had already set the bar so high, but very equal to their attempts to make intelligent comedies in a day when dumb, tone-deaf, and formulaic all rule at the box office. Kendrick is charming and sharp, Wilson manages to wring one more funny variation on her standard character, and Astin more than holds his own as leading man among all the strong women surrounding him. Looking forward to seeing what each of the people involved does next.",8,2,4,6 July 2013
