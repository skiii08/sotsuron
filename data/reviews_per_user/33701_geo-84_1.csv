Mission: Impossible III," So much disappointed
","I was so much disappointed with MI-3. The whole movie is played by 6 actors. But this time - no idea and no concept. Too long 'looking in the eyes' and 'I love you' scenes. Couple of action scenes, but half of the 'impossible' things are not even shown. For example, when TC is picking the rabbit foot - we only get to see how he swings from one building to another to enter the secure area. That's it. In 5 minutes he has it, but we are 'waiting outside'. And finally, it feels like this movie's idea is based on 'Italian job', but the last one is definitely much better.So my advice to you - don't watch. At all!",3,1,3,7 May 2006
