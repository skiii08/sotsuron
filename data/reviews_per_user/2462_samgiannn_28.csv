The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)
","Since the first novel was released in 2008, The Hunger Games series has become one of the biggest YA franchises on the market, and it's been probably the only series to legitimately rival the Harry Potter franchise in sheer popularity. Although The Maze Runner and Divergent have enjoyed enough success to spawn their own film adaptations, neither have been nearly as lucrative as The Hunger Games. The franchise's complicated and timely hero as well as its biting political subtext has attracted many people to the series, and seven years, later the final film has been released to close the series. To get ready for it, I decided to watch the penultimate chapter, Mockingjay: Part 1. After destroying the arena at the 75th Annual Hunger Games, Katniss is brought to the underground District 13 in order to assume her identity as the Mockingjay, a symbol of hope and rebellion for the people of Panem. However, Katniss's hope begins to burn out when she realizes that Peeta was captured by the Capitol and is being brainwashed to convince the people to stop the rebellion. Even as a fan of the series, splitting the final book into two parts felt less like a narrative enhancement and more like an attempt to make more money. Some scenes seemed to drag on too long or be completely unnecessary. The book could easily be adapted into an epic three-hour conclusion and still be effective. There was also much less action than the previous films. However, the action scenes that were present are as poignant and exciting as ever. The series' strengths have always outweighed its issues, and Mockingjay: Part 1 is no exception. Jennifer Lawrence is still mesmerizing in her portrayal of Katniss, and the social commentary is just as timely and striking as it is in the other films. It may feel like too much exposition for the conclusion, but The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a grim and exciting set-up for a hopefully action-packed finale.",7,0,4,24 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
","I suppose I should start calling this 'Confessions of a Star Wars Virgin'... Anyway, I've finally come to the much-maligned prequel series and a movie that gets considerable hate, The Phantom Menace. Maybe because I don't esteem the Star Wars film as the greatest films of all time, or maybe I just have lower standards than most, but I found The Phantom Menace to be the most fun Star Wars movie yet. Yes, there are enormous flaws with Episode I, but like every other film in the series, the good moments don't just excuse the bad; they topple them. The Phantom Menace follows Jedi Knight Qui- God Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they escort Queen Amidala on her travels to the planet Coruscant, hoping to find a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. They also encounter Anakin Skywalker, before he became a Jedi, who appears to have unusually strong powers of the Force. I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie based on how much hate it has received. Being the first movie in a trilogy, The Phantom Menace is going to feature a lot of exposition and many seemingly stock characters. I would hope many of the plot lines and character arcs are continued in the next couple of movies because, but I have to at least give it the benefit of the doubt for now. The movie's good moments made me completely forget many of the bad ones that came before it. The pod race in particular was stunning as well as the final fight with Darth Maul; showing the Jedi in their prime made the lightsaber fights more fast-paced and exciting. Even though I enjoyed the movie, I can completely understand the hatred it has accumulated over the years. If I was a big fan of the original series, and I had to wait sixteen years for this, I would be pretty disappointed as well. Maybe being a Star Wars virgin allowed me to enjoy Episode I more than I should have, but, at least for me, The Phantom Menace was the most visually impressive and maybe even the most fun Star Wars movie yet by continuing to showcase the series' creativity and imagination.",6,3,4,28 November 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)
","First, this isn't a sequel to Cloverfield nor does it take place in the same universe as Cloverfield, so if you go see this, don't get mad that the Clover monster isn't ripping through the city again. Now that that's out of the way, this is going to be a completely spoiler-free review, unless you don't want to know about, um, character names. But seriously, the less you know about this movie, the better, so I'm not going to give anything away that wasn't in any of the trailers. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, a woman, Michelle, gets in a car accident and wakes up in an underground bunker. Her captor, Howard claims to have saved her life and that everyone outside the bunker is dead. Another man is also in the bunker, named Emmet, and tensions arise between the three as Howard becomes increasingly suspicious, and Emmet and Michelle mount an escape plan. While Cloverfield, was an intense, in-your-face monster flick, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a completely different beast altogether. Instead of the vast area of New York City, this movie takes place in the confines of a doomsday bunker, so the scares come from paranoia and suspense than a giant monster attacking the city. All three cast members are excellent in their roles, especially John Goodman as Howard. His awesomely creepy performance makes this one of his most memorable roles. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Galleger Jr. are incredible as well. You may recognize her as Wendy from Final Destination 3. Winstead's character definitely isn't a damsel in distress here; Michelle is crafty and smart like Nancy from A Nightmare on Elm Street. John Galleger Jr. also provides some witty comic relief while also seeming a bit suspicious himself. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a restrained, suspenseful and well-crafted psychological thriller that calls to mind both Misery and The Twilight Zone, and if this anthology series continues, it'll be hard to match the standards set by this and its predecessor.",8,2,4,12 March 2016
The Ring," One of the best American remakes
","I consider 'The Ring' to be a classic now. It's scary, suspenseful, and engaging. The twists and turns of the story keep you guessing even in the slower parts of the film. 'The Ring' is really more of a mystery with some elements of horror than straight-up horror. There are definitely some very scary scenes such as the opening scene and when Samara comes out of the TV, but the film is really about trying to crack the curse. The fact that the main character, Rachel, only has seven days to break the curse adds an extra level of tension. 'The Ring' also has great acting from the entire cast, and the cinematography is amazing. This really isn't the sort of movie that resorts to jump scares and excessive gore to scare the audience; it's all about tension and atmosphere. 'The Ring' is definitely one of the better, if not, the best remake of an Asian horror film. It's really one of the best horror movies of the 2000's.",9,2,2,24 September 2014
Point Break," Point Break (2015)
","I sincerely hope the original Point Break is much different than this lifeless, hippy-dippy, overblown Mountain Dew commercial. I've never seen the original movie, so I have no bias towards it. Based on the movie's own merit's, the Point Break remake is laughably awful. In Point Break, a rookie FBI agent tracks down a group of extreme athletes who go around the world carrying out crimes in unusual and life-threatening ways; they plan to do a series of near- impossible stunts called the Ozaki 8 in hopes of reaching spiritual enlightenment. At least, that was the plot for about ten minutes before the movie devolves into a series of party scenes and surprisingly dull extreme sports clips that could have been easily viewed on YouTube, all set to irritating club music. It takes a special director to make BASE jumping and cliff diving this boring. Ericson Core builds as little suspense as possible in his action set pieces and instead films admittedly well-shot highlights reels for the action scenes. Any sort of suspense conjured up is because of the great cinematography because the characters are so flat and annoying that you almost wish they would get killed off. Everyone in this movie acts stoned out of their mind. All they do is spit faux- philosophical nonsense which gets tiring after the first twenty minutes. It gets laughable towards the end of the movie with lines like 'Ideas are strong. But not as strong as a whaling ship,' and no amount of context will make that line any less ridiculous. The unbearable dialog, muddled plot and dull characters makes this Point Break remake utterly pointless. If you're not a fan of remakes, this will make you reach your breaking point.",2,105,145,26 December 2015
Sleepy Hollow," 'Sleepy Hollow' is good, creepy fun
","Tim Burton put his own spin on the classic short story 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' with the surprisingly good 1999 adaptation Sleepy Hollow. In the movie adaptation, New York detective Ichabod Crane must travel to the mysterious Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of murders that took place there, but realizes the town's dark history and the legend of a headless horseman might be the true culprit. Sleepy Hollow is essentially a highly stylized slasher flicks. There are lots of gory decapitations set against a fittingly Gothic tone, and although it's never truly heart-poundingly intense, there is a great atmosphere and some creepy imagery. Burton does make this movie a bit darker than his previous films (at the time), but there's still a bit of humor in its heart, mostly because of Johnny Depp's role as the Ichabod. Even though it deviates significantly from its source material, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, atmospheric movie",7,1,1,19 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)
","I've finally come to the finale of the original trilogy, and although I still can't say I'm a huge fan of the franchise, I've really enjoyed all three of the original Star Wars films, even if there are glaring flaws that no one seems to talk about. Of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi definitely has the most noticeable problems, but it does end the series in a suitably ambitious and entertaining fashion. In Return of the Jedi, the Galactic Empire is building a second Death Star to finally destroy the Rebel Alliance, and Emperor Palpatine is personally overseeing the project. The Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack onto the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill Palpatine. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker attempts to bring Darth Vader out of the Dark Side of the Force. The action scenes in Episode VI are a bit more inconsistent than in the other movies, but I have to mention the speeder bike chase scenes. It's without a doubt my favorite scene in the series so far because it's so fast-paced, well shot and intense. It was definitely the highlight of the movie. One of the weaker action scenes was a bizarre set piece with the Ewoks. The entire scene was just awkward; I find it hard to believe that a primitive race of small hairy creatures armed with sticks could defeat the Imperial stormtroopers. Return of the Jedi also didn't improve on the cheesy father-son plot from The Empire Strikes Back. Watching Luke pitifully try to convince Darth Vader to step away from the Dark Side was groan-inducing. Nevertheless, the strengths of the Star Wars series are still on full display here. The utter imagination and detail put into the universe is incredible, and the film is just as exciting as its predecessors. Return of the Jedi isn't as competent as the previous films, but it is a satisfying and sporadically rousing conclusion.",7,1,3,27 November 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
","I'm not a huge comic book movie fan, but I have liked the past few comic book movies I've seen (Deadpool, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy...), and I just so happened to find yet another one that I like. Personally, I'm getting ready for Civil War next month by watching The Winter Soldier, and if the next Captain American movie is as good as this one, there's nothing to worry about. In The Winter Soldier, Steve Rodgers is trying to adjust to the modern world until a conspiracy involving SHIELD comes to light, but Cap also has to team up with Black Widow to battle another threat: The Winter Soldier. To me, Captain America has always been the most interesting Avenger because of how he was forced to leave behind his old life and friends, especially his old lover Peggy Carter, and adjust to life in the 21st century. It allows him to be more than just a roided-up superhero with a cool shield, and his struggle with readjustment is explored well in this movie. He also has to deal with a myriad of other significant issues like SHIELD and the Winter Soldier. The political conspiracy plot in particular adds a lot of suspense and twists to the story to make it consistently thrilling while the Winter Soldier provides a lot of great action sequences. His character is mysterious throughout the film, and he's definitely one of the better Marvel movie villains. Captain America: The Winter Soldier should certainly please even the most casual comic book movie viewer with its intense action, great plot and witty writing. I think I might need to binge watch all the MCU movies before Infinity War comes out next year.",8,2,4,27 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002)
","Five movies in, and I think I've finally come to my definitive least favorite of the series. It's not bad, per say, just underwhelming, although it does have an better plot than The Phantom Menace. In Attack of the Clones, the Galactic Republic is on the brink of civil war when several planetary system threaten to secede under the leadership of rogue Jedi Count Dooku. An assassination attempt is made on Senator Padme Amidala, so Anakin Skywalker is tasked with protecting her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi goes to investigate. Luckily, Episode II did deliver on my hope from Episode I in that the plot moves considerably forward, and some of the more notable characters are given more screen time (or less in Jar Jar's case, thank god). Padme and Anakin have a romantic subplot that I didn't mind, and Obi-Wan is always fun to watch, but I thought Anakin's character was much more interesting in this movie. There was quite a bit of foreshadowing of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader that put the prequels into a better context and made Anakin more intriguing. It'd be nice if Hayden Christensen wasn't so awful in his role. Attack of the Clones does succumb to middle-chapter problems at times. There wasn't anything as memorable as the Darth Maul battle in The Phantom Menace or the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi. The fight between Yoda and Count Dooku is pretty cool at first, but watching a little green alien jump around like Sonic got old after a while. Attack of the Clones is still just as entertaining and fun as the other Star Wars movies, even if it's one of the weaker entries.",6,3,8,7 December 2015
Ant-Man," 'Ant-Man' Dares to Be Different
","I'm not one for big action spectacles where we see New York getting destroyed for the four-millionth time, so I'm always a little worried before I go into a superhero movie. Fortunately, Ant-Man dared to be different than the usual superhero flick like the largely overrated Avengers and abysmal Man of Steel by being a heist movie. Ant-Man, based on the Marvel character, Scott Lang has to use Dr. Pym's Ant- Man suit and plot a heist to stop Darren Cross from making more Ant-Man suits. The suit itself allows the wearer to shrink to the size of an ant while their physical strength increases, making them a virtually unstoppable force. The worst thing I can say about Ant-Man is that it's not as neat and controlled as Marvel's best entries. It doesn't match the tight story of Iron Man or the thrilling nature of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it makes up for that by being an incredibly fun and sometimes unpredictable heist movie. A majority of the film is dedicated to showing how Lang attempts to pull of the heist rather than showing non-stop action. It makes Ant-Man feel unique and significantly different than any other Marvel movie I've seen. Most of the action doesn't happen until the final act of the film, but the scenes themselves are very interesting since you see Lang and Cross constantly growing and shrinking. There's also quite a bit of comedy in there, which unfortunately, misses a lot more than it hits. Nevertheless, Ant-Man is an appropriately fun and unique superhero movie that actually tries to tell a story rather than showing fifty skyscrapers fall to the ground.",6,2,7,18 July 2015
The Revenant," The Revenant (2015)
","Loosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman Hugh Glass, The Revenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances yet. The film follows Glass after he is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders. One of the frontiersmen, John Fitzgerald, kills his son, and Glass voyages over 200 miles to exact revenge on him. The Revenant is one of the most violent movies I've seen from 2015, although the incredible scenery and cinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look at. It combines some intense, difficult-to-watch scenes with amazing scenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films I've seen. Leo's committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the best of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the film. The 156- minute running time, relentless brutality and limited dialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish, but The Revenant is a masterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matter's intriguing story.",9,20,37,8 January 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," 'Rogue Nation' proves that Mission: Impossible is unstoppable
","By the time the fifth installment of a movie franchise rolls around, that series starts to show its age. Not with Mission: Impossible, it seems, because Rogue Nation is yet another incredibly silly yet undeniably entertaining entry in the 17 year old franchise that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. This time around, Ethan Hunt is now an international fugitive and must take on his most impossible mission (heh) to bring down the rogue organization Syndicate, who are committed to bring down the IMF. The plot twists keep you on your toes the whole time, and it's really what makes Rogue Nation so thrilling. It does succumb to the normal spy movie goofiness, one time in particular early in the movie that made me shake my head at how ridiculous the whole idea was. The double, triple and quadruple crosses get rather confusing as the plot progresses too. There's never a dull moment in Rogue Nation, a suitably fun and over-the-top summer blockbuster, and it proves that Tom Cruise is an unstoppable action star.",7,0,2,6 August 2015
The Conjuring 2," The Conjuring 2 (2016)
","Three years after he blew the doors off cinemas across the country with one of the biggest modern horror movies, The Conjuring, James Wan comes back with a true sequel to The Conjuring, aptly titled The Conjuring 2. Often, horror sequels try to get too big or too flashy and end up being far inferior to their predecessors. The Conjuring 2 is certainly bigger and flashier, but James Wan has some gift for taking a generic storyline and making it scary as hell. The Conjuring 2 takes place six years after the original film in Enfield, London. It's based on the Enfield Haunting, one of the most well-documented paranormal cases of all time and was labeled 'England's Amityville.' In this haunting the Hodgson family, a single mother and her four children, are being tormented by a spirit and call on several paranormal investigators to help them, including Ed and Lorraine Warren. The case quickly turns into a media circus with allegations that the haunting may be a hoax, and the Warrens have to decide if the kids are playing an elaborate prank or if the Hodgsons are living in a very real nightmare. Being a horror sequel, or really just a movie sequel in general, it's expected that this movie is going to up the stakes and flashy imagery compared to the original film. The Conjuring 2 is no different. There really isn't a scene that's as brilliant as the hide-and-clap game with Lili Taylor from the first Conjuring. However, at a staggering 134 minutes, James Wan packs in a ton of surprisingly durable scares. After a great opening sequence, Wan gives us about 5 minutes to get acquainted with the Hodgsons before already scaring us silly with the first night at the Enfield house. There's tons of agonizingly long tracking shots that ratchet up the tension for an incredibly long time. What's great is that not all of these shots end with a jump scare. Be warned though because if there is a jump scare, it's perfect. There's not a single cheap jump in this movie. The 'scare scenes' themselves are very long; once one of those great tracking shots is done, you'll go to another person for an equally scary scene. Because there's so much suspense and so many scares in the movie, the 134 minute running time never feels too long. It feels just right, although the scares might be exhausting by the end of the movie. Wan also has a knack for making an old scare new again. He can somehow make a tired jump scare scary again, but at the same time, it's not quite as fresh as it was the first time. That's what holds back The Conjuring 2 from surpassing the original film. The Conjuring 2 does have some heart though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great as the married ghostbusters, and the Hodgson family is a likable group of people to hang out with for two and half hours. Madison Wolfe steals the show as Janet, who gets put through the wringer throughout the whole movie. Even if it doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor, The Conjuring 2 is an incredibly scary thrill ride that'll be hard to top this summer. I do have to admit that I did scream very loudly once.",8,2,5,12 June 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)
","This seems to be the year of superheroes vs superheroes with DC and Marvel releasing their tentpoles, Batman v Superman and Civil War, and now Fox has released one for the X-Men with the lackluster X- Men: Apocalypse. In Apocalypse, the world's first and most powerful mutant, aptly named Apocalypse, has woken up from a slumber after thousands of years to find that society is not revering him as a god as they used to. Apocalypse throws a tantrum and assembles a team of four mutants to destroy modern civilization and create a new world order. As the fate of the world hangs in the balance, Mystique and Professor X assemble a new team of young mutants to save mankind. It seemed like having God and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse be the villains would make the movie at least somewhat interesting, but, really they don't do anything for a majority of the 144 minute running time. For most of Apocalypse's story, he's just assembling his team while the Horsemen he's already recruited just sit around while he convinces another mutant to join the group. That's not only an issue with the Horsemen, unfortunately. Almost all of the other mutants, Mystique, Professor X, Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, etc, wait around until something bad happens. There's a ton of interesting characters in this film that aren't given anything interesting to do. Almost all of the mutants spend the entire movie feeling sorry for themselves, and there's really no good action until the very end. Even the final fight scene gets underwhelming at certain points. At times, I felt like I was watching a bad Roland Emmerich disaster flick. One positive is that Evan Peters steals every scene as Quicksilver, giving a great personality to the character. He was the one thing I wholeheartedly enjoyed about the movie. X-Men: Apocalypse has a couple moments of visual flair, some decent action and clear ambition, but its muddled plot and bland characterizations make it a disappointing misstep.",5,0,8,5 June 2016
Everest," 'Everest' is surprisingly emotional and intense
","I might not have been ready for the kind of movie I just watched because this was a deeply emotional and visceral disaster film. I was expecting a little more of a mindless action thriller than the amount thematic depth that I actually got, and it was a very memorable and intense ride. Everest dramatizes the 1996 Everest disaster that lead to the deaths of eight people, and the movie involves two groups that get caught in a violent storm while climbing Mount Everest. It actually takes a while to get to the real meat of the story. Maybe 40 minutes pass before the storm is even referenced, but the movie gets so intense and emotional during the last half that it makes up for the slow pacing of the first half. Luckily, the slower first half allows us to get to know each character, their motives to climbing the mountain and each of their back stories. The second half is so much more effective because of this. One thing that bothered me about the film were these random lapses in time that were distracting at times. One moment it would maybe be 2:30 PM, and thirty seconds later, it'll be 5:00 PM. Some of the transitions just felt choppy, but it's not such a big deal that it takes away from the film. Everest is a movie that grabs you and takes your breath away for 2 hours, and it's one that you need to see in the theater.",7,0,1,26 September 2015
The Witch," The Witch (2015)
","Ever since seeing the trailer a few months ago, I've been dying to see The Witch. It calls to mind recent art-house horror movies like The Babadook and Goodnight Mommy, but The Witch is far scarier than those movies. It's a grim, perverse, and disturbing tale of religious paranoia among a crumbling family that will surely be remembered alongside the likes of Rosemary's Baby and The Omen. The Witch takes place in 17th century in Puritan-era New England. A family is excommunicated from their village and settles on the edge of a vast forest. Soon thereafter, their baby goes missing into the woods, and the family is torn apart by accusations of witchcraft, black magic and possession. From the first ten minutes, The Witch has a morose atmosphere and starts out with an incredibly disturbing scene. The initial shock is carried through the next few scenes which are dialog-heavy and slower, causing the dread to continue to the next horror. The terror never lets up and only amplifies as the plot progresses until the final 20 minutes are agonizing to watch. I could only vaguely tell you how the movie ended because I was watching through my fingers. It's perversely scary. The acting is fantastic from the entire cast, especially from the child actors. They're given heavy stuff to work with and pull it off with unsettling results. Along with amazing cinematography and an ominous score, it'll be difficult to find a better horror movie than The Witch this year. It'll leave you shaking.",10,5,11,28 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)
","It's official; I'm no longer a Star Wars virgin. I have finally watched all six films in preparation for The Force Awakens which I eagerly await with my pre-ordered tickets. Revenge of the Sith is undoubtedly my favorite of the prequels and my second favorite overall, behind The Empire Strikes Back; I was surprised by how much they stepped up their game and ended the trilogy in a darker, more emotional way. In Revenge of the Sith, the Jedi Knights are spread out all over the galaxy leading a massive clone army against the Separatists. Obi-Wan Kenobi is sent to kill the leader of the Separatist Army, General Grievous. Meanwhile, Anakin Skywalker becomes closer to Chancellor Palpatine who is secretly a Sith Lord and eventually leads Anakin to yield to the dark side of the Force and become Darth Vader. Although Anakin's transition to the dark side was only foreshadowed in Attack of the Clones, it is a major theme in this movie and gives the film much more dramatic depth to explore. Watching his mind warp into that of an eventual Sith Lord is almost tragic in context with the rest of the trilogy, and it makes Episode III the most emotionally driven prequel. Hayden Christensen's acting is still questionable as ever, which I blame on poor writing. He has great facial expressions and body language, but the material he has to work with is dreadful at times. Even then, Revenge of the Sith is still a wholly satisfying and terrific ending to the prequel trilogy. From its memorable opening action sequence to the final scene showing Darth Vader's construction, Revenge of the Sith is a thrilling and impressive conclusion to the trilogy.",8,3,6,14 December 2015
The Big Short," The Big Short (2015)
","The financial crisis of 2008 and the men who pulled the strings behind it is a story too crazy to make up, and that's exactly the premise of The Big Short, a lesson in the Great Recession of the United States and a black comedy about the people that caused it. The Big Short starts in 2005 with hedge fund manager Michael Burry who discovers that the U.S. housing market is extremely unstable. Predicting that the market will collapse sometime in 2007. Burry realizes he can profit from the crash by betting against the housing market. His idea is laughed off by major investment and commercial banks, but they accept his proposal, believing the market is stable. From there, Burry's idea is heard by several hedge fund managers and traders, and their profits increase as the housing market crashes. The documentary-style camera-work and dark comedy make this dense subject easily accessible to almost everyone. The film's funnier moments come when some random anachronistic celebrity comes to explain financial terms to the audience, with the best being Selena Gomez. Even with all the black humor in the movie, The Big Short can't help but make you angry at the real-world villains that it's portraying, which is exactly what the movie wants. The Big Short is both hilarious and angering, and while it's obviously not a documentary, it does offer one of the best on-screen presentations of the 2008 financial crisis that is thought-provoking yet accessible.",8,0,0,16 April 2016
1408," 1408 (2007)
","A typical PG-13 horror movie consists of a bunch of dumb teenagers aimlessly running around in their film either trying (and failing) to solve some urban myth or being killed off in the least inventive ways possible. Of course you get the rare Insidious or The Ring, but for the most part, you'll end up with a movie like Ouija or One Missed Call. 1408, however, is the former. Based on Stephen King's creepy short story, 1408 is about an author named Mike Enslin (because it's not a King story if there's no author involved) who writes about haunted houses, graveyards, and the likes. He gets a mysterious letter in his mail one day that tells him 'not to go to room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel'. Viewing this as a challenge, Enslin, who's played flawlessly by John Cusack, finds this hotel and gains access to the forbidden room 1408.The horror begins before Enslin even steps into the room. As he's pacing the halls of the 14th floor, he finds himself back at an empty open elevator, as if the hotel is telling Enslin not to go into the room. Slightly confused, he finds 1408 and walks inside. Mike's first five minutes in the room is rather boring. Nothing particularly supernatural happens until his clock all of the sudden starts playing 'We've Only Just Begun', and a 60 minute timer begins counting down, in response to the hotel manager who says that no one has ever lasted more than an hour in the room. The movie then becomes an increasingly terrifying, non-stop haunted house (or, in this case, haunted hotel room) ride that relentlessly scares the audiences with a growing sense of dread and a very heavy atmosphere. 1408 doesn't scare us with what does pop out; it scares us with what might pop out. If you've ever seen Oculus, this movie is similar to that, only in a hotel room.Being based on a very short story, the structure of this movie is extremely simple. 1408 is a one-man show, and John Cusack is the star. For three-quarters of the movie, it's just him in the room witnessing all these bizarre and scary events. This movie isn't cluttered with unnecessary backstories, side-characters, or plot twists. It's a simple and effective horror movie that leaves a lingering sting. 1408 may not be as ground-breaking as Carrie or The Shining, but this movie is definitely one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date.",7,1,2,9 March 2015
Casino Royale," Casino Royale (2006)
","I'm not a huge James Bond fan, but I like a good spy thriller, and Daniel Craig's Bond movies have been some of the best in the past few years. I went back to his first Bond outing, Casino Royale, which is arguably Craig's best. In Casino Royale, James Bond has been armed with a license to kill and goes out on his first mission as 007 where he must defeat a weapons dealer in a high stakes game of poker. This movie serves as a reboot of the Bond franchise and shows a new story arc for Craig's Bond, so we see a more vulnerable and less experienced James Bond. There are still some ridiculously fantastic action sequences to behold, but it's obvious that he's not nearly as sharp as he will come to be. The action scenes aren't even the best part of the movie though. The second act takes place almost entirely around a poker table, changing from a spy movie to a more contained thriller. It's suspenseful and incredibly well acted. Casino Royale gives one of the more memorable Bond movies that I've ever seen and set up Craig for a great run in the role.",8,1,5,16 April 2016

","The non-fiction novel Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption is an incredibly riveting, moving biography of Olympian and prisoner-of-war Louis Zamperini that I believe is an important book to read. Naturally, a movie based on the book was inevitable; the film adaptation does do its subject justice, even if it's only sporadically compelling. Unbroken is a bio-pic about the life of Louie Zamperini in World War II, whose bomber plane was shot down, and he was forced to survive on a raft for 47 days. He was then captured by the Japanese and placed in various camps for over two years, where he was severely abused until he was rescued at the end of the war. There are a lot of great things about Unbroken: the spectacular cinematography, breakout performances from the entire cast, an explosive opening act and some genuinely moving scenes throughout the rest of the film. Angelina Jolie directs the film in a surprisingly graceful way. Despite some obviously unpleasant war scenes present in the film, Unbroken is a beautiful movie to look at. An opportunity that the film misses, however, is the effects of the war on Louie. His battle with alcoholism and PTSD is never mentioned in the film, and although it would have made the movie longer than it already is (137 minutes), there should have been an emphasis on those ideas. Even if it doesn't resonate as strongly as it should, Unbroken is compelling enough to do justice to its subject matter and a must-watch if yo're a fan of World War II movies.",Null,0,0,11 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)
","Having never seen any of the Star Wars movies (don't kill me, I just wasn't that interested) and another entry coming out in December, I decided to marathon all six of them to prepare myself for the latest chapter. Starting out with the original movie, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. I definitely enjoyed it, but I'm just hoping this isn't the best installment in the series. A New Hope focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. A farmhand named Luke Skywalker acquires droids that have the architectural plans for the Death Star. The Empire searches for the missing droids, and Luke agrees to help Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to get the plans to the Rebel Alliance and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyrannical rule. The only reason I was slightly disappointed by the movie was because the first 45 minutes or so were just plain boring. The initially slow-moving plot and cornball dialog didn't really impress me much. What kept me watching was the amazing set pieces and cinematography; it really made up for the flaws the beginning of the movie had. The last half of the movie, however, is incredibly entertaining, fun and action-packed. The climax especially was breathtaking and impossible to forget. The imaginative world also makes me excited to watch the rest of the series. There were quite a few flaws with the original Star Wars that disappointed me a bit, but once it gets going, A New Hope is an undeniably fun ride that I wish to take again.",10,1,2,27 November 2015
Deadpool," Deadpool (2016)
","I guess if Ant-Man and of all people can get his own movie (and a pretty good one at that), then Deadpool can finally get his own movie. Luckily, Fox bounced back from its monumental flop Fantastic Four last August with the pretty decent R-rated comic book flick Deadpool. In Deadpool, Wade Wilson is a mercenary in New York City when he meets a woman named Vanessa at a local bar. They hook up, and a year later, Wade pops the question with a ring pop which she accepts. Wade then collapses and is later diagnosed with terminal cancer. One night at the bar, he meets a recruiter from a secret program who offers an experimental treatment for his cancer. Wade declines and leaves, but he later reconsiders the offer and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to receive the treatment. The procedure involves getting tortured for weeks on end until a mutation occurs, and Wade is severely disfigured in the process, although his cancer is cured, and he's practically immortal. Wade escapes the facility that looks exactly like the torture chamber in Hostel and vows revenge on the person who did this to him. Oh, and somehow he's aware that he's in a movie. For all its intents and purposes, Deadpool is a very fun and sometimes funny movie, although not all the jokes hit, and it gets a little exhausting towards the end. The ridiculous, over-the-top violence also makes the movie unnaturally entertaining for a comic book flick. Hopefully more R- rated superhero movies are made in the future. Deadpool's ability to break the fourth wall also makes the film more interesting, but it causes the plot to suffer somewhat. A lot of the backstory is told by Deadpool in flashbacks, causing the film to jump around in time a lot. Deadpool may not be the crowning achievement of comic book movies, but it's entertaining enough to watch in the theater. I'm sure it'll be the perfect movie for 12 year old boys' slumber parties after their parents have gone to sleep.",6,2,11,14 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
","Improving on almost every aspect of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back manages to be the rare sequel to undeniably top its predecessor in both quality and entertainment value while still not feeling rehashed. This was the Star Wars I wanted with the original, and it was extremely satisfying. In The Empire Strikes Back, the Galactic empire is on the hunt for Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Darth Vader is chasing Han Solo, Princess Leia and others across the galaxy, Luke studies the force under Jedi Master Yoda. Structurally, the film isn't as controlled as A New Hope, featuring long action scenes intertwined with dialog-heavy scenes of characterization, but that's an easily forgiven issue. The intense action scenes and darker plot make this a more involving film than its predecessor, and the young actors seemed a lot more confident in their roles. The Empire Strikes Back is an exciting film from start to finish, especially during the final thirty minutes when Luke faces off with Darth Vader. George Lucas really knows how to make a memorable climax. Although it does get a little cheesy right at the end, The Empire Strikes Back is a great improvement to its predecessor, and it set a high bar for movie sequels.",10,1,2,28 November 2015
Minions," Too Much of A Good Thing Isn't A Good Thing in 'Minions'
","If you've ever seen Despicable Me or its sequel, you will definitely remember the little yellow tic-tacs called the Minions. They stole the show in almost every scene they were in, and they were memorable and cute little sidekicks. However, too much of a good thing isn't necessarily a good thing, and the origin story for the Minions is the perfect example of that. Minions shows what those little bananas did before they met Gru as they journey to the International Supervillain Convention in 1968 and become henchmen to the world's most notorious villain, Scarlet Overkill. The issues with Minions are present from the very first scene and continue throughout the entire film. Much of the humor, as agonizing as this sounds, is supposed to come from the way the Minions talk. That wears out its welcome extremely quickly as you can imagine. Even the jokes that don't concern the Minions are reused numerous times throughout the film, making this movie tedious and repetitive. That could be somewhat forgiven if Minions had interesting characters or a compelling enough story, but unfortunately, this film has none of that. The Minions aren't exactly dramatic characters; they're always the sidekicks, destined to be overshadowed by the villains they serve. Even Scarlet Overkill is a fairly generic villain. She doesn't have any sort of special powers or a unique personality to distinguish herself from other power-hungry female villains. There's never any sort of drama or development with her character. Now onto the unfocused and rushed plot. If you have the attention span of a goldfish, you might find the plot of Minions to be fun, but anyone else will feel like they're being suffocated by the insanity of this film. This movie just never takes a break. There's never a moment where you can calm your senses from the insanity of the previous scene, and it's not because it's some action-packed spectacle. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to fit as much as they possibly could into each scene so that much younger kids wouldn't be bored. Minions might entertain the least demanding moviegoers and their very young children, but anyone else should stay away from the contrived plot, tired jokes and dull characters littered throughout this movie.",3,4,16,11 July 2015
Spectre," Spectre (2015)
","Coming after a film as good as Skyfall as well as this summer's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is going to be difficult for the next Bond film. There are some impossibly high standards that will have to be met for people to be satisfied. Spectre obviously isn't going to be the franchise's next 'masterpiece,' but it does offer a suitably engaging and action-packed thrill ride. In Spectre, M must fight political forces to keep the secret service in operation, while Bond must use a message from his past to find the truth behind SPECTRE. Spectre is much more like the classic Bond films updated for a modern audience. A nail-biting action sequence in a helicopter opens the film in gloriously absurd fashion. Unrealistic? Many scenes in the movie will surely stretch reality, but Spectre is too entertaining and well-directed to really have a negative impact. I also have to mention the beautiful cinematography, which is pretty typical of the Daniel Craig Bond flicks. Spectre, however, has some of the best cinematography out of all the Bond movies I've seen. The film employs a rugged look to fit its locales like Mexico and Rome as well as some shots that look like they were taken straight out of the great Sean Connery Bond films. Spectre is an entirely satisfying, thrilling, beautifully-shot spy film that should entertain most James Bond fans.",8,10,22,8 November 2015
Joy," Joy (2015)
","Jennifer Lawrence made a name for herself by starring in The Hunger Games, and she's easily one of the most recognizable actresses in Hollywood. But what does she do now that The Hunger Games has ended? Her first post-HG project is reteaming with David O. Russell, director of Silver Linings Playbook and American Hussle, which netted her one Academy Award win and two nominations (including Joy). Although Joy wasn't as well-received as their other pairings, it still gives Jennifer Lawrence a movie to carry on her own without a franchise title to support her. Joy is a biographical film about the life of Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop, because evidently she needed a biopic. She grew up in a home where everyone around her had a dead-end job, and her grandmother was the only source of optimism for Joy. By the time she's 30, Joy is a divorced mother of two, working a dead-end job, her parents are divorced but still live with Joy, and her ex-husband lives in her basement. To add insult to injury, her sister constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children. The rest of the film is Joy overcoming these obstacles to become an overnight success with her first invention, the Miracle Mop, and selling the product on QVC. It is one of those inspirational bio-dramas we get a few times a year, but it never feels overly sappy or fake. The real issue is the film's first half which drug on about 20 minutes too long hammering in how much the characters' lives suck. Once Joy makes the prototype for the Miracle Mop and starts her business, the movie's quality picks up immensely. You actually start caring about the characters rather than just saying 'Wow, their lives suck.' The ensemble cast, which includes Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, does typically great work and salvages the movie's slower parts. Joy is definitely one of those movies that you really go see for the cast, but it's often fun to watch Joy's race to the top even if it takes a long time for her to start.",6,6,13,16 April 2016
The Martian," 'The Martian' is the next great space epic
","It seems in recent years that there is maybe one really good sci-fi epic each year. 2012 was Prometheus; 2013 had Gravity; last year saw Interstellar; and this year has The Martian. Each movie has their own distinct style and can be enjoyed for different reasons. Of the four, The Martian is probably the most light-hearted and fun to watch, but don't let my words fool you. There are some insanely intense scenes to be found here. Based on the novel of the same name, The Martian is about astronaut Mark Watney who is presumed dead after a violent storm and left behind by the crew. He actually lives and must survive on Mars for months with meager supplies and his own ingenuity. Ridley Scott directed this film, and he was desperately in need of a success after the financial and commercial disappointments of Exodus: Gods and Kings and The Counsler. Luckily, he delivers one of his most spectacular movies to date that's capable of making you laugh and putting you on the edge of your seat. The final act of the film is particularly nail-biting, drawing comparisons to some of Gravity's most terrifying scenes. But what makes The Martian such a hit is its heart. Besides its great humor and amazing characters, it emphasizes the value and integrity of the human spirit. It may not go into the more philosophical implications of those themes too much, but when a movie is this well crafted, that hardly matters. The Martian is up there with the other great sci-fi epics of recent years, and it's certainly one of the best films of the year.",8,3,7,2 November 2015
