Walk the Line," History of Rock and Roll is Not What you Think
","This is a movie with lots of surprises coming from someone who assumes that Johnny Cash is just a country music and had no idea other than someone with an over-sized guitar and a bass voice. The quality of the movie and the surprise of the beginnings of rock and roll totally surprised me and as a result I ended up watching this movie on the very first day I bought this video four times in a row. So this movie just moved me a lot, and this coming from a person whose favorite music is just only the Beatles! Johnny Cash is not just country, he is in a class unique, combining blues, gospel, Rock & Roll, depending on his music.It is a movie about the early part of Johnny Cash's life as a humble cotton farmer, after joining the Air Force, married, settled down in Memphis, Tennessee to work as a unsuccessful door to door salesman trying to support his family.It totally surprised me that Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins' music has its roots in about the same time during the early 1950s, in the same region, the Deep South, and were discovered by what I call the Father of Rock and Roll, Sam Philips of Sun Records.It also revealed Sam is not only tactful and a visionary but can push people to perform his best and with tact and flexibility. Little did I realized that Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lewis all toured together! I wasn't even aware that both the lives of Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash both got addicted with amphetamines while on this same tour and both suffered greatly, where Johnny Cash addiction was saved by June Carter, while Elvis Presley died without anyone's help.You will learn that Johnny Cash's life was no easy matter either, his first wife can barely control him while it was June Carter personality was a different chemistry altogether, where the little lady through her own morals can achieve such control and charisma over Johnny Cash. There are lots of surprises in the movie, such as promoting his band through a prison and other interesting fact.The movie did eventually revealed that in year 2003, both Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash died that same year, but it is also noteworthy to pay respects to Sam Phillips, who also died that same magical year of 2003 also. It is as if it was the end for legend world of rock and roll and country that year.I highly recommend this movie more than just a mere biopic, while Joaquin Phoenix do resemble somewhat of Johnny Cash, it was Reese Witherspoon that the entire movie is centered. This is a sheer surprise for me as this movie represents the love of Johnny Cash's life for June Carter since his childhood right up decades later in what I believe to be one of the longest courtship uphill battle for June Carter, something so difficult to attain that success only is secondary to him. The fun thing about the movie is that success may be the only thing, but, in the words of Johnny Cash's father that he is just still 'nothing' without a real family or a real love.Therefore the history of Rock and Roll is not what thought to be just Beatles versus Elvis Presley. It is much more than this. It is a movie that had a lot of substance. It is of course non-fiction.",8,0,0,22 June 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Few Movies that Questions Taboo in America
","The movie is a disarming view of a local villager from Kazhakstan who is an absolute fool that somehow exposes the most deepest taboos in America, from feminist, evangelists, gays, blacks etc. He shows the dividing country of U.S. stiffness by exposing his own sense of cultural stupidity. This is one of those rare gems that should exposed America's deepest problems a long time a go and that the idea of 'political correctness' and liberalism is just a pie in the sky. Done quite well in the style of Monty Pythons' movie and a pure comedic movie that I wish should earn an academy award for its disarming honesty - a rare trait in these times and something that should have been done a long long time ago. Only All in the Family came close, but that was just a lip service, here we see a cultural shock, U.S. cultural shock rather than the other way around. Brilliant and unique in its approach, and likely to be of a cult movie in years to come.",10,0,23,24 December 2006
Mission: Impossible III," A More Twisted and Conspiratorial Ending would be better
","This is clearly the best of all Mission Impossible series. Part I was sleepy, conspiracy plans are somewhat too deep, although understandable. Part II was cheesy. Part III is a bit of Saw I but especially Saw II(which is twisted) and makes Hoffman looks good. I mean all movies, villains just look good if they are just twisted enough. I guess this is the key fabric of the movie which gives it it high marks on IMDb with 7/10. The score will go lower later on, no doubt a 6/10, but I am giving this only 5/10 score.Most of the MI: III weaknesses is Tom Cruise's lack of depth and cardboard personality. I cannot but help that Ben Affleck and Tom Cruise acting are just about cardboard as they can get. I have always associated Tom Cruise to that of a used car salesman, or some door to sleezy men's cologne, or perhaps some other jobs that required extreme superficiality. If it wasn't for his portrayal in Rainman, he would just be as obscure as Ben Affleck. All his movies have that trademark. The other actors, besides Hoffman are just the same, with the exception of Fishburne, who is always good in any movie (Star Wars, Matrix) The movie's strengths is that it keeps your attention throughout the 120 minutes something movie. The weaknesses is that it is too techie relying on too many gadgets and other toys to get the job done, unlike Bourne series which requires wit, skill and intelligence. Intelligence is what is lacking in this movie. Only a popcorn and hotdog audiences who listens to iPod while watching MI:III can truly enjoy. It is one of those movie my pet dog and chimpanzee can understand.Apparently the movie tries to copy the shaking cameras from Bourne Supremacy. This techniques leaves me nauseated. The other technique that irritates me a lot is the extreme close up. I can't help but admire sweat glands, dandruff or skin blemishes which is not what I wanted to watch. In fact believe or not, I had a premonition nightmare of this scene where Tom Cruise is chained, with extreme close ups of sweat glands, eyebrow hairs and sweat.The movie could have been improved with a somewhat more twisted ending if Fishburne (this is NOT THE REAL ENDING AND NOT A SPOILER) just say to Tom Cruise, 'Oh about the rabbit's foot we sold it Middle Eastern buyers! Our President of the United States is happy. Your direct supervisor real plan was to dispose of it!' A twisted conspiratorial ending would have been better (to prepare for MI:IV), given the fact that the present George Bush's present popularity (2006) and corruption are as low as you can get! With that kind of a twisted ending, it is a question of patriotism or humanity. These are the most important thing if you work for a spy agency, follow orders or follow your heart. Who is your real superiors, is it the crooked President, or your direct superiors who follows a crooked orders? Or yourself who follows crooked orders and risking your life for something that means nothing to mankind? It is something like overthrowing Saddam Hussien for his oil.It would be much more interesting if the movie plots reflect the current public climate about how the public view CIA, FBI or any other covert operations rather than trying to glorify them all the time. This is the point I want future MI series be shown and I would most enjoy the movie if only it was written in that style.",5,3,7,8 May 2006
Casablanca," Looks like the story was written by a six year old
","The movie is predictable, the lines are predictable, Bogart chain smokes all the time. The ending is predictable. The acting is stiffed. People watching the plane flying over looks like they were acting.I went to comatose over 10 times. Rewatched it by hanging myself upside down with my pet bat and still couldn't feel anything for the movie. I was again forced fed to watch to understand why these monkey brained movie critics liked about the movie and I still couldn't stand it. It is obvious that Ingrid Bergman is running away, and why is it that Bogart don't get a bit suspicious? He could get suspicious and just still like the woman with a double feelings for her by reminiscing that incidence.Oh yeah bitter Bogart, and yeah cynical Bogart became idealistic in the end. And good friend the stupid cop also decides to become idealistic also, but what are the mathematical odds against this scenario? But isn't that stupid? Isn't the ending a bit messy for Bogart and the cop just for just silly women? I mean the ending is so predictable and I guessed the ending of the movie since the beginning of the romance, breakup and welcome back and another (I will not mention the ending)... but you could have guessed.Couldn't the ending be like this: Bogart doesn't even have to sell his entire business - he can just get a partnership and still retain the interests, and what happened to poor Sam the piano player - throw away an old pal and cop and Bogart become fugitive? No way! Even in real life, it would be fair to say that if I were Bogart, I would dump the woman anyway since she had a previous boyfriend. It just not credible. And what to do if Bogart shot the police who tries to inform the authorities? Simple just pay your local cop under the table and it's business as usual.Do you really need to sell the ownership of Cafe Americain? That would be a stupid idea. Even if Bogart was under house arrest, he can still escape and yet still maintain his control through his old pal the Piano player Sam and if that's not possible just get another partnership to run the show. He can also retain control by through his banks and his check signing, etc. without having to be physically present at Cafe Americain.Again poor choices of Bogart a cynical man should have some business shrewdness like him should have been a bit more practical in his business affair without having to sacrifice any idealism for love, romance or anything else that comes his way.Is there other ways to NOT SELL Bogart business? Yes there are other ways. You can lease the business on a 10 year basis with furniture, equipment, Sam the piano player etc. and once the lease is over, he can get the ownership back. Or how about another idea, franchising? Just franchise Cafe Americain to your competitors and collect royalties. I mean there are a lot of ways out here, but no one who watches the movie tries to imagine the best way out for these poor creatures (Bogart, cop and Sam). The cop in the end of the story is very unlikely to run away, but he can be just part of the cover-up. In fact there weren't any witness anyway. And why would he do the cover-up? Simple: he also gets the commissions from the Roulette wheel.Because of the messy ending and see-sawing of story, I can see clearly that the writers were a bit messy and undecided and therefore decide to put every trash into the movie and crossed their fingers, while making sure the main point of the 'fair ending' is o.k. but did not clear all the loose ends.So much for a story that is poorly written! Get real. The story is not even close to realism!",1,30,113,6 April 2005
Minority Report," Great Technically Fails on Logic
","Warning, Spoilers ahead.O.K. I watched this movie over 50 times and I still can't make sense of the story. If I turn off my logic, then it is an enjoyable film.Now let us see, why need a cop if you know the future you can prevent a crime from happening by just stopping ahead of time instead of actual arrest? For example I am planning to go to a shopping mall where a murderer is waiting to kill me. Police warned me weeks ahead of time so I changed my schedule. The police grabs the potential murderer telling him we have to fine you because you were planning to murder. If next time you think of doing this again, we will put you in jail. So you save prison costs. Now remember, these pre-cogs can predict events far into the future, not minutes or seconds, but the next day. How do I know that? The movie said so! They predicted events one day ahead while they were treated at the hospital.The plots that really gets me sick is Agatha, if she is so psychic how come she won't tell John Anderton that Ann Lively is her mother and the police chief is the murderer. She should be able to tell can't she? Or she can't remember her mother? How can even John Anderton ever figure out Agatha is the daughter of Ann Lively? There is no part in the story that reveals that fact? O.K. let us be forgiving about Agatha and assume she knows nothing, she don't even know that the police chief murdered Ann Lively. Now how can that be? O.K. Echo. Well, why don't Agatha tell them those are not 'echo' they are different. Why does Agatha even bothered working for pre-cog? What happens if she dies of heart attack, won't the entire pre-crime police be relying on one woman just a bit too much? Or do they have a low quality neroine in the works to make more of these 'Agathas' and kill more innocent children. Sounds like a catch-22, kill more people to save more people? What a circular logic! Why won't Agatha file a misconduct to police department in censoring her on the account of her 'minority report' and that the pre-cogs are fallible! What is wrong with Agatha? Why bother tell John Anderton's son, when he is already dead????? Is she so fallible, I mean super fallible, so fallible it makes me shame especially in the final seen when police head commit suicide, completely wrong! Now assuming that these pre-cogs have pretty good, as opposed to always perfect in prediction you can make use of their talents. Instead of arresting since you are uncertain a crime will take place because these silly pre-cogs are only 50% right, you can still get a crime reduction by 50% through prevention. How? Suppose a potential rapist which the pre-cog predicts will take place at Hyde Park on 3.00 p.m. They are only 50% correct. So the police goes to Hyde Park at 3.00 p.m. The rapist seeing that changes his mind and quit because the police warned him that he may rape someone so they slapped him with a record of warnings. That is enough to just make him think twice.The other issues I have with this movie is what happens with your ID if you have no eyes. Remember the person who sell John Anderton clarity? He had no eyes. For me it seems the 'chip' implant that the U.S. government currently proposing as part of the ID of all people in U.S. makes more sense than to use eyeball ID! Another silly analogies that I really hate in the movie is when John Anderton throws the wooden ball to the other end where the other guy from the Justice department receives and said something like 'predetermination!' Well I would feign a throw a ball to Lt. John Anderton back and throw it in such a away that he can't catch him and I would yell back 'free will!' What about free will? Didn't that element existed even before the final scenes when the pre-cogs made a terrible price by making the predictions wrong.The other part that incensed me is where the police chief kills the son of John Anderton to 'set him up' in some distance the future. It would have been much easier, assuming the head knows John Anderton could be a headache in the future by just transferring him to another division. Give him a good excuse, tell him his son may be kidnapped if he work for this unit! I mean this crime is way too elaborate! If Agatha truly hates to see the future she could make a wrong prediction on purpose and cause the pre-crime units to be closed for business. There is just a lot of loose holes in the story so many that I will just leave this for now. I mean where is the job satisfaction in lying on water all day and all night? Isn't that slavery or something? Wouldn't your body get swell or rot or something? I give 1 star for cool cars.",1,1,4,7 October 2005
Chinatown," Fritzl Noir Film with a Conspiracy too Big for him anyway
","I won't watch the movie. I won't give you the spoiler of the movie, but I can say that it is a Fritzl noir film (incest) with everyone in the characters not giving key information from the detective which they paid him to hire. Imagine 3 clients from a related group of people hiring Gites. And each of them holding key information and a holds a conspiracy too big to handle. It is actually very easy to write a story with Fritzl type movie with a larger then life conspiracy and a detective who isn't too clear and have no plan. In fact I find it a child's play to write movies where it raises too many questions and nothing can be done about it just to overwhelm the senses. One was that mysterious Hal malfunction in Stanlely Kubrick, although no answer was provided, that was provided by the movie 2010, and 2001 remains somewhat of a mystery. And to make it appear complex is actually easy then to make it simple in any scriptwriting work. While critically acclaimed, because of the secrecy and mystery surrounds the movie, it could be a complete opaque. In any event I don't like the movie because it drags, too mysterious and there's nothing you can do about the crime in Los Angeles. The pass the movie as something you just have to accept. I believe can be done about it, but the veil of mystery is gone. The movie explains nothing and writing this style of movie won't get a blockbuster, audiences and just bore someone to tears. The writing style such as this is also easy to do or imitate and this is not the kind of story writing I like other people to emulate either. It's sloppy work to have any story without a clear story or actions by the characters. It makes for a very sloppy writing and is extremely easy to write. Hence, I find the movie bad. I don't want to see writers getting lazy in writing this Fritzl noir films.",1,11,52,21 March 2009
Star Trek," Terrible Premise
","Wonderful special effects, brilliant camera work, excellent special effects, believable actors to take the place of Shatner, Spock, McCoy, Chekov, Sulu, Scott, and Uhura. Must see and enjoy but leave your brains at home. The story doesn't make sense. Let's just assume that I am a Romulan and knew the boo boo Dr. Spock is going to make. The solution is simple, get the red matter and kill the super nova 129 years before it happens. The retribution doesn't make sense. It won't stop the Romulan genocide. The logic is simple. I am a Romulan, ghastly found error Dr. Spock made and if I killed the planet Vulcan, and Spock (or Ambassador Spock) have not died, he's going to go about making the same boo boo 129 years from now killing the entire civilization of the Romulans. A reasonable alternative is just to kill Mr. Spock, without the need to kill the entire planet of Vulcan. So what happens if entire planet of Vulcan died and I guess the Romulans wouldn't be saved either without an advanced warning. Knowing the entire mess of the story and we wish to mend the stupid things Romulans made by killing off Kirk's father and the planet Vulcan an easy solution is for Spock to show how NCC 1701 can travel to time going back the time where his father was killed, just before so we get a Doppleganger, a twin NCC 1701, but the second ship, knowing Romulans will disable the code to protect the shields to kill the Romulan's waiting to kill the original star fleet. Thus once the Romulans are destroyed, the red matter confiscated from the ship is then used to destroy super Nova that suppose to explode 129 years later and the NCC 1701 thereby goes into the same period, without any event. The End. An uneasy Star Trek saga, a bad premise, an illogical story is not likely is going to sit well with IMDb top 250 movies for long. Since when will these writers get their head straight? 10 for movie, 1 for story line, 1 for premise and 1 for logic. My guess 3/10. Still a must see movie for Trekkies like me despite of a terrible movie's story and a nightmare for me. It's as unsettling as Captain Kirk's death when the bridge fell over him after leaving Nexus. This will be up there with bad story lines as same as other previous star trek. In any event, the Wrath of Khan is underrated and this, overrated, except for the special effects and the notion of time travel, but lacks the obvious logic. A much simpler story Ha Ha Ha is for Mr. Spock to go to planet Romulan and murder baby Nero, then kill off the exploding supernova. Oh hot pancake, the story isn't dramatic.",3,53,82,10 May 2009
Constantine," With Keanu Reeves Acting Lucifer May Not Take Him Either
","This may be the worse Keanu Reeves acting in his career. Even with his acting in a teen movie was more enjoyable than this one. His stone acting looks and feels like watching Thunderbirds on a stringed puppet. The entire movie are too complicated, convoluted, the flow of the story is bad. The writing is amateur the story lack any logic, it isn't even abstract art, its like someone vomited on the story.I just watched the movie today and the entire movie is scratching there head not understanding anything. The only thing that made sense was when the movie was over. My mother slept in deep coma and had to wake her up three times during the movie. By the time it's over. It is clear this is a block-disaster movie.On the positive side, this is a very good movie for students of arts, in reminding them not to write a complicated story with no beginning and a story whose flow is discontinuous. The story could have been written much simpler in terms of making the plot more clear to keep the audiences in suspense. Was there any suspense here? No! Since no one understands, there is no suspense. I in fact, wasn't even aware this was a horror. What horror? Didn't scare me. The cat looks cute, the suicide was nice and clean, and the superhuman strenght to destroy the bathtub didn't impress me, there was so little blood not even enough for a blood exam that Keanu Reeves couldn't possibly need the help of God (from sacrifice) to save his life! I mean this Lucifer, why bother removing the cancer from his lungs! Just give back his life back, warts and all!!!",1,4,23,23 February 2005
Match Point," American Psycho Meets Pink Panther
","This is a movie about a schmuck with all the luck. It is somewhat of a drag to watch the first three quarters of the movie about some snotty rich English family with all those money and connections. You are advised to fast-forward if you just can't stand that part and just press Play whenever you see Nola Rice. Basically that is what I did to drag my own corpse of lifeless body to go through the entire torture chamber. Honestly, the movie could be edited out that rich welfare estate. But still, this would not hurt a movie, much like those porn movie where you have to fast forward also! Basically you will be just as stupid before you came into the theater as you do when you leave it. Therefore it is my point to you to just enjoy the ride. The most important segment of the film that could turn you belly up in rating this movie from 'decent' to one 'of art' is perhaps Nola Rice demands and the Irish cops! The Pink Panther of comedy near the end is the part at least I enjoy the most, it is a comedy of errors, and no doubt, it is probably Inspector Clouseau's wet dream! I thoroughly enjoyed this incompetent cops as funny and refreshing as the Edward Blake's Pink Panther movies. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I press replay at least 4 times and thoroughly enjoyed that segment! I laughed - a rarity these days when you watch a serious drama! Something that only Woody Allen genius could show!You are strongly advised to make up your own ending and decide yourself, if faced with a paradox of getting Passionate love with Nola Rice and a Rich Wealthy wife, when faced with such choice who would you choose yourself. This movie is not going to answer this and I strongly advised NOT to cheat on such exams!For me - my answer is a simple one: Perhaps I would either convert (or proclaim my life long secret to my wife that ) my religion is of Islamic or a Mormon faith, either way, I can get more than one wife! Again not an answer either! The same silly things you would get from the movie, but the big differences is that I am an unknown, and Woody Allen is an established director. Hmmm. Some people just have all the luck, which goes to tell you what this movie is all about!Enjoy yourself, don't take this movie seriously. It is just American Psycho (born into the Corleone's family) meets Pink Panther!",7,1,3,25 June 2006
Capote," Cold Blood Parallels the Murderer and Capote Himself
","The movie Capote was well acted, by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and it represents a microcosm of a small part of his life during the writing of his non-fictional book, In Cold Blood. A large portions of the movie is devoted, somewhat unbalanced look on the murderers, which we only see Capote interviewing only one of the murderers, Perry. While we were left in almost complete darkness, with possible exception near the end of the movie, the other murderer, Hickock. The movie was not clear cut as to why he never engaged in any conversation with the other one. It is obvious that screening time for the other murderer would have helped at least for the audiences to compare the differences in personalities between the two murderers.The movie stresses that Capote himself in a desire to finish his novel had to manipulate the prisoners in a somewhat less than honest confrontation with them to get the story he wanted on the night of the murder. Of course, he had to spend an enormous amount of time just to get that. As a result,he resorted to a somewhat cold blooded method of getting the facts by telling the prisoners false lies and that he is interested in the case, when in fact he isn't. It therefore makes you wonder the parallel of two not so bright thugs who murdered the family in cold blood, were matched with a person who is cold blooded, in a different way concerning the welfare or his actual interest in the two murderers. So in fact we can say the murderers and Capote were both cold blood, but in different way, one is real blood, the other is your attitude.A more direct way to deal with them, but a gentler approach would have worked by bargaining with the prisoner that I will provide you with the lawyer to fight your case, if you please just tell me what happened on that night, and I promise you the information will not be released until the case is over. I think Truman did not try a more direct approach. It would not only save Truman an enormous amount of time, but it is also more ethical and that too might have save Truman's own soul in the future and as a result his own productive output. Who knows? That brings me to the other issue of the problem about that movie, it is whether there is in fact the writing of Cold Blood was responsible for Truman's own demise as implied by the movie. The implication is not that clear cut as that if you read encyclopedia descriptions of Truman Capote. His Grand Party he held was not even emphasized, it just showed him only just a small player, where in fact it is well known that he is in fact a major player. These are some mistakes that I would like to point out, if only the movie can show this casual relationship between the writing of Cold Blood did in fact lead to his demise. I for one still can't see it and his output in writing for short stories and novels does in fact continue right until up to his own death. So the problem of the movie appears to be a somewhat inaccurate portrayal of historical facts with the movie. The movie would have been better if people would have known that he does make himself a bigger than life character, instead of just someone enjoying the party, instead of the Party Master himself.",7,0,1,24 June 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," What the Community are Complaining
","There has been a few edited parts of Terminator done by the internet forum community. So I will address this. The major theme that seems to hit hard and what the community has done was to re-edit the entire movie where the T-X original program was to upload the virus program onto the mainframe as one of the beginning sequences, and her first choice after that was to find John Connors FIRST, instead of running around shooting high school students which is what supposed to be after that. In fact the internet community, and I agree with them, is that Kate Brewster was an absolute drag to the entire movie and as a result was completely removed from the original movie remake done by this small fan community. Most people who are fans of Terminator aren't the kind of people who watch it once or twice, they can watch, 10 or 20 times. Whenever that is done several scenes become extremely irritating, too long or too short. They kind of stand out like a sore thumb. Those include, Arnie wearing Elton John's Sunglasses, T-X machine's breast size increase, and corny lines about 'I like your car/bike', and 'you got a big gun'. Cheesy lines simply won't do. It didn't display any intelligence as 'I'll be back' as in the original Terminator 1 franchise. Overall, if I have to see this movie, I really have to watched the re-edited version (done by myself or community) or it's a torture to watch. The biggest problem I have regarding Terminator 3 are: 1) John Connors is Stupid and way too weak 2) Kate Brewster's a real drag to the entire movie. and 3) T-X machine is too busy killing small cockroaches (e.g. John Connor's friend) instead of trying to find John Connors first or show she was uploading some virus program. The movie, I believe runs too short and the scene where the crane runs demolishing the city is way too long. It's an overkill and cheesy. The decision by Arnie where he wanted to add the extra scene was helpful when his body is crushed through the crane going in the building. Unfortunately the rest of the city demolishing is unnecessary. Kate Brewster scene can be eliminated entirely. There's no place for her in John Connor's life (romance with this woman is out of the question), at least for Terminator 3, because it makes John Connors look like a wimp. This is not just my opinion, but a opinion of a fan community that has to gross out and watch this movie over and over. Mind you, it's a minority who does this, but certain parts really are irritating. How would you like to see Arnie wear Elton John's Sunglasses 20 or 30 times like me? LOL.",5,0,1,19 April 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Great Story, Great Concept, Unethical Ending
","A good movie needs a good premise and a good ending, usually an ethical one at that, such as Casablanca. Apparently these movie director haven't watched Casablanca. All Emmerich's movies have great concepts, wonderful technical excellences, but usually falls apart on the second half of the movie, such as the ending. Anyway this is a movie I am meaning to review desperately and for a long time due to a heated debate with fellow watchers which resulted in me being badly injured from a heated fight as a result of a bad ending! I guess this is where movie review critics comes in to solve problems???**spoilers ahead** Much of the controversy lies in the issue of the ending. Either the theatrical version or the director's cut. The theatrical version had a good ending, albeit an unethical one. The idea can be summed as 'I don't know you, you don't know me so there is no problem.' In other words, 'see no evil and no evil will exist'. The director's cut ends with the leading actor dying in the mother's stomach, so technically he was never born, which is also unethical, because it begs the question that human problems (the Millers) will still continue with him or without him. In other words, the father who made the kiddie porn movie will continue to make it with him or without him. The preferred ending should have been that he goes back to that house, make demands to the father who make the kiddie porn and make a threat not to do it or else he will report to authorities or at least destroy the camera projector anyway. Much of the conflict between Tommy and Evan arises from the fact that Evan had sex during with his sister while his Tommy father filmed the whole thing. Initially he was going to film his own son having sex with his daughter, but since Evan Trebor came, he decided to replace Tommy for Evan. So whichever the outcome, if Evan never knew the Miller family, the Miller's family life would not have gotten for the better since his father would continue making the kiddie porn anyway. Yes the father did mentioned that Tommy was supposed to lead but Evan was replaced the last minute. So the theatrical ending the fact that Kayleigh Miller had a better life and walked passed by each other in New York City was entirely unrealistic. Her life should have been a whore and so is her brother, to that tune anyway. So there you have it, two endings and both endings were unethical since the cause was not eliminated. Just remember that the theatrical ending we see the What you don't know can hurt you, what you do know can hurt you too, but what you can do to stop it at the source of the problem is what makes the difference. The entire problem of this movie actually revolved around a deranged pedophile father, which the movie totally lost focus of, but that is the real source of the problem of Tommy's unusual behavior and which bought about a chain reaction for Lenny murderous ways and his own personal problems. This problem can be resolved if he made some mention near the end of the movie to the effect, 'Yeah, come to think of it all these problems I am having with Tommy and Lenny all came from this crazy Pedophile Father, no matter what I do! Yeah, I better go back and resolved this in a more direct way, but without the dynamite or punish Tommy! How stupid of me!' Perhaps, I should tell the producers, the Emmerich, but then they won't care anyway, but it would be nice to add this addition to the DVD version on the alternate third ending, at least in a storyboard form anyway.",6,1,1,3 May 2006
Batman Begins," Batman the Psycho
","The best part of this movie is they finally got the correct casting for Batman this time. They finally chose Christian Bale the man who played 'American Psycho' and another Orwell kind of movie, 'Equilibrium'.It makes me think they finally got it right for once! Val Kilmer looks like a comedian rather than Batman, George Clooney looked too cool to be a Batman, and others who played the role just doesn't have that chemistry. Michael Keaton as Batman looks too coward and not dark enough and not even close to being athletic.This is the first in a series that finally concentrate on Batman as the real actor instead of the villain. There were many twists and surprises in the casting and this added a great dimension. I mean Morgan Freeman who played Seven, is great in dark horror movie films that required serious tone, while Liam Neeson played well from his Star Wars Episode I. The big surprise that was Gary Oldman playing the good guy for once, really difficult viewing him because you are so use to him playing 'Dracula' or some guy to destroy earth in the movie 'The Fifth Element'. Go this Oldman, I don't know if I should cheer him or be careful of him. He is the nervous element in the movie.The movie is somewhat good in tone, but could have improved on the theme of 'Big Brother', which is a big serious topic in the internet world of New World Order. So the crime scene, the Mafia thing is a bit overdone, but I can take it. The fight sequences were too dark and could not see who is fighting who. The beginning sequences was sloppily done somewhat and the story was a bit too broken with flashback while he is training in the Himalayans. Because of some touches in the movie to New World Order, it would not be surprising that the mainstream media won't like the movie anyway, but most viewers will.Other than this the movie has a great display of realism and special effects was done well enough to believe that it was real enough for the general viewing. The psycho element and realism of Batman is done better than all the previous Batman because all the previous ones were over-the-top.The terrorism of destroying Gotham just doesn't add as to the realism of motive. Most motives in reality is that terrorism is either state- sponsored or a major corporation or consortium is behind the economic gains rather than some wild-eyed crazy religious (or philosophy) as this movie would indicate. Well, who am I to blame? Newspapers been doing that all the time and blaming on the patsy like Lee Harvey Oswald.However, it would have been much more realistic if economic gains were behind the destroying Gotham. An example is the series of James Bond 007 such as the movie Goldfinger.The writers did a good job however in showing the Wayne Enterprises' President were somehow behind the entire 'terrorist act'. Yes, you need TONS of money to finance terrorism and only corporate or state funding is needed for this kind of scale of terrorism.It is somehow eerily portrayed to remind you that the World Trade Center, as the train goes to hit the Wayne Enterprise building for a massive blow up of the city's water supply center. The writing could have been much more interesting if there were a clearer tie up to the President of Wayne Enterprise to be behind the entire fiasco and corruption that Batman and the owner of Wayne Enterprises tries to defend. However, this is the best Batman movie I have ever watched and I can stand the slow and choppy beginning and this can be overlooked on the strength of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman. I do not like the casting of Rachel, she looks like a child to play the part, but this again can be overlooked. Near perfect movie 10/10.",10,2,2,15 June 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Depends on whether you want a good or bad ending
","If you are like me who wants a good ending, then don't watch it. You will be forever disappointed. I mean you will be waking up nightmares after watching it. If you want a bad ending then the movie is for you. There are two camps and it is the movie of the great divide. Most boxing ends with a fairly satisfying ending regardless of the story, whether we speak about Cinderella Man, Raging Bull, Rocky, etc. They are all good. This movie is an exception. I am one of those people with a conscience and this movie totally goes against my conscience. I will not spoil the movie for you and it is a fictional film about an aspiring woman boxer who knocks out opponents in the first round. And if you are like me. I would rather turn off the video, or at least stopped after the second half of the movie and burn the movie. I made a mistake, and this is a warning. This movie should not deserve even to a favorite, if only you know medicine, suffering, and torturing. There is a better ending, and it is definitely not this movie. I made the right decision by not watching in the theaters here. In fact in my locale everyone her hated it and was in a theater for about a week. I wonder why Hollywood love this movie so much. Perhaps they are part of the New World Order, in that case it is perfectly socially acceptable. Sorry for being blunt.",1,7,12,18 July 2006
The Dark Knight," Had to Fast Forward to Watch the Joker
","The movie isn't too much of a blockbuster or anything unique if you took out two face, and the Joker from the equation. It has gotten so boring that the second viewing, I simply can't watch it (unwatchable) that I simply had to fast forward and just look at The Joker. In fact the beginning of the movie, that begins with the robbery is just too much of cliché. Surprise me! This followed by ho hum Bruce Wayne talking to his Butler, and other parts are just humdrum. The only reason why the movie's rating are so high in a 5 minute scene where the Batman interrogates the psychopathic Joker. I think the best part of the movie is actually the makeup artist that makes the Dark Knight like Friday the 13th. In all fairness, this is the only installment of Batman that gives that look and feel of a flick B movie horror, instead of a blockbuster, which I believe a 9.1 IMDb Rating(November 2008)is just a passing fad. I guarantee that it isn't as gripping as The Godfather. A really good dark Batman I believe is the early installment of Batman with the Penguin, which is quite dark. That baby scene when the baby was abandoned into the river and float on one very dark night allowed to float away by their parents just still haunts me. Perhaps the reason why The Dark Knight is highly overrated is the very sad passing away of a really brilliant and promising actor, Heath Ledger. Aside from that, Two face played a fairly good scene, although, I still believe The Oscars should be given to the makeup artist (much like the move The Fly) to give it a look and feel of the only horror movie genre in the Batman series. What the studios are doing I believe is to redefine who is Batman, into horror and psycho (but they didn't they only looked at Joker and Two face completely IGNORING Batman), such as James Bond in Casino Royale, into more meaty type movie such as The Scorpion King genre. I think people today simply got sick and tired of all the polished CGIs and wanted to move to more reality type show, more meat (ala Casino Royale), more horror (ala The Walking Dead) type of movie. In all fairness, the story and directing is woefully sleepy (if it hadn't been for the Joker Scene during interrogation or his blood curdling description of a knife cutting up a smile), it really resembles the same bore I have received watching Angelina Jolie, Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life. Sure all the action sequences are there, but it has been done with outright cliché, that you can just go to sleep as the men jumped from building to building using a wire. Oh I seen that before, I think it was in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, played by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Give me a break. Killing the robbers amongst themselves to reduce their share loot is a stale cookies. Do something different! Batman in this movie needs to be a little maniacal or extreme obsession in getting the criminals, that was the key missing issue in this movie. The other thing I would like to see added is hallucinations of dead innocent people, his father, mother, and perhaps his deadly madness for revenge. This would add a little flavor to the vanilla type Batman. If the directors have lack of imagination, learn that a Batman can have the same craze personality and scenery as that of American Psycho that Christian Bale played in. Haven't anybody learned? At least that would give it a kick. Still, personality aside, the plots and story lines doesn't have the twist and turns and emotional element filled atmosphere as that of The Negotiator, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie needs to have a more convincing story line. Sure, Mafia are competing for territories and robbery is spoiled by Batman. Gee, what else is new. The basic story premise should be changed when the police are the real mafia who used Batman for their own gains would have been more exciting along the lines of 'The Departed' played well by Leonardo DeCaprio. I keep the best for last: the best movies anyone can make is an outstanding premise of the story. The premise of this story is simply Joker wanting to rid of Batman because he is interfering with crime, isn't an interesting premise. It's hardly an interesting story to begin with. Try a more interesting premise: Batman is being used by the police force so that Joker can monopolize the criminal gang warfare. But his methods are psychopathic and strings of 'Jack the Ripper' type horrific murder. Isn't that a nicer premise. Greeks teaches the importance of a good story is the plot. Well the Premise is even more important the plots because the premise is the guiding light to the entire plot of the story.",4,3,7,15 November 2008
Groundhog Day," THE MOVIE on How to Date a Woman and a lot of other things
","This movie is a rare gem. When the movie was first out, no one knew about it. It didn't make a huge fanfare and the Groundhog Day movie never did make it in the IMDb top 250 movies, at least in the beginning.Why this movie is one of my favorite comedy of them all? For one thing, you can watch the movie over and over again and still enjoy it. The making of a classic is it has many elements put into the movie, much like Casablanca, but this is more like Casablanca comedy. What elements does this movie had. It was perhaps the first movie that introduced Groundhog Day originates in Punxsutawney, PA and it is done every year. For Phil it is his fifth time. The second part of the movie is its unique comedy. For those who likes time travel movie - like me (e.g.Timecops,Time Machine, etc.), or those who want to know the future this is THE movie. The third element is a very good question and one that has already effected me as I am actually living in this kind of life (not rich): What would you do if you live in eternity? Would you complain, enjoy, or grow. Phil has been through all the human emotions he can enjoy, from irritation, surprise, being 'God', care little about the future, hate, taking advantage of the future, to finally maturing and growing.The best part of this movie is: This is THE MOVIE on how to date a woman! Really! One of my past time is to read for fun (but not really do it) a great many articles on picking up a woman, using NLP (Neural Linguistic Programming), and other tricks.To summarize in a nutshell how to date a woman is not to view a woman as a GAME (or a prey), or make a Woman your Prize, or try to please her too much. A woman can spot a man's sense of insecurity and weaknesses in a mile! You can use all the tricks of NLP or in simple language, using the right keywords and other robotic movies and she can tell. Evolution of a woman over a man on this area is something a man will always loses. It is best not to try to be something you are not.This movie also tells you of the most common mistakes a man can make with dating a women. The way to date a woman or get a woman to like you is to make you HER PRIZE. And this is clearly shown in the movie. By making everyone like you through all the things you do, develop your skills, get other woman to want you, and she will want you. This theory in dating is the key to success and it is one of the few movie where a totally retarded man (like me) on dating can really learn this movie if one has any understand of what is going on in the movie. It is just more than getting a woman it is the development of a man's own identity and what he does.This movie basic premise is to relive your life over and over again, what would you do if given that chance, variety of emotions in the movie, and the meaning of life, romance and everything all in one. What more could you ask? Repeat viewing of this movie gets better and better. It is the best comedy movie I ever seen. In my opinion, the IMDb ranking deserves to be higher than #179 and it is only recent that this has even made it to the top 250. It should go higher still if people realize the hidden messages of the movie: should you be a cynic or should you view life positively. The screenwriter did not realized they have just wrote a masterpiece. The comedy and everything are unique only to this movie and it is well worth the watch! You won't be bored.",10,0,1,17 April 2006
Pulp Fiction," We Choose Our life but s**t happens then the 'miracle' or 'luck'
","Yes Yes Yes. The movie have a message. If some viewers don't think so! People who watched this movie thinks the movie doesn't have a message. Well, in my locale, everybody seems to agree that it does have a message, but we tend to take things for granted.The life of crime that the two hit-man had a job for two to send the mysterious briefcase (probably gold bars) to his boss. But on the way they encountered 's**t happens'.Basically the one of the hit-man accidentally shot an informant and they had to get rid of the body. However before he was shot, one of the hit-man had a 'revelation' of a 'miracle' and interpreted that this miracle was his decision to quit his job as well as making the 'right' decision in the cafe robbery as well! However lack of sense that is beyond the 'realms of explanation', Jules made a decision not to further his career and his one last job is simply to successfully send the briefcase to his boss.The other hit-man refused to believed it and went to continue his job. That decision was to cost him his life, which was shot by a boxer who decided not take a fall.Perhaps there is a miracle or luck, but we just ignore the 'signals'. Is that true? The boxer, accidentally forget his father's watch, being so superstitious along with his nightmares and flashbacks, his so called 'lucky watch' he had to go back to his apartment to retrieved it. His intuition proved to be a correct one.He knew very well that by going back that he risked his life of being shot by a hit-man who is probably going to kill him in the apartment. But the fact that he did retrieved the lucky watch, he got 'lucky', really lucky. Not only did he survived it, but without spoiling the movie, everything simply turned topsy turvy from bad luck, to good luck and a major reversal of fortune. Something that most logicians would describe as 'impossible'.So basically if anyone would ask, hey guy what's Pulp Fiction movie about? I would simply say, things (s**t) happen, your belief in something can really carry you through inspite of every logical things that could possibly happen. Things will not go as you expect. You will have both good luck and then bad luck. How you understand an event, whether it makes sense or not, will be a correct one, provided that you don't ignore its signals. Sometimes not only God works in mysterious ways, but our own Unconscious works in mysterious ways. Things don't have to make sense as long as it works. I learned that the hard way. Thousands of years ago we can't explain why the water rise with the full moon, but we can always predict it. Today we know why, but that doesn't mean we can predict any much more better than the ancients. You don't have to explain to make anything work, it just had to work.Or in short, Superstitions will happen and it can help you! We leave the explanation later, get results, why can be explained later. Why will not save your life. Results will, regardless of the explanation.Overall a very good movie with a subtle message, which makes this movie my favorite one. Subtle message are powerful, but once the veil of mystery is lifted, all the excitement just goes away. This movie makes this veil difficult to lift and it makes for a classic movie, of the likes of Casablanca, if only they just eliminate the use of vulgar words!",8,0,3,9 July 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Great Concept Sleepy Story - Mainstream Conspiracy Theory
","It was not as exciting as the book where it is page by page thrills. The movie should have been done in an adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock movies. As in all Ron Howard's film, the movie is sleepy at best. I always go to sleep in all his film and the movie tends to be like one of those stagnant films that Ron Howard himself played as Opie in Andy Griffith's Show in a sleepy town. If it had not been for that wide eyed Don Knotts, the television series would have fallen flat. Will, this movie does not have any really great memorable characters like those of Minority Report, the story is slow. I think Ron Howard would learn more by trying to create excitement minute by minute like those of Crichton's books, which are really page turners. For the film it should be like frame by frame thrills. The movie hopes to cash in on one of those 'if you think it is true' but it is really really not then I think Ron Howard made a big mistake. Those movies have a uniqueness in themselves, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Blair Witch project. Of course, he would have improve greatly if he at least make it into some horror like suspense out of this Da Vinci thing. Now for the conspiracy theories, be warned: Mainstream Conspiracy theories have very little truth to them. For a good reason: they are designed for people discredit the real conspiracy theories, which can NEVER be a mainstream and a lot of truth exists, but will always be an underground one anyway. Mainstream conspiracy theory movies include, Mel Gibson's Conspiracy Theories, the Moon Hoax (many of these), and In Plane Site. I am sure this movie will spark debates, so I will clear something here to save your time.Most of these mainstream are designed to discredit them. The more interesting underground conspiracy theory movies that is a lot better are those movies which you know are from Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, Alex Jones, and a lot of others. So don't take these movie other than the art of the movie. Is there any truth in all this? Well just watch the Real Da Vinci code, which is popularly downloaded for free using your own P2P. If you want a more in-depth really eye opening books just download some underground books such as the bible fraud, the God Code, which are most of the times very interesting. Or the conspiracy surrounding the cover-up of the Dead Sea Scrolls, before a couple of really bright scholars finally found it from some 'insiders' who leaked out thousands of those pictures for public viewing. In fact it is a LOT MORE interesting to read those Dead Sea Scrolls because many of these were almost destroyed during the preparation and writing of the bible. And a lot of it was actually omitted. Now this is a place where we can start. Or perhaps look at some underground videos on the origins of the bible where scholars actually showed an exact copy of the story of the bible coming from the pages of Egyptian lores and that was an almost exact copy from the Babylonian ones. Many will miss the point that the bible has something to hide. It doesn't, it just simply left out in history where hundreds of these books were hidden in the Dead Sea for thousands of years to protect historical knowledge from destruction. I therefore salute those who hide them.In summary of the movie, don't take a salt of truth of the movie. If you want to just investigate and get yourself the movie The Real Dead Sea Scrolls or a British documentary the Real Da Vinci Code. Authors want you to believe its real, to get sales no doubt just like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Just sit back and enjoy Ron Howard film. If you haven't fallen asleep in Ron Howard's The Alamo, then you have a good chance to sit this one through.",5,1,4,19 May 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Not as Good As To End All Wars (2001)
","The movie is not realistic and contrived, without going to details, war is hell. In this movie it is not that bad. There are two movies that depict the River Kwai during World War II. One is this movie which was mostly written that is fictitious and I can tell, since bombs of the bridge was not that way. The other is a lot of hell, which is based on real experience, such 'To End All Wars' (2001) which is much more realistic portrayed, such as the amount of efforts required to build the bridge, the destruction of bridge, the clash of cultures, the resulting friendship after the war, and much much more. The destruction of bridge in the real war are often done with planes dropping bombs, the Japanese protect the bombing of bombs by tying up the Prisoner of Wars to the Bridge as well as them standing on them. They never had it so easy.",1,8,24,2 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Anakin's Going to the Other Side is a Joke
","Let me tell you the good parts of the movie. The entire cast of wooden character and robotic script reading is reduced. Lucas clearly did avoided THAT not by asking for the actors to change their bad habits, but by using zoom close ups. Even Yoda got some nice hairy closeups. So we kind of ignored the body language which doesn't exists and look at there facial features talking like Thunderbirds puppets.Now I will not deny this, but you will enjoy the supreme CGI special effects. It has gotten a little clearer and better focus this time. The first two episodes, all the CGI characters looked liked they were Vaseline painted all over the camera lens. This time they did it better, they finally wiped used toilet paper lightly over the thick Vaseline in front of the camera lens. A major improvement.The movie is certain a major improvement in terms of story, dramatization, more modern camera zooming over the last two episodes. What happened Lucas, forgot how to use the cameras during the 1990s? The last two episodes, I and II were clearly a B movie you would watch after Sesame Street had it not been for the CGI geeks. Again it is not that good when compared to Star Wars New Hope or Empire Striks Back. However the lousy Return of the Jedi and this were close. But since there is clearly no acting talent here, the award goes to Return of the Jedi with Harrison Ford great acting.The main characters which we will relish is the drama of Anakin and Padme. Both whose acting you care not what happened to them. O.K. so go do genocide if all I care, let me go brush my teeth.The only two characters who were not main characters that I ended up rooting for were Obe Wan Kanobe and Master Yoda. Master Yoda is a clincher to be nominated the best Actor for 2005. Brilliant, I almost that feeling of bravery. Master Yoda's great acting ability showed acting ability since episode II. Oh, he's just only CGI - or is it the human actors were terrible? The other part of the movie for best acting honorable mention goes to the two little babies. It made me cry. As for Anakin and Padme, I give them the Rotten Tomato Award. I mean even shallow Ben Afleck playing Anakin and quietly serious Matt Damon disguised as Padme would be more entertaining! This is one of those stories that everybody knows how it is going to end. It is one of the movies with the least spoilers. The main suspense of the story is what got Anakin going to the other side.The funny thing is the reason he went to the other side was his love for Padme and his ability to prevent death by going to the dark side. So after turning to the other side he starts killing the young padawan learner (they must be 5-7 years old). The FUNNIEST PART OF THE story that I vomited in the theater just today on May 20,2005 (as funny as America's Funniest Home Video) is with his ability from the Dark Side to give IMMORTALITY. So once he knew Padme DIED, the Sith Lord said, 'oh Padme's dead because of your anger'. Yeah, and after going to the darkie side I STILL CAN'T save Padme's live. Oh well, we can throw immortality out the window! It would have been more convincing in going to the dark side to find Padme died in the hands of the Jedi Knights and he became so angry he turned over to the dark side. Some CGI flashes and things as he is converted would have been more fun, followed by rampage of murder and the allegiance to the Sith Lord after killing the entire padawan learner would have been more reasonable as his revenge.Now let's go to Senator Palpatine. The politics of senator Palpatine's corruption is nothing more than your typical U.S. politician's tyranny. I mean we vote for a leader which we be believe in him and then he turns around and become tyrant leader against our own people. The story line of this is in similar vain of Fahrenheit 9/11. So depending on how you look at this action, you either liked it or you hate it. There is an enormous divide on this issue just like Republicans vs. Democrats. While this scheming of 'conspiracy theory' are something like Nazi that can't happened in America soils or it can and very disturbing. This is a rather controversial topic that Lucas has given in his final Episode III that I am on a great divide. A brilliant political look insight.One of the better movies on politics rather than fantasy. Because of this I am giving only 6/10 because of politics. I would have given a better ratings if it was a mindless Lord of the Rings, Return of the Kings - but then Don't we all? LOTR is in the top 250 of the IMDb movie with the highest rating. This one will NOT make the grade.",5,1,2,19 May 2005
Back to the Future Part II," It's a good movie if you don't mind the Giant plot holes
","If Marty and Jennifer left in 1985 to go to 2015, it would not be possible for both Jennifer and Marty to exist in 2015 since Biff mentioned he never seen a Delorean for 15 years. This means Marty and Jennifer just changed the timeline. The other problem, but not a serious plot hole is him giving the Almanac to his younger self in 1955, which a future has changed, the old Biff should disappeared or something. One exception of not changing the future if going to the future is to view Marty and Jennifer of the future, without physically going there would not have that effect. The original Time Machine movie the man left in a time machine and he was not there in the future, and this made sense. Nevertheless. Back of the Future II is my all time favorite, because of it's intriguing plots concerning changing the future.",8,1,2,11 February 2008
Casino Royale," Autistic 007 is James Bond without the Gadgets
","Bond is not too bright. Get fooled, looses in casino, a terrible driver, slow witted, and plenty of luck. He cannot speak beyond 10 words. Looks autistic. Rainman IS 'James Blonde'. Reminds me of a construction worker ruffian or some football hooligans who likes masochistic sex, instead of the real Bond. Can we learn from him from this super spy? Well yes. Low I.Q., makes mistakes all the time and the only thing he us successful is to shoot guns at something that will explode. He could be an Olympic marathon runner for all I care, but he is no Bond. Where is the suave? I must admit the last Bond film was way too much gadgets. In this movie it is no gadget at all. They are using that Scorpion King formula again, the one movie they done to do away with the Mummy's II special effect. He can easily play James Bond 007 20,000 B.C. for all I care. Matt Damon could easily do a better job then this semi autistic guy, at least he has form and smarts, despite being short, while this guy is just big and dumb. His form of fighting is hardly deadly. He fights like a girl. His form of fighting and his looks reminds me of Popeye. I wished he would smoke a pipe and had Olive Oyl as his girlfriend. He looks more like hooligans fighting in a soccer match. I would have given this movie a much higher score if it was NOT 007. As a 007, you must live on certain expectation, the most important factor of a super spy has smarts, not stupidity. Poisoning him is the easiest thing in the world. Some gadgets are still important in spy business but this guy manages to jump around like a monkey. One was a fat black monkey and this is a skinny blond monkey. A great combination of monkey versus monkey. Ian Fleming is probably turning over his grave if he sees this!",1,23,45,20 November 2006
Up in the Air," the Story is 'pointless'
","The story is about Byran Bingham who works as an outside consultant who fires people for a living because their own bosses don't like firing them. So he makes his living flying from one place to another firing people. The story picks up when they hire a new college graduate, Natalie Keener who is to use the internet to fire people to save money by not traveling. This causes Bryan's own zone of comfort outside down and faced being grounded and thinks that Natalie doesn't know the details of what it is like to fire people. Also along the way, Bryan meets a women Alex, who has the same personality of traveling as he does. Unfortunately I won't mention how the story ends, but it has a couple of loose ends, for instance, during the marriage of one of his sisters, the groom asked him about his own married life, and ask him 'what's the point?' to which he responds that he needs a 'co-pilot' and his life is about getting rid of excess baggage in his life. The story I believes ends being 'pointless'. It would have improved the plane have crashed, got fired, and had sister to support him that he realized that there is more to life then just flying and firing and people are simply not excess baggage and can be as important to you as your hands and feet. At least this story I prefer to end as less then pointless. There's no spoilers here, just my own alternative ending. I feel the story is somewhat empty.",5,7,13,12 October 2010
