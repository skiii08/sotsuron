"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Funny Average
","This is probably one of funniest films I've seen at the cinema for a long time, and plus it's British (I think) and that's always a good sign. It stars Simon Pegg (star of Hot Fuzz and the cult classic Shaun of the Dead) who does another flawless performance playing a guy called Dennis, who has run away from all the difficult decisions in his life, this ends up with him running the marathon to win back his ex-fiancé, Libby (Thandie Newton), who is going out with a fit, rich American bloke celled Whit (Hank Azaria, voices of loads of the Simpsons characters). Most of the film is Dennis training, but that's the best part so it doesn't matter. There are a lot of great and memorable moments, like when Dennis and Gordon (Dylan Moran) his best friend have a hilarious fight, which leads to both of them in a lot of pain. You maybe thinking how I gave it 3 stars with all these good comments, well the fact is that it is an average film, average humour and average romance. The best feature of the film is the cast defiantly, Dylan Moran doing a brilliant performance as Gordon, Simon Pegg doing same as always and Hank Azaria doing a great job acting like an average American rich snob, this film also contains some little scenes with David Walliams and Stephen Merchant.",7,2,5,27 February 2008
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," May as well buy the first one on DVD
","Back in 2004 National Treasure was released; it wasn't bad, as it was something that hadn't been done that well for a while, since Indiana Jones. The sequel is more or so the same with a few tweaks but not many and this time it is even more absurd. Other than that they have kept the same plot line, mainly the same stars and the same outcome, so if want to save money you may as well rent the first one on DVD.The basic story is about this treasure hunter called Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage  Ghost Rider, Leaving Las Vegas and Gone in Sixty Seconds) who is searching for a city of gold  I won't bore you with the details  which is connected to the assassination of President Lincoln in some way. This leads him to break into the Queen's private study in Buckingham Palace, sneak into the Oval Office, and later kidnap the President in search of clues. While being pursued by a rival treasure hunter (Ed Harris). I told you it was absurd.There are good cast members, bad cast members and some that could of done better. Here are the rest of the cast, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Helen Mirren (who must have needed the money), Harvey Keitel and the in my opinion the very under used Justin Bartha who gives the film most of it laughs.Overall the good points about the film is that it's fun, watchable, clever and quite witty at points, provided you don't think about it too much, or haven't seen the first film.. The bad points are that it's almost too absurd, to American for my liking (not that I don't like Americans I just prefer Britain), almost exactly the same as the first one and a few of cast could be better. Somehow this film topped the box office Stateside for three weeks, that's something that Gates himself wouldn't be able to solve.",6,0,2,27 February 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Just a fun film to watch
","Kung Fu Panda - ****Director: Mark Osborne & John Stevenson. Starring: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Ian McShane. Certificate: PG. Duration: 92 minutes. Best Bit: The Escape and Po's training. Worst Bit: had a few corny bits. If you liked Over the Hedge or The Incredibles you might love thisYet again an animation with animals appears on our screens, which is OK as this one features a panda. Pandas are awesome. Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, voiced by Jack Black, who is a fat panda who works in a noodle shop restaurant thing, with his uuurrhhh dad? which is duck. Anyway Po has a dream to be an awesome kung fu master, to fight along the Furious Five and to be taught by the greatest kung fu master in the world - Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman, who is a RED PANDA which will stop you guessing for the whole film. Although there's a slight problem which is the fact the Po has no Kung Fu fight skills and he's fat. Continuing on, the peaceful village Po lives in is in danger, as there is talk that Tai Long, voiced by Ian Macshane, might escape from Prison, guarded by Michael Clarke Duncan. So after some accidents, some training, then some friendship and then some blah blah blah blah You can kind of guess that story line.But you can't sometimes guess why they would do some stuff they do, I mean what is it with that finger hold?First of all the animation, obviously DreamWorks where going for more cartoony look for this film, in which they succeeded. I have to except the character designs where ferpect. I don't understand why DreamWorks have gone through loads of trouble getting an all star cast when only two of the most noticeable stars talk. They had Angeline Jolie, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu (both of which only said about 10 words each). Most of the less known actors got much more dialogue than the big 'uns, like Dan Fogler and Ian McShane that does exceptional as Tai Long and he's English. So basically Jack black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane to brilliant and the rest are OK.To be honest this film didn't have as much gags as I thought it would have, but the gags there where are very very funny. Most of the gags are about the panda's belly, which is totally fine as he's a panda. Some the best scenes are the prison escape, the bridge fight, Po's training and Po's big fight seen.So overall I'm gonna say this is a great film that will make pretty much anyone laugh, with great voice acting and very good animation. I liked it and so should you. SKADOOSH!",8,1,2,20 July 2008
Juno," Guarteed to smile
","Deservingly, this film has been nominated for four Oscars including best picture (maybe) and best leading actress (hopefully) for Ellen Page, and it also has confirmed her status as one of America's best new talents. She is one to watch.First of all it was nice to see a proper title sequence and not just a crappy title in the corner, but that has nothing to do with the greatness of this film. The basic story is about a sarcastic, cynical, tomboyish teen played by Ellen Page called Juno MacGuff, who has sex with her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of Superbad). This gives her an unwanted gift, in a form of a baby. Woops.Juno decides to give her baby to what seems to be a perfect couple of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). It seems to be going smoothly at first but there bumps on the way to the birth.Juno has a strange affect on you when you leave the cinema; the first reason is the fact that you couldn't ask for a better written story that makes you smile so much thanks to Diablo Cody, and secondly you feel that you could walk out of the cinema and you could see Juno MacGuff just standing there, as if she were a regular living, breathing teenager. That's how good Page is. In fact every single performance in this film is brilliant. It was good the way that Allison Jenney character of Juno's step mum, Bren isn't like average whiny she-demon like most step mums portrayed in films, she's far friendlier than you would expect. J.K. Simmons finally gets a role where he isn't a total jerk; instead, he's a sensitive father who truly cares for his wacky daughter. Some of the characters of this film may start off a little un-likable but nearly all turn out extremely likable.Another fact of this film that I normally take no notice of is the sound track which is just perfect, as I like songs with good words; I might actually go out and buy it.I don't think I have ever smiled (not laughed) at a film ever, only Little Miss Sunshine comes close. This film is also very funny with loads of witty lines shooting out of Pages mouth all the time. This really is a wonderful film.",9,3,8,27 February 2008
Ratatouille," Pixar second best film to date
","Pixar have done it again. This is the Second Best Pixar film so far, as nothing beats Finding Nemo. It was directed by the Oscar-winning Brad Bird director and writer of 'The Incredibles', who has created a film with humour, heart and meaning. If you see the film at the cinema it will begin with a hilarious so called 'Pixar Short' called Lifted, that will actually make you cry with laughter. Anyway back to the story, it follows Remy a young and lovable rat with a special gift of hyper smell I suppose and he just loves to cook. He actually loves to cook so much that he ends up putting his huge rat family in danger and ends up in (with some help from his ghostly hero Gusteau, a top chef) Paris the food capital of the world and right in front of Gusteau's restaurant that's being run by Skinner who's just in it for the money not the love of food. Remy then makes a friend called Linguini who can't cook to save his life. So with some amazing discoveries and clever antics, Remy and Linguini run this top restaurant, with help from their staff of course. Then all goes wrong when Linguini falls for one of the chefs called Collette, Remy is fed up with Linguini getting all the credit for his work and worse of all, the food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole Troy, Venus and many films that I am too young to know) that could determine a restaurants future by a few words. Well that's the clever and original story, but what really makes this film shine is the beautiful and absolutely mind blowing animation, the attention to detail is unbeatable and this definitely shows when you see the water in the sewers. This backed up with brilliant sound and brilliant voices from people that I have never heard of, except Peter O'Toole of course who gives quite interesting speech at the end. The message of this film is anyone can do anything if they put their mind to it and it doesn't matter where you come from, which I suppose is true. So overall a clever and warming film for the whole family, with humour that both children and adults will find funny.",8,0,1,27 February 2008
Quantum of Solace," Disappointing
","James Bond: Quantum of Solace - ***Bond is back, and for the first time it's a sequel. This film started out packed with action, with Daniel Craig driving his swanky looking Aston with ease, while being rammed and shot at by several cars and a truck, only for him to come out without a scratch. This basically seems to happen all throughout the film. Which is a let down.The story is defiantly different from other James Bond films, as it's a sequel so it would be and as it leaves off from Casino Royale he's out for revenge, I think. There's not much I can say about the story to be honest, apart from the fact that it's hard to get into, this because it either to simple or it's to complicated that you miss out a lot.Because am a boring person I sometimes listen to the audio commentary on DVDs, it was Gladiator which mentioned that a way of telling if an action film is well made is if you can follow what's actually happening in the scene, which is where Quantum of solace sadly fails.The acting is top notch Daniel Craig does great once again on making a rugged Bond, Judi Dench does great as M, Olga Kurylenko does great as the new Bond girl (in the first film I've seen her keep her clothes on) and Mathieu Amalric also does great as the screaming Frenchman. There was a lot of hype over Gemma Arterton although she was hardly in it, that's not saying she wasn't also great.If you compare Quantum of Solace to Casino Royale, Royale is miles better, and as this is a sequel I will take this into account. Sequels shouldn't get worse, although that seems to happen most of the time. Once again Q with all his gadgets wasn't included in this film, which was a let down as those parts where always my favourites.To sum up Bond, James Bond (sorry) Quantum of Solace in one word that word would be disappointing. Sure it was good but it could of and should have been better.",7,1,1,12 November 2008
District 9," Better than you'd expect
","District 9 (15) - ***** I had read rave reviews on this film so I expected a decent film. It was not what I expect, it was better.The basic plot is that 20 years ago a huge alien ship had hovered and stopped over Johannesburg, South Africa, in the ship there ends up being refugees from another planet. They are then taken in by the MNU who give them an area to live in called District 9. 20 years on, District 9 has become a slum full of crime and fraud; this is when an MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) has been given the task of moving over 1.8 million aliens to a new area. While he is doing this something happens which puts him under extraordinary circumstances, as the MNU may not end up wanting to help the refugees after all.To tell any more would ruin the film, but the story and the script is top notch. It is good in the fact that it is very realistic even with a very unrealistic plot, the aliens aren't all powerful and has very human qualities and the main character reacts incredibly realistically to every situation he is in.The CGI is brilliant and makes the aliens look almost real, even with the surprisingly cheap budget for the film.It is made by the little known director Neill Blomkamp and is based on a short he had made earlier, also as the company which made the film quite small Blomkamp was aloud to choose a little known actor like Sharlto Copley. Who did an amazing job with very realistic reactions throughout the film; he also improvised for parts of the film which most likely help with the realism.As I've go on about this film is very realistic, it makes think if there were alien refugees this is how'd they'd be treated. I don't see this film as a film about alien refugees coming to earth; I see it as a film about how one man copes with extraordinary circumstances.I loved this film and I'd say it is defiantly the best film of the year so far and probably the best film I've seen since The Dark Knight. Go and see this film.",10,1,4,16 September 2009
The Dark Knight," this is a bigger blockbuster than anyone could have believed.
","The Dark Knight Rating: ***** Certificate: 12 Duration: 152 minutes Director: Christopher Nolan Starring: Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman and Maggie Gyllenhaal Best Bit: The Joker Worst Bit: Maybe to talkative at times If you liked Batman Begins and well great films you'll love this.Well first of all I would like to mention that me and my friend where so syked about this film we went all the way up to Birmingham to see it in IMAX!!! (It's like a HD version of the cinema). We live in Exeter. But I think was totally worth it.The film begins with... well I really don't want to say, as its all just brilliant and I don't want to ruin it, but I will say that the story will amaze you, inspire you and captivate you in the film. This film contains everything a blockbuster needs a hero wearing a cape, a demented villain, a bad ass car, a bad ass car chase, gadgets, an all-star stellar cast, fighting and EXSPLOSIONS.Defiantly one of the most noticeable features of this film, is the cast. Christian Bale does fantastic once again in playing a much more physical Batman in this film, Katie Holmes turned down the role of Rachel in this film so she has been replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal who may not be as eye-catching as Katie but makes a much better performance, to be honest it appears Aaron Eckhart has been slightly overlooked in the upcoming of this film, I know he wont be now as he will be giving many people nightmares. So now I come to the late Heath Ledger, so people think that the only reason his performance is getting such good reviews is the fact that he is no longer with us, well they are mistaken, he is fantastic. OK some of the credit goes to the Nolan's for creating such a psychotic and demented villain, but they made a role that needed an actor who could pull it off, and that's just what they got, he is amazing, nearly every scene in this film is memorable.The Director Christopher Nolan is probably my favourite director. He's not only directed the brilliance of the Prestige he's also British, which is an achievement in itself. One thing I have noticed is that he likes casting British or non-American actors in American roles. Yes Christian Bale is British. I pretty sure that this film could be classed as a British film as many scenes where filmed in Britain, many actors are British or not American, the directors British and Michal Caine is in it.So overall the story is top  notch, there's a stellar cast, great action, constant suspense and well this is a bigger blockbuster than anyone could have believed.",10,3,7,28 July 2008
WALL·E," Simply a Great Film
","WALLE - *****Director: Andrew Stanton Certificate: U Duration: 98 minutes Best Bit: WALLE Worst Bit: Seeing WALLE sad If you like PIXAR films you'll love this.This isn't my number 1 PIXAR film (Finding Nemo), but it does star my favourite PIXAR character which is obviously WALLE. He is overflowing with charm.So the film follows WALLE (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) a curious robot who was left on earth to basically tidy it up, as we humans some time in the future make so much rubbish that it covers the land. So while we're up in space living a dream, WALLE is here saving the planet. WALLE was not the only WALLE left on earth, but the others all just weren't like the WALLE I adore. Anyway while WALLE is being his own curious self collecting knick-knacks here and there, a futuristic robot called EVE fly's down from space, and well WALLE bless his heart falls in love with her, and well I don't want to ruin the rest of the storyOne thing I love about PIXAR is that it's not realistic, but its gritty, the reflection of lights are flawless, it's not always full of colour, and when it is its done well, there's no pointless colours, there's stupid multi colour stuff to entertain kids. PIXAR don't make children's animation films. They make Films.It's always surprised me that PIXAR always make films with some of the most creative heartfelt stories ever put into film.As for the voice acting well there isn't much at all. There's the good old John Ratzenberger in there, also there's a brief few words from Sigourney Weaver in there. That's about it.As I have already said WALLE is fantastic, he is likable from the first time you see him. He's not colourful, or super in anyway. He is just likable. The way he does what he's told, but his curiosity makes him look at the world while he's doing it, is brilliantly thought of. You might actually feel sorry for him as he tries to care of EVE. As for the others, EVE is also likable who ends up being just as curious as WALLE (thanks to WALLE), and there relationship is often funny and heart-warming. As for the humans, well personally I thought they were brilliant, they way they're helpless without the help of the robots is great. I loved the part when they all for of they're chairs and flap about like fish out of water.So my final verdict of this film is that it is simply brilliant, there are no flaws that I can real describe. The animation is the best I've ever seen. WALLE is one of the greatest characters ever created. The story is heartfelt and funny. Well done PIXAR for making a film for all ages that is funny, great to look at and contains one of the greatest character created. This may seem strange to say but I've given this film 5 stars because I thought it deserved more than 4. It was special. The thing is my favourite films have that one moment where it just makes you go 'wow' films like Unbreakable and Prestige did this for me. WALLE just didn't seem to have one of those moments.",9,1,4,25 July 2008
