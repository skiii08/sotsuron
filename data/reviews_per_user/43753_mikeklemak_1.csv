Requiem for a Dream," The most disturbing movie I have EVER seen!
","Darren Aronofsky has taken Hubert Selby Jr's novel and turned it into an often disturbing, but always intriguing piece of art. The core characters in this movie are portrayed brilliantly, even by actors one might have thought could not achieve the desired effect. The first thing you notice about this film is the brilliant editing, which is used to convey the drug using. The repetition of sounds and images allow the audience to connect with the characters on the levels that Aronofsky sets out. Also, the fact that the movie is separated into sections, each becoming more graphic, forces the audience to ride the roller-coaster of emotion that the characters experience. Kudos to Jared Leto for shedding any kind of 'pretty boy' image of himself, and to Marlon Wayans for limiting the comedy in his acting. Jennifer Connelly's and Ellen Burstyn's acting was also superb. Burstyn shocks you with the combination of her descent into this drug-filled world, and her decay as a character. I thought that Trainspotting had done it for disturbing drug movies, but REQUIEM makes Trainspotting look like a Disney movie in comparison. I doubt I can ever watch this movie again for the graphic images stay with you long after the movie is over, but I recommend it to anyone who has thought about doing drugs. This movie will definitely dissuade that idea.",8,0,0,12 February 2001
