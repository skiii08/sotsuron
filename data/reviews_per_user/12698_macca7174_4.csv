Minority Report," SPOILERS HEREIN
","This was a lot better than I expected, however there a few major flaws.For example, Andertone was identified and located all over the city by his eyes, so he had them removed. Therefore, I think it is a flaw that he retained his eyes, and used them to gain access to the 'Temple.'Also, but this is debatable, I don't believe that we would have totally abanodoned cars, and other forms of transports totally in fifty years.",6,0,0,1 May 2003
Se7en," 9/10 My only quarrel...
","This was a very intelligent thriller, with a worthy reason for the killers' actions. However, I tried as hard as I could to go in knowing as little about it as I possibly could, and all I knew was that it was about the Seven sins. Even still, I couldn't help but find myself one step ahead of the plot on many occasions. Perhaps I have seen too many of these sorts of films, but apart from that, more than decent.",10,0,0,10 April 2003
Titanic," I hated it then, I hate it still.
","Only the effects redeem this film. From the ultra-quashy, and sickly love story, to the shameless stealing of countless scenes from the vastly superior British film, 'A Night to Remember,' this film is a disgrace. What was James Cameron thinking? Pish-posh... Perhaps if they re-released an edited version, with the love story cut out, and the stolen scenes removed, it could be a good film. For anyone who likes this film, I urge you to see 'A Night to Remember.' (1958) It's listed here on IMDb. Check it out.",4,2,3,24 July 2003
The Truman Show," Genius
","The worst thing about this film is that is was probably the direct inspiration for all the big brother/ reality TV crap that saturates the TV listings these days. But still, it's now a satire. Immaculately directed, with an ingenius script, and Jim Carrey doesn't become annoying after watching it a second time.",10,0,0,18 February 2003
