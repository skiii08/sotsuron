Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Just as horrible as the first one
","I walked into the movie wanting to know how it ends even though I hated (HATED!) the first one. I thought maybe i was over reacting. But i wasn't. After about 20 minutes all the annoying little quirks in this movie gave me flashbacks of the first. Everything about these movies is annoying, from the shitty lines the actors say to the actor's body language and even the sound effects. And then, like the first one, everytime something big happens, which happens a lot, the scene is dragged out for another 10 minutes. These are the first tarantino movies I've ever seen and if all his directing is like this, then something's wrong because these were two of the worst movies i've ever seen. Another thing that pissed me off was that uma is supposed to be a tough ass, indestructible, yet smoot and I HATTTTTTTE when the main character is a girl like this. Its bullshit. Everyone loves this movie and thinks uma is great it in. But...i can't even describe what I wanna say. This movie along with the first is awful. I don't know how so many people buy this rubbish.",Null,0,1,2 May 2004
Pitch Black," Pitch Crap
","During the first few minutes I thought this movie would be great....very differently put together and extremely original which is always good. Of course, like many of the crap films out today, there's always at least one character who can ruin the movie: The prisoner. Of course this guy happens to be strong, invincible...spurting out cheesy lines to make him look like a 'cool' character....then of course, he's the guy who saves the day. One character ruined a perfectly good effort...that's a shame.",Null,0,0,23 June 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Not bad but way too overrated
","This film was by no means bad. It just isn't great as everyone  says. Why are these teen's are whatever they are beating/raping people? They have no motive. They're not poor. they live in a futuristic society without a gov't but that's no motive. And who and why are there cops if there's no gov't? There are so many plotholes in this movie it made me lose any enjoyment. So if there's all these plotholes, then how is this a masterpiece? Cause it's violent and has naked chicks and has one memorable scene(the film/cure scene)? The directing isn't great either. Kubrick definitely improves drastically later on and becomes a phenominal director, but this proves his amaturety at this point. Everything just has a corny look to it. I couldn't take any of it seriously. It was too tedious. This is the kind of movie I'd want to be dark and serious and disturbing. And the cheeze-ball music makes it even more rediculous. The last complaint is the horrible representation of a futuristic society. Some scenes look less futurstic than today's look and other's have an obviously fake futuristic atmosphere. OVerall, this movie is just....stupid is the only word. Not bad. Just stupid. Had it been done in the past ten years by Kubrick, I think this movie could've had much more merit and deserve to be overrated.",Null,1,2,28 March 2004
