"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Run Shaun Run!
","Simon Pegg the amazing and funny actor most known as Shaun of 'Shaun of the Dead' back again in another great comedy with no zombies but playing almost the same lazy and confused character. And that's the great deal of the movie. In 'Run Fatboy Run' he plays Dennis Doyle a man known for running (literally and not literally) away of his problems or his duties. In the case of the movie he walked out of his own wedding leaving behind his pregnant bride Libby (Thandie Newton). After five years he wants a second chance with her and wants to live with his young son Jake but she's already involved with a man, the American and sportiest Whit (Hank Azaria) a guy who loves Marathon. Dennis thinks that this is a competition and he'll do anything to proof to Libby that he's a different man by joining a marathon that's going to happen in London. If you remember Simon playing Shaun, well things are quite the same here too. His character is fat (not that much), lazy, playful, without any discipline and worst he can't barely run for few blocks without getting easily tired but he's going forward, training with his best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran, very funny) and his landlord. OK here comes the criticism. It's not as brilliant as 'Shaun of the Dead' but it has it's good and enjoyable moments. Simon Pegg is always great to see, and you become deeply involved with his mannerisms much because, I think, everybody has something in common with his character here, people always trying to proof something to themselves and to other people but instead he only makes silly and funny things. All of his attempts to run are comical (Wheter running after a travesty robber who stole things of the shop he works as security guard, or whether his first training steps on his street).The casting is good particularly Dylan Moran and Hank Azaria and the guy who plays the Indian landlord. The screenplay is quite good, the writers (Pegg himself included) came up with a good idea (especially towards the ending with the marathon). Very entertaining and with a good soundtrack (songs of David Bowie and Kaiser Cheifs included). But the biggest surprise is to see who's behind the camera directing it: Actor David Schwimmer ('Friends') is the director of this great Brit comedy and he does a marvelous job (he has 2 cameos along the movie but you almost won't find him). 10/10",10,0,2,18 June 2010
Frost_Nixon," Excellent duel of real characters and great performances
","Nixon might had lied countless times but this film doesn't, except for some artistic license or other that is necessary to make the story more spicy or to fill a drama and tension that might have never existed during the famous Frost/Nixon interview. Ron Howard directs 'Frost/Nixon' a thrilling story with the behind the scenes of one of the most famous broadcasts ever presented in television, and that is the meeting between Former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and English TV host David Frost (Michael Sheen) after the President's impeachment. This meeting will be just like a long awaited boxing match between two heavyweights and it will take all of their power, intelligence and courage to make of this event something memorable and it will be memorable. Behind these two fearless men there's a great team assisting, played by Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Matthew McFayden, Rebecca Hall, Oliver Platt and Toby Jones.Transforming a play of success into a film is a very difficult job but writer Peter Morgan adapted it perfectly, with wonderful dialogs exchange between Sheen and Langella and all the actors, balancing drama, comedy, heated discussions, and of course, using quotes of the real interview, one of the most successful events ever presented on TV, very historical. Allied with a magnificent screenplay there's a highest quality of the performances. Langella might sound and look like a Nixon caricature but he manages to portray the President in his emotional and darker sides, a figure that needs to be doing something useful other than just be a retired politician, always in the arena even if that arena is a TV show where he might get trapped with his demons, face to face with the American public. Sheen makes of his Frost a entertaining man who gives a leap into a whole new field (a serious interview with a former president) where he needs to find a way to survive or win what could be the battle for his career, his reputation, but more than that he wants to be a star in America making the interview of the Century. Two men without their masks in front of a whole audience trying to win a battle where the winners are us the viewers delighted with such incredible moments. The supporting cast is top-notch and is amazing to see all of them together in such a brilliant project.Explosive in its content, thrilling in its presentations without losing the rhythm and the movement, 'Frost/Nixon' comes as one of the most absorbing films ever made. It was everything I expected and more! Brilliant! 10/10",10,3,3,1 February 2011
3:10 to Yuma," Even with its flaws this is a truly great Western of the 2000's
","I was quite skeptical in watching the remake of one of my favorite westerns of all time since that was a film in which I wasn't expecting much but gained a lot of surprises. I love it! The 1957 version directed by Delmer Daves, starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, is extremely surprising, tense, perfectly build and very interesting to see. But it turns out James Mangold update of the story was really interesting, very surprising and really great just as the classic. But there's some slips along the way...The story is the same, the approach and how it unfolds in front of you is completely different. The masher and not much frightening villain Ben Wade played by Ford is played like an violent, smart and bloody guy on the hands of Russell Crowe; while the honest and at times peaceful Dan Evans of Heflin is played with the same integrity but more dangerously by Christian Bale. Aside these differences here's the plot: Ben Wade, the most wanted criminal of the west and his team got succeed in another money robbery but after staying on their first stop Ben was arrested by the local authorities. Their decision is to escort him to the train to Yuma, which leaves at 3:10 of the next day. Until then, he'll be on the hands of some Pinkerton guys and of rancher Dan Evans, who joined the team because he needs the reward promised so that he can save his ranch from the control of abusive men. However, escort these man won't be that easy. Ben's group, now led by the creepy and violent Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) will hunt them down wherever they go, leaving a trail of blood on the way. Get ready for the shots, persecutions on horses, and for a frantic cat and mouse game where nothing is predictable and fairness might even surpass injustice when it seems Wade is willing to cooperate with the poor Evans.This is a truly great western as we haven't seen it in ages. The quality of performances couldn't been better, not only Bale and Crowe bring some innovations to the classic roles, but this new version has the advantage in two things in terms of character development and performances. Ben Foster playing the mean Charlie Prince was terrific, the guy has a natural quality of making everyone terrified, and he was more like a villain than Crowe/Wade was. The other great role of '3:10 to Yuma' is the rebel teenage son of Dan, played by Logan Lerman, who helps the almost trained team in their hard duty. Here's this underrated boy who always wants to make part of things along with his father, always wants to pick a gun and do some justice and he's always pushed back, but when the moment comes he's ready for action. The way Logan played the character, with a constant tension in his eyes, a mix of fear and curiosity in what's going to happen next was amazingly great.Now, here comes what's bothered most viewers and myself. We've seen the Wild West in films or tales as being something brutal, violent, no country for weak or dumb men and what '3:10 to Yuma' presents is something that quite gets there but it differs in quality and presentation of it. There's so many inconsistencies, plot holes, absurd things that one might think this was a place for idiotic moves, ridiculous ideas, and intriguing things that could make someone wonder why such things happen and how did it happened. If you don't notice while watching the movie, just take a look at the boards here and see for yourself the amount of problematic things the screenplay has. It bothers me not knowing how can three armed guys let Ben run away, they didn't shoot him because he had Evans gun and he just shot the Indians who were shooting at them; the way they handcuffed Ben throughout the whole thing, allowing him to kill two members of the team, that was awful; and there's plenty of others. All that didn't ruined the movie for me, a movie is more than just little technicalities that can make it believable or not. But the one that really annoyed me was the ending (completely different from the original, in theory they have one little similarity). Why's that? I won't say what happen but I'll justify why it didn't convinced me: 1) it was totally unexpected, okay, sometimes this is good but here it went way absurd what it followed after one principal death and 2) the reason why the ending of 1957 worked was that the whole way Ben had the chance to know what kind of man Evans was, therefore he didn't caused many troubles along the way and go for the train. Let's say, the bad guy has some ethic. Here, Crowe never gets evident or gives a possible, plausible explanation of why he took the train (the film gets a little lousy after that, but nothing that could ruin it). The script tried to sound poetic in this particular moment saying words without speaking, leaving possible interpretations for us but it wasn't that convincing.I enjoyed for its tension, its action, the thrills of great sequences (the climactic final shootout with Evans escorting Ben through a whole city against them is outstanding), the good performances of the cast and for showing that the Western genre hasn't died yet. 9/10",9,1,2,6 August 2011
Mississippi Burning," Outstanding film and a great effort in dealing with difficult themes.
","First of all, let me say that 'Mississippi Burning' is one of my favorite films of all time, I've seen it several times, on several different occasions and periods of time, and it's a movie that always manages to change my view on things. It's funny, it's the same movie but looks like there's something new to be discovered there every time I see it. But what attracted me to write something about it now is the fact of watching it for the first time after seeing the award winning film 'The Help', whose themes are a little similar but the approach given is completely different. Comes as a sad fact that people are running away to see 'The Help' (which is good considering how long Hollywood hasn't dealt with a heavy subject that racism is), taking it too seriously believing it's all truth but they probably never watched Alan Parker's classic.Based on a real case that happened in 1964 'Mississippi Burning' starts with the brutal murder of three young Human Rights activists who were helping the black communities of Mississippi. Later on, the FBI comes to town led by the young and idealist Agent Ward (Willem Dafoe) followed by the veteran Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) to search for the boys in what most people thought to be a simple case of missing person. So, it was the 1960's, lines were divided and racism, lynchings were a common thing back there in the South and here's two agents and part of the Hoover boys trying to change things down there, having a lot of trouble in getting answers about what happened with those activists. While Ward wants to do the investigation by the book, following right procedures and all, the more experienced Anderson is quite the opposite, preferring to beat up suspects or use more unethical methods but always getting what he needs. He's a man that lived in a similar place and knows how things work so he understands he can't smile and be nice to people in order to get what he wants. Different men, clashing at each other from time to time but working on the same goal. In 'Mississppi Burning' we feel outraged, angry, sad with all the hatred whites had for blacks in those days. Prejudice and its roots are difficult to understand, it's something we can't accept and we can't tolerate but the movie manages to give an inexcusable but quite real argument on why it happens. A key moment from the film is when Hackman's character tells to Dafoe a story that happened when he was a child, when his father killed the mule of a black man he knew, after getting sick of hearing his friends teasing him saying that the black guy was more important than he because he had a mule. Hackman concludes with this: 'My old man was just so full of hate that he didn't know that being poor was what was killing him.' Therefore, what we get here is that racism, in most cases, comes from a paranoia that one race must be better than the other, otherwise it'll take advantage of everything that exists. Absurd. Returning to 'The Help' issue, (and I do like that film), I don't agree with that distorted, colorful and very humored presentation of how African Americans were treated in the South, the excess of comic reliefs were too much. The ones featured in 'MB' are quite good and always followed by some tension in the middle e.g. when Rupert quotes to the Mayor Tillman about why he loves baseball as being the only thing where a black man can wave a stick without causing a riot. Sure, we're not getting a truthful full account of what really happened in 1964, there's plenty of fictionalized moments in Parker's film but it's easier to believe in this film than seeing all the humored moments of Tate Taylor's film. On its own, this is a really must-see film even though it's not much of a comfortable watching, it's a true challenge to many of us. Even today I get disturbed with some of the painful moments of it. It's haunting (in a good way). At the same time, there's more cheerful moments that are a great pleasure to see over and over (Deputy Pell getting his beard made by Anderson, best scene ever!). It's an impressive work in its technical aspects, the Oscar winning cinematography of Peter Biziou (an arguable work for many viewers since it's too dark but it reflects the serious subject); editing and sound, the music by Trevor Jones, the words by Chris Gerolmo who made a terrific script. The casting couldn't be better with Hackman in one of his greatest roles, Dafoe, Frances McDormand and the big team of villains played by Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Michael Rooker, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Gailard Sartain and R. Lee Ermey, all spectacular performances.Alan Parker's most impactant film of the 1980's and certainly one of the greatest films of all time, 'Mississippi Burning' might not be 100% real and not being all so truth to the facts but still works to present a dark period of American history. It's a gripping film that should be used in schools and in colleges. A nice suggestion to watch along with 'MB' is the TV film 'Murder on Mississippi' (starring Tom Hulce and Blair Underwood) that recreates the trajectory of the murdered activists. 10/10",10,4,6,5 April 2012
Public Enemies," Opportunity thrown into the wind
","The right director, the right cast, the perfect sets, and a great story to be told for the upcoming generations. Everything seemed great and this film surely looked a promising potential Oscar nominee but something was missing: A good screenplay. As Hitchcock said one time 'The script, the script and the script'. That's what makes a good movie; that's what makes the difference between a memorable movie and a trashy movie. But 'Public Enemies' is not trashy neither is memorable, it is just weak. Weak in almost everything and that lies on the hands of the people who wrote it without thinking on the public. The movie focuses on John Dillinger's greatest moments while robbing banks, escaping of jails and the police, and also his romantic life. This is the villain (here played by Johnny Depp). Tracking this bad guy and many others is FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and his team of young agents. This is the good guy. I just presented these opposite forces of the story because the rest is equal as any other films of the genre even reminding us of another work of director Michael Mann 'Heat' where you have these two guys on the different side of the law fighting each other with all their forces (brilliant film). 'Public Enemies' could have been just like 'Heat', it could have been like 'The Untouchables'. It could have been a memorable film in terms of everything. You may wonder why all this dislike? 1) Weak screenplay, it needed a better development of action scenes, lack of criticism on the main character and a plausible explanation of what they're doing and why they're doing it; a point of view worth seeing was missing here. The whole aspect Mann wanted as letting the main characters been played realistic was totally wrong because in the end of all you can't care enough for these two guys, they're dead on scene, very stone cold figures with no trace of likable things. People needed someone to cheer up throughout the film. 2) a anti-climatic ending; 3) Unrealistic things (such as the guy shot on the head being able to talk who shot him (very laughable scene); 4) it moves in so many different genres, very indefinable; 5) Considering the ensemble casting of this film no actor was outstanding here (except Stephen Lang who was very good); 6) Many of the technical aspects dragged the viewer out of the movie such as HD camera work (for a story set in the 1930's it was a awful aspect); the musical score composed by Elliot Goldenthal was wrongfully played at times and even worst than that he copied himself using a excerpt of his score from 'Michael Collins' (those who have a great ear for music and a good film memory knows that Mann rejected a piece of music of Goldenthal in 'Heat' that was later used at the end of Neil Jordan's film); and some viewers noticed a familiarity with the score of 'The Thin Red Line' so can we say plagiarism? 7) The movie runs for too long, it bores a lot.But it is good for a few things. The art direction and the costumes was interesting to see, very well made; the editing is not that bad as people say it is, it has some shaky camera but it's not so bad. And again Stephen Lang's performance stealing the show of Bale playing a FBI agent. As for Depp, Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Channing Tatum, David Wenham, James Russo and company it was just another film added in their filmographies. Nothing more! Good premise for a film but I didn't involved me. Writers thrown a great opportunity to the wind. Good old times when James Cagney was the real thing playing a truly 'Public Enemy'. 5/10",5,1,1,5 September 2010
127 Hours," A thrilling and real story about a man against himself
","When you go to see Danny Boyle's '127 Hours' you simply have two choices just like the main character trapped in the canyon: or you watch it or leave it behind without seeing a thing. But if you want to see be aware of everything that comes on the story of Aron Ralston and don't expect to find a howling message than the ones given by the main character in some scenes. It's indeed a real story but it doesn't fills us with morals, messages or anything similar which is very common in real life stories. Perhaps the biggest lessons you can learn with '127 Hours' is always bring a cellphone wherever you'll go, and always, always, tell to everyone you know where are you going, just in the case you get lost in the middle of the desert, with your arm trapped in a canyon, without water to drink and other disasters. This is a movie about what happened to Aron (played by James Franco) and all his ways of survival during those five days with his arm stuck in a canyon in the desert without a phone, not able to call for any help and with his water stock running out, and with only had two choices while being there: death a slowly death or cut off his arm with a knife. Second option is the chosen one and is the most awaited moment in the film. The amputation scene (filmed in one take) is frightening with some good sound effects mixed with the background music. Everything is thrilling here, from the minute where Aron's adventure begins up until his tough and difficult moments in the canyon, thinking about his family and some imaginary moments of a future life outside of the canyon, and his moments after getting out of there. This is a one man show and Franco carries the whole film in a heartbreaking performance. A movie depending on his main star is very difficult to be made and to audiences like (being Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away' a rare successful example) but Boyle surely found his actor here. Franco is excellent in the whole drama, he's very believable in the risky scenes climbing the canyons, you really can believe that he's a adventurer (although a little bit silly). But if the dramatic scenes, and his breakdown moments are great and conduces the film, it is a funny and surprising moment that really caught my attention, and that is the 'Good Morning' scene, a hilarious and positive moment where Aron makes fun of himself while in the canyon, creating a TV show where he interviews himself telling his whole situation there. Just a reminder of how positive someone could be even in a dramatic and tense situation, not everyone can do that, and he managed to lighten up the tension of a story that at no point makes us feel distracted, calm, or uninterested. It holds the viewers in the chair at every second, every minute in its short running time.'127 Hours' doesn't want to deliver a message, or be preachy about anything, it's not philosophical. It is simply a real life event that urges the viewers to see the man's struggle in a shocking event where he only has two choices and both of them are not that good and he's the only one who can do something about it. There's a few lessons to be learned here even for those who are not inclined to enter in an adventure in the middle of the desert.Danny Boyle makes of '127 Hours' a triumph in technical qualities, great editing, great music, great sound effects, brilliant cinematography and a powerful performance by James Franco. The final result is a great film about a man against himself in his most difficult and most painful moment of his life. 10/10",10,0,2,14 March 2011
Superbad," One of the most funniest movies of the decade!
","The plot is simple, but what comes in it is incredibly hilarious! Plot: Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) are best friends in their last year at high school. Both are going to college, sadly they're gonna to different ones. And both of them virgins. So in one day these funny and non popular teens want to get laid as fast as possible, joining in some crazy parties trying to have sex with the popular girls of their class. But to enter in this party they need to buy lots of alcohol and with the help of the rejected and nerdy Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his fake ID they're gonna provide everything they can. But it's not that easy, and this three boys are gonna have a lot of trouble and we as audience are gonna laugh over and over again. What makes this movie so good? Anyone can relate to one of the characters easily. It is similar to movies like 'American Pie' but it has some single aspects that really makes the difference. In 'American Pie' movies sometimes there's some unfunny joke, some things that doesn't work all right, maybe a joke was too hard to laugh it and sometimes the characters are quite offensive, not funny and difficult to relate with it. One thing that is dumbfounding in 'American Pie' is this: All of the characters are self confident, good looking boys and they're always on the run trying to get some hot chick. In the real world you really can look at Seann William Scott (Stifler) and thinks 'he could get a girl easily'. With that I point that this movie is not realistic at all. Now in 'Superbad' you have a fat and funny boy with a incredibly taste for dirty jokes; a shy and cute boy with no skills for talking with girls without blushing; and a nerdy with a strange sense of confidence. This three musketeers on a almost impossible task. Well, the reality factor counts sometimes and in this one helped the movie be what it is: real funny!In 'Superbad' 99,9% of the jokes has some original aspect and everything works. The dumb characters and the funny conversations are well written and not a single moment is wasted or not funny. And you can watch it over and over again even knowing everything what happens and still think that this is hilarious and enjoyable comedy. One thing that received the biggest amount of complains on the boards here was Michael Cera singing Guess Who's 'These Eyes'. Many thought that this scene was ridiculous and pointless and all that. Let me say this: people you are SO WRONG about that. It is one of the most funniest moments EVER. Since this is a teenager movie released in 2007 most of the teen audience (I think) really don't know the song and doesn't even know how difficult is to sing it. And one can think: Why he choose this song to sing? I sing better than he but he really was funny doing that, making the sounds of the keyboards and singing badly. Between the funniest and weirdest moments are: Fogell using his fake identity with the name of McLovin; Seth being hit by a car; Fogell/McLovin hanging with the irresponsible and funny cops (played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader); the strange party where Seth and Evan were taken by the guy who hit Seth; Evan talking on the phone with Becca, the girl he desires; the singing moment. I guess everything was funny and I couldn't stop laughing. All the actors were excellent in their parts notably the three boys and the cops. Here you have comedy professionals doing their best. One of the best teen comedies I ever seen along with the John Hughes's films. It really says a lot about teenagers and portrays them with some accuracy I must say. Badass! 10/10",10,2,4,29 July 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Surprisingly Great!
","This is something rare of me saying that a movie featuring a hero is THAT good. I know the characters, although almost haven't watched the cartoons or read the comic books, but I watched the 3 other X-Men films and they're great. With this one I loved everything. The action scenes were incredibly well made, breathtaking, no shaky camera and all of it was involving (my favorite was the last one). And even more rare than my opinion is the dramatic scenes, who were very good too. Everything was balanced here and the result is not disappointing despite some exaggerations. Logan/Wolverine returns (or better, forget everything this movie is about his past) played by the great Hugh Jackman. His story is told since he was a child and then it evolves in his fighting on many wars. He and his brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are approached by a group of mercenaries conducted by William Straker (Danny Huston in the role given to Brian Cox in 'X2'), when something goes wrong and Logan decides to leave the team, while his brother stays with them. The story jumps again, he mets a girlfriend and he's happy until Victor and Stryker reapers trying to convince Logan join a new experiment involving transformation of the mutants power. And then the fights begin...The transformation of Wolverine might have countless clichés but still makes this movie worth watching. The visual effects were right on the target, very well made. The casting was fabulous (even Will.I.Am was great playing a mutant, sort of like the same powers of Nightcrawler). Director Gavin Hood made a terrific job here and I sincerely hope that Hollywood calls him again to make a similar movie or perhaps the X-Men Origins of another member of the team. What else can I say? I really loved it and I wasn't bored at all which is something that happens in some pictures of the genre. 10/10",10,7,11,28 August 2010
Yes Man," Say 'Yes' to this film, you won't regret!
","Here's an interesting case of taking two movies of the same actor, trade a few things to create a third one whose result is quite funny. In 'Liar Liar' where Jim Carrey played an notorious liar who couldn't tell lies after his son's birthday wish. And in one moment of 'Bruce Almighty' when he was given to right to be God for some time, his character answers 'Yes' to the prayers of everybody who asked him something. 'Yes Man' mixed the premise and the moment from both films but this time Carrey has an life changing experience where he'll stop of being an negative person to become an man who answers 'Yes' to everything that comes in his life. Confusion and some hilarious moments are set in a film that must not be taken so seriously.What would happen with a man whose job at a bank consists in saying 'No' to people and who also says this same word to his friends whenever they want his company, if he had to say Yes' for a whole year? What kind of obstacles and/or advantages he would get? After being dragged by an old friend (John Michael Higgins) to an workshop about saying yes to thing and lead a positive life, the dull Carl will see that life might open lots of doors to him but at the same time will put him into an gigantic load of confusion, heartaches, and add things he don't need in his life (or it appears he won't need them but eventually he'll use somehow like learning Corean or learn how to play guitar. Things that only happen in film scripts.)Carrey takes advantage of his enormous variety of facial expressions to compose the troubled Carl while facing lots of misfortunes and disasters in his life, most of them very comical, others a little bit dramatic like when he rescues a man who want to jump to his death. Basically, it's the Jim Carrey we've get used to see, being very funny in ridiculous situations. And the movie comes with an obvious message of knowing how and when to give up from saying 'yes'. Of course a film like this fall into some absurds and some annoyance (like when Carl is arrested by the FBI considered to be an suspect of terrorism) but there is brilliance in this as well (when he's promoted to a higher position in the bank after approving an great number of small money loans or his moments with a girl he meets, played by Zooey Deschanel).It's a nice way to spend the day, there's plenty of good and funny moments. 'Yes Man' has an great cast that includes Danny Masterson, Bradley Cooper, Terrence Stamp (playing the Yes guru), Brent Briscoe and Fionnula Flanagan.And in last case it might change your life, making you being more open and positive about things. The two first steps for it is by watching the film and by giving me a yes in this review. Then, you'll see how easy is to say yes to things. When you say yes, amazing things can happen. 9/10",9,1,1,21 January 2012
Resident Evil: Extinction," Well made but less scary
","In 'Resident Evil 3 - Extintction' Alice (Milla Jovovich) returns for more action trying to lead a group of survivors to find a safe place without the infection that almost destroyed mankind on Earth, now a desertic and apocalyptical place to live among zombies. The third part of the Resident Evil series is more light than the other films, less scary, more funny, with great action sequences and the trademark is present all the time, the famous headshots where you can say out loud headshot after a zombie got killed just like in the video games. The movie is very short, everything goes for an hour and a half, the plot is pretty much what I said and there's not only the zombie danger but also a creepy doctor (Iain Glen) that can control Alice in his new experiment supported by some form of government. Meanwhile Alice teams again with Carlos (Oded Fehr) and his friends on their way to Alaska where it is said that the virus haven't reached. Once again what makes the film interesting in the scenes between Alice and Carlos along with the group led by Ali Larter; the fights and shootouts against the zombies, some moments by the annoying doctor. The best part is definitely Carlos last moment, one of the most honorable moments for a character ever, sad but truth.Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and produced this third film and I really wish I could direct it because I didn't find the tension, the scary things that made the first episode more interesting than this one. I'm not saying that Russell Mulcahy is bad director but I felt that this film is meant to be more like an action work than a horror film and we're talking about zombies, frightening creatures supposed to scare. On the other hand the humor was vital to the film, some quotes and moments were really funny which made of 'Resident Evil 3' a enjoyable film. The movie goes well but not enough to be the greatest of the series. 7/10",7,0,1,16 January 2011
The Expendables," Better late than never!
","The church meeting scene is something action fans all over the world waited for many years to see happening on the screen. Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Willis together in a moment from the same film, something that should have happen a long time ago, way back in the 1990's when they were at the top of their game as the greatest action heroes of the period. It took a long time to get here, to get this brief encounter made reality but better late than never.Made almost with the same extravagance of the 1980's action flicks but not with the same greatness and effectiveness, 'The Expandables' recycles an heavy clichéd plot about good mercenaries taking down from the power a corrupt and tyrannic dictator of a South America country supported by a CIA agent (Eric Roberts) and his malign plans. But the appeal here is seeing the group's member, the so-called Expendables: Stallone joins Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Mickey Rourke, the last one playing a friend of the team but retired from all the action. Now, the other side is composed by Steve Austin, Gary Daniels (but you can't barely see his face) and a few others. Willis and Schwarzenegger are merely cameos but there's no problem in that, they're part of our fun in watching the movie. And it wouldn't be a complete work without a girl to help those guys, the dictator's daughter, played by Gisele Itiê.Theme and plot are quite similar to many others developed in action films made since the 1980's up until now, but without causing some of the everlasting impact some of those movies caused on us, specially when it comes to the action scenes. Let's face it: the heroes are the same but the Hollywood system has changed a lot in order to get bigger audiences and to do that they get a little bit drenched with a politically correct agenda avoiding problems with the final product and editing/censorship issues. With that I mean that 'The Expendables' is quite controlled in terms of violence, Stallone doesn't make of this such a visceral and heavy thing like 'John Rambo' was, where half of the villains had their body parts flying around shattered by knives and machine guns. Good thing to some, but the movie isn't so memorable for the action sequences (they're good,being the most impactant the first guy killed in the movie, he simply disappeared after one shot fired) but it stays in the memory because of its use of humor. Gotta admire the priceless moment with Statham reciting a poetry in a bar, or Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren fights, or Li wanting to get more money for his work because he needs to pay for the school of his alleged kids.It's a helluva movie, proving that action heroes never lose their style while in combat and they never get old (only their faces). The dream became true, not the way we wanted but at least it wasn't a nightmare, got some wonderful results with audiences and critics, the sequel is on the way and I can't wait to see it. 10/10",10,2,5,3 May 2012
The Town," Powerful and Outstanding Performances, Reasonable Thriller. Affleck succeeds it again in the direction.
","Ben Affleck is a great surprise behind cameras since his directorial debut in 'Gone Baby Gone', and here with the thrilling 'The Town' he takes some of the same characteristics that made of his first film a good film about crime events in a city where the connections between ordinary people and criminals are very close. The film is very good but for some reason I thought that more could be added to make it a great film, more thrills, more violence and an excitement in a few moments but at least the dramatical parts are among the best in a film of this genre.'The Town' of the title is Charleston and the crime flies high there from the first scene presented in the film in a tense and well executed bank robbing made by Doug (Affleck), James (Jeremy Renner) and a few other partners. During the heist they decide to take a hostage with them, a female manager (Rebecca Hall), fearing that the cops would appear. After her release, Doug gets involved in a relationship with her, trying to see if she can give informations to the FBI (his inside level), and starts a romance with her (on the outside level he revels to be a very nice guy), hiding the fact that he kidnapped her, at last he starts to reevaluate his life as a robber and thinking of a new future in another town along with this great woman. Doug's problems while trying to reach this illusion are: 1) his dangerous friend James who doesn't like this relationship fearing that she might tell something to the police; 2) his boss (Pete Postlethwaite) who keeps sending more and more 'jobs' for him to execute; 3) a young woman (Blake Lively) interested on him that only knows how to provoke this guy 4) and, of course, a headstrong FBI Agent (Jon Hamm) who is getting closer to the group of thieves. There's nothing new in the plot of 'The Town' except for the important fact the drama takes a new and interesting level that was more captivating than the suspense built through the whole story (based on the book by Chuck Hogan 'Prince of Thieves'). Among the great dramatical moments are all the scenes between Affleck and Hall, where his character shares with this frightened woman many things of his past without giving away about his life of crimes, and a surprising sincerity in his talks that makes her unarmed against this guy, who simply appeared in her life in her worst life moment and he created that terrible moment. This contrast was excellent! And a scene where he visits his father (the excellent Chris Cooper) in jail, another great moment. The heist scenes, the car chase and the conclusion are among the nice action sequences, but I was expecting more energy coming out of it, to make me glued in the seat wanting more. It delivers something good, it is well made but it had potential to be more. 'The Town' performed well at the box office, and that's why everybody heard things about the film and the awards nomination (including Oscar) to the great Jeremy Renner. While I do think there's things to be praised about him and his acting here (the accent and a different tone of voice, his mannerisms and a dangerous look), I still think that there wasn't so much for all this awards buzz. Why's that? I expected him to be a more menacing character with violent and shocking moments, and someone with more important lines, more than just mumbling words. He should be the character of who we can't take our eyes off, with a powerful screen presence where we would have the chance to be surprised with his next moves because he's a very unpredictable guy and we haven't seen much of that (except in his scene with Hall and when he and his friend beat up a guy in the apartment). Jon Hamm was much more effective and interesting as the FBI agent and he should be the one nominated for the awards (even though my preference between the ignored names would be Andrew Garfield for 'The Social Network'). But, again, Renner's is quite good here but not enough for this Oscar, SAG and Golden Globe talks. Affleck is amazing in the main role in a very mature character, he's the element of surprise here; Rebecca Hall also amazing because she has the ability in playing such a high range of different roles that you forget about the actress and think more of her performance, her character, she totally disappears behind them and that is a great work. The late Pete Postlethwaite delivers an outstanding performance here, sad that his screen time is so short but he stole the show for himself and gladly Bafta was gentle enough to remember of his performance here, and instead of Renner they nominated him, a name that didn't make it in these awards lists.It is a good film, with powerful moments. More could have been made to be a more appealing film to me. 9/10",9,1,1,8 February 2011
Top Secret!," haha, very funny
","'Top Secret' makes a goofy parody on the popular spy movies of the 1940's combining with some of the humor of the 1980's, and it's so dated that can only cause one or two haha's in the audience. Won't even bother detailing the messy plot. Really. Not funny. Maybe two or three jokes. That's it.Charismatic as usual, Val Kilmer delivers some fun while his leading lady has some appeal but we never heard from her again, so who cares; Michael Gough is the coolest guy of the film playing a scientist while Peter Cushing, in one of his final roles, is outrageously reduced to a part that consists of speaking in another language pretending to be German and you don't have a clue of what's he saying (at least in the version I've watched, I don't know if there's something understandable about his character). One of the main reasons I didn't enjoyed this is probably my current dislike in brainless movies that makes parodies on another movies. There's so much of them now, like Aaron Seltzer's flicks (I don't even bother in watch them, but every time I'm bombarded with more and more trailers of their upcoming projects), they're not funny anymore, and this one was quite sleepy, tedious, with few good parts (only the sexual jokes work). The ZAZ trio (Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker) at one time was the greatest team to make such movies and they were very good, being 'Airplane' and 'The Naked Gun' their biggest comical efforts. 'Top Secret' is a big disappointment that consists of giving objects random purposes, characters falling to pieces like a jar crashing on the floor and ruthless scenes that don't cause any kind of amuse on us.And please, answer me this: in what year the story takes place? Everything looks so 1940's, Nazi German, but then there's this rock idol (Kilmer) who sings surf rock from the 1960's and there's devices and cultural references of the 1980's. It's so bloody confusing. Why bother, anyway? Endure for one hour and a half into a pile of wasted things is something to be treasured here and I don't suggest you to look for this. Comedies must accomplish more than a dozen of cheap laughters. 3/10",3,1,9,23 July 2012
21," 'Winner Winner Chicken Dinner' and a strange lesson learned
","In '21' Ben, a bright young student (Jim Sturgess) with an amazing memory for numbers is approached by his teacher (Kevin Spacey) on a big plan: go to Las Vegas to make money by counting cards on Blackjack. The teacher has a whole team of students along with him, and they will help Ben in the plan by making signs and codes. Why Ben joined the team? Because he wants to go to Harvard Medicine School and he doesn't have money, and even with an excellent background and many extracurricular activities the director is not impressed. So in order to get a scholarship he needs to convince the man that he has a impressive life experience to dazzle him. I'm sorry...did I just delivered the whole thing and ruined the experience for you? Sorry my bad!I haven't read the book in which Robert Luketic's movie is based or even haven't heard about the real life story in which this was based but I can say that it's a very good film about how money and education always are walking on the same side. For someone who lives in a third world country this movie doesn't make no sense for one can think: Or you born rich, pay for your studies until high school and then go to a public college, without paying but getting a good education, and then get rich otherwise you're gonna be locked in the lousy public school system during high school and then paying for a college degree and having a mediocre formation. That's how it sounds for those who live in countries like Brazil. And what's the connection between the movie? Everything! Ben is only doing the counting thing in Vegas because he wants to go to a prestiged college, it's his dream, even that his already studying at MIT. He's smart, hard working, but he's attracted to other things while 'gambling' such as women, money, fun, all things he didn't have with his nerd friends at MIT. He dreams big and knows exactly what he wants and that's great but here's a real tragedy bigger than to be beaten by the security staff of the casino: Ben is good with numbers so why he can't think about millions of people that won't have what he's get so far and be happy with it? It's not mentioned in the film why medicine is so important to him, if at least he said that in the future he would work for Doctor Wihout Borders and go to a foreign country where the health system is poor, okay I would get it and I would be more favorable to his character. That's not the case. And even with all the 'Winner Winner Chicken Dinner' cheered throughout the movie, and all that fun of playing like a hot shot in Vegas what was the lesson that the director in Harvard (played by Jack Gilpin) gave to Ben in the end? That if you participates of a little and innocent scheme to make money, deceiving his family and his true friends and even making a strange deal with his mentor (and deceiving him too in the end) you really can impress Harvard and be welcome to be a doctor! We're talking about medicine, folks, the most ethical of the professions and that's how Ben finally entered in by coming clean with a fraud? This took a lot of credibility of the pursuit for a good education theme.Despite these criticism it's a quite enjoyable, thrilling and interesting movie. Well acted by the incredible cast (Sturgess is fascinating; Spacey efficient as usual), and directed with a fast good rhythm by Robert Luketic '21' is a must see film for those who enjoy stories with a difficult mission to achieve. It has a great soundtrack too. In the very last scene it starts to play Rolling Stones's 'You can't always get what you want' which is ironic considering that Ben talks about several things he missed and gained, and it seems that he didn't lose anything. 9/10",9,0,0,19 July 2010
American Psycho," 'And as things fell apart nobody paid much attention'
","Patrick Bateman is the epitome of what success really is or at least the idea propagated by the media of what this must be. Wealthy, amazingly good-looking, powerful, cultured enough to make valuable points about the artists he likes and he's engaged with a rich and beautiful woman. There's only one thing on his way to achieve perfection: he kills people. Maybe that's what makes him feel complete within himself. But then again what's he doing with his life? Is he really doing the things he thinks he's doing?'American Psycho' pulls plenty of tricks to convey its message on how thin the line between sanity and insanity really is, and there's so much to take into account that one does not fully understands the movie in just one view. It looks something simple to be solved but it's just the other way around. The more you see it the more you realize how shaky everything is, nothing and no one is reliable. Speaking of reliable, Bateman (played by a flawless Christian Bale) isn't much of a trusty character, but not in the sense he fools people, pretending to be nice to later murder them. It's more that he's so over the top in some of his actions and reactions that he's completely unbelievable, specially when things start to turn upside down for him, he doesn't get credit for his acts. But is he really there? No one seems to be listening to what's he saying. How much of Bateman's murders are real or just imagination or maybe fantasies of his twisted persona? If they're real what's the pleasure in killing people? There's madness, hysteria, ecstasy, laughs whenever he's slaying and brutalizing his victims, frequently preceded of long opinions on the musicians he listens to. But there's no true enjoyment afterwards. We can't see that on his face or some sense of gain in getting rid of his victims, merely people of whom he just needs to make them disappear, such as a business acquaintance he truly dislikes (played by Jared Leto) or a poor homeless. If he feels something we'll never know, he hides deep down inside.Bale is such a good actor for this part that comes as a shock to know that he wasn't the first choice for the role. Thankfully, many obstacles in the way of making it made it possible to him take this role which people said to him 'It will kill your career!'. It turns out to be not only one of his most notorious roles but also the one that reinvented him to Hollywood, a completely 180 degree turn up of his most recognizable role to that date as Jim in 'Empire of the Sun'. The character he plays here is vain, brutal, calculist, deeply impressed by the mass culture of the period he lives but completely apathetic and careless on the people of and out of his circle. He exteriorizes many expressions but down in the core we know he can't feel anything. That's why he does what he does (if he ever did). To make a relevant comparison, the performance of the actor and his character reminded of Eric Packer, played by Robert Pattinson in 'Cosmopolis', one of the most debated films of the last years. Hard to reach a good consensus on it because his character resembles a lot Patrick Bateman but the performance of the actor leaves us confused, there's difference in the situations he lives and the one he faces through the whole journey. Of all the film adaptations based on Bret Easton Ellis novels this is truly the greatest one. Mary Harron made a hard effort in making this looks like the 1980's ('The Informers' is so poor in this aspect), quite a nostalgic time travel in between musics and references, a truthful portrayal of the yuppie generation as never shown before in so many details, yet it reveals so much about every vain and blind generations that came after in the 1990's and the 2000's. Perhaps that's the reason why people identifies with this movie so much, even after years of its release. Harron also got it right with the casting - Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Chlöe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Matt Ross, Guinevere Turner (who also wrote the script) all in positive performances. Disturbingly funny, the movie and its main character are powerfully iconic just as Alex DeLarge in 'A Clockwork Orange', both easily misinterpreted by a vast majority of its viewers. Bateman's tirades are priceless whether discussing Huey Lewis & The News musical qualities before killing one of his victims or his repeated line about having to return some videotapes. Like he says 'he's just a happy camper!' 10/10",10,0,0,31 December 2012
Warrior," Much more than just a fighting movie. Brilliant in all senses.
","It's a shame that in the past they gave all the Oscars to 'Rocky' but they couldn't recognize a wonderful job like 'Warrior'. That movie is good but completely egoistical in terms of story, just a man and his will to fight and survive; 'Warrior' is about two men, their will and fight to survive AND help others. That's important, very noble and what really defines the greatness of the film.On one corner we have Brendan (Joel Edgerton), school teacher, dedicated husband and father who's having plenty of trouble in paying the debts of the family's new house. And on the other corner there's Tommy (Tom Hardy), brave soldier who fought in Iraq and he's back to his hometown with several plans in mind. What unites these characters are: 1) a MMA championship with a big prize for the greatest fighter; 2) both are good fighters, one heavily trained and the other trying to get back in shape; 3) they are brothers and they don't have a good relationship with each other and also with their father (Nick Nolte), a trainer who had serious drinking problem for years and now that he's sober he tries hard to fix things in the family. The best he can do is training Tommy for the battle but nothing more than that. 4) Fate (to be explained later on the review).From the promotional stills released about the film it's no big deal that both brothers will have a huge duel against each other, just like most of us know that Rocky will have a fight against Apollo Creed in 'Rocky', and one might wonder why bothering in seeing this if the movie is that predictable. But you must see it, regardless of such aspect. The whole way until the final moment is exciting, thrilling, one of the greatest things ever presented on a film of this kind, which is quite rare. What impressed me about 'Warrior' was its interesting way of presenting a critic on the current social/economical situation of America inside of a martial arts picture. As explained earlier, fate brought the Conlon brothers up to this situation in subscribing to the championship and hoping to get the money (but only one can win). Brendan desperately needs the money for the already mentioned debts he has; Tommy needs it for great reasons that I won't detail here, one of the amazing surprises 'Warrior' holds to its viewers. They're fighting for good causes but they wouldn't be in such extreme if it wasn't for what their government did with them: Tommy and Brendan are products of the millions of dollars spent in supporting war and conflicts (fought by Tommy) that later proved to be one of the many economical problems faced by several people (and here we include Brendan) who lost their homes and/or had problems to pay for it. So, it's not just a bunch of guys kicking and punching each other for vain and egoistical reasons or to impress someone at the end of the day; it's a movie that makes a reflection on why similar people are put against each other when their reason to live and survive are the same. And it also deals with themes like forgiveness, struggle, the importance of family, so it's not just about the fight, it's bigger than that. But when we get to the awaited fights we have unforgettable moments, a great spectacle that doesn't disappoint. Hard to choose to which Conlon brother we cheer up more! 'Warrior' greatness doesn't stop here. The acting is so fabulous, so careful and it's very hard to not get impressed. Edgerton and Hardy are really amazing (their dialog on the beach was one of the highest points of the film, brilliant) with the first playing a very likable guy, real, one easy to be connected, and the latter playing a savage, lonely wolf type who has his tearful moments. The contrast between both brothers were greatly worked. However, the show was from Nick Nolte who resurrected with perfection in a role that sounds so clichéd but it's not, and he deserved a fair Oscar nomination. A long time he wasn't this good and we have to thank writer/director Gavin O'Connor for always having Nolte in mind for such character, and quoting in his words the movie wouldn't exist if Nolte wasn't involved. I rest my case here, I really loved it, one of the biggest surprises I've ever had while watching movies so, stop everything you're doing and go watch it now. 10/10",10,2,5,29 June 2012
Cross of Iron," Peckinpah Goes to War
","In 'Cross of Iron' director Sam Peckinpah tells an story about true heroes and their real acts of heroism and false heroes and what do they do to be recognized as brave mens and guarantee all the fame to the themselves. During the Second World War the Prussian Captain Hauptmann Stransky (Maximilian Schell) fights along the Nazists even though he dislikes Hitler. All he wants is to put his hands in a medal of honor named 'Cross of Iron', a medal given to acts of bravery in a battle. He's a total coward, manipulates his subordinates and does everything he can to win this medal. But he's the new leader of the squad. Newly promoted Sergeant Rolf Steiner (James Coburn) is the good guy in this story, the good German. He's gonna be one of the many obstacles that Stransky got to deal with. Steiner is a real hero, a guy who always risks his life in order to protect his friends and even potential enemies like a Russian soldier boy that he kept as prisoner. But both men are united against the Soviets in a desperate attempt to survive.Along with the vanities, friendship, bravery, pride and the Cross of Iron there's also the battles, the shootings, blood, insanity, fights like a typical war movie. The originality of this movie is to show the German side of the war, a side that's almost isn't showed in movies and here they got the chance to be the 'heores' of the story even that we know that in real life wasn't that way. If you're looking to an accurate story don't watch it. But if you want with bloody battles and a good story you must watch it. This is the only incursion of Sam Peckinpah into war films and he really did a terrific job here. It might not be violent as 'The Wild Bunch' but it has many characteristics of his preview works (the great editing alternating slow motion and still images and then moves forward). Another rare and interesting aspect is the homosexual relationship between the Leutnant Triebig (Roger Fritz) and a young soldier named Kepler (the actor is not credited). Their relationship appears briefly in a scene when both are caught by Stransky (they don't know that). Stransky uses their unfoldment as a way to use Triebig as an allied to his plans. I think that this worked really well in the movies, it's not something you see even in recent war movies. The focus here it's not only the war strategies but the man strategy to get what he wants, even if all he wants is a medal or to stand for those he likes.Good performances by James Coburn, Maximiian Schell (the best in scene), James Mason, David Warner and Igor Galo (he plays the young Leutnant Meyer). Since this was an very underrated movie by the time of its release I hope that someday (soon) maybe Hollywood remake this classic. Here comes an suggestion: Tom Wilkinson must play Captain Stransky, I can picture he playing this almost villain.",10,1,4,16 April 2010
Control," One of the best films I've ever seen
","'Control' is one of my favorite contemporary musical cinebiographies ever made, ranking next to 'The Doors' (1991) both going for a certain accuracy in terms of presentation of events, their great poetic sense in presenting their main characters and without surrendering to sensationalism, exaggerations (although Oliver Stone's film flies away with some imagination but it's good anyway) . Cinematically speaking, the film offers a view on things that are close to the object investigated, through a careful cinematography that recreates style, the period, the way we perceived the life and work of Ian Curtis and Joy Division. It's art in its great state. Most important, the man moving the whole show is Anton Corbijn, video clip director close to the Joy Division, he knew them all, and he makes of this work his film debut. He couldn't pick anything better and more appropriate for a promising beginning.For the challenging role of Curtis, Corbijn has on his side the newcomer Sam Riley, who is one of most amazing talents to rise in the last years. This marks his first screen credit after a few TV movies but he stands firm on the ground by singing, acting and being Ian Curtis, the late vocalist of Joy Division. There's no one like him, so impressive, so young and already acting like a veteran. His performances carries the whole film, going through so many different stages, depressed, angry, shattered, afraid of going to the stage, romantic. We follow Riley/Curtis (gotta make this association) from the moment of start of the band, the first meetings, then writing lyrics from the things he personally felt and seen (example, how he came up with 'She's Lost Control' after seeing a girl having a seizure on the floor at the hospital he worked), the recognition and attention the band got from Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson), the first gigs, the success and eventually his fall, and the band's dissolution (turning into New Order and the rest you can follow on '24 Hour Party People', which is blasé compared to 'Control').There's also room for Curtis love relationship with Deborah Curtis (played by Samantha Morton), life in family, and his love affair with journalist Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), that seems to be used as an indicative of how things got messed up for the man. From the beginning we know that he's a man with many problems, suffered with depression and seizures that often ruined his performance on stage. His lyrics evoke and paint things in a darker, sad way. Just take a look at their most famous song 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'. Real artists who make genuine art must reflect themselves, in one way or the other. Curtis was all that. I'm wonder where did Riley took it all to compose his melancholic portrayal of the man.'Control' shows the dimension of Ian's problems but it leaves the real reasons for suicide to the perpetrator. Pressure, difficult in dealing with fame, the problems at home, his medical condition, the depression, addiction, who knows? All we know is that on May 18, 1980 he listened to Iggy Pop's album 'The Idiot', watched one of his favorite films Werner Herzog's 'Stroszek' and hang himself, leaving everything behind, becoming a rock n'roll icon, eternally remembered by his fans. He just lost control and ended all. It's not our task to judge him. A note I make to the film's great accomplish is by not showing this final moment. We see the ritual (and I want to know how all of this become a fact, with the album and the movie), he enters in the kitchen and the rest is seen through a distant shot of Deborah entering in the house. It would be too painful to see that, we like Curtis too much to see a shocking moment like this.With no lost moments in it, 'Control' is full of so many great scenes that is difficult to select just one to say that this movie is special. Walking down the streets with a jacket that says 'HATE'; the confusion during a performance where Ian couldn't go to the stage, replaced by a uncharismatic lead singer singing 'Disorder' and booed by the crowd (the song's inclusion is not an accident); the conversations between Ian and Annik; 'Atmosphere' for the conclusion was perfect and the band concerts, amazingly played by actors Joe Anderson, Harry Treadaway and James Anthony Pearson playing respectively Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Bernard Sumner. Outstanding musical numbers!I don't know how much of it was legend or fact or condensation of both, but the true thing I've seen here was epic and it looks and sounds completely real and believable to me. Curtis would be proud of this. 10/10 RIP Ian.",10,1,1,15 July 2012
The Exorcist," The Power of The Exorcist Compels You To Watch it!
","Almost 40 years has passed since 'The Exorcist' was released and it still is a haunting, exciting, thrilling and frightening horror movie. Lists after lists are made to elect the best horror movie of all time and this film always manage to get to the Top of almost every single list. Not only that: it's also an very complex dramatic film with a compelling story. A story of a devoted mother to save her teen daughter of a strange possession.After finishing the filming of a movie the actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) finds herself with an awkward situation after her adorable daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave differently. She is taken to all the best doctors but nothing is found and doctors suspicion is that the kid may have a brain tumor. But after all the medical treatment fails and when Regan's starts to move frantically Chris is told to get a bigger help: a priest to exorcise what possessed her daughter. Father Karras (Jason Miller, incredible acting in his film debut) is called, but he himself is a tormented man, who has recently loss his elderly mother, almost faithless and with few skills to perform an exorcism. Even with all that he agrees to see the girl who has increasingly gone worst. She vomits, masturbates with a crucifix and says countless bad words and profanation. Karras's verdict: she's possessed by Pazuzu, a mysterious and powerful demon. But this demon has a weakness and this weakness is Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow in a very aged makeup), or better saying The Exorcist. Father Merrin knows everything about exorcisms and demons and he knows how to fight it. Even with all this knowledge (as it is showed in the beginning of the movie when he's in Iraq investigating an occurrence) you can feel that he has some fears, (his hands shaking) but he'll do everything to kill the demon and save the poor girl. The last 40 minutes with Karras and Merrin together performing the exorcism in that freezing and haunting bedroom is priceless, scary and the best horror moment of the 1970's. I must salute director William Friedkin for his efforts on present us a movie greater in its genre different of everything seen before. He was mean with actors to create realism but he get what he wanted and the audience was terrified by those images (Ellen Burstyn's face when she was thrown to the floor; Jason Miller's face after the vomit comes right into his face which wasn't supposed to happen). On the technical side of 'The Exorcist' an interesting thing must be noticed: all the horror moments are shown without music. This works really great, it's not a manipulated movie where a soundtrack must be added to create tension. And without the music it was much more scarier and fun to watch, listening to all the strange sounds created by the sound group (Won Oscar). Makeup effects and visual effects are stunning and many of it it's not dated or old-fashioned. Impressive! About the screenplay: William Peter Blatty writer of the original book and the film's writer created a whole new thing here. The drama, the horror and even some humor are perfect. Although I think that some scenes, characters and clues aren't well explained, there's too much mystery. For example, we heard that the film director (Jack McGowran) died on the long stairs. This scene isn't showed and if it was it would be too frightening and unforgettable. After that the movie lover detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb, very good and funny) starts a investigation about the event. Then he gets some clues about many things he didn't even saw. The public may wonder how did he get to that evidence or clue. Two moments I would like to see or questions to be answered: Who puts the crucifix under Regan's bed? And what happened to Father Merrin in that bedroom after he leaves Karras and exorcise the girl alone? Not only the technical team worked well. All the actors have fantastic performances: Burstyn, Cobb, Miller, Sydow, Blair, even not professional actor the Reverend William O'Malley has a great performance here, and at last Mercedes McCambridge who plays the devil's voice (one thing I hated in the Portuguese dubbing version is that her voice was made by a man). Even being the biggest blockbuster of 1973 it only won 2 Academy Awards (Adapted Screenplay and Sound), and it deserved the award of Best Picture cause it was greater than 'The Sting'. And it must get a higher rating on IMDb's Top 250 list. This movie is awesome, one of the very few horror movies to still shock me, to not be dated or cheesy. If you haven't watched yet or didn't find time to watch it run and buy it if you can. The power of this film compels you to watch it now and over again. Must see film for horror fans and for movie lovers just like Lt. Kinderman. 10/10",10,9,12,24 May 2010
Enchanted," A Enchanted Tale Of Our Times
","'Enchanted' is another great fairy tale about a princess that must be rescued by his charming prince. But the difference starts when we find out that this story begins in a sort of classic Disney cartoon and it evolves to a motion picture with real actors and placed in the current time, in New York City. This idea really works showing the contrasts of real life when many things go wrong versus fiction life where everything ends with a happy ending.Giselle (Amy Adams) is the princess that wants to find his true love, the man who'll finish her love songs duet. And Edward (James Marsden) is a handsome knight that happens to be her true love in vice-versa. But the witch Queen (Susan Sarandon), also Edward's mother, fears that his place in the castle will be taken by the beautiful Giselle and so she pushes the poor princess into a dwell that led her to recent times, most precisely at 21st century, right in the middle of the Times Square. Now Giselle's is totally lost in time and in the city but she insists to the other people that she needs to find a castle in order to get married with his prince. During one of those walks into the city she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter (Rachel Covey). He's gonna help her to find his way back home and of course find her prince. But there are more many complications on the way: Robert is getting married with Nancy (Idina Menzel) and Giselle's sudden appearance may ruin the 5 year engagement of the couple; a man loyal to the queen was sent to impeach that Giselle returns home, the funny and deadly Nathaniel (Timothy Spall, excellent), the Queen herself also appears to put her plans in the right direction and Edward seeks for her, to rescue her once again. The funny thing in this story is that she's a happy princess that always believes in happy and romantic endings, and Robert is a lawyer specialized in divorce, and he knows that in real life not always couples stay together. This kind of playful and paradox dynamic worked very well in this film.Another great thing about 'Enchanted' is the comparisons between the two worlds. Robert presents to Giselle all the differences of the real life but it's not a bureaucratic movie when the character finds many different things and starts to ask what everything's for (this happen only in a scene when Giselle is in the shower and she wants to know where the water comes from). The scenes and the dialogs about what is true love, and the reasons of why or not believe in happy endings and fairy tales are very well written and many times it's the best thing in the movie, working way better than the funniest scenes and the musical moments. All actors are good here (most notably Amy Adams, James Marsden and Timothy Spall), there's comedy and romance, funny situations, well, it's a very entertaining family movie. And of course like in almost every Disney movie, there is a happy ending!",10,2,2,10 May 2010
Die Hard 2," McClane Returns
","Bruce Willis returns as the iconic action hero John McClane in 'Die Hard 2' and instead of fighting terrorists in a building in Los Angeles he fights another terrorists (former military men), and this time they invaded Dulles Airport in Washington and they want to take control of everything. Here comes lots of action, shots, incredible scenes and some humor as usual in Die Hard series. In this new adventure McClane is at the airport waiting for his wife return from a business trip when he notices strange happenings and some unusual movement in the place. He finds out that a military named Colonel Stewart (William Sadler) took control of the airport, at distance, controlling all the planes that are going to land including the plane that carries an important General (Franco Nero) who's about to be rescued by Stewart's group. In the middle of all this there's the chaos at the airport, flight controllers panicking, the chief of police (Dennis Franz) complaining of McClane actions on the airport and the dangerous tactics used by Stewart in order to get all he wants. And there's McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) on board of one of the planes trying to land in Washington, and she has to deal once again with the arrogant reporter Thornburg (William Atherton).As an action film the movie goes very well compared to many action flicks that emerged in the past 20 years. In comparison with the other films of the series this is my least favorite because of the excessive drama, it takes too long to really have a decent action moment, and some viewers might get confused in some parts. On the technical aspects I disliked the dark cinematography with overused red lightning, it's almost impossible to see things here. But it's a very thrilling picture, with many inspired and original scenes (McClane escaping of the plane filled with grenades by pushing the eject button of the pilot seat).Actors performances are very good, Willis is a great action figure playing McClane, Art Evans has the coolest character in the film, and Bonnie Bedelia is even better than in the first film. The great aspect of this film is the inclusion of many references about the excellent 1988 film directed by John McTiernan, and brought back some of the characters too. I think many people were disappointed that he couldn't direct this one (he was offered the job but he was already filming 'The Hunt for Red October') but Renny Harlin made a great job here, way better than the ones he's directing lately. 10/10",10,1,3,24 November 2010
Across the Universe," Across the Universe is Wonderful
","'Across the Universe' is a radiant, artistic, psychedelic and excellent experience that evokes a great period where peace, love, war and music walked side by side. With a story set between 1967 and 1968 and filled with musical and cultural references this is a fantastic film that really takes you back to that period, making you sing along with The Beatles classics performed by the great ensemble cast and singers like Bono and Joe Cocker. The story follows the love story between Jude (Jim Sturgess), a poor English in America and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) an upper class American girl. We also see the circle of friends of both characters such as Lucy's brother Max (Joe Anderson), the singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), the guitarist JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) and Prudence (T.V.Carpio). We join their reactions towards the many turbulent events around them such as the Vietnam war, the discovery of love, rock n'roll, art and many others. And they sing The Beatles songs. I won't explain too much of the story and I'm only gonna write why it was a great film. Director Julie Taymor made a very captivating film about an era very similar like 'Almost Famous' or 'Hair'. The way The Beatles's songs were used, or better saying, the context in which it was used was beautiful, magical, intelligent and worked very well. For instance when Jude is introduced to Max's friends and they sang 'With a Little Help from My Friends' (great funny moment) or when the Max was enlisted by the Amry it starts to play 'I Want You' and the Uncle Sam poster pointing at him. And of course the Beatles references (many songs couldn't been introduced here so there are cases when a character's name reminds you of a song or something said by a character like Jude's boss saying that things would look different when he was 64 years old) and rock references such as Jimi Hendrix (JoJo) and Janis Joplin (Sadie). It was a great mix of things.In the beginning I thought the movie was becoming one of those musicals where you almost laugh at it, many of the songs wasn't good performed by the actors but when Joe Cocker appeared singing 'Come Together' I was really in the mood of the film, and after that it was delightful to follow and at many times sing along almost all the songs. And I changed my mind about the whole thing (except for the performance of 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', that really bothers me, the girl sings too much). It is like a 2 hour video clip but it's a very good video clip. All actors are great, dramatically and performing the songs. Jim Sturgess what an inspiration...Great leading actor here and the chemistry between he and Evan Rachel Wood was amazing. There are few special appearances of Eddie Izzard (Mr. Kite), Dylan Baker, Bill Irwin, Logan Marshall-Green (unrecognizable as a protest leader) and Salma Hayek (who worked with Julie Taymor in 'Frida', she plays a nurse in a musical scene). Best moments: Bono singing 'I am the Walrus'; the whole cast singing 'Because'; the performance on the rooftop reminder of Abbey Road; Jude throwing Strawberries on the wall and the result of one of his art works; JoJo and Sadie electrifying performances on stage; Max's jokes; anyway everything was excellent here. Definitely a memorable film. 10/10",10,2,3,19 May 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Fantastic Movie About An Unusual Life Versus Time
","In 1920 American author F.Scott Fitzgerald wrote a short story about a man who born resembling an old person and dies younger. This short story was a great account about time passages and its importance over many ages, and other issues like the prejudice of society towards people of different ages, because Benjamin never looks like a person of his own age. He's 7 years old but it looks someone with 80 years old. After many attempts in transform this short story (since the 1970's Hollywood tried to make this film) into a feature film David Fincher (Zodiac, Seven) finally got the chance to direct this incredible and powerful movie with a great cast, amazing technical works and a touching and captivating story. Well, let's say: it came in a good time. Scott Fitzgerald's story lacked an deep look over many aspects of life, it was just a way to reduce Benjamin's life to some funny and awkward situations. In the movie, the screenwriters Eric Roth and Robin Swicord took the basis of the original story and created something different, something more passionate, added many points of view and in the end the result is excellent.The story begins in 2005, in New Orleans few moments of Hurricane Katrina's advance to the city. In a hospital an elderly woman is dying and her daughter (Julia Ormond) is asked to read a old diary that she kept. The diary contains the story of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), since his birth in 1918 as an elderly man until his last remaining days as a baby. But in the middle of all that there's all his precious and difficult moments. Abandoned by his father (Jason Flemyng) and left in a asylum he's adopted by Queenie Mama (Taraji P. Henson) a religious woman that believes that Benjamin was a miracle of God and accepts him likes her own son. The story also follows Benjamin's love interests. His first and eternal love was Daisy (younger version played by Elle Fanning, when older's played by Cate Blanchett), the granddaughter of one the ladies of the asylum. With Daisy Benjamin feels complete, and life seems to be an beautiful adventure. The second interest is a rich married woman (Tilda Swinton) that he met on a hotel during the war years after he join as an sailor on Captain Mike's boat. Benjamin lives like an ordinary person. He married, he worked, he had a children, and many other things but the time works differently to him. As we seen in the beginning there's a story of a watchmaker (Elias Koteas) that designed a clock to run backwards because he lost his son in the First World War and wanted that people remember that if we could back in time great things would happen and many lives wouldn't be shattered. To Benjamin time's strange, fatal but he lives the moment no matter what it takes. And love was the greatest gift he could ever receive. It really makes one look to it's own life and sees that no time can be wasted, all the moments counts because life isn't measured in hours, minutes or seconds but in the good and bad moments everyone has. One thing Benjamin has in common with all of us. Just like Bowie's song: 'Time may change him but he can't trace time'. I must compare the film and the short story because I get different reactions with both. The short story left me thinking over the subject and the result one can get is that this theme is depressing. The movie seemed to went to the same direction but when you see the whole journey and all the thing that were created for this movie you might think differently. There's something positive about it. Eric Roth wrote not only this film but he's well known to be the writer that pick a small and good work and changes into something bigger and better. 'The Insider' was a little newspaper article that becomes a explosive and excellent movie; 'Forrest Gump' was a funny and critical book and then Eric wrote an tremendous screenplay. Many people will compare Forrest Gump and Benjamin Button in many levels. Not only the writer is the same but the main plot about a man's life journey is the same. Personally I liked more 'Forrest Gump' because it was something I watched often during childhood and the performances were better. But 'Benjamin' has tremendous good performances by Pitt, Blanchett, Henson, Swinton, Flemyng and Jared Harris as Captain Mike. The special effects and the makeup are the biggest rewards of this film, everything was made beautifully, giving the public the chance to see Brad Pitt evolves from older to younger. The music by Alexandre Desplat evocate sadness to the magical and mysterious world of Benjamin. My only and minor disappointment was the cinematography that in many moments are very very dark, that aspect wasn't needed in such a beautiful movie. It could've used some lighter tons. Fincher leaves the killers and psychopaths and enters in a more humanistic world. His entrance in this world was great, thrilling, making one of the best movies I ever seen.",10,8,11,12 April 2010
The Nightmare Before Christmas," I liked it but...
","...I probably missed something while watching 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' because I didn't find anything so special as people claim to have seen it. It's good overall, very watchable but I really didn't felt the hype of this animation. And the tragic thing that I heard was people saying that the only people who'll enjoy this film is the ones who watched since they were kids and grow up watching over and over again. Fine. I watched it more recently, I'm young but not a kid but I still think that a movie can and must win all kinds of audiences otherwise it's just silly and forgotten.The concept, the story of Jack a scary Halloween creature that discovers Christmas and gets involved with the holiday but doesn't know its meaning quite well, is very original, funny. Perhaps more suitable and interesting for a live action film than a animated feature. This is a cartoon for kids but at the same time it's not, it's dark, kind of creepy. And a movie idealized by Tim Burton wouldn't be a Burton film without Danny Elfman's songs. Sometimes the songs work quite well, other times it's annoying and overlong.Perhaps the aspect that bothered me on this film, or the thing that didn't make me enjoy it more than I wanted is the direction of the film in charge of Henry Selick. Selick directed one of the worst films ever made, a tiny awful film called 'Monkeybone', a waste of time, space, money, completely misguided film and since then I was afraid of watching something directed by him. Here in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' he was good, knew how to direct and control the stop motion technique, and was able to capture Burton's ideas. But had this movie directed by Burton himself, with more control on things this would be a better and greater film as it is. Burton is present here but not as much as his presence in the wonderful 'Corpse Bride' (which I enjoyed so much more).The voice casting was very good although they haven't included any famous actors behind the characters voices. The great special effects were nominated for the Oscar (lost out to the undefeatable 'Jurassic Park'), the soundtrack is good, has its great moments most notably the song 'This Is Halloween' played at the opening, that song should have been nominated for an Oscar.Again, I wasn't so excited as many people claimed to have been while watching this experience. It's good but not great. I've seen better animated films and that's only my opinion. Now I'm gonna have to face many people who suggested the film to me, and they were so thrilled while talking about it, and when they ask me what did I find about it I'm gonna frown my face a little, say it was okay, and they're gonna kill me for doing that. But that's life! 6/10",6,1,3,20 December 2010
Quiz Show," It's All About Money And Vanity In One Of The Best Movies Of 1994
","Robert Redford's 'Quiz Show' is a great drama about what happened behind the scenes of a very popular quiz show. Based on true events happened in 1958 we see two contestants of a quiz show and their contribution to one the greatest scandals of the 1950's. The first contestant of the show is Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a poor working-class Jew with a fantastic memory on several subjects. He's winning a lot of money on NBC's show '21' and people love him because he's a success on the show, answering correctly all the answers. But the show sponsors doesn't like him, thinking that he's ugly and boring and they ask to the show producer Dan Enright (David Paymer)to find someone different to beat Stempel and get more high ratings to the show. The answer to his problems is Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) a College teacher, born on a very influent and rich family. Now he's gonna compete with Herb on '21' but things are not what they appear to be.Enright asks Stempel to 'dive' for a good sum of money and lose the game. He offers to Stempel the question and the answer that's gonna make him lose everything and worse: he knows the correct answer and don't wanna be a part of it. Enright says that Stempel might have an future on TV, but he must lose. Stempel follows what Enright says and loses but nothing of what was promised to him happens and he gets mad. He starts to denounce the show and the producers saying that the show is a fraud, that everything is set up, and most shocking than this: the contestants got the questions and answers before the show be on the air.Richard Goodwin is the responsible for investigating any quiz show problems. On his search he discovers that something is wrong with the show but he wants more. He approaches Charles Van Doren, the very popular contestant that's making the ratings of the network fly high. Van Doren's is starting to get upset with the investigation, after all he's a man of principles, he doesn't believe in fake acknowledge, he doesn't want to receive the answers before the show starts, and last but not least he's the son of the acclaimed writer Mark Van Doren (Paul Scofield) a man who taught everything from Literature until moral values. Here comes our questions, the viewers questions: Why Stempel gave in? Why Van Doren wanted to be part of this show? Why an educated man, with a good life needs to change his values to participate in a game show? Why Goodwin thinks that people would be interested in knowing that what happens behind quiz shows is a scam? And most important: Why the producers of the show couldn't make something real and opted for making an fraud?It's all about money. Stempel wanted money, he obtained the money in the show, lost and wanted more, something that Enright promised. Van Doren's rich, teaches at Columbia and gets a great paycheck but he knows that he can get more. The '21' producers and the sponsor proved that with an interesting and charming contestant on the show they get more ratings and they get more money. In a particular scene after Van Doren's lose (in a question showed to him but that wasn't part of the scheme) the producers send Dave Garroway (Barry Levinson) to make an offer to Van Doren, NBC's offering a millionaire contract to him so that he could stay on TV. It's all about vanity. Stempel and Van Doren's look was a decisive factor on why NBC and the sponsor preferred the richer guy over the Jewish guy. When a NBC's accountant (Griffin Dunne) tells the sponsor (Martin Scorsese) that Stempel's a very popular guy in Queens, the representing replies: 'Queens is not New York' (meaning that he wanted Stempel out of the show. Van Doren is an more charismatic figure, Stempel's has a problem with his teeth and talks too much.But this is also a movie about ethic, moral values, dignity or the lack of all these items. Probably many people will condemn Stempel's attitude after his loss on the program, claiming that he had a choice, and in the end his denounce was thrown back at him, making him a desperate person seeking revenge. In the case of Van Doren his name speaks loudly than everything. When a Commission is formed to investigate the '21' scandal, and Van Doren testifies in front of all Americans, all the judges of the Commission replies that what he did by telling the truth was courageous. There's differences between the same issue. The most absurd of the reasons of why the show has to be made of that unethical way is that the producers and the sponsors were working for the cause of education.And with all of that, Robert Redford created a thrilling film, with a fast rhythm in the first hour and a slower and full of thoughts in the second hour. Paul Attanasio delivered one the best screenplays of all time, here you can find humor, drama, curiosity and really learn many things. 'Quiz Show' has a great ensemble cast, with all actors giving their best. It's really difficult to say who's best. Certainly one of the Top movies of 1994. 10/10",10,0,0,26 April 2010
Taken," Thrilling with some flaws here and there but very good
","According to movies, Paris is not safe anymore on the first day you get there! First, kidnappers took Harrison Ford's wife in 'Frantic'; now they took Liam Neeson's daughter and her friend in the action thriller film 'Taken', where both girls will be sold as prostitutes by Albanians slave traders. But instead of a vulnerable doctor like the one presented in Polanski's film, our hero is a former CIA agent with skillful tactics that goes to rescue his daughter from the evil. Among the favorable points of this film, besides a great performance by Neeson, is the way this father manages to save his daughter and the techniques he uses to track her last steps after being kidnapped. Small things that makes a total difference like hearing the traders conversations on the phone or even asking his daughter before she was taken to mention a few characteristics of these people (but this moment fails a little if one considers the impossibility of someone doing so since she was very distressed, and how come these guys show up without wearing masks which would make impossible their recognition?). Of course, some of these things are pure exaggeration but as long as the film played with some tension, nice action sequences and a solid drama involving human trafficking and all the desperation of the main character, we are thrilled with a above the average flick.A few things could be worked better or played more fairly and that is 1) the editing, because we need to know who is beating who. The fights are great, Neeson is very believable in doing all this and writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen provided to the main character lots of combat with Nagasu Do, a interesting and mixed martial art style, but the director, editor and the camera went all nuts and they wouldn't allow us to see precisely what was going on in key moments; 2) the cold-blooded character played by Neeson and his coldness didn't work at some moments, most notably where he shoots at a woman trying to discover where one of the traders were. This was something surprisingly strange to see it, didn't work so good, and this kind of implacability works better in a Bond film or a Schwarzenegger type of film (and 'Taken' resembles 'Commando' a little bit). It is comprehensible in the context used for this film, here's a desperate father trying to save his daughter in a short period of time, he did way worst to the guys who took her but for some reason this was too strange, and this woman wasn't even involved in the whole situation although her husband was.It might be an overdone and clichéd picture but it has a lot of good things to show, it's well made, well acted with a nice supporting cast with names like Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser, Jon Gries and Xander Berkeley, and the action is great. 9/10",9,2,2,2 April 2011
Chariots of Fire," Perfection!
","Rarely times a film offered such a complete and rich view of what being an athlete means than 'Chariots of Fire'. This outstanding Best Picture Oscar winner deals not only with that but also brings incredibly good insights on how different religions peacefully work together for the same cause, which is running, not just to the extent of winning a medal and being recognized but also showing how God helps them. Right, there's some rivalry between a Catholic and a Jewish but they know how to tolerate each other without getting into a fist fight. And more, all of this happened during the Olympic games of 1924. More inspiring to our lives than that I don't know.In those quiet and foggy days, there was a group of runners running on a beach training their bodies and minds to a cause, to get closer to God on a search for perfection, that's what running did for them or at least that's the way they saw it: to make heart and soul united in a magnificent and joyful experience that was more interesting than to run for their college or their countries while competing; those were good reasons but to run for God was the noblest of all. They were the chariots of fire!As main characters of this adventure we have these two athletes: the preacher Eric Lidell (Ian Charleson, remarkable), a zealous Catholic and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish student at Cambridge. Of course, there are other characters but those two and the trainer Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm) are the ones you really pay great attention for the way they share their views on life and athletics, their personal efforts in overcoming obstacles e.g. the ones involving Abrahams dealing with lots of Anti-Semitism at college trying to make his way through life.I know there isn't such thing as a perfect film but this one gets closer to that in terms of composition, Colin Welland's script, Milena Canonero's costumes, the art direction, everything works! But the ones that deserve extra credit are the wonderful music composed by Vangelis and the acting by the cast. The music, a piece executed with lots of synthesizers, is very contemporary for a story that takes place in the 1920's but somehow perfectly fits the film, and now has an enormous cultural impact (whenever you hear that song you remember marathons, athletics and all. Sadly, most people know that the song comes from this film but they never watched it). And we have the excellent and very believable performances from the actors who play the runners (including Nigel Havers, Dennis Christopher and Brad Davis) with Charleson and Cross giving the best of the show. A great achievement by director Hugh Hudson, who after that haven't got much luck with his next projects. It took me a long time to fully appreciate 'Chariots of Fire', its messages and its magnificence. A bit overrated ('Reds' was the best picture that year and should've won the Oscar) but indeed a powerful work to make you marveled. To those who gave up on this film at one time I suggest to give it another chance because this is one that can only be really understood with time and with the experiences you have in life. Liking sport films or not, this is really a must see. 10/10",10,1,1,25 November 2011
Invictus," It's not about winning the game, it is about how you play it that really counts
","In 'Invictus' Clint Eastwood takes us back to a divided South Africa of the post-Apartheid after Nelson Mandela's being elected President and making a new government, the first one elected by the people. And it is in this fragile nation with enormous tense between South-Africans and English South-Africans that a political game and a rugby game will be decisive for the country's union. Morgan Freeman, perfect as Mandela, is the elected leader trying to unite a divided country by making a unconventional choice by supporting South Africa rugby team during the Rugby's World Cup, at one time known for its racist songs while playing during the Apartheid; and now they are a failed team led by captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon) and a team composed in its majority of white players, and where the only adored star of the team is a black player loved by many fans. Mandela knows that only changing the laws and building things are not enough to make a different and better country, opposite to the one he only knew behind bars for almost thirty years. He needs to join forces and show to everyone he's the right guy on command and that things can be worked for better. His alliance with Pienaar is a brilliant strategy, he teaches to the captain of the team valuable things on the importance that rugby has on the country (but only if they win because that brings a little bit of closeness between people, everyone together for one cause, and Mandela is promoting a new country to the world showing that a black President is as much as good as a white one) and Pienaar tries to risen up the moral of a broken team, playing his game efficiently.The positive, different and unique strategy used by Mandela worked perfectly, and not only his ability in working with the team and the results they got in the nation, but also he calmed the tension between the former members of the secret service (white), and his personal security (black) who didn't get along right from the start of the new government. In the end, it doesn't matter winning the game, whether the political game or the rugby game, it's all about play it and stick it to the end that really counts, that really makes the difference. Many other politicians used of weapons and false propaganda's to spread terrible messages or evil ways to built a better nation, but here we see a man, almost alone, that used his power and presence to bring together something that was faded to be shattered forever. Two spectacular performances by Damon and Freeman made of 'Invictus' a really great picture, that also has a magnificent screenplay joining together a real event story with a sport themed film (with a exciting final match in the last part). Eastwood's unusual choice of film to direct proved to be a excellent and beautiful choice, an nice inspiring film these days, very very rare to find. It is a outstanding work but it should have gather more audiences, it looks like that people turned their backs from this precious gem. This is a example of what movies should be, giving some great, positive and realistic examples without preaching or selling an idea. It speaks higher and shows much more than you can think of. 10/10",10,1,2,16 March 2011
A Clockwork Orange," One Of The Most Dangerous Films Ever Made
","All of this can be said of 'A Clockwork Orange': controversial in all possible ways, shocking, jaw dropping, wild yet beautiful, artistic, elucidative, cinematically impressive, unique. Stanley Kubrick reveals the world as it is, horrible things we do not want to see melded with a disturbing sense of humor. Here's an striking film that dares us to watch, disturb our senses and perceptions, and in the end most of us we'll be failing in seeing what one of the greatest directors of all time tried to say to us about a violent futuristic society that reflect many problems of all the forms of societies in all the times, past, present and future. It is a dangerous film because it challenges its viewers to open their eyes to violent acts presented in a almost jolly, pleasurable way (of course, the ones who are committing acts like beating a old man and raping his wife to the sound of 'Singin' in the Rain') and most people will probably think Kubrick is a sadistic man for filming such things. Not the case! Here's a director aware of its time, who probably saw how things were running down in the world like extreme violence, bad politics, totalitarianism, moral failure of society and decided to make his own statement on the issue (not only he, in fact, this is based on Anthony Burgess book). We see this ultraviolence in the film as a distant future but now, many years later, things haven't changed much and there'll always some twaddler out there to blame amoral behavior in society because of films like these which leads me to another aspect of why this is a really dangerous film. It is the most misinterpreted film of all time, hailed by the wrong reasons (and most of the time by the wrong kind of viewers, the ones who love Alex mannerisms and violence), and the wrong kinds of ideologies who are led to believe Alex is a hero, the government is the oppressive system that institues wrong forms of rehabilitation and all. I can't be a hypocrite, I also got the wrong idea of what this film is about several times, always believing that this was some sort of morality tale about not doing to others what you wouldn't wish was done to you. It's way more than this.The paradox is amazing since we have the most dubious character ever created on film, greatly played by Malcolm McDowell. You can hate Alex DeLarge, you can like him and you might have mixed feelings about his way of seeing the world, using complicated expressions to express himself or express violence, hatred, and we also have the 'corrected' Alex, the one sent to a drug experiment where he started to hate everything he liked in his previous rebel life: violence, sex crimes, and he can't even listen to Beethoven anymore without feeling sick. Some films have not the obligation to answer our questions or to lead us into some one path or the other; they're exist to be watched, to be debated, to make us think about new perspectives on a provoking and controversial theme. 'A Clockwork Orange' is a mandatory film for those who dare to see how powerful movies are and how cinema is powerful, visceral, contradictory, an wonderful media at its highest best status: being art and a deep look into a reality, much more than just entertainment. Love it or hate it but it's a real Horrorshow! 10/10",10,2,4,9 May 2011
The Untouchables," Ness, Malone, Wallace & Stone: The Untouchables
","'The Untouchables' is one the most complete films of the 1980's and one of the most unforgettable films of Brian De Palma. An Untouchable classic. It has an great ensemble cast, the 1930's period re-enactment is excellent, the magical music by Ennio Morricone and the incredible cinematography and editing. If you didn't see it you must see it now!1930. Chicago. During the Prphibition Al Capone (Robert De Niro) is flying high, making a lot of money with the bootleg of vast amounts of alcohol and of course the law is on his side (buying judges and corrupted officers). If you're against Capone get ready to run because he's implacable and kills those who betray him even bashing with a baseball bat the head of an colleague who failed in his duties. It's also the time of Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) an honest man working as Treasure Agent and he's in charge of putting Capone behind bars. Capone is untouchable, dishonest and got the most dangerous crew on his side. Ness has a chance? Well, now he has three good souls on his side and things can be very different and Chicago might be another good place to live again. Ness's companies includes Malone (Sean Connery), an old and smart street officer who's up for anything, sometimes following rules and other times creating his own rules; Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) an accountant that wants to arrest Capone for not paying his taxes; and Stone (Andy Garcia) the best shooter of the police force. These are The Untouchables and with them there isn't things that they cannot solve it, no one can buy them, and those who are at the wrong side of the law are going to be killed or arrested. Writer David Mamet opted for not writing the real story of the events or even make a film version of the series of the 1950's. Instead he opted for an original work about four simple guys fighting against injustice and facing mortal threats. And to tell a story like that in the 1980's was a completely risk of failure in the box-office if one considers that the movies of that decade that were real commercial success were muscular heroes like Rambo or Terminator and many others. But with Brian De Palma directing, a great story developed and a amazing ensemble cast 'The Untouchables' turned out to be one of the most remarkable movies of that decade and Sean Connery proved to be a actor even more talented than he is, and earn a Oscar in the following year.De Palma is known for his technique on editing, planning movies almost like Hitchcock (his idol) and here everything is done marvelously well. In the most climatic moment of the movie (the Stairway Shootout) he made a fantastic homage to 'The Battleship Potemkin' (Sergei Eisenstein's film). Here Stone and Ness are in a shooting against Capone's thugs and in the middle of this shooting are Capone's accountant (Jack Kehoe), a woman and his baby in a baby carriage that runs out of control in the stairs. Unforgettable! And of course Ennio Morricone's memorable musical themes. He was robbed an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1988. He has a tremendous job here, setting the music in the cold and dark Chicago atmosphere, and he knows how to use the variation of instruments in a same theme for different scenes (For instance: the 'Death theme' is used twice, two different scenes, but if you notice Ennio makes little changes with instruments). Brilliant!It's a mystery to me that there are people who simply just don't care about this film calling it superficial, or saying that everything was weak. I Disagree. I never get tired of watching this movie and see a great cast performing incredibly well, it has a good story (way better than some today's movies) and it's one of the best films of the 1980's. De Palma's top of that decade along with 'Scarface', 'Blown Out', 'Body Double', 'Dressed to Kill' and 'Casualties of War' A must see film! 10/10",10,4,5,30 May 2010
Zombieland," Quite exceptional
","It is fun, it has lots of qualities, sometimes is scary, other times is hysterically funny, but in the end you only get from 'Zombieland' an entertaining film that overused a few things that worked better in 'Shaun of the Dead'. Zombieland is America after almost all of its habitants were transformed into zombies after a virus, being the last human survivors of this place four people (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone) who have many issues of trust, fighting and surviving with their own rules, trying to escape from being transformed into disgusting creatures. Down on the road they'll met thousands of zombies, will go to Bill Murray's house and meet the real Bill (the funniest part of the film!), and try to have some fun in a amusement park. There isn't much of a goal here for these characters, although the film explicits one at its ending in a almost cheesy way about having a family, having company is what matters in life.The movie works its style of horror and comedy very well, good jokes here and there (Woody's tactics to kill the creatures; or Jesse's rules flashing on the screen all the time e.g. #1 Cardio, things like that), some hilarious moments but its premise gets very weary after a while, closer to the ending which is something very dangerous for the film's good impact on us. It gets stranded in this lack of purpose that one can only wonder: 'So, here's a bunch of characters, they try to survive in a place dominated by zombies and...?' It is entertaining and all but sometimes even entertainments can be and should be more than just that! 'Shaun of the Dead' got better results by being scary, funny, intelligent and surprising. Now, 'Zombieland' fires a lot but only hit a few points. The acting of all the ones involved is very pleasant and funny (Harrelson and Eisenberg being the funniest on scene), some spectacular scenes (the supermarket attack) and it is a nice film to spend a great time. Enjoy the little moments...nice and slow! 9/10",9,0,1,7 May 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I can't believe I lost an EMMY'S night for this!
","What a terrible mess this film was for me and for many people also. I mean what these producers (including Mr. Spielberg) were thinking? What Michael Bay was thinking? Too much money on their hands and the result was an excessive, endless, distractive and horrible movie? But I won't point my fingers only to these guys, I must say something to other people too. The blame of this excuse for a movie is on the shoulders of the two writers of this and Columbia Pictures/Sony for allowing a useless form of cinematic experience to been brought on screen. Is it really that bad? YES it is! I watched this thing for the whole time which means almost three hours of projection and the movie starts to become a boring and endless experience at 15 minutes. But I went ahead, almost crying for missing the EMMY'S (although I've seen some parts of the show and I could honestly say that it was a very good show). When Linkin Park song appeared and the credits rolled I was devastated. And along with that a annoying headache appeared and bothered me for some time. Reducing the plot: Two great team of Robots fights each other and the arena for this fight is our planet and our fate is on the hands of....Sam (Shia LaBeouf) who has in his pocket a fragment of one of these robots, and this fragment shows some secrets. Gathered with incredible and miraculous special effects there's a group of actors from the first (and excellent) film: Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Megan Fox (which is here only for the purpose of horny teenagers seeing her bending over a car; she barely has one decent dialog here). Hugo Weaving also makes the dubbing of one of the robots. And adding new elements and actors to the franchise there's a wasted performance of Rainn Wilson, Ramon Rodriguez (the movie could be better without him) and John Benjamin Hickey, who plays a hysterical bureaucrat, and has the worst performance in this film even beating Jon Voight for a similar role in the first film.There's no plot here. I mean, two Robots hating each other and their fight is going to be here just because someone has a little thing in the pocket? Thousands of plot holes and inconsistencies; thousands of unfunny and annoying jokes; overlong battles; nothing was interesting, and when I say nothing it really means nothing. The trailers offered a dark, sinister and interesting movie to watch, but the real deal is a waste of money, waste of time, waste of actors, waste of director and waste of health (for me who end up who with a headache, perhaps other person might had some nausea). 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is a disaster out of salvation. One time I was the biggest defender of Michael Bay's work, even when people called the 1st 'Transformers' of being the worst film ever. Everything he directed I truly enjoyed but after this one it is possible that I might not want to watch his future releases. But I know that the fault lies in the writers because nothing could be made of so great or interesting here. The loads of comedy thrown in this gigantic wreck is incredibly shocking, so shocking that you wonder if a robot wrote this movie and the writers is just names of a front like the ones used in the McCarthism.It's incomprehensible how people liked this incomprehensible adventure and made these the 23rd highest grossing film of all time. I'm writing these because I was there, I watched, I suffered through the whole thing and as a advice coming from the one who was in the battlefield of trying to understand if this was good or not I'll say to you: If you have the guts go for it, take all the necessary risks. But don't say I didn't told you so. It is really that bad. For the indecisive people trust me, you can skip this one easily like a root canal treatment. And I've never been in one! Awful! 1/10",1,1,9,30 August 2010
Con Air," Buckle up and enjoy the show cos it's a helluva of a ride!
","Greetings from the outer space! A long time without writing here so I'm back to give it a try with a movie that never failed to get my love, attention and
never lost its fun and charm all over the years. 'Con Air' was one of those big ass blockbusters produced by Jerry Bruckheimer back in a time when 'bigger, better,
faster and more' were the ultimate goal for him to generate budget and conquer audiences. I'm not saying that he doesn't do that anymore, but there's a certain
distance from the times he delivered the likes of 'Crimson Tide', 'The Rock' and 'Bad Boys' where the sense of adventure, real danger, spectacular sequences and
stellar casts were the main attraction even if the story didn't deliver much, lacked of bigger brains and as usual, countless jump cuts and plot holes - he's still
delivering more of the same but the quality of the material, the charm and innocence of the 1990's flicks (the lack of political correctness was a major turn on too)
were all gone; the team he has now, the directors and actors on his productions are too softened in those days where he basically lives of 'Pirates of the Caribbean',
some other franchises and super heroes who are the name of the game now. Action films were made with more humans beings than CGI. And that's why 'Con Air', despite its numerous flaws,
still stands out as a supreme moment in terms of entertainment, quality and memorable moments.The basics: Golf War veteran Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) spends some time in jail after accidentally killing a man who was messing around with him and his wife
(Monica Potter). When jail time's over, free is at the door when he takes a ride on a plane filled with the most horrendous and dangerous criminals, and their plan,
meticulously conceived by Cyrus 'the Virus' Grissom (a hilarious yet menacing John Malkovich) is to take over the airplane and escape from authorities. After all, the
majority of the group have long sentences to complete while Cameron is going on parole and his greatest wish is to return home to wife and the daughter he never met.
The hijack works and suddenly our hero Poe is destined to alert the good guys down there about what is going on. One of the guys is Vince Larkin (John Cusack), supervisor
of the flight and a good man who has the thankless job of dealing with the unpleasant presence of a careless Narcotics chief (Colm Meaney, also hilarious) who put an
inside man on the plane to track down the schemes of a powerful drug dealer. It's total chaos but for us in the audience is an endless thrills to joy the ride, how
Cameron is gonna make his good plan to work; how Cyrus' dangerous plan is going to work; and how Larkin is gonna manage to do his job without being bossed around by
clueless bureatric people.Gotta put into account that 'Con Air' was a baby created to be pleasant to its creators (obviously) and to ourselves as long we don't get too demanding on
what the film brings to us. One action sequence tops the other, it's extremely fast paced yet perfectly edited, a insanely sense of humor with one countless cheesy lines
and dialogues (never cringeworthy), and to the ones expecting some message behind all those rushes, changes and gunshots there's a positive message behind it all:
there's always someone with good intentions trying to make the best of nightmarish situations. Poe is not the selfish hero who just wants to leave the plan and go
back home; he's the one who always finds means to spread the message of a taken flight to the police and also save his sick friend (Mykelti Williamson) and the female
guard (Rachel Ticotin), hostage of the bad guys. And the Cusack character comes in a high and might intellectual way, though always knowing best but when it's time to
act he becomes a man of action. As for the humor relief - though 'Con Air' is not as heavy as one may think - Malkovich delivers all the goods, along with the ad-libs
from Dave Chappelle and the frightening Hannibal Lecter-traits coming from scene stealer Steve Buscemi. I grew up watching this and the forementioned films to the point
where I can watch repeatedly and the pleasure it's always the same. I might discover one or two new things, overlooked points, lots of errors obviously but I never get
tired of it. It reached to a point that few current films hardly ever get, which is to make you revisit the film time and again, absorb everything and that enjoyable
thing where you can repeat the most memorable lines every time you watch it. Not saying it's the greatest script ever written, but there's excellent quality stuff
that never gets out of your head ('Put the bunny in the box' or Buscemi's definition of irony when people are having fun while listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd).The core of this review goes to show how nostalgic one can be with a movie. I guess the majority of current viewers are only accostumed to see Nicolas Cage
wasting his talent with 'only in it for the movie' flicks and forget that for some decades he was a truly great actor, not just in action movies as this one and
'Face/Off' but also a heavyweight actor for all seasons in 'Leaving Las Vegas', 'Moonstruck' and 'Adaptation.'. I must say 'Con Air' joins the list of his best movies;
along with John Cusack who also was at one time a talented fella but his current wave of dark characters simply don't appeal to me. His heroic character is smart,
likeable and it's worth the adrenaline he goes through while following the plane's movements. I mean, let us be honest: how many times in recent you looked back at
a highly charged action flick that had all those best elements combined that made the profit this one had? The difference is that audiences don't care much about
getting lost in the enthusiam and the fun filmmakers are delivering to us, now we all follow only intelligent action films that lose in appeal or quality here and
elsewhere (sometimes they're not even all that good). And a pity that director Simon West (unknown at the time) never repeated a similar feat with his next films, they
were all dull and empty - but made money, possibly launched some careers.In all honesty, heart of hearts, 'Con Air' is one of the most exciting, humorous and heart-pounding action/adventure films of all time in my book. It brings the best of me in so many ways, I get the laughs, the suspense and I can even enjoy all the unbelievable goofs and silliness of it all - the descent in Las Vegas tops everything - and admire how bald West/Bruckheimer et all brought to the screen. Fasten your seatbelts, enjoy the flight and apllaud at the end. You probably haven't feel this good in ages with a movie in the past decade. Just maybe. 10/10",10,0,0,23 March 2020
August Rush," Pretty decent despite the corny theme
","Only the magic of movies could make a very unrealistic, unbelievable and improbable story become something joyfully good and very nice to watch. In 'August Rush', Freddie Highmore is an orphan boy who escaped the place he was living and goes to New York City where he'll try to find his parents, of whom he never met but he firmly believes they're alive. His search for them is based on following the music, as he says something he really loves, and he'll connect his mom and dad (who are apart of each other) through the music he plays. The movie gives us the vantage of knowing that the boy's parents were two musicians, a rock star played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, and a concertist played by Keri Russell, and both parted different ways after one night stand without knowing what happened to each other, and not even knowing they have a son. In the city, the boy will meet Wizard (Robin Williams), a drifter who uses street kids as street musicians and he'll be surprised with the boy's talent for music, 'contracting' his services and giving to the boy the artistic name of August Rush. As I said, an unrealistic story. But, at times we seem to forget that movies are only mirrors for life, showing a image of life but not really the real image, it's always a slightly distortion, which is why movies are movies and life is life. When people complain that a movie wasn't realistic pointing things here and there it's so annoying that one must ask to himself: What do you really want of a film life or entertainment? Because if we had to look at 'August Rush' as the real thing we would be disappointed but seeing as a beautiful voyage of the imagination, this movie works perfectly. It goes for obvious ways, avoids some clichés here and there but it gets trapped with some happy clichés (the climatic ending, though very exciting), it's kind of corny like some nostalgic films of the 1940's but it's always well intentioned. Shows us the beauty, the magic of hearing and perceiving music (to me, the most sublime of arts, if not, the most perfect. A quite harsh opinion coming from someone who really, really loves movies but that's what I believe) and the importance it have in people's lives. Not only August is touched by music but the other characters as well, even Wizard who teaches to August great things about how one must feel the music in order to play it. Music is out there and we need to listen!The thing I really like about this picture was the choice of actors in their roles, they're all perfectly fit. It's almost impossible to not like them. Highmore is one of the best young actors to ever appear on the screen and his presence makes the whole film; Rhys-Meyers is very charming and nice playing a man who turned his back to the music after not finding inspiration for composing when the love of his life vanished of his life; Keri is effective as her companion; Robin Williams goes okay in playing not much of a positive character, barely resembling the hobo he played in 'The Fisher King'; and we have the talents of Terrence Howard, Marian Seldes, Ronald Guttman, Alex O'Loughlin and Mykelti Williamson in secondary characters. And there's the good songs played throughout the film, one of them Oscar nominated for best song in 2008. Pretty decent movie with good qualities and that's a huge deal in times where films seem to have almost none. 8/10",8,1,1,28 July 2011
Shooter," Disappointing effort in mixing action and drama.
","Hollywood has told many times the story of one good man who fights everything and everyone in the pursuit of good deeds or saving the world and even something more. Sylvester Stallone in the Rambo series or Matt Damon in the Bourne series are some examples of such characters that follows the same path just like the main character in 'Shooter'.After a recent tragedy in which his partner was killed during an operation in Africa, Bob Lee Swagger(played by Mark Wahlberg), an ex-sniper special forces is approached by the Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover) to get back in action in order to prevent a possible attack against the American president. Initially, Swagger turn down the offer, but since he's the only one who can track down a possible killer and because of his know-how about machine guns he moves forward. The rest of the movie? Well, an not original story at all. Mark's character is involved in the assassination of the president (or attempt to an assassination of the president and the murder of a bishop, things very hard to understand), he has to fight with the people who contact him and discovers plenty of lies. We've seen this thing many times before. But worse than this, is the fact that this movie is filled with indecision. Antoine Fuqua, director of the brilliant 'Training Day', unfortunately couldn't make up his mind and keep wrestling with the viewers stating a dramatic movie in one way and then a violent action movie in other way. This indecision affected the whole movie. The first hour is enjoyable, very thrilling, but after that is all downhill, and then rises a little bit in the climatic scene near the ending (the scene where the villains are happy and everything seems perfect to them until Bob reappears). The movie's result? Disappointing. Despite the fact that a great ensemble cast is included (names like Elias Koteas, Rade Serbedzija, Ned Beatty, Tate Donovan and Kate Mara are also in the movie), and many great action sequences, this is a low action film that went in the wrong direction. Michael Pena, a great actor in movies like 'Crash' and 'World Trade Center', has one the worst first appearances in a movie. In the beginning his character seems completely lost, not knowing anything that happened during the president's attack and all of sudden we're told that he's a training agent. FBI would put a guy like that in such a operation? And then he starts to investigate the plot and then he looks like an good agent? C'Mon!And, of course, there's the reason why Bob was incriminated, which is quite good, but I don't think that's something interesting to be included in a supposed-to-be action movie. It may work to some viewers the political context, but if you don't like it stay away of this film.I'm giving four stars because Mark Wahlberg and Danny Glover were good in it, some action sequences are quite entertaining (the beginning and the shootout in the house in the middle). That's it!",4,2,4,29 March 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Fine experience but it'll never beat Lumet's classic
","Yet another clumsy remake of a powerful classic trying to emulate its steps, throw a big cast and big budget, make some improvements in order to cash 
in and maybe entertain its new viewers or mostly the ones who can't stand 'old films'. To talk about this 'Murder on the Orient Express' is kind of more of 
the same specially to those who watched Sidney Lumet's brilliant psychological study starring Albert Finney as famous detective Hercule Poirot. Most folks 
had seen that movie, gave it a shot to this one and thought 'well, there's something missing here' or 'it's not good enough'. Lead actor and director 
Kenneth Branagh had one thing in his favor while making it: speed. The story flows more like an adventure flick in some parts, with some great exterior shots 
at times ruined by weak special effects while Lumet's film was more like a play where you could catch every nuance of each actor and each character the more 
the classic story progressed - and to resume for those who haven't seen it, Poirot investigates the murder of a mysterious man on board of the Orient Express 
while the train is stuck in the snow, interrogating all of the passengers, important figures or people of little relevance. 
 
I'm not a detractor of Branagh's film, in fact, I had my share of good time with it and find it very stylish, impecable costumes and art-direction, and 
in times where plot twists are common place for the same type of project, to bring back a little bit of class and long dialogues is something that it's worth 
seeing. The cast doesn't disappoint despite not having one prominent performance in it - and that's why the 1974 film was the better one. Branagh is a fine Poirot 
but far too eccentric (and I'm comparing it with the books written by Agatha Christie, who presents him as a man of rituals and manners but Branagh makes him look 
like a Phineas Fogg, evidenced in his opening scene with the eggs); Johnny Depp, PenÃ©lope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Derek Jacobi, 
Josh Gad (finally breaking from his usual annoyance) are all good but no stand-outs here - maybe Dafoe grabbed my attention the most. 
 
However, I've found it an exhausting experience not just because I already knew what was going to happen but mostly the rush in presenting some things 
and slowing down anothers - the ending felt like a disappointment if compared back (sorry for the repetition) with the other film - of which I wasn't much of a fan 
during my first viewm neither the book (that chase sequence between Poirot and MacQueen was dumb). Lumet's 'canon' version never loses momentum despite the play aspects of it, you're intrigued through it all while Branagh reserves some 
thrills here and there and then it becomes a snooze fest halfway through. It's like much ado about almost nothing (no pun intended with Kenneth's previous film), I 
haven't felt it was a necessary film or one based of Agatha's novel that was needed to be remade - she has several great mystery books that weren't made into a film 
or just became TV projects, I'd like to see a version of 'After the Funeral'. Good news is that the movie's apparent success excited Branagh enough to the point of already announce that 'Death on the Nile' will come and perhaps new audiences will be interested in following the footsteps of the incredible Hercule Poirot. Challenge is: that one was already made in 1978, also an Oscar winning film and with a stellar cast; difference: as of now, I still haven't seen it. We'll see. 
 
Conclusion: 'Murder on the Orient Express' is fine, entertains but it's far from being on the level of quality and memorable works where a gathering of movie stars makes you feel impressed or overjoyed with the experience. 7/10",7,0,1,13 September 2018
Defiance," An Underrated Movie About Hope
","The 2nd World War themed movies are very difficult to discuss with everyone because people wants to know if it is a great movie, if it is accurate or even if it has great explosions and something like that. And moviegoers always selects their favorites. Classics like 'Stalag 17' and 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' or more recent 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line'. The director Edward Zwick placed us in several different battlefields in several different periods of history like the American Civil War in 'Glory', the First World War in 'Legends of the fall', and a samurai war in 'The Last Samurai'. In 'Defiance' he finally get to the Second World War. But instead of concentrate the story in shots and explosions he preferred to tell the true story of three Jewish brothers and their attempt to fight against the Germans and save other Jews. The result is a incredible movie but people doesn't seem to understand its grandiosity.In 1941, in Belorussia, the Bielski brothers finally succeed escaping the Germans hiding themselves in a forest. Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), Asael (Jamie Bell) and a younger brother are the Bielski brothers. Their parents were killed and now they're doing everything they can to stay alive. But other Polish Jewish families are appearing and the brothers helps them, provides food, security and a place to stay in the middle of the forest hiding themselves of the Nazists. Zus is a rebel soul and he wants to fights against Germans and so along with a few friends and their brothers they started to plot against the Nazists, getting a revenge of everything that was happening with the Jews at the time. Many things happens, Zus and Tuvia fights against each other because Zus still wants to fight against the enemies and Tuvia wants to help his people. They went on different directions: Zus joins with the soviets fighting the Germans and Tuvia and Asael help everybody that comes to them. This is a story about union, it's about hope in desperate times, it's about fight against your worst enemy and show to him that you're not defeated, that you can participate in the defiance and show that you're danger too. It's about suffering and resistance. And heroism in a certain way. The evolution of a people who were always educated to be servant as possible and the way they change this situation. OK, it might not be a sad story like 'Schindler's List' or a war movie filled with action like 'Enemy at the Gates' but it still is a great movie in both departments, dramatic and action. It might not be accurate (although it's based on true events) but at least it's entertaining. The battlefield scenes are very well filmed, and edited in a brilliant work, there's no 'shaky camera' in here. Why action and war movies have to follow this tendency of the shaky camera? It is supposed to people see the movie and not try to discover what's happening with the cameraman. That's why I enjoyed 'Defiance'. Zwick is a great director and he knows how to handle with a scene. The first fight against the Germans, when the brothers ambush an jeep, is fantastic, with great tension. James Newton Howard score was great (nominated for an Oscar), specially towards the end of the movie.The actors trio was good. Jamie Bell is always a pleasure to see, every work he does he plays marvelously well (although he has less screen time than the other actors); Liev Schreiber is great as the nervous brother, very impressive; and Daniel Craig does a good job, sometimes over acts, sometimes he really finds the way of his character. 'Defiance' also features Mark Feuerstein ('What Women Want') and Mark Margolis ('Requiem for a Dream') in small roles. I say give this movie a chance. Despite it has many slow moments and you might feel tired or bored of watching just be patient and you enjoy it every minute. 10/10",10,1,5,13 April 2010
Carrie," One of the most relevant horror films ever made
","Based on Stephen King's novel, 'Carrie' is a classic horror film directed by Brian DePalma and one of the greatest movies from the 1970's that still echoes in our minds and in the popular culture. If in many high school themed movies there's always a shy and lonely character who gets abused by everyone in the school and sometimes in the family we owe this characteristic to Carrie White, the main character played by Sissy Spacek. And if we sometimes identify with the tragedy of the character, with a possible chance for revenge the ones who are bad to us, you gotta recognize: you have a part of Carrie inside of you. I don't know how Stephen King idealized this story or his motivations but all I can say is that it works, it scares yet it makes you look at life with a different perspective. Carrie had a hard religious education at home with her mother (Piper Laurie, excellent) that looks more the devil himself than a woman who preaches the Gospel. And the teenage girl doesn't know how to behave herself during classes at school, or even taking a shower when she finally had her first period (a scene meant to be more dramatically sad than scary, except for the music) and she gets mocked by her colleagues all the time. The film evolves into a dramatic story but there's a catch. In the middle of the drama we find out that Carrie has special powers, she can move or break objects with the power of her mind, and that's something she can't control quite right and no one knows she has this ability. I'll won't spoil more things, I'm gonna let you see for yourself, but by this time you can possibly know what's the horror in this story.I must admit I had a total dislike over this film when I watched a few years ago; now I understand why it's an effective and powerful film, and why it was relevant in 1976 and still is today. DePalma released 'Carrie' on the same year of many great classics whose major themes were 'We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take this anymore!'. Carrie White is no different than Howard Beale ('Network'), Travis Bickle ('Taxi Driver'), Rocky Balboa ('Rocky') and the Woodstein team ('All the President's Men'). Strange mixing of films some might think but if you look back to all these characters and their struggle to challenge everything and everyone, is quite similar from one to another. In the scene where Carrie stood up and says to her mother that she'll go the prom with a boy for the first time in her life you can see the exactly same thing when Howard Beale shouted the most famous movie quote of that year. Gladly all these films were great, and were recognized with nominations and awards, and survived to tell how the American society felt at that time, and 'Carrie' even while being a horror movie knew how to be a important piece of filmmaking.As I mentioned in the beginning most films today has some qualities and characteristics that appeared here for the first time and the way DePalma presented the story was excellent, including homages to his idol Hitchcock (the music by Pino Donaggio reminds some parts of Bernard Herrmann's theme in 'Psycho', and by the way Herrmann was the original composer of the music of the film but died a few months before the filming begin). Not only the music, but the editing is also great, and one of the most awaited moments is the prom night, there are thousand of things in that scene that keeps you thrilled all the time, no matter how many times you watch. And at last the great casting composed by Spacek, Laurie, John Travolta, Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Betty Buckley, all wonderful. It's a very interesting horror film but more than that it is a historical study (in terms of film) over a period. 10/10",10,2,3,17 December 2010
Toy Story 3," Just Like The Other Films Of The Series: Never Fails!
","A whole generation grew up watching the great 'Toy Story' series in the 90's and then we entered in the 21st century and people at Pixar must have thought that kids wouldn't care about a film about toys. After all, kids nowadays have other kinds of things to do, now they use the internet, computers, video games, in short, the culture of toys changed a lot and that's why we had to wait for 11 years until the release of a third part of 'Toy Story'. People at Pixar needed to know if another movie would be plausible, meaningful now. But the wait worth all the while. 'Toy Story' continues being the animated film series that never fails, entering into a new generation without disappoint its previous, and end up being the most innovative and brilliant film of the series. Why we care so much about this phenomenon? Because it really touches a part of us that never dies, our childhood memories, our childhood toys and the all fun we had with them, some of the greatest moments of our lives. But then one day we grow up and must leave them all behind; some of us can do very easily, others take a longer time or always hide them in some part of the house keeping them as remembrance of a good time. 'Toy Story 3' using the famous toys Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and others, in this part of life when kids grown up and don't need these toys anymore, so Woody, Buzz and all Andy's toys are frightened with the possibility of going to the trash, or to the attic, or the last and more plausible option, being donated to a day-care center. But when Andy is deciding to keep the toys before going to college his mom takes all of them putting them in a day-care center that seems to be a great place to stay, all the toys there welcome them very well, including Barbie's Ken (voice by Michael Keaton) and a charming bear (Ned Beatty), but things are not what they appear and here starts the dangers of the lovely characters of 'Toy Story' who wants to back home to his previous owner.In its themes about rejection, changes of life and the things we miss in life 'Toy Story 3' adds humor, great jokes, an incredible adventure (the opening scene has to be most memorable moment in a transition of a wild adventure with the toys and than transformed into Andy playing with them as a kid) and a lot of emotion (very difficult not to cry at the final minutes). And, again, as the other films this is not just entertainment for kids, the series always knows how to grab a older audience, of all ages, it's fun for everyone. 'Toy Story 3' is the best Animation of 2010 and one of the Top 10 of the past ten years, but in terms of longevity, in touching themes that never gets old despite we think it might be, this film will echo in a long time. A great part of a successful trilogy that you must see anytime. 10/10",10,0,1,24 February 2011
Live Free or Die Hard," John McClane steps in the 21st Century. Still rocking!
","And who could have thought of seeing the 'Die Hard' franchise entering in the 21st Century. It took some time (12 years to be exact) to create a good and relevant plot destined to make a good follow up to one of the most beloved action films and characters of all time, John McClane, greatly played by Bruce Willis. With three outstanding films behind it, the fourth installment doesn't disappoint. However, it's quite soft if put along with the trilogy, this got an PG-13 rating rather than the usual R, so this might upset the hardcore fans of this great franchise.McClane's challenge here involves technology, to use it in his favor or to be used by it as his antagonist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) uses it to shut down the whole operative system of the United States, in what hackers call as 'fire sale'. As his sidekick McClane protects a young and rebel hacker (Justin Long) who might be of help in trying to figure what's going on with those attacks.'Live Free or Die Hard' is very fun to watch. One can respect and admire Len Wiseman's style of direction and his ability to coordinate impressive action sequences like rare films tend to present these days. But he's not John McTiernan, responsible for the two best 'Die Hard' films, combining violent and thrilling moments with powerful loads of humor. As said earlier, this 'Die Hard' is too soft for its own sake, too CGI oriented. Even so, Wiseman is best while moving this then directing the blasé 'Underworld' series.Is this a good return for McClane/Willis? Yes, it is! The perfect hero for this kind of plot. Old-fashioned. troublemaker and with his powers reduced in the strict sense of his job (then an detective; now he's an street police officer), McClane finds himself once again in the chaos, this time provoked by Gabriel, who took down the country's energy and all the systems that moves everything, controlling all the communication along with his team of experts that includes an deadly fighter (Maggie Q), and their plan to steal billions of dollars. The task is huge; it's no longer present on a building or an airport or a city; it's a whole nation to look after and a bad guy hidden somewhere, behind powerful technologies and machinery McClane does not know. To John, it's a good way to prove he's not too old for the job; to Willis is an interesting way to explore new boundaries, to show the great hero getting a little tired of his function, questioning what being a hero truly means. He loses in humor but gains plenty in drama. An admirable trade. The action? Breathtaking as usual such as McClane taking down a helicopter by using a car; the chase with a military plane trying to hit a truck conducted by the hero; the shootout at the hacker's house; and the ending (oh that memorable ending!) among others.If compared with the others 'Die Hard' this is a little weak; let alone it's an exciting and fun movie. Who can resist to this franchise and the unforgettable 'Yippie-Kay-Yay, Mother(beep)? 10/10",10,4,6,14 November 2012
300," Pure entertainment
","'300' is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the battle between the 300 men of Spartan versus a large number of Persians commanded by King Xerxes. The movie follows Miller's concept, both are not History lessons over a period, it's more concerned about how difficult it was the Battle of Thermopylae (occured in 480 BC.)Zack Snyder's action film is pure action with everything that is required of a action film, has fights, blood, visual effects in which most of the film was made, heroic speeches made by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), villainesque moments of Rodrigo Santoro and a voice-over that tells us about how powerful and magnificent the Spartans were. And this voice-over is the thing that was unnecessary and it almost drags the movie down for being a better movie than it is.Throughout the film there's a narration that goes on and off without care, appearing in some moments and disappearing in another's made by David Wenham. My complaint is not against him but it goes against the '300' writers of included such an awful element into the film, something that to me was like saying that the viewers are dumb and they need to be told what's happening at all time. Example: 'See how wonderful the Spartans soldiers were. They were so brave' and then you see the soldiers killing everybody' or right in the first line 'When the boy was born, like all Spartans, he was inspected.' and we see a boy who would become Leonidas. We already have the image so why insisting on using a narrator with a awkward voice (specially if you watch the Portuguese dubbing version which is quite annoying and I watched the original version and it's a little better) that keeps saying 'Do you understand what you're seeing?'?. I can't complain about the action sequences since most of the them were well made, with violent moments captured in slow-motion effects (but I felt bad when one of the soldiers was killed in front of his father, and it's a shocking scene considering that the film wasn't so much violent as I thought it would be); the drama involving King Leonidas wife and the senators back in Spartan was very good presented, balancing the tension of the battles with a conspiracy plan made by Dominic West character.You might not believe that everybody had washboard abs back in 480 BC., or that King Xerxes was transported in a strange vehicle carried by thousands of slaves but this film is not a historical film and don't tend to be. It amazes me how so many people wanted that '300' were an accurate film, and worst it's so ridiculous that whole controversy about how the Persians were portrayed and that whole political thing. This film is beyond this, it's a good and exciting entertainment. No more, no less. 8/10",8,1,3,11 January 2011
Happy Feet," Penguins Playing by the Heart.
","Animated films are becoming real great in this past 20 years. Warmful and moving stories, nice developed characters, a fantastic use of songs are many aspects of why every person should watch animated films these days. And 'Happy Feet' is one of those.A little penguin named Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) can't sing and singing is what makes a real penguin. But he can tap dancing just like Fred Astaire, something he does since he come out of the egg. His father (Hugh Jackman) disapproves, but his mother (Nicole Kidman) likes the dancing finding very cute. The problem is that penguins must sing his love song, because that's why they fall in love and eventually the specie evolutes. Mumble falls in love with Gloria (Brittany Murphy) a female penguin that has the most beautiful voice between the penguins. But a penguin couple can only exist if both penguins sings. Cast out of the group, Mumble found new friends, a group of friendly Latin penguins. But he can't give up Gloria because he's still in love with her and he's gonna fight with the elder penguins showing that he is also a penguin.This a moving film about love, prejudice, friendship, loyalty, and also about social preservation of the environment. Everyone will love it because it has funny moments, the animation is well made (it includes a very good segment with real actors) and there's many songs of artists like Prince, Queen and Earth Wind & Fire (sanged by the penguins). Here you can find action, adventure, romance, drama, musical, almost every cinematic genre in one movie. And, of course, a good message of what love can do to us (here in the form of penguins). Received a well deserved Oscar of Best Animated Film in 2007. George Miller (well known as the director of 'Mad Max' series and 'Lorenzo's Oil') debuts with animated films with the right foot. 10/10",10,1,1,3 April 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones Finds His Excellence
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' closes the trilogy of the 1980's movie with Harrison Ford playing the lead character a professor of Archeology involved in incredible adventures purchasing mythical objects and things like that. It ended very well until Spielberg returns with another adventure in 2008, good but without the atmosphere of dreams people had in the 1980's. In this one Indy is contacted by a millionaire (Julian Glover) to find the Holy Grail or most known as the cup from where Jesus drank-ed during the Last Supper. In the Grail contains a powerful water that can give eternal life for the one who drinks of it. Indy is reluctant but after he finds out that his father (Sean Connery) is missing after trying to go after the Grail, Jones embarks along with his friend and chief Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Dr. Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody) in the rescue of the Grail and Indy's father. And of course they're gonna encounter lots of fun and adventure fighting villains, Nazists and even get a book signed by Adolf Hitler. Most people admires this movie so much because of the introduction of Sean Connery to the series which added so much humor, intelligence and along with Harrison they form a great team together. People are right on this matter. Is definitely the best film of all four, not only because of that, but because it's fluency in presenting the characters without much talk and developing fantastic action sequences and funny moments are everything well made. Also it's Spielberg's favorite in the series. Before the adventure begins audience will found out how Indy got his scar on the chin, why all the fear of snakes and his taste for dangerous things. Young Indy is presented to audiences in the figure of River Phoenix in one of the most memorable sequences of the series where he fights a bunch of guys trying to protect a treasure. For those who can't figure out how he got out of the box remember: It was a magical box! He could go to anywhere on the train just entering in that and that's it. The CGI effects in some parts are very dated and you can see some of the 'flaws' (the scene with the war tank falling and Michael Byrne's character is screaming you'll notice a thin line on his side showing that the image was added by computers); at other moments you won't notice anything but still it is a fabulous film to see and enjoy and watch over and over again.My favorite moments are: all the escape Indy and Jones Father have to do (the scene in the airplane is most funny ever when old Mr. Jones didn't know to operate a gun and end up shooting on the tail of their own plane); the chase with the war tank (some funny moments with Marcus Brody character); the Holy Grail appearance (there's a great and subtle moral about how simplicity always win in the end of a matter, simple is safe). The whole package is wonderful. Another great example of what is missing in today's films that are filled with marvelous visual effects but lack with a great story, great acting and that fantasy thing that makes us enjoy the movie in its entirely. Spielberg and Ford got it right again with this film but I wished that the series could ended here, with the scene of the team along with Salah (John Rhys-Davies) riding into the sunset. That was a very good conclusion but the rest is history and one more film were included along with the excellent trilogy. 10/10",10,1,2,12 July 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," A Surprising Sequel
","The sequel of 'The Bourne Identity' takes the character played by Matt Damon out of his nice hiding with Marie (Franka Potente) when a professional killer finds them, accidentally shoots the girl and still goes after the hero. Bourne here goes on a personal vendetta revenging Marie's death but he's also framed in other mysterious schemes, one of them involving the murder of a Russian politic as part of his training with his boss Conklin (Chris Cooper's coolest character of the first film, here appearing in obscure flashbacks). To complicate Bourne's life even more CIA has a new agent (Joan Allen) tracking down all of his steps with the help of people who were trying to reach him in the first hunt, the Treadstone Operation (characters played by Brian Cox, Julia Stiles and Gabriel Mann). 'The Bourne Supremacy' has many surprises, plot twists filled with action, thrills and adrenaline and a good story, always turning away from what we wanted to see but fulfilling our desire to see what happens next (the huge blow was Marie's death, certainly I wasn't expecting that). Change of direction means also change of style, and in this case not so good one. Doug Liman, director of the first installment and producer of this one, steps aside and gets substituted by Paul Greengrass, a more dramatic director with a approach with a documentary style, now well-known for his Academy Award nomination for 'United 93'. If the first film was more like an adventure film with many cool moments, the sequel gets a more dramatic and tense tone (Thumbs Up for that) but the editing ruins the viewing a little bit. Some of the action sequences lost their excitement butchered in the editing room, and also the hand held cameras that seemed more suitable to film an earthquake than this film. Greengrass controlled his editing team better in the third film as we all know, Christopher Rouse won an Oscar for his brilliant work in that, it resembles a little bit this one but somehow he managed to make things better (also comes the fact that Richard Pearson helped him in the second film and not in the third, so there must be something wrong here).Besides this minor complaint, the film goes very well although I kept wondering where's the grand finale of it? Something more exciting or interesting could be made of the last minutes of 'The Bourne Supremacy' and that almost unfinished conclusion ruined my first viewing of it, but then I forgot about that because somehow this film gives us what we want, it is well made, take us to Europe, India, and U.S., has great sequences (the fight in the house; Bourne awesome tactics of fighting and escape), so what more I could ask? Well, basically nothing, and gladly they made 'The Bourne Ultimatum' that was the perfect conclusion of a great series.In terms of casting, Damon goes very well again in the main role; Joan Allen plays a brilliant character (but she doesn't have the same bite Chris Cooper had in the first film playing a similar role); Karl Urban playing one of the villains was extremely hot and menacing at the same time; and at last there's the dark-obscured-sad flashbacks of Cooper playing Conklin in an uncredited appearance which was very relevant to the story but they could make these flashbacks sequences way better than just blurry the image. I guess that there are still people out there who want to know who was that guy.If you want a surprising thriller, with fantastic action sequences and some solid acting this is the film you've always looked for. To me, it's very good but a little bit inferior than the previous and posterior films of Bourne series. 9/10",9,3,4,3 April 2011
Warm Bodies," Feel the magic of the bodies getting warmer!
","On the wave of hits like 'Twilight' and similar unconventional and impossible love stories involving different worlds, 'Warm Bodies' is a sweet tale on the love between a human and a zombie both living on an apocalyptical world. It's about zombie R (Nicholas Hoult) and human Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer) and how one saved the other's life amidst the conflict between their species and the Bonies, horrific and dangerous creatures more powerful than the zombies itself, slow in movement and speech and reduced to strange groans. It all started when R noticed the girl while they were under human attack and he end up killing her boyfriend (Dave Franco) yet saving her from being attacked by his own zombie friends. At first she doesn't understand his reasons since he can only mutter words, the most he can say is 'Not safe'. But since she's the daughter of the human's resistance leader (John Malkovich), a tough colonel, she needs to go back to the stadium where the few human survivors are based, at the same time R notices changes on his deteriorated condition, now capable of doing more human things like dreaming, expressing his thoughts in a better way and more. And now? Love and trust trying to survive in a shattered world that is about to face more conflicts and perils.What's underlined such simple story? True love and true respect that doesn't see appearances but sees actions, it's all about what's inside and not what's outside. It's different, it's far from the usual, you get suspicious but you try to know the other one and discover the world others have to offer. It seeks union in the difference, even at its most awkward. A good call to its target audience (teens) and the way they perceive changes and go through them. Invisible to majorities, sometimes alone in crowds, walking around like zombies and only getting truly noticed when they like someone, love, friendship or any kind of bond. Just a way to put it, not necessarily an universal truth, but appropriate.Easy going, profound and far from being corny like many of same traits, 'Warm Bodies' manages to be better than its original source, Isaac Marion's novel (good yet depressing), not betraying his intentions, changing a little here and there but being a little funnier. But they should have stick with Sinatra's songs (changed for obvious reasons but replaced by Springsteen and Guns N' Roses, equally great in my book) and also present R's zombie family and his adopted kids. Relatively impossible to happen but please, give Nicholas an award for his role in here. The first of its kind, here's an unusual zombie, one that invites you to his world and deeper thoughts, one you create an enormous empathy even when he kills people to survive. He was the perfect R, in movements, expressions, actions, reflections and all and we get a bonus because he's incredibly funny and charming while being an awkward and good-looking zombie. Palmer was a good companion to him, and Malkovich played a good antagonist but Rob Corddry steals the show from time to time as M, R's best friend. Interesting to see him playing a more restrained character, a little amusing, different from the loud characters he plays.One of the year's most entertaining films, greatly presented and acted, humorous and romantic despite the minor horror in it. 9/10",9,0,2,2 July 2013
All the President's Men," Powerful, Thrilling, Explosive and Still Relevant
","Based on the book of same name written by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, the film version of 'All the President's Men' is an account of the news coverage by The Washington Post on the Watergate scandal in 1972. Directed by Alan J.Pakula and one of the most important films ever made, this title is often mentioned in journalism classes and it is considered the greatest film about the press, and the students or future journalism students must see it and learn a lot from it.It shows how to make a tiny little story into a big one; the ethical aspects of a coverage; all the journalists tricks, relationship with sources; the way difficult texts must be written and how to connect thousands of facts and references altogether without confusing your colleagues, the editor and the readers. The reporters work is really like the one made by detectives, it's a complete investigation and the movie screenplay knew that and it made an impressive report about the investigative journalism. Bernstein and Woodward, the reporters who covered the story are played by Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, respectively and here we follow them from the day when the Watergate invasion happened and it was treated by the media as something irrelevant, of minor repercussion, until president Nixon's last day in the office resigning after his involvement in the scandal. In the middle of that comes the most interesting and dazzling aspect of the film and that is the whole investigation made by these two wonderful reporters, searching clues, questioning everyone involved directly or indirectly with the burglaries and the passionate commitment with the story that this young reporters have.Also presented in the film is the day-by-day of a newsroom, the work relationship between journalists, editors (played by Martin Balsam, Jack Warden among others) and the executive-editor Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards) who calls the shots of everything that comes out of the newspaper, interfering in the story when needed. And at last but not least, on the top of the most precious aspect of the whole news coverage is Woodward's informant the mysterious Deep Throat (Hal Holblrook eclipsed in shadows), a confidential source who helped the story follow its path into the media as being one of the greatest politic scandals in America. Now everybody knows that he was an important FBI director but back then in 1972 only Woodstein (as the two reporters were called) knew who Deep Throat was. And the meeting scenes are very well made giving tension to the audience, everything they were doing was risky and the people involved with the scandal were very dangerous and since you couldn't trust in your own government in who will you trust? No one. Pakula was a master in balance thriller and drama without disappoint the viewers in all movies he made, but here you got his best work. But I must thank writer William Goldman for finding the right way of presenting a story filled with references, names, situations without making something boring. The way Goldman dealt with such an complete and very hard to handle material was brilliant. It inspires journalists and future professionals of the area until today. But I advise you to make a research about everything involving the Watergate story if you never watched the film before because it involves a lot of political references and if you don't know one name you might get very lost, but nothing so compromising that makes you being pushed away from this classic.Hoffman and Redford were at their best moment, both are great and there's no way you can compare who's best on scene, they're equally great. Jason Robars won the Oscar of Supporting Actor for playing the journalist mentor and chief, and every time I watch his performance here I found it better and better, an well deserved Oscar. Along with Robards's Oscar 'All the President's Men' also won the award for Best Art-Direction, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay (the second award for Goldman). Tough contender at that year along with 'Taxi Driver' and 'Network', these three wonderful films were wronged and lost out the top prize to 'Rocky'. One of the clues that Woodward gets with Deep Throat about who were involved in the scheme is 'Follow the money!'. Looks like the Academy followed the money that year and gave the Best Picture Award to 'Rocky' who had the biggest box-office in 1976. I like both movies but 'All the President's Men' stands out for being more courageous, more powerful and still relevant to the date. 10/10",10,3,4,13 November 2010
Semi-Pro," Sit back and Enjoy it! You Might be Surprised.
","I have never heard of this film until a few months ago when it was exhibited on TV. Actually it was a large campaign over this movie but still I didn't wanted to watch for some odd reason. But one Sunday afternoon after I got bored while watching the first 10 minutes of 'Gengis Khan' (1969) I switched channels and found out this movie and started watching. As a result I discovered that this was a surprisingly funny movie and very delightful to watch. By that I mean that I was really laughing because it was very funny and saved the day. 'Semi-Pro' is an sports related comedy staring Will Ferrell as Jackie Moon, an singer who has used the profits from his one hit single 'Love Me Sexy', to buy a basketball team in Flint, Michigan becoming the owner, head coach, and starting power forward. Facing the fear of have his team dissolved because of the poor results, and under the menace that the team might not enter in the National League (only four teams will be selected to join NBA), Jackie hires Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson), a former player winner of a big championship in order to elevate the team's result. Monix not only is gonna be player but also he's gonna coach the team. The real fun things about this movie is the way Jackie promotes his team by using a bear as an attraction, the strange uniforms and the dances the players have to do. The movie also puts focus in the sports newscasters (something I always pay attention in sports themed films). Here they are played by Will Arnett (as Lou Redwood) and Andrew Daly (as Dick Pepperfield). Their punchlines are one of the best things in the movie, sometimes fighting with each other and other times agreeing with the opinions.The basketball games are nice and fun to watch (special the last match with the creation of the Alley Oop). But the funniest scene in the movie is a discussion between Lou and one of the players of the team while playing cards. In this moment, Lou is angered with something that this player said and pulls a gun threatening him. When it's revealed later that the gun was unloaded, everybody who were playing cards start to joke with each other saying disrespectful things to one another and pointing the gun to themselves and pulling the trigger was hilarious. This scene could went in the wrong way, and turn out to be a tasteless and unfunny thing, but the way that it ended was very good, very funny and very well made. This is a movie to sit back, watch it and enjoy it. If you don't be too demanding you're probably gonna like it. 10/10",10,1,1,31 March 2010
