The Perks of Being a Wallflower," This film is infinite.
","One night, I thought 'Hey why don't I buy a quick film on the TV, one that I've already seen will do fine' and then I saw a trailer for 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' and I thought, 'Oh why not, it looks average and I might as well give it a shot'... THE TRAILER DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE! As soon as it began, I was sucked into another world and I felt as though I was going through a journey with Sam, Charlie and Patrick. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the whole length of the movie. Although it seems a rather light hearted film, it deals with issues such as Homosexuality and mental health very maturely which just makes the film all that much more better. The acting was superb and Erza Miller, Emma Watson and Logan Lerman had such a great on screen chemistry which was beautifully complimented by the actors with less screen time. This film is officially my favourite movie, EVER, and if you watch it and it didn't at least place in your top 3 I would be surprised. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING ON!!! Go see this film. Now. It doesn't matter how you do it, but you won't regret it. Stop reading. Please. GO WATCH IT!!!!",10,1,3,10 April 2013
