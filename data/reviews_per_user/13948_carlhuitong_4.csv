Men in Black 3," MIB spirit
","Before watching MIB3,i re-watch MIB1-2 and remind about the story and characters. It has been a decade since the last MIB film was released. Agent J is still Agent J (Will Smith) and 'Agent K' divides into younger and older ones. Yet,the spirit of Agent K is still there that he works with other Agents to maintain law and order and even save the Earth.The sequel uses another perspective - a generic time traveling story like Source Code,The Terminator,Back to the Future and such like. Even though time-travel plots are commonly used by filmmakers, MIB3 combines this features with its original selling point - arrest villain and protect the Earth secretly. Use of neutralizer and black glasses AgentJ,K wear are retrospective of the MIB series.Aside from these features, MIB3 still keeps the background theme music played in MIB1-2 and the text at the beginning and the end of the film. More importantly, the charming smile of Agent J and straight-faced old Agent K still imprint on our mind.",7,2,4,4 June 2012
Minority Report," One of the most impeccable science fiction films
","It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, then moving pictures are worth a million words, which is why it may generate at least a million words.Steven Spielberg conducts another cinematic masterpiece and the movie is one of the most beautifully crafted movies ever made. It is an engrossing story about a system called 'Precrime' seeing into the future and predict crimes beforehand by three gifted humans (called 'Pre-Cogs') with special powers.At the beginning,the film gives a snapshot of the background in the year 2054 A.D where technology is highly advanced and the state-of-the-art compared to that nowadays. For instance,hand-touch screens,automatic traffic moving system and sci-fi weapons will have commonly used in the foreseeable future.The content is unquestionably amazing.The background sets in the year 2054 A.D and the 'Precrime' with highly advanced technology prevent crimes,usually murder cases, from happening. But,will the system realize when i become a hoary-headed old man? I reckon everything will happen.The story is undoubtedly impeccable,but a little bit complicated.It raises some questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society issues. For example, can the authority declare guilty of someone who 'may' murder via the 'Precrime' that affect their whole life? is the 'Precrime' flawless if some officers use the system to help their friends or relatives with their authority,just like Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise)?? How the government monitor the system which might be mis-used and cheated??The casts craft a visually stunning movie that give a amazing plot portraying the US authority tries to stop murder cases from happening. Steven Spielberg still makes film noir via sci-fi means. Tom Cruise shows his talent through vivid performances and he delivers a first class performance as usual to the audience. Also,other professional actors and actresses,like Max von Sydow and Neal McDonough show their unique idiosyncrasy.In a nutshell,the movie is perfect and worth watching.",9,1,2,12 June 2012
Taxi Driver," Reflection of morality
","Taxi driver is a cinematic masterpiece ever made,including impeccable screenplay,incredible directing and excellent plot, acting. Travis played by Robert DeNiro ,who is one of the most famous actors, shows talent through vivid performances. At first,I deem the movie is some kind of an enigma,revealing a man full of loneliness suffering from insomnia. In order to fill his emptiness,Travis toils for 10 hours or above in the cab . Just like cabbie Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) in Collateral(2004) who deludes himself into believing that his now twelve year cabbie job is temporary and that someday he will own his own limousine service,both are cabbie and drive the taxi purposelessly,or just earn a living.Regarding Travis,he is an an ex-Marine middle-aged man and become more eccentric when falling in love with Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palatine. She plays an important role in highlighting Travis's utter alienation from society,along with disappointment with the words by the Senator. He does something odd that save twelve-year-old prostitute,Iris. Even though his intention(bail her out of peril) is appreciative,can he kill so-called 'scum' violently and unlawfully ? And then he is hailed as a hero fighting against the gang.I really doubt that this social mind. Everyone has flaws regardless of your race,nations,social status and loneliness. We should give a chance for those who go astray to engage themselves in self-reflection. Yes,we might despise the scum but cannot kill them.There are alternatives.Another important point is that disaffected mind is of paramount importance in today's world. But,hardly can we observe this valuable behavior in the world,especially in China. Take 'YueYue incident' in 2011 as an example,social moral degrades and hearts are corroded. We need Travis's disaffected mind and appreciative attitude towards our society and world.",8,0,0,9 June 2012
Looper," Can be better
","Looper is one of thought- provoking movies in recent years. Although it has some defects in the story plot, it is overall entitled to a slick piece of good sci-fi film. ( not a masterpiece ) The story to some extent is hard to fathom the whole backgrounds and implications. It irks me to try to understand why this happens, how this comes from. The whole premise of the film is not satisfactorily explained. For example, the background of 2074 society and gangs which send 'loopers' to 2044 to deposit dead bodies make me confessed. Meanwhile, the 'Rainmaker', as well as his mother, are not fully explained and how do they relate to the time traveling. And the 'Bruce Willis style', like the Die Hard and the Expendables is not necessarily extended so long. 'Looper' is not an action, but a sci-fi. The most fatal part is time-traveling paradox. Present Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Future Joe (Bruce Willis) are messed up. Their relationship in general is very hard to fathom and lacks in verisimilitude.As many reviewers said, Looper is a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece. I agree to certain extent. Even if there are some defects, Looper is still vastly superior to any of the higher profile action released in recent years. Present Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) adds bonuses to the film through his vivid performances, along with typical Bruce Willis's action style.",8,1,2,26 December 2012
