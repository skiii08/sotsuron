Requiem for a Dream," hypnotic tale of desperation
","Requiem for a dream is a hypnotic story about four people desperately pursuing their vision of happiness. It links the lives of a lonely widowed mother, her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyrone. Each one of them begin to fall apart largely due to drug addiction. Each one of them is on a dangerous free-fall but none of the stubborn addicts can change their habits. Shot in Coney Island, Brooklyn with a unique style and flair, Darren Aronofsky directs a very effective film. Although lead actors Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are good in the movie, it is Ellen Burstyn as the widowed mother who steals the show with a powerful performance. Director of photography, Matthew Libatique is on top of his game with his imagery and the musical score works perfectly with the film. Good Stuff!",8,0,0,12 May 2008
A Clockwork Orange," a bit of the old ultra-violence
","A Clockwork Orange is one of those rare films that you really can't compare anything to. It is so unique in a good way. Watching it is kind of like having a surreal dream but one you wake up remembering. Malcolm Mcdowell is cast perfectly as Alex, the leader of a group of violent punks who both admire him and are afraid of him. Alex is chosen to participate in an experiment that will cure him of his violent behavior by brainwashing him to be a proper citizen. He is forced to watch hour after hour of violence on a movie screen until just the pure thought of violence makes him want to vomit. There's more to the experiment then that but that's the gist of it. The group of punks even have their own language that they speak to each other but not so obscure that the audience can't grasp it. When the controversial film was released, it sparked much violence in England where a few too many audience members were inspired by Alex and his gang of punks. The director, Stanley Kubrick, forbid the movie playing there again to his dying day. You'll never think of the song 'singing in the rain' in the same way again and you'll see why. Let's hope the day doesn't come when this movie isn't made into a lame remake starring Leonardo Decaprio. GOOD STUFF!",8,0,1,20 June 2008
