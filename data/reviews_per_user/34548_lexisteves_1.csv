Requiem for a Dream," don't watch this one alone
","I am not writing this review to actually talk about the techniques used by Darren Aronofsky to make this amazing film but about the effectiveness of his film making. All of the techniques in the world are not going to make a good film to me unless it makes me feel something.This was one of the first movies where I was left feeling utter despair. The type of despair that you feel after losing a loved one to cancer, or to another woman. The type of absolute despair that leaves you doubled over unable to make a sound. I saw it alone one night, from midnight to two in the morning,(being the brilliant genius that I am), and what I wanted to do afterwards was talk about it with ANYONE, and I ended up crying myself to sleep because of the void that it filled me with. It was disturbing to see the things that people are addicted to (heroin, hope, food, affection etc.). The horrifying part was the length to which all of the characters went in order to not give up. To not give up on dreaming of a better way of life; a sure fix that will solve all of their problems. The drugs were not what the characters were ultimately addicted to; they were an immediate problem that dulled a deeper sorrow.When I woke up yesterday morning after watching it the night before, I looked outside and was wonderfully appreciative to see the sun, and to see that life went on around me. It was the ultimate 'f*&% you' to this film. That is not to say that I did not appreciate it, but like a funeral, or an experience in which your life was at stake, you will want to express your thanks for being alive and healthy, if that is your current state.All of what I planned to write seemed to be much more profound than what I am actually expressing, but what it comes down to is that I envy anyone who would be able to walk out of this film feeling unaffected. Either they are the most pretentious people to ever walk the face of the earth, or they have faced demons I hope to never see and have come out triumphant. If you do not fit into either of these categories, then see this film. However, make sure that you have the stomach to watch it, and a shoulder to possibly cry on when it's over.",9,0,0,4 March 2003
