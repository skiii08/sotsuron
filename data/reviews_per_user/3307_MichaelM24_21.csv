Raiders of the Lost Ark," simply the greatest film ever made
","If I had the power, I would crown RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK the absolute greatest film ever made. Well, that'll never happen, but it has in my mind. It's basically the blueprint for how to make a great action movie. Other than STAR WARS, this was the film I was most-obsessed with when I was little. I remember wearing my Indiana Jones-style Fedora and my little shoulder bag, using a whip my dad had to swing around in the backyard while I sang John Williams's world-famous 'Raiders March.' I was only two years old when the film came out, so I never had the chance to see it up on the big screen the way it was meant to be seen. I find it so entertaining because it has a little bit of everything: action, adventure, horror, suspense, and even a bit of romance. It's got the perfect actors playing the perfect roles, the story is good, the music is excellent (my all-time favorite soundtrack, too), the direction is top notch, and the pacing is great. There's not a dull moment in this movie. Even the quiet dialogue scenes are enjoyable, with some of the best lines ever written ('I am but a shadowy reflection of you. It would take only a nudge to make you like me. To push you out of the light.') or improvised ('It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage.') The supporting cast is great as well, and the villains are appropriately creepy, and Belloq is one of my favorite screen villains. Not because he's menacing, but because he's just as interesting as the hero of the film. Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones is, without a doubt, one of the greatest--if not THE greatest--matches between actor and character. The action pieces are great as well: who can forget Indy's escape from a booby-trapped South American temple, or his fight with a huge Nazi mechanic near the deadly blades of a giant Nazi plane, or the thrilling truck chase through the desert which is still my favorite action sequence of all time. (As if you couldn't tell, RAIDERS has a lot of things that I rank as my 'all-time favorites'). I'm shocked that there have been no plans to rerelease the film in the theaters for it's twentieth anniversary this year, and that there's still no plans for a DVD release. How could RAIDERS not get both? The greatest film ever made certainly deserves it.",Null,0,0,2 July 2001
The Others," Nicole Kidman delivers, the movie does not
","THE OTHERS is certainly one of the best-looking ghost movies in years. Rich with atmosphere, you easily feel as if you really are inside a WW2-era English mansion. Without a doubt, the atmosphere is the next best thing in the movie besides Nicole Kidman. She scores a bullseye with her performance as a mother of two young children living in a mansion on one of the English Channel islands, a mansion which appears to be haunted. Her daughter claims to have seen some of the spirits, and the new team of helpers who have arrived know more than they're letting on.Unfortunately, the well-set up film fails to deliver. The story meanders seemingly forever, and I can't even recall how many times I found myself glancing at the clock to see how much time had passed during the first thirty minutes alone. The pacing is terrible. Some scenes go on too long. Others just fail to be effective. The suspense is almost non-existent with the possible exception of a few moments here and there, but even then it's rather lackluster, with only some good performances to keep you awake.Alakina Mann and James Bentley are good as the kids, though why must one of them always be a little brat who likes to torment the other and mouth off? It's getting tiresome. Fionnula Flanagan is the next best element of the film, but otherwise, there's not much to get out of the movie. The story drags and drags until the final ten minutes or so when things finally began to pick up, only to lead to a twist ending that (while unexpected) seems just as much of a cop-out as the ending to THE SIXTH SENSE. Thanks to that overrated film, ghost story movies now feel they must offer a 'shocking twist ending.' At best, this could have worked as a short film of about fifteen or twenty minutes. But as it is, it's just like THE SIXTH SENSE: nice to look at, but ultimately completely unsatisfying.",Null,0,0,19 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas somewhat redeems himself
","Well, I'm not ashamed to admit, ATTACK OF THE CLONES wasn't quite as bad as I had thought it would be. It was certainly an improvement after the over-the-top, ritzy-ditzy, incredibly-awful EPISODE I, but still not as good as the original trilogy. It had an even balance of ups and downs, making for quite a mixed bag in my opinion.THE GOOD POINTS: The special effects weren't as overkill as they were in EPISODE I, and I liked the darker tone the film had. But for me, the best thing about this film was Ewan McGregor. Although I liked him in THE PHANTOM MENACE (the only other principle actor I liked in that movie besides Liam Neeson), he was much better this time around. At times, I felt as if I was actually watching a young Alec Guiness, and I could easily buy that this was the same war-hardened Obi-Wan we'd be seeing again in EPISODE 4. I know these prequels are about Anakin Skywalker, but I would have been perfectly happy if this film (and EPISODE III) focused entirely on Obi-Wan. He was terrific.Watching Samuel L. Jackson kick ass with a lightsabre was cool (and one of the things I was really looking forward to), but it was a moment that could have been much better. His fight with Jango Fett was too short. Temeura Morrison was good as Fett, but the character was rather underused I felt. He needed more presence in the film, and he should have been saved for EPISODE III, as he had the makings of a really interesting character. Jar-Jar, thankfully, is barely on-screen, though he's still a cringe-inducer when he is. And one of my favorite scenes is the one with Yoda and the young Jedi kids.The chase through the city on Coruscant was pretty good, but went a little over-the-top with Anakin successfully managing to catch a falling Obi-Wan, and Anakin, moments later, diving headfirst through the city. He must have an excellent sense of timing, because judging from the distance he fell and the time it took him to get there, the vehicle he was jumping to was nowhere near the vicinity of them. And even if it was, it would have been long gone before Anakin could have even thought about jumping out.THE BAD POINTS: Hayden Christensen was quite bad, more so in some scenes than others, but overall proved to be a bad choice. I didn't buy for one second that this is the kid who will become the fearsome Darth Vader just a couple years down the road. Perhaps if his murder of the Tusken Raiders had actually been shown (and not just the two we did see), it might have helped a little. His emotional scenes were unconvincing, as were his scenes with Natalie Portman, who was as dull as she was in EPISODE II. And why must her hairstyle/wardrobe change with every scene? It really gets laughable after awhile, especially with that pseudo-dominatrix outfit during the fireside scene.The always-watchable Christopher Lee arrived too late in the film, doing what he could with Count Dooku, another underused role that should have been a lot more menacing than it was. A weak villain, though better than Darth Maul. Yoda fighting Dooku was one of most hysterical moments I've ever seen on film. Using the Force to block objects being thrown at him was good (reminiscent of the confrontation between Luke and Vader in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK), but once he started bouncing around like Jim Carrey in THE MASK with a lightsabre, the sequence instantly well apart. And Anakin going double-lightsabre on Dooku was rather annoying, something you would expect in a John Woo movie, not a STAR WARS movie.And when will filmmakers learn that humans riding on the backs of thrashing animals doesn't look at all convincing? Whenever the film was with Anakin and Amidala on Naboo (and, later, Tatooine), the pace dragged badly. When it was with Obi-Wan trailing Jango Fett from one planet to the next, it was great. Obi-Wan's subplot was, for me, the most entertaining aspect of the film.Composer John Williams seemed to be on autopilot for about the first hour or so, with music that seemed to do little beyond providing atmosphere. Only around the time of Obi-Wan and Jango Fett's first confrontation (my favorite sequence of the whole film) did he seem to finally get going, coming back with a couple of the themes we all know and loved, though a better use of them would have been nice.Seeing it once in the theater was enough, but being as how Obi-Wan was just so damn awesome, I'd probably buy the DVD just to have his moments.All-in-all, I give it a 3.5/5",Null,0,1,12 June 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," a full-filled family movie
","The majority of so-called 'family' or 'kids movies' recently have been full of lame-brained 'jokes' such as bathroom humor and gross-out stuff. In MONSTERS, INC., we have a terrific family comedy that kids and parents alike can enjoy, with not a single gross-out joke or spot of bathroom humor to be seen. Kids will like the comic situations, and parents will get some of the more grown-up jokes, but both will delight in a fun-filled adventure about monsters and the world they in. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are spot-on with their vocal talents, with Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, and veteran James Coburn rounding out the supporting cast. It all moves at a pretty good pace and has good honest laughs scattered throughout the story. One moment may be a tad scary for real little kids (the scene where Buscemi's Randall is threatening to physically extract Boo's screams from her), but the film is pretty light the rest of the time, with everything building up to a fun, thrilling climax involving the millions of closet doors the monsters use to enter the real world. A good-spirited kids movie that the whole family can enjoy.",Null,0,1,11 March 2002
Cast Away," great movie
","I don't think I need to give a plot synopsis; I'm sure you know what it's about. Tom Hanks (as usual) gives another good performance. Seeing him struggle to live on the island, the film generates a good deal of sympathy, and you find yourself really feeling for him. The airplane crash sequence is intense. Helen Hunt was just her usual self, but she's not too bad. Alan Silvestri's score (what little there was, about 15 minutes or so, and none of it heard until the final half-hour) was effective. My only complaints: the final half-hour was a bit overlong, and I wish that instead of cutting from Chuck's early days on the island to 'Four Years Later' that they had shown a montage or something to let us see what all he went through during that time, especially how he found a way to set up a calendar system using the sunlight in the cave. But that aside, CASTAWAY is a great film that, at 2 hours and 25 minutes, flies by like 15 minutes. Robert Zemeckis remains high on my list of favorite directors.",Null,0,0,13 July 2001
U-571," one thrilling movie
","U-571 was the most fun I had at the theaters all year long in 2000. No other film gave me the same amount of excitement, though VERTICAL LIMIT came damn close. I enjoyed U-571 so much I went back at least two more times to see it. It was a thrilling movie with a lot of action and a pulse-pounding pace. Matthew McConaughey and the entire cast was great in this film. Who cares if it wasn't historically accurate? I'm tired of hearing people complain that the film denied the British's involvement in being the first to steal an Enigma code machine. That's true, but obviously those complainers missed the dedication at the end before the credits that directly says they were responsible for the first Engima victory. This is supposed to be a movie, not a historical document, people. Even the director knows that, saying in an interview that it was his hope people would see the film and become interested in learning how things actually happened in real life. He knew the film wasn't a documentary, and more people need to learn that as well. Anyway, U-571 is thrilling entertainment, a nice throwback to the WWII films of the 50s. The action is adrenaline-pumping, the score is full of heroism and tension, and the film is so fast-paced it flies by before you know it. The DVD looks and sounds magnificent. Even all the way to the end of the year, U-571 remained the best, most fun movie I saw all year long.",Null,1,2,16 July 2001
Spider-Man," the ultimate comic book movie
","One word best describes this movie: awesome. I haven't had this much watching a comic book-inspired movie since probably THE PHANTOM. Relieving the bad taste left behind by X-MEN, SPIDER-MAN is a powerhouse of what every comic book movie should be. It's amazing how faithful the movie remained to the source material, with only very minor alterations that don't become a problem thanks to Sam Raimi's mastery of the rest of the film. Knowing the film opened with a good deal of focus on the origin story, I was fearing a long drawn-out exposition with lots of talk and little excitement. But watching the development of Peter Parker from a nerdy everyday teen to a man learning to deal with incredible powers was just as exciting as watching Spider-Man and the Green Goblin fight it out over Times Square.Tobey Maguire makes an appealing Peter Parker, someone we can instantly identify with. We feel sorry for him when he's harrassed by the school bully, and we root for him when he gets the upper hand during a fight with them. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary-Jane Watson (even though the character was not Parker's first love interest), and though her portrayal of the character is a little different from the comics, it's still one that should win over most of the die hard fans. The always-watchable Willem Dafoe is a delight as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. What could have been a typical over-the-top, maniacal super-villain is instead an intriguing struggle between Norman's good and bad side. The scene in which Good Osborn talks to Evil Osborn in a mirror is terrific. James Franco is also good as son Harry Osborn, one of Parker's few true friends. Veteran screen actor Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons (as J. Jonah Jameson, a part I always thought character actor Peter Jason would be perfect for) round out the good supporting cast, with Raimi usual Bruce Campbell doing a great little cameo. Spider-Man creator Stan Lee also has a blink-and-you-miss-him cameo during the parade attack. Watch closely.With references to Dr. Curtis 'The Lizard' Conners and (apparently) Eddie 'Venom' Brock, and MJ calling Peter 'Tiger,' among other references, screenwriter David Koepp obviously did his research in writing the story. Many moments throughout the film are taken verbatim from their original source, and while some may see that as lazy, I see it as excellent: staying nearly 100% true to what has already been established, whereas BATMAN and SUPERMAN had their origins and other things altered for the film versions. The CGI of the film was much better than I had been lead to believe. I've heard complaints that the CGI Spidey was terrible, but it was incredible. Although I feel CGI will never replace live actors, recreating an entire human form and making it appear fluid (at least in regards to making these characters act the way you would expect) now appears very doable.All-in-all, a really incredible film that that has set a new standard for comic book-to-film adaptations that I think will be very hard to pass. Let's hope the sequels maintain quality, unlike the BATMAN films. 10/10.",Null,0,0,13 May 2002
Batman Begins," 'Batman Begins' after 8 years . . . but was it worth it?
","I cannot remember the last time I was so disappointed with a movie. I went into BATMAN BEGINS with pretty much no expectations, and I was very disappointed. I actually felt sad on the way home afterwards because I was so disappointed. I really can't even think of much that I did like. Christian Bale was alright, but the only scene where he really shined as Batman was when he interrogates a crooked cop atop a fire escape. But otherwise, he was just so-so as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. I missed seeing Michael Gough as Alfred, but Michael Caine was the highlight of the film, without question. My favorite scene of the whole film is in a flashback where Alfred tells young Bruce that his parents' murder wasn't his fault. The rest of the cast was okay, except for Katie Holmes, badly miscast as a District Attorney. Gary Oldman fared pretty well as a pre-Commissioner James Gordon (he certainly looked the part), but he's given almost nothing to do and seems to only be in a handful of scenes. Rutger Hauer is the CEO of Wayne Enterprises in a subplot that isn't needed at all. I couldn't help but feel that a lot of the movie was just padding that could have easily been trimmed out.As for the villains, we get the Scarecrow, Ra's al Ghul, and Carmine Falcone, a local gangster. Now, I know the point of this movie was to make it Batman's film, but the villains were handled so badly I practically felt cheated. The Scarecrow, one of my favorite of Batman's Rogues Gallery, is seriously wasted. He's no longer the Ichabod Craine-looking college professor, but instead a sophisticated-looking pretty boy psychologist. In the comics, his poisons cause people to experience their greatest fears. Here, they simply make people act crazy more than anything else. Ra's al Ghul is also wasted. He appears to be killed early on, but turns up later in an unnecessary plot twist that reveals Ducard (Liam Neeson) is really Ra's, the one we saw killed having only been a decoy. Thus, Ra's is absent for a good bulk of the film, and as a result fails to make much impact as a villain. Even worse, the 'villain' shifts constantly, from being Falcone to Scarecrow to Ra's, instead of just giving us one for Batman to deal with, the way it should be. This was the problem with the third and fourth Batman films, and I was very surprised to see them falling for it again in this film. (Anybody remember how well it worked out for the first BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN when when you've only got one villain?) It just really ticked me off how they handled the villains, because they were using two of the most interesting ones. We saw glimpses of Scarecrow's potential in a few moments, and when he finally gallops into the thick of the action at the end, on horseback and (finally) in full Scarecrow costume, we expect to really see things hit the fan. But what happens? He gets zapped with a stun gun by Katie Holmes and runs off screaming into the night like a little girl, never to be seen again. What!? And Falcone was a total waste. We already had two other much more interesting bad guys, so we could have done without him.Other things that irked me: I really hated the Batmobile, even more so after seeing it in action instead of just pictures. And the scene where it jumps across rooftops? Geez, wasn't the point of restarting the franchise to get away from the junk we got in the last two films? I couldn't believe it. The murder of Bruce Wayne's parents was also poorly-handled. It had much more emotional impact in Tim Burton's BATMAN, where I actually felt sadness seeing it happen as opposed to this one, where it's over and done with before you can really react to it. (Which I guess is something they might have intended, but it still had no affect on me.) And Gotham City! I know Christopher Nolan has said they wanted to make a 'realistic' Batman film, sort of bringing him 'into the real world.' Well, it clearly doesn't work. The Gotham City of Tim Burton's film lived up to its name. Here, the movie could have just as easily taken place in Los Angeles. And this is really just a small complaint, but Batman's gadgets were hardly used. Where's his gas pellets during his escapes (like we saw demonstrated for him earlier in the film)? And the Batarangs were virtually missing in action. The action scenes, what few there are, were terrible. The MTV-style editing and camera work didn't help, practically drowning out any suspense and excitement they may have had. Half the time, I couldn't even tell what was going on and who was hitting who. And the excessive use of flashbacks in the first act made me feel like I was watching an episode of LOST.By the time the movie was over and I was heading out of the theater, I really didn't even feel like I had just seen a Batman movie, but something else entirely. It's really a shame. The film had lots of potential, and after eight years of waiting, this is all we get. It could have been something really good. I know everybody's raving about it, but I really didn't see the big deal. I thought it was pretty lackluster. Perhaps if the writer hadn't been David S. Goyer? Who knows? All I know is that I'm extremely disappointed. Of the four live-action Batman movies (not counting the one with Adam West), I guess I'd rank BATMAN BEGINS at Number 4, right behind BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS, and even BATMAN FOREVER. It seems that SPIDER-MAN's place as the best superhero movie of all-time isn't likely to be challenged anytime soon.BATMAN BEGINS: 3/10",3,9,23,16 June 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," 50s monster movie action
","I like trilogies in which each film is a little different. Such is the case with the JURASSIC PARK movies. The first is sort of a science-fiction/epic adventure. THE LOST WORLD is more akin to a 50s monster movie. And JURASSIC PARK III is just a full-blown action movie. Like the best 50s monster movies, THE LOST WORLD offers a simple premise: the good guys travel to an island to rescue another good guy, but get stuck there with a bunch of bad guys and living dinosaurs. Although the movie never really gets going until the forty minute mark (which could have used some editing here and there to quicken things a little), once it does, it doesn't let up. The action is non-stop, the dinosaurs seemingly more real and menacing than before.Though following the old monster movie standard of set up and attack, set up and attack, Spielberg does a great job with it. The child character adds some cornyness to the film (a part that should have just been left out; does she really do anything important?), but the rest of the film makes up for that flaw. Jeff Goldblum is good as always, even if he is just playing himself, and there's good support from Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Arliss Howard, and Richard Schiff, though Pete Postlethwaite steals many scenes. His (deleted) introduction scene at a marketplace in Africa is very cool. Check it out on the DVD. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed with all the changes (the book was awesome). But as a movie fan, I was pretty pleased. The film does have its flaws (nearly every movie does), but it's an otherwise well-made monster movie that delivers.",Null,0,0,12 April 2002
Mission: Impossible II," a real stinker
","Amazing that such a great film could be followed by one of the worst movies ever made. Whereas the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was a suspenseful thriller with a sharply-written story, this sequel is just nothing but two hours of Tom Cruise. There's no sharp storyline, no well-executed sequences, no interesting characters, and worst of all, no team work. Cruise pretty much just does everything himself this time around, leaving co-star Ving Rhames in the background. Dougray Scott is a weak villain, Anthony Hopkins is wasted, and Thandie Newton is a disaster, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. It's amazing John Woo could turn out such a terrible film. Some say BROKEN ARROW was bad, but this is Woo's absolute worst American movie thus far, but then again, you can't really blame the director. I would be tempted to blame the writer instead, but Cruise is probably the one to blame. Skip this movie and stick with the first, but hope the inevitable M:I3 is at least half as good as the first.",Null,0,0,12 April 2002
Mission: Impossible," a great and well-written(!) action movie
","*possible spoilers* Proving how stale the recent Bond movies have gotten, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is what the future Bonds should aspire to be like. An exceptionally well-written spy-thriller with mysterious characters and a plot for those who like to play the mystery. Tom Cruise is awesome as IMF team pointman Ethan Hunt, who's on the run to prove his innocence after nearly his entire team is killed during a mission in Prague. For the entire film, we're absorbed with the story and Hunt's quest to clear his name and find the person responsible. Co-stars Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Henry Czerny, and the beautiful Emmanuelle Beart lend some good support to the film as shady characters who you're never sure what side they're on. Jon Voight is a standout as Jim Phelps, in a role that now seems to have typecast him as the over-the-top villain. Much like RONIN, the film has a gritty realism and shows that flashy cars and neat Bondian toys can't always save you. From the now famous (and often copied/spoofed) CIA computer room break-in to the adrenaline-pumping helicopter/train finale, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is one of the best spy-thrillers ever made, and though I love many of the Bond movies up until TOMORROW NEVER DIES, this film most assuredly topples them all.",Null,0,2,12 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," a very pleasant surprise
","I hadn't read any of the novels, so I wasn't that anxious to see the film, assuming it was just a kiddie flick and that I would be totally lost since I hadn't experienced the Harry Potter phenomenon. Well, on a whim I decided to rent the movie and give it a look, and boy was I surprised. It was great.There's never a dull moment as Harry Potter travels to a mythical land to study magic at the Hogwarts school, where he meets a variety of colorful characters ranging from the funny Hagrid to the 'he's definitely up to something' Prof. Snape. Every character in this film seems alive, thanks to a terrific cast of seasoned veterans and fresh newcomers. Daniel Radcliffe is a standout as Harry Potter. I doubt any other kid could have been as good as he was, and out of the (rumored) thousands of kids who auditioned, he was obviously the best of them all. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are good as his new friends, Ron and Hermione. The veterans of the cast include the always-reliable Richard Harris as Prof. Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Prof. McGonagall, a barely-noticeable Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as the dubious Prof. Snape.Though I've not (as I said) read any of the books, I can't compare them to the film, but it seems like director Chris Columbus went as far as he could go to literally bring the book itself alive. He seemed to go to great lengths to adapt as much of the Harry Potter world as possible. It's definitely an admirable effort, and I have to applaud him for making the film able to attract newcomers, such as myself. Not since STAR WARS has a movie made me feel so much like a kid again.The pacing of the film moves nicely. At just about two hours and thirty minutes, it flies by like one hour. There are many standout scenes throughout the film, most notably the Quidditch sporting event (more exciting than the over-hyped pod race from THE PHANTOM MENACE) and the giant chess game battle near the end of the film. The cinematography is top-notch, the fantasy characters well-designed, and the score by John Williams ranks as one of his best of recent years, with a grand theme, beautiful epicness, and action-packed excitement.All-in-all, the movie is a fun-filled adventure that both parents and kids can enjoy. Kids will like the action and special effects, and parents will feel like a kid again.I wasn't a Harry Potter before, but I am now.",Null,0,0,19 June 2002
Jaws," still thrilling after all these years
","Not many films have the power to keep me in suspense everytime I watch them. JAWS is one of the few that does. I've seen it countless times, and I still find myself captured by the suspenseful each time. A terrific lead cast (Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfus, Robert Shaw) highlight Spielberg's intense ride of a great white shark menacing a small East Coast island community during the Fourth of July holiday. Spielberg does a great job of capturing the small town island life before moving things to the claustrophobic setting of a lone ship at sea. Thanks to on-set mechanical problems, 'Bruce' the shark (as he was called during filming, named after Spielberg's lawyer at the time) is kept hidden from the audience for much of the movie, making his first appearance in the film a moment that shocks not only Scheider's police chief Brody, but the audience as well.The interplay between the three lead stars is what makes the film interesting, though we end up not really knowing a whole lot about Brody and Dreyfus's Matt Hooper. Shaw's Quint, by far, delivers the most intriguing backstory, telling the two men about his time on the U.S.S. Indianapolis, a story that is both exciting and (thanks to John Williams' music) haunting at the same time. The scenes in which the men are attempting to capture the shark are exciting and suspenseful, culminating in the final attack that sees Brody as the only one left to take care of things, and he does so in a truely ingenious way.Through the whole film we're drawn in by these characters and come to connect with them. We care about what happens to them, and that's what a good movie should do. Along with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, this is my favorite Spielberg movie that I still consider one of his absolute best. And knowing all the problems they encountered in getting it made, it's really a miracle that it turned out as fantastic as it did.",Null,0,1,14 March 2002
Halloween," great!
","HALLOWEEN is an undeniable classic, the one that started the horror trend of the 80s and that continues to this day. Even recent horror films show it's influence: the masked killer with utter determination, the strong heroine fighting to survive. Sure, not all of them have been good, but they all show the influence of HALLOWEEN. The film is one of the ones that helped spark my interest in filmmaking, and is just a great movie in general. Everything about it is superb: the simple story, the unstoppable character, the feisty lead character (the then-unknown Jamie Lee Curtis), the always reliable Donald Pleasance, the relentless suspense, the music, the direction, everything. A horror film that continues to beat all that have come since, HALLOWEEN is not just a great horror film, but a great film. Period.",Null,0,0,29 June 2001
Vanilla Sky," a strange and fascinating movie
","VANILLA SKY is one of the most strange and bizarrely-fascinating movies I've seen in quite some time. Normally I would just turn such a movie off and not bother finishing it, but as strange as this film was, I just couldn't look away. Something about it kept pulling me in further and further until I was as utterly confused and frustrated as Tom Cruise's David Aames as he tried to figure out just what the hell was going on.I've never really thought much of Tom Cruise as an 'actor,' but more as an 'entertainer.' But here he delivers an exceptional performance that is, quite possibly, his best. He's a man who suddenly has his whole life turn into a bizarre, surreal world where nothing makes sense and everything is constantly changing. The way he handles the transition from easy-going to boiling-with-frustration is great, and we, the audience, buy the transition because we sort of go through it for ourselves as well.The film has its share of surreal images and 'art house movie' moments, something I usually don't go for, but there was just something about this film that made it all work. The revelation at the end wasn't close to what I was beginning to suspect it was, and I won't give it away here. Even now, just a few hours after watching it, I'm still trying to figure out exactly what happened at the end.Co-stars Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, while completely untalented, don't distract too much from the film, but (especially in Cruz's case) there are plenty of moments when you realize how more effective the parts could've been with talented actresses in the roles. Kurt Russell is good (as always) as the psychiatrist who wants to help Cruise figure things out and determine if he is responsible for the murder he's being charged with.It's not a film I would watch over and over again, and it could have been a little shorter (a couple scenes went on a little too long), but overall it was a satisfying movie that will have you confused, frustrated, and amazed until the very end.",Null,0,0,12 June 2002
The Emperor's New Groove," what has happened to Disney's movies!?
","THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE was a big hit-and-miss to me. At only 77 minutes, it was too long. Perhaps if the story had had a quicker pace and funnier jokes, it would have seemed to go by quicker. As it is, it had only one or two really good jokes about every ten or fifteen minutes, and the space in-between them just seemed to drag and drag. I found myself laughing the most during the climax, when Yzma (expertly-voiced by Eartha Kitt) is turned into a cat and attempts to steal the potion that will turn Kuzco back into a human, and only occasionally throughout the rest of the film. The characters were well-cast (particularly Kitt, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and Wendie Malick), but David Spade got rather annoying after awhile. There were also (thankfully) no songs, with the exception being the opening sequence, featuring a funny little character that sings the opening song, voiced by Tom Jones.I wish Disney could back to making the kind of animated movies they used to do, like THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER (still my favorite animated Disney movie), ROBIN HOOD, LITTLE MERMAID, and the other classics. Heck, even BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was better than this one. (MULAN and A BUG'S LIFE are the only recent animated Disney films I liked.) Maybe the film would have been better had the studio stuck with the original story (and partially already produced film), which from what I understand was a more serious film. Little kids will like the comical situations, but probably won't have the attention span to sit through the whole thing, while adults will like some of the jokes and feel the movie has already been on two hours by the time it gets thirty minutes in.",Null,1,2,19 July 2001
Live Free or Die Hard," Top-notch action!!
","It's been a long twelve years, but John McClane is back and better than ever. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is now divorced from his wife and dealing with a broken relationship with his daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The FBI requests that he pick up a known computer hacker, Matt Farrell (Justin Long), and bring him in for questioning regarding a recent security breach of the FBI computer system. McClane arrives just in time to save Farrell's life from a team of assassins. Meanwhile, more computer attacks are being carried out by a terrorist mastermind named Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) who is systematically shutting down a variety of utilities, bringing Washington, D.C. to a virtual halt. Farrell recognizes the pattern of events as a 'fire sale,' a plan to destroy the country's infrastructure. Taking Farrell into protective custody, McClane has to keep him alive as they avoid continued attempts on their lives and race against time to stop the terrorists from plunging the nation into a new stone age.I've loved the 'Die Hard' movies since I was a kid, and I knew this one would not disappoint. While I don't mind CGI in movies, 'Live Free or Die Hard' is a terrific throwback to '80s action movies, and while there are a fair share of digital effects, a lot of stuff is done live and even with models, giving it something of an old school feel that elevates it above a lot of stuff that's come out in recent years. A little over 50 years old, Bruce Willis easily slips back into the role of John McClane and shows he can still kick ass. The rest of the cast is good. I particularly like Olyphant as the villain. At first I was worried how the film was going to handle the fractured relationship between McClane and his daughter, but it was thankfully done very well and did not distract from the story in the way many other parent-child relationships like this have done in other movies. Winstead plays Lucy McClane as a feisty girl who can take care of herself, and she gets some nice moments during the later half of the film.The story is tight, has a great pace and some nice developments along the way, and the action is top notch. Director Len Wisemen brings back some of the closed-in, claustrophobic feelings that were present in the first two films. This is probably best recreated during an excellent sequence that involves McClane fighting Gabriel's second hand, Mai Linh (Maggie Q), in and around an SUV that finds its way into an elevator shaft, dangling precariously several stories about the ground. Their preceding fight ranks right up there with the fight in 'Die Hard' between McClane and the terrorist Karl. And the climactic sequence in which McClane, having commandeered the terrorist's high-tech big rig, is pursued by an F-35 Lightning jet is one hell of an action set piece. Many fans complained about the film's PG-13 rating, since the previous three films were all rated R. But it didn't bother me at all. I've now seen it three times. This is a top notch action film, one of the best in the last ten years, in the finest 'Die Hard' tradition, and nothing delivers action quite like a 'Die Hard' movie.",10,6,9,23 March 2010
The Sixth Sense," overrated
","I can't remember the last time a movie was so overrated. I didn't see THE SIXTH SENSE in the theater, but I finally had to rent it just so people would stop telling me, 'You have to see it. It's an incredible movie.' Well, one thing is incredible: that it was such a huge hit. The performances by Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, while good and passable, weren't as 'outstanding' as everyone said they were. Really, I thought the best acting in the entire movie was by Toni Collette, who played Osment's mom and did a terrific job. The film itself had some nice atmosphere and a decent score by James Newton Howard (far from his best, though), but that was about it. The 'surprise' ending is telegraphed right from the opening scene. I knew the moment that scene ended what the 'shock ending' would be, and I wasn't a bit surprised to see I was correct. If you want a good ghost story movie, you're better off renting the similar (but highly-superior) STIR OF ECHOES.",Null,0,0,11 March 2002
Jurassic Park," exciting
","JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, 'That's what I want to do.' Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment.",Null,126,157,6 July 2001
Evil Dead II," one helluva rollercoaster ride
","Without a doubt, this is the wildest, bloodiest, goriest, craziest, funniest, most bizarre damn movie I have *ever* seen in my life. Before you can even get comfortable in your seat, the film is already kicking into high gear and refusing to let up, with one wild sequence after another. It's best described as an 80-minute bloody Three Stooges skit, as there's just as much blood as their is slapstick humor. The sequence in which Ash battles his own hand is just plain crazy. I don't how Bruce Campbell managed to keep a straight face during this sequence (or during the rest of the film), but it must have been difficult. Throughout the whole film, even during the gore parts, you can't help but crack a grin at how bizarre it all is. If you're looking for one wild rollercoaster ride of a movie, and don't mind lots of blood and gore, EVIL DEAD II is a film to check out. It may not be a piece of cinematic magic, but it sure is a piece of bizarre fun. My personal favorite of the series.",Null,0,1,23 October 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Clooney, what on Earth were you thinking?
","George, George, George. I thought after BATMAN AND ROBIN you said you were going to pick your scripts more wisely. First THREE KINGS, now this? Maybe you'll start picking good scripts with the next film. O BROTHER is one of the unfunniest 'comedies' I've ever seen. I think I laughed about two or three times during the whole film and was bored by the rest, but there were a few things I did like: Stephen Root's blind radio station owner, Clooney getting pulled out of the train, John Goodman, Charles Durning's loud-mouthed character, the three gorgeous sirens Clooney and his friends encounter and the photography of the scene itself, and the scene where Clooney gets beat up in the store was funny. Goodman is only in the film briefly, but steals the scene when he is, and John Turturro was quite good, though Clooney (whom I do like) gave what had to be his worst performance thus far. I also liked the great sense of atmosphere and the exceptional costuming, which really did an incredible job of recreating the time in which the film is set.But that's about it. There's not much going for it, and is so slow that I found myself checking the DVD player to see how much time was left. If you're a Coen Bros. fan, you'll most-likely love it. If you're someone like me who likes their comedies to actually make them laugh and give you a good time, then stay away. Oh, and congratulate yourself if you can understand more than four words spoken by the blind man on the railroad cart near the beginning of the movie.",Null,0,0,19 July 2001
