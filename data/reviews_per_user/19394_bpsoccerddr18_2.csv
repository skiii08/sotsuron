The Ring," Best Horror Movie in sooooo long!!!!
","The Ring, is one of the best horror movies, or movies in general! The plot is so intense, thrilling, scary,dramatic, keeps you guessing, gripping and anything that has any relation to those! The way this movie achieves such a great scare is amazing there has not been good scary movies sense this one! White Noise, Boogeyman, Hide & Seek, The Village, Gothika, The Ring Two, they all sucked. This is a great movie with so many twists and turns, but it makes you think which is kinda a good thing because most movies are just so bland and just plain boring! anyways this movie is awesome and one more thing two new scary movies that are actually scary are The Exorcism of Emily Rose & Cry_Wolf. I'd Recommend seeing them too! well anyways this movie is reely good and i would recommend seeing it! ~!@#$%^&*()_+ PEAcE +_)(*&^%$#@!~",10,0,2,21 September 2005
Fantastic Four," more like fantastic bore
","This movie was really,really,really a great disappointment. First off when i went to see this movie i was expected something action-packed and a little funny. It was a major disappointment to see that there was barely any action/violence whatsoever it was mostly the 4 trying to figure out their powers and them arguing! The plot of this movie states 'Five friends get special powers after being exposed to harmful space ray things, then they have to save the from Dr. Doom', but really they are barely any fight scenes at all with Dr. Doom and when there is it's not that spectacular! And, they don't even use their powers that much like I said it's basically them just arguing with each other! Anyways, this movie was a great disopointmeant i give it 3 out of 10.",3,59,116,1 October 2005
