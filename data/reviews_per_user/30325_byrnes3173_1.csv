The Legend of Bagger Vance," Pleasantly surprised; you'll either love it or wonder why they bothered.
","I'd seen the trailers and thought I wouldn't bother but my husband rented it for me and I was pleasantly surprised. I love golf and if you do you'll love the beautifully shot scenes and the snapshot of history of our game. Predictable-of course, it's a feel good movie but I really did like it. Many will find the predictability boring and if they don't understand the game (and I don't mean the rules), they will wonder why anyone paid to have it made.",8,0,2,16 August 2002
