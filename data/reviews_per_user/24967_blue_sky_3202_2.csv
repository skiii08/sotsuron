Come and See," A Masterpiece of War Film
","'Come and See' gave realistic pictures of a war during the Nazi occupation, so watching many cruel scenes in the film became a great burden for me. Espesically, two scenes were so powerful.Firstly, I felt so bad due to the sound effects when I watched the scene that Florya, who was a main character, split his eardrum by a loud explosion of a bomb and became insane by the death of his family. The sound effect expressed his mental confusion.Next, Nazi's terrible massacre of many people in a village was very realistic, so I could not keep watching the scenes that many citizens were killed in a large burning house.Even though 'Come and See' is a masterpiece of war movie, I would not like to watch that again.",10,2,2,7 June 2008
Ran," An Excellent Movie
","The story of Ran was based on 'King Lear', and Akira Kurosawa adopted Japanese values and historical background in this film. Although we have to take more than two hours to watch 'Ran', many people can probably enjoy that like me because of two reasons. Firstly, the performances of actors and actresses were so wonderful. Especially, I was moved by Tatsuya Nakadai, who played Hidetora, and Mieko Harada, who played Kaede. Mr. Nakadai could express both mental agony and madness of his role. In addition, Ms.Harada's act was very terrible in the scene that Kaede frightened Jiro after Taro was killed. Finally, the film sets were excellent such as many kinds of weapons and castles. By the sets, the scenes of the battle and a castle,which burned fiercely, were impressive. Thus, I would like to recommend 'Ran' to the people, who like to watch movies!!",9,1,4,7 June 2008
