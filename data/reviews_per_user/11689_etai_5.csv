Requiem for a Dream," Just a thought..
","I think everything has been said about this film so I won't repeat how powerful, orginal and audacious this film is.What I found striking though, reading many of the comments, is that almost every review focused on the drug use and some even thought the film is anti drug propeganda that should be seen by schools. I think that is slightly naive and shows, with respect to the commenters, an ignorance and detachment from the issue. Furthermore, and this is really the main point I am trying to make, I disagree that this film is about drugs. This film, in my humble opinion, is about addiction. As such, it is not real or hyper real. It is, following my thesis, a surreal analysis of human obssession, addiction, and the effects thereof. To support this view, merely look at the way Aronofsky juxtaposes the story of Ellen Burstyn's obssession with appearing on TV and the means taken with that of the kids' obssession with 'finding a way out' and the consequential drug addiction.",Null,0,0,11 January 2001
Snatch," One Step Forward (..and not two) for Guy Ritchie
","Guy Ritchie has definitely done it again. Using the same formula as in Lock, Stock.. and backed by the ever - in - search - of - a - new - image - Madonna, Ritchie has gone and made another winner. Tightly scripted, cleverly shot, and classily casted, this is an immensly entertaining film. Brad Pitt deserves his own little paragraph. Brad Pitt has had a terrible career. Brad Pitt thought that having a pretty face and muscles makes you a good actor but, as countless others have proved before him (including the abysmal Keanu Reeves), that is not enough. So Brad Pitt took a lesson from Johnny Depp on how to overcome your pretty face by choosing challenging, unexpected and difficult roles in films not intended to be watched by freckle faced brace wearing teenage girls. Brad Pitt has finally switched ranks and hopefuly, after the Fight Club and this film he will never again shave.As this is Ritchie's second film, he is excused from making the same film again (with bigger budget, snazzier cast etc) but, he will not be able to make another film that looks like a Smirnoff/Guiness commercial if he wishes to develop his undoubtebly original talent.",Null,0,1,19 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," a classic festival opener
",No wonder this film has opened so many festivals. This is a remarkable piece of work and a great achievement for Ang Lee following some pretty undistinguished films made recently by Lee.I will not repeat what has been said by almost all reviewers here with regard to the choreography though what I would point out is how magnificent this film looks on such a relatively small budget. It puts Hollywood to shame.,Null,0,0,18 November 2000
Final Destination," Yet another Nike sponsored catastrophe
","Final Destination does not know what it wants to be. It lacks coherency and direction and whenever it doesn't know what to do, it throws in a cheap gag to help it stumble along.The crux of the problem with this abysmal farce is that instead of using a vaguely interesting concept (without ruining too much, something to do with 'the grand scheme of life', fate, etc.) to create an truly original flick it gets trapped in the Hollywood machine and therefore has to spoon feed the viewer, e.g. by making death into Death, i.e. a new baddie like freddie kruger, jason, leatherface, etc. Here, Death is made almost human so that the dumb viewer can grasp who the baddie is - pathetic and insulting.Needless to say that the characters and acting are awful. Yet another generation of third rate zitty teenage actors of the worst kind. The acting is so poor its not even amusing in the most camp B-movie attractiveness kind of way possible. The characters are 2D stereotypes made so much more gracefuly in films like Scream.This has got to be one of the worst horror films I have seen in a long long time.",Null,2,3,21 December 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Mixed Feelings...
","Any new Coen Brothers film is a reason to get excited especially after wetting our appetites with the Director's Cut of Blood Simple. And any new film with John Turturro is a reason to still have faith in the power of acting. But, this time around I am not entirely convinced that the Coens hit the jackpot. Paying tribute to Homer and Sturges sounds pretentious and impressive but it doesn't quite work. The story evolves at a very slow pace, the trademark wackiness seems a tad contrived and getting George Cloony to star feels like a sell out. Also, the way the Coens dealt with Depression-era politics and social issues is lightweight and unsatisfying. Having said that, this film is light years more entertaining and amusing than any Hollywood drivel that gets spewed at us regularly. The fluency of their humour is something that your De Niro/Crystal/De Vito comedies will never achieve.",Null,0,0,19 October 2000
