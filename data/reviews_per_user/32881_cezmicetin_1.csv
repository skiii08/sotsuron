Scarface," great
","Bloody, glitzy and over the top, this gangster movie icon is certainly not the best in the genre but is brilliant and worth seeing just for the notoriety of it's material. Al Pacino is over acting the whole time and as a result becomes captivating in the lead role of Tony Montana. The epic final scene is also well done and caps off the movie brilliantly in a bloody, smoke filled massacre that resembles something of a serious battle in a hard fought war. The destruction of Tony's house coupled with the bodies of multiple men in the final sweeping take in jaw dropping and really packs a punch to conclude the movie. As I said previously, despite the fact that by no means is it among the best films in the gangster genre, this is a must see film due to it's style and reputation.",9,0,0,13 November 2017
