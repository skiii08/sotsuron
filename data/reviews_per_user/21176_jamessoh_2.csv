Walk the Line," Solid movie but should have been better
","I am a big fan of Johnny Cash, the singer. Like the movie 'Ray', I was expecting a solid tribute to the great singer. In 'Ray', the audience was able to buy into the singer's life because of the strong tie ins of Ray Charles' personal life and his music. We were able to see the influences that quite often gave him his biggest hits. Unfortunately, the movie, in and of itself, followed a rather drab storyline that involved a child growing up, getting into a bad conflict or problem (drugs), recovering from it, and then exiting out of the movie in a great flourish. Sadly, we see the same gambit in 'Walk The Line.' Unlike 'Ray', however, the movie fails to make the storyline as a bit player in the movie's composition. Instead, the storyline itself is the salient aspect of this movie. We do not see genuine attempts to explain Johnny Cash's influences in his music. Rather, we are left with the all too common banality of some tragic experience that affects the main character deeply. With hits like 'Rain of Fire' or my particular favorite 'Don't Take Your Guns to Town', it would have been nice to watch a movie that tried to present a fresh thesis on Johnny Cash's life and his musical influences. The movie's pace is often drab and not worthy of much praise. Much more critical thought could have been put into the script, especially for someone like Johnny Cash. Nonetheless, the movie is quite often saved by the repeated injections of musical performances-all of which were Cash hits. These performances, all performed by the actor portraying Cash, are enough to delude the moviegoer into thinking that he is watching a great biopic. Having said that, the performances by the actor and actress portraying Cash and June Carter, respectively, are outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix is great as Cash; I personally think his singing voice gets better and better as the film progresses. The actress playing June Carter maintains an air of fluffy and bouncy Southern girl charm, which complements Cash's dour demeanor. This movie is a '10' for people who have listened to Cash off and on but are not serious fans. For the rest of us, this movie could have been way better. Cash deserved a solid and awesome screenplay that involved serious thought and exploration into his life, not this.",6,2,9,18 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Not as good as the first one
","For the enthusiastic Matrix fan, this movie is definitely worth watching. For the rest of us, like me, this movie is so-so.  I was not impressed with the Bullet Time 2 action sequences.  In fact, it was difficult to notice. However, granted that the action is stepped up to the thousandth power in this movie, the real drawback of this film is the overdone dialogue, especially when new characters are introduced.  The scenes involving Percephone's husband going on and on about cause and effect or the scene with the councilman talking about the definition of 'control' was laughable, just to name a few.  Frankly, this isn't the first time I've heard this philosophical gobbledy-gook.  The great part about this movie is, aside from the stepped up action sequences (they were very well done), the actor who plays Morpheus.  He has a commanding presence on the screen. Unfortunately, his acting ability was not exploited in this movie, favoring, instead, Neo punching the lights out of just about every character in the movie. There is one scene in the movie, near the end, and tells Morpheus about the Oracle and his fallacy in his beliefs that struck my fancy.  In that scene, Morpheus is shocked by Neo's comments and one can see Morpheus' face reacting to the ungodly news.  If the movie exploited what went on in Morpheus' head at that time instead of wasting it on, say, Link's girlfriend or the insanely long techno dance scene, this movie would have been much better.  Further, after seeing the ending, I have a feeling that Revolutions, the final movie in the Matrix trilogy, is going to be a downer. There are too many things to discuss about this movie, especially the ones that seem overly done and out of place.  One has to see this movie and make his own judgements.  Again, I would recommend this movie for the enthusiast, not just anyone.",Null,0,0,20 May 2003
