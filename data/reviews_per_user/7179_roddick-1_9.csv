United 93," Amazing
","I went into this movie not knowing much about it except that it was about the plane that didn't hit a target. I hadn't seen any trailers or anything. I was expecting that it would be more of a blockbuster type film. I was quite wrong. United 93 was a truly amazing and scary experience.I had always found it awful of course watching documentaries on 9/11, but never really scared. Probably because I live in New Zealand. But watching this as if you are actually in the plane was frightening. I was not scared in the build up of the event, even though you see the terrorists looking nervous etc, but as soon as they started shouting and stabbing innocent people I became quite frightened. The cast did an excellent job. It was awful to see the look of fear on the people's faces when they knew they were going to die, or how nervous they were at fighting back at the hijackers. The actors who played the terrorists were amazing as well. You hate them even more since they have a face, but are of course extremely scared of them too.Paul Greengrass did a terrific job on this movie. Amazing and scary, United 93 reinforces how awful the 9/11 attacks were.",9,4,7,26 August 2006
Madagascar," OK but don't believe the hype
","This movie was OK. It didn't live up to my expectations. I thought it would be considerably more funny. It starts off well. Some nice wee gags, but it lacks plot. It seems to be very similar most of the time.It is definitely not as funny as some of the other digitally animated movies. I know these types of movies are aimed at little kids, but normally they have some quite funny jokes in them. But this one didn't have many good jokes. They were all very childish. Most of the best jokes were on the trailer, but there were a few good ones. Really, my friends and I got more laughs out of mocking it than we did watching it.Another poor thing is the animation. It is awful compared to Shrek, Finding Nemo, Shark Tale etc. That really surprised me. They didn't look very real. They looked more like cartoons. Although some lemurs were done well, I remember that Alex the lion didn't look very good.One thing that is very good is the voice acting. Especially Ben Stiller. He always does well.Overally I thought it was reasonably entertaining. Younger children will probably enjoy it but I wouldn't fork out large sums of money to see it.",5,5,11,14 July 2005
Batman Begins," Not like the others
","This Batman movie was definitely not like the others. a) because it had none of the cast from the others and b) because it was filmed in a different style and of course c) it was darker.But that doesn't mean it was bad. I thought it was great.It goes into a lot of detail on how Bruce Wayne became Batman. And not just a wee intro thing, it was a large part of the movie.At the beginning it cuts back and forth between present and past, which may make you confused ( I understood it all, but I was with friends who weren't following it) but it stays in present for the rest.I thought the story was very smart. It had Batman villains (with funny beards!) that we don't normally hear about which was interesting.The comic relief was good. Some laugh out loud moments and some things you'll probably find funny that aren't meant to be.There are some really good action scenes. Very exciting and original.Acting was good. Christian Bale did a good Batman. I think he was trying to sound like the Batman on the animated TV series, it sounded good. You grow to hate Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson, who play the two main villains in the film, which is good because they must be acting well. Everyone else was good as well.Now the thing everyone has been saying is that it's darker than the others. I think it comes across darker because the last two weren't that dark. There are some scary and sometimes disturbing moments but it's not darker than Batman Returns (the one with The Penguin in it). Overall I thought it was an entertaining and exciting movie which you will probably enjoy. A good new addition to the Batman series.",8,1,2,19 June 2005
City of God," A Magnificent Movie Experience
","I had been trying to watch this for a while and when I finally was able to see it I was blown away!It is one of the most exciting, original and interesting films I have very seen.It has a great style of directing. Upon introducing a main character it would give you a whole back story of the person.It is very fast paced and action packed which is great.The acting is fabulous considering a lot of the actors were children.Interesting to see that it is based on a true story. The violence can be quite brutal and graphic at points but but nothing that will make you vomit. Overall I thought it was a magnificent movie experience and a must see for all.",10,1,4,4 June 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Action packed but lacks plot
",This movie had plenty of action and humor but didn't have much depth in the plot.It was the action scenes that made me interested in it. Although sometimes over the top or unrealistic they were still very exciting and cool.Another thing that kept me interested was some of the comic relief. There were some good comic situations and jokes and also humor incorporated into the action. Much more funny than I expected.Acting was good. Vince Vaughn was the most memorable. He played a similar character to his character in Swingers and Made.Overall I thought it was exciting and entertaining but was missing something especially in the plot.,5,2,5,26 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Surprisingly Scary
","This movie was much more scary than I thought it would be. I thought it would be a big action movie with aliens, explosions etc. I didn't think it would be bad but it took me by surprise. I am not sure how the original story goes, but I have seen the 1950's version of it, so I had a pretty good idea of how it would go. I thought it was a good idea to have the lead character as a normal guy, as opposed to a scientist who understood everything that was going on (like the lead character in the 50's version). I thought the story was excellent and very smart. It was good how it showed what people would do in such desperation to stay alive.The acting was good all round. This movie is scary! I think the 50's version probably scared that times audience, but it is laughable today. I was probably more scared because I wasn't expecting it to be. But trust me, it is! It is made so scary because of the great suspense. And also the aliens actually look scary (no little green men!). Plus the machines the aliens control are actually very scary because the seem so life like.Overall I thought it was a brilliant movie. I was pleasantly surprised. Make sure you see it!",8,0,3,14 July 2005
The Ringer," Great feel good comedy
","At first I didn't want to see The Ringer, since a review I had read gave it no stars. But when a friend and I wanted to go to the movies and there was nothing else on I thought I may as well check it out. It turned out to be a nice, funny, feel good movie that definitely doesn't deserve zero stars.Some have said that it is unfair that Johnny Knoxville gets acting roles when he only became famous by hurting himself on Jackass, which is pretty true. He still does a good job as the main character Steve Barker. The rest of the cast were good as well especially the real handicapped people who were acting.There are plenty of funny parts of course. Mainly making fun of the contestants in the Special Olympics although I wouldn't think it would offend anybody. Overall The Ringer is a great feel good comedy that doesn't go out of it's way in making fun of handicapped people, but really shows that they are just the same as any other person.",6,0,0,27 April 2006
Cube," Genius
","This movie was much greater than I expected.The story is genius. A lot of thought must have gone into it. Original plot twists. It is not really a horror movie as some people have said. It does have a lot of suspense but I still wouldn't classify it as horror. Probably Sci-Fi. It had a Sci-Fi feeling to it.Now the acting was OK. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it didn't seem very good. Sometimes cringe worthy, but the actors still did well. They made the movie what it is.Yes it does have gore but Sci-Fi gore, if you know what I mean? Not green blood etc. but not extremely realistic. Overall I thought it was very good. It may not appeal to all, but I still thought it was a genius movie.",8,4,8,29 June 2005
Fantastic Four," Not marvelous, but worth the money
","I must say that I got more than I expected out of this one. It was pretty enjoyable.The thing that caught me the most was the story. It was much deeper (but not very deep) than I thought it would be. It's not just Good Guys vs. Bad Guys, there's definitely more to it.The action scenes are good. Should keep you excited.It's probably more of a kids movie than an adult one, but I don't think that any adults watching would get bored sitting through it with their kids.Overall it's not marvelous, but money well spent.",6,1,3,25 August 2005
