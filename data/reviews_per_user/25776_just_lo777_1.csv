Source Code," Put on a 'Must Watch' List
","First of all I got to say that I'm not a big fan of both Jake Gyllenhaal nor Michelle Monaghan so the movie must be so good that I like it that much despite their presence. It's one of those mind twisting movies that you must pay attention to every single word they say and to every single detail to be able to understand it very well . There are those moments when you get so confused and it's OK, just go with the flow and keep watching because everything is getting clearer by time. For the story, it's sci-fi but more like realistic one since it happens NOW not at some time in the future when people use laser guns and dress as astronauts. It will blow your mind with every scene but in a good way. Although it is sci-fi you can easily relate to the events and you can't stop wondering what if this is true and what if this actually can happen or what if it's happening now and that we are just part of it. I just didn't like the ending and that's the reason I gave it 8. It was some sort of mind-blowing open end that will make you unable to stop thinking maybe for few days trying to figure it out but I guess only good movies can make your mind go like this. For the performances, Jake's Performance was really good and he managed to take it to a higher level while Michelle's performance is exactly the same as all her other roles. She act in the same exact way no matter what is her character, the story or the other cast members. In the end, all I can say is that you will enjoy it specially that it is story is not one of those that had been done for 1000 times before. It will expand your imagination and the way you think .For my questions about the movie, it goes like this (It contains spoilers): What kind of ending is that??? I mean I spent two hours to understand the whole idea then they blew it all off by the last scene. Does that ending mean that he just escaped to Sean's body and continued his life being aware of his own death? Is he completing his life as Sean without knowing that he is Stevens in the first place or he is aware of his death and being in Sean's body in the source code? How did Goodwin get the message while it was sent only in the Source code? How did his father reply to him and say all those things? Was it made by his mind where he imagined that this what his father would say? Does it mean that all of this was just a little part of a huge simulation that live in thinking it's the reality? Yeah I know he said that in his message but yet it doesn't make any sense. I think it would be better if they ended it right after Stevens and Christina were hanging out.",8,1,3,17 December 2013
