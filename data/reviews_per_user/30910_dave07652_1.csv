The New World," pure torture
","As I was driving home I was trying to remember the last time I had sat through a movie as boring and annoying as the one I had just seen. And The Thin Red Line came to mind. I got home and looked it up and sure enough same director. I remembered sitting in the theater looking at my watch every 10 minutes wondering when will this torture end. If you liked The Thin Red Line you will love this movie. Plenty of sun shining through trees, plenty of mindless walking around. Natives walking through the fields, colonists walking through the fields, natives walking through the forest, then colonists walking through the forest, voice overs here and there, natives running around , colonists walking again, natives walking again, a battle where many colonists die and yet their numbers don't diminish, more walking, more voice overs, a boat ride, more walking, a conversation, more walking, more sunlight, oh beautiful nature, more walking...get the idea. Towards the end I was laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of sitting in a theater being tortured to death. Every time Christian Bale came on I was hoping he would say ' I am Batman '. Then I would have known for certain that I was watching a comedy.",1,6,17,21 January 2006
