Iron Man 3," a very bitter bitter disappointment
","I gotta say Im a big fan of MARVELS movies and of course the comics, with that in mind, sadly speaking as a big fan i have to say this is the WORST MARVEL MOVIE EVER DONE, i mean forget about the first HULK movie which was OK, but with a lot of room for improvement, this movie takes the word SUCK to brand new level of SUCKINESS, why I MEAN WHY !!! did they had to choose this muppet of a director AKA Shane Black he HAS DESTROYED THE IRON MAN FRANCHISEE IN AN SPECTACULAR WAY, WELL DONE YOU GIGANTIC DUSHBAG.The movie is nothing like Ironman 1, or Ironman 2, in which they actually deliver an action movie not a poorly written and directed movie like Ironman 3, you don't see nothing but a glimpse of what was shown on the last 2 movies, the storyline is crap, they ruined a great iron man villain in this case the MANDARIN, the holes in the story are major since the iron man 3 movie as the other 2, are connected to the MARVEL universe = THE AVENGERS movie, so i mean the suits in this movie break only every 3 seconds with a scratch, and on the Avangers the suit (which you would expect is better now in Ironman 3 cause time has passed and obvious improvements have been done) could resist and actually give a 400% power capacity when Thor threw a lighting it didn't melt, or stopped functioning, so... i mean there are just about tons of holes like this on the movie and you don't get that amount of action that your (or at least me) craving you wait and wait and wait a bit longer and what you do get? NOTHING a long with a lot of Disappointment.So guys don't spend your money is not worth it, and even if you get to see it for free you will still feel like you have been robbed, and i cant stress this enough maybe cause my favorite MARVEL superhero is iron man and seeing how this dushbag Shane Black has DESTROYED one of the best franchisees of marvel, hopefully in the next Avangers they will save what is left of Ironman. And if there will be another Ironman keep simple guys Jon Favreau has done pretty good on the 1 and 2 one, so really is that hard to see?",2,33,66,28 April 2013
