The Blair Witch Project," scary, disturbing and absolutely entertaining
",The Blair Witch project has probably been the scariest movie I have ever seen. The one thing that makes it so scary is the fear of the unknown. All of the three main characters did an abolutely awesome job. This movie should definately receive many award nominations and that would include a Oscar for best picture. This is one the scariest and the best movie of the year and one of 10 best movies of all time. Go see it now! 5/5. Without a doubt the best.,10,1,2,31 July 1999
Pitch Black," one of the worst ever- bad effects, acting and filming
","I went into this movie with high expectations. The trailer wasn't all that, but you know...trailers suck most of the time... The idea overall was pretty good, but it never gets really accomplished. What we are left with are two main stories, the people against themselves and the people against the aliens. If they'd stick with the one against the aliens and develop it a bit more, I'm sure we'd see something A LOT better. The acting sucks, the effects blow, and the first 30 minutes lick. I have no idea how this got greenlighted and I have no clue why this didn't go straight to video. I advise you to wait for when it comes to primetime TV... I definetaly think this is the worst movie after Message in a Bottle. If you ever go to the movie theater and you think about seeing this, go see something like Scream 3, The Beach or Hanging Up, I'm sure you'll have a blast!",1,8,15,19 February 2000
