Conquest 1453," Very bad effects and too much inspiration!
","It is like a mix of Lord of the Rings, Troy, 300, Scorpion King etc... Every moment when I was watching this movie was taking me to another movie. It is too much inspiration!There isn't a slight effect that is different than these movies, and the story and everything is exaggerated too much!The most important part where the humans carry the ships onshore only takes 1 min in the whole movie! This event is the most important historical event and it takes only one min!If you are planning to watch this, you should be aware that; the history is not covered correctly and too much exaggeration, the most important parts only takes a few min (ship being carried by many people onshore), It is totally the same effect for other movies that we have known, maybe taken from these movies directly, I don't know and the end was so poor.I cant believe I paid 15 TL for this movie!I would not pay any penny for this movie if I knew these!",10,73,146,22 February 2012
