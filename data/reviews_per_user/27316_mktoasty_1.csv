Sucker Punch," Ignore the critics and see this movie. It will tickle your id.
","First off, I love all the negative reviews of this movie. Critics (the public) are so quick to judge. This movie did what it promised. A trip through a dark reality depicted with a good taste of original style. Snyder knows how to create a powerful opening scene. The man uses slow motion. So what? he does it well. As for the acting? It was appropriate. It didn't need Oscar performances. And for the soundtrack? Very fitting, and very well chosen. This movie was not hard to grasp. I pity those who were confused. And if you're asking yourself 'where were the characters?' They were stuck in between the realms of the different realities. Funny, that's where he wanted the audience to be. If you didn't become engaged with this movie then go back home and watch the Social Network.. If you recognized the cover of 'Where is my mind' at the beginning of the film, then this movie was intended for you.",8,2,8,6 April 2011
