Insidious: Chapter 2," Awful!
","Disjointed and possibly the most un-scary film i have ever sat through, but most annoyingly it was so boring! I love slow burners but that's often because there is something true to life about the pace and feel, but this rubbish cop out, money making, profit margin piece of tripe was so full of stupid ripped off sound effects and jumps that i was bored stiff in 20 minutes! It just keeps getting worse and more boring. The story was ridiculous and i don't care how silly people want to be trying to justify this lame pseudo intelligent film with its ludicrous attempts to try and make us think it was just plain BAD! In every way it fails as a horror. Friday the 13th part 100 are awful films but at least they do not pretend to be anything else. This is a director who has limited imagination and scope and indeed credit anymore, and is clearly running the same old machine and getting paid handsomely for it...and fair play to him! But one day people will look back and not remember him at all if this crap keeps being churned out. This film fails as a horror film because it was not scary. It fails to grab you because it was so disjointed and fragmented it was impossible to care, or at least for me. It fails due to the lack of direction and IMO because it was so clearly just about making money.Am i the only one that was bored? I mean all those screeches and jumpy sounds are find if there is any point to them but seriously i thought at times they would add them when someone sat on a chair, made a cup of tea or ironed their shirt!!! It was crazy annoying and pointless!If a couple of the actors were worse i would have given this 2 and that i think is probably too much. And please do not get me wrong i love horror, its my favorite genre and i also fully realize that horror films are largely made than ripped off and regurgitated at an alarming rate, but this for me was just awful and lame beyond my wildest dreams!",3,2,3,9 January 2014
Hereditary," let down.
","Briefly, this film promised so much and started brilliantly. I do not always agree with Kermode but since watching this film and then listening to his comments, i couldn't agree more.
Its good, but could have been so much more.
Its nowhere near as good as the Babadook although it tries. Comparing this to the Exorcist is crazy !
Up to the decapitation scene and including this, it was brilliant, but then, as is often the case in modern horror films, the director feels the need to spell out the content and what it means, as if most people couldn't see this quite clearly already.Not bad, but a let down :(",7,0,2,12 November 2018
The Babadook," Finally a great horror!
","I am not going to do any long review or give anything away but after many tears waiting i watched a horror that had some hype and was not left feeling cheated by the end! I love horror movies and have seen far too many. In recent years people have been left watching bad recycled horrors in which you can correctly predict what will happen, who will die, in what order and how the end will almost certainly be left on a cliffhanger--or better known as a director/producer who is thinking of lining their pockets more than constructing a proper end to a film and not thinking of another rubbish franchise. How people regarded the Conjuring as better than this ill never know. It had moments of course like all half backed horrors which know how to pull strings but that is rarely more than that. This was different. Perhaps the fact it didn't come out of the US is partly why it managed to stay clear of the usual flaws.Anyway, enough from me. Like i said i don't want to say too much but the score, the sound and visual effects, the acting, the lighting, the creativity and clear understanding of what makes something scary are all top notch",9,5,10,30 January 2015
American History X," By votes, the most overrated film on IMDb
","This in my opinion is not a bad movie by any means, but i was just scrolling down the list of the top films by ways of votes on IMDb and saw how highly this movie was rated and how much it has impressed. I do think its quite good and of course its controversial, but i can't help thinking that its getting as much credit as it has for being just that. It has some good moments and the fact that the neo nazi's opinions are put a cross in a well constructed manner, rather than the usual thick headed thug type fashion does make it more uncomfortable and asked more questions of us (perhaps) and of course it has other current flowing under the obvious ones, like the element of prison and what that brings etc etc, but overall this film lacked any subtle moments. Everything is thrown infront of you in an aggressive manner, which i know people will say is the point perhaps, but in my opinion it isn't. We all know racism is a bad thing so to have it spelt out and then have the rather obvious idea of redemption but paying for your sins or for your actions (being accoutable) for your eventual loss is a little obvious",6,5,11,31 January 2010
The Conjuring 2," Big jumps, little content
","A little surprised this film hag received such glowing reviews.
For me its just a lot of scary, jumpy scenes and more like a collection of short stories than one well formed film.
It relies on jump scares and creepy scenes almost to the clock! You know after 10 minutes your going to get a jumpy AND LOUD scene.
So boring and no real content. The only reason i give it 5 is for a couple of scenes that were well done, but again don't do anything to form another layer of the story.
Modern horror at its most obvious. Boring",5,0,0,1 July 2019
Green Street Hooligans," Awful!
","7.5 currently on IMD and i have to say this made me laugh. I am not being a snob but this film is possibly the worst of the year! Mr wood (the hobbit)has to be the worst casting in the history of film! He could never be scary or 'tough' with street cred. He is a hobbit at best and the most unlikely hard nut you could ever face! Not to mention what is this film actually trying to say? Is football violence fun? Does it make us a man? Should we never leave a man behind? WHAT A PILE OF CRAP The worst accents in the history of film? Can't be far off! And what nice football hooligans....they don't kick a man when he's down! Really! Amazing! What a way to make us like and identify with the characters a little more by suggesting that they are not cruel thugs but honest, good hearted souls we can relate too! Honestly, the most overrated film ever Gareth",2,1,2,20 December 2013
Alien: Covenant," such a let down
","So fed up after watching this last instalment of one of my favourite franchises. Even though there has been a couple of let downs, and one terrible movie (Alien 4) i still held hope that we were getting back on track.The first 30-45 minutes were absolutely fine. nothing special but a simple search and rescue film, similar to Aliens. The middle was rushed so badly it suffers from a real lack of story, timing, and as so often in modern films, including sadly sci-fi and horrors it just bored me after that midpoint. Why oh why does someone like Ridley Scott continue his downward slide into mediocre action movies. Why, also does he seem hell bent on flexing his ego by trying to over-complicate something so simple it doesn't need it. Alien, a perfect horror film. Tense and to the point with enough story but not so you felt you were being taught some sci-fi facts. Aliens, simple search and rescue and excellently effective. Aliens 3, better than some suggest but still i big letdown (both the cut and uncut films). Alien 4...crap!!!!! For me it then picks up gradually but now sadly i have lost all hope.The film should have been called robot or droid, because that is all that it seemed it was about. The fxxking droid! You do the right thing and put less well known actors in it which is great in horrors particularly as your never sure who is going to die first. The you put droid man in it, whose a huge movie star and hey presto, its all very predictable again!Two scenes in which i lost all faith and never regained hope...the droid fight and the drop ship fight, both right out of a Hollywood film for young adults, not so different from transformers and the like....DREADFUL!!!! Ridley please don't touch another alien film. Go and sit enjoying your endless wealth, but quit ruining films",6,1,7,18 May 2017
