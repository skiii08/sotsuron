Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not superb film, but I liked it a lot.
","I saw Phantom Menace a quarter after midnight may 19(or, technically, May 20), and i considered it worth staying up until 3 am on a school night.  Do I think its a masterpiece of screenwriting? No. I believe the film WAS overhyped. I also believe there's such a thing as too much special effects. But I liked it a lot.  And personally, as far as my liking the character goes, young ObiWon Kenobi beats Ep. 4's luke skywalker HANDS DOWN. (Ewan MacGregor's voice may have something to do with that...my ears are directly connected to my teenage-girl hormones) There should have been more of him and less of jar jar in my humble opinion.  Looking forward to Episode 2....Rahne",7,0,0,19 May 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," Now I know why it's a classic.
","Normally, i throw a fit if a film is not historically accurate.  I also don't like movies that drag on for long periods without dialogue.   I've got a feeling that this is a major exaggeration of the accomplishments of TE lawrence.  For once, I don't care.   There are many sections which consist of lovely scenery and pretty music with no spoken words.  For once, I don't care.  This was an incredibly well-done movie.  The writing, acting, and directing were all good, and as for Omar Sharif....i don't think I've ever seen a man look so sexy with so much clothing on.  The growth of the relationship between Lawrence and Ali was excellent.",10,1,4,19 May 2000
