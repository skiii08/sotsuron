The Blair Witch Project," So much hype for such a terrible movie.
","Obviously the people that said this movie was scary have never seen a scary movie. I love a good horror movie but this one never scared me once. Someone must have known the right person to get a review like that. I stayed for the entire movie hoping it would get better, wrong. The girl in the movie was getting on my nerves by the time the movie finally ended. 82 minutes was too long.",1,1,4,12 August 1999
