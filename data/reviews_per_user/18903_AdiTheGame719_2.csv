Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can - one of the greatest films ever.
","I saw this film a few days after it was put in theatres and it was inspiring.All the parts were excited and some parts were hilarious.In my opinion, 'Catch Me If You Can' is the greatest film ever to be able to mix drama, comedy, chasing, love, and action successfully.I love this film, it ranks #2 on my all-time favorites list. I highly recommend it.I just bought the autobiography and Frank Abagnale and will read it soon. I want to buy the movie book, full with screenplay, stills, everything, but it is $32.95 and will save up for that.10/10",10,1,2,1 February 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," The Shawshank Redemption
","The first time I've seen this movie was on December 31st, 2001. My parents and I were getting ready to down to the city and celebrate the New Year.My father said it was a great film and it was just on TNT or TBS. I decided to watch it, and wow. This has to be the greatest film of all-time.The acting was excellent, the directing, the writing. Everything. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gave excellent jobs. On my all-time favorites list, this ranks #3...1. 'Rat Race' (2001) 2. 'Catch Me If You Can' (2002) 3. 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994) 4. 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991) 5. 'Spider-Man' (2002)The only bad aspect of the film was that the ending was too weak.SPOILER ALERTWhen Freeman's character met Robbin's character on the beach, it was just dull. I don't even think they ever said a word. They just faded out. Couldn't they have shown what happens next? Oh, well.SPOILER ALERT OVER.Everything else was great and there were even some funny moments, like when the Prison owner guy found out how Robbins' character left the prison.Since 12/31/01, I've seen the movie four more times, bought the screenplay and bought the DVD.10/10",10,0,0,1 February 2003
