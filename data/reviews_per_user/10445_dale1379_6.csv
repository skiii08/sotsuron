Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A little disappointing
","I was looking forward to Volume 2 for a long time like any other Tarantino fan. But now i've seen it it's nowhere near as good as Volume 1. I hate to say this, as i'm a huge Tarantino film, and loved the first one. But i left the cinema not feeling any different or excited by the viewing experience. One of my friends even fell asleep during the movie!Now i'm not saying that this film is awful. It is good and has some great moments, even a good send off to the first movie. But there were so many moments where the characters were just sitting round a table and talking for ten minutes which did make me want to yawn and look at my watch.
(possible spoilers) the great moments were the bride and elle fight sequence, and the brides escape from the grave. Other than that there weren't really any points that made the story from the first that gripping or exciting. the Tarantino directing style was definitely there, but not as obvious when compared to his earlier work. top marks for Tarantino's shots and camera movement, but the storyline and flow of the film was a little slow and basic. I'd say for any Tarantino fan, whether u like it or hate it, it's worth seeing for the presentation of the film. But if you're looking for a lot of action like the first, you may be disappointed. I would agree with some people who have said that even if Tarantino made the worst film ever they'd still like it, which is true. I'm a huge fan of his work and still am, but i'm afraid Volume 2 is his least best work.6/10",Null,0,1,5 May 2004
Spider-Man 2," Brings the comics and cartoons to life
","I am a big fan of Spiderman and loved the cartoons as a kid. When the first was made, everyone was worried whether it would butcher the original story. Luckily the first was a success, and good viewing. But after viewing number two, in my opinion, this was a far better film than the original. The action was spot on and kept me hooked. The script was good, and a little surprising toward the end. I thought every actor performed well throughout, and i personally preferred Molina's (i hope i spelt his name right!) acting as a villain, compared to Defoe's in the first. (Defoe did sometimes appear to power ranger enemy like from time to time). I would say for all the films that have been based on Marvel and DC Comics, Spiderman two for me has now come into the few films that were brilliant (others i liked were Batman 1 and 2, Blade, and Superman). Getting Stan Lee involved is another bonus to keep the original Spiderman legacy alive, and Spiderman 2 was an excellent watch.Would recommend this to any true Spiderman fan, and a definite DVD in my collection. A great sequel, and well deserved in the top 250 list.9/10",9,0,0,19 July 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Not as good as 1 and 2, but still good.
","i just saw this film this evening and really liked it. i'd ignore all these other comments, because if u ask me these are from the poor little kids who only appreciate films if people fight lots and something explodes. u have to appreciate all of the matrix films as they are especially this one. there isnt a lot of matrix action like in the first 2, but what is great is that more questions are answered and the surprise ending was unexpected and brilliant.its like the back to the future trilogy. Part 3 wasnt the best of films, but it makes the trilogy what it is and gave it a great conclusion. all classics.a great end to a great trilogy. matrix revolutions 8/10",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
School of Rock," The film that stars Jack Black as Jack Black! Excellent!
","This has to be Jack Black's biggest movie and it certainly isn't a let down. I'm glad i went with all the hype because i enjoyed and laughed through the film from start to finish.Some people were put off by the fact it's a kid rated film, but actually there is a lot of good adult humour included in it.  Jack Black isn't exactly a rock legend, but he is a good spokesperson for it, and shines when starring as the role of Dewey. A must see for avid rock fans, and fans of Jack Black. Some classic tunes are included in the soundtrack and is definitely worth purchasing aswell as the movie on DVD. A film such as this gives the younger generation a chance to listen and appreciate classic rock, instead of the recycled crap they bring out these days. It wouldn't surprise me if this were in the top 250 list. i hope it is. a definite for my classics DVD collection and a must see, feel good film. 9/10",9,0,0,9 February 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 6 Years? Worth the wait!
","Along with millions of others i eagerly awaited Tarantino's fourth movie. He is one of my fave directors, and when i finally saw it i wasn't dissappointed. But i did realise that this movie does go several way. If you're a BIG Tarantino fan, ur most likely to enjoy it. Some didn't like it because they were thinking too much about his past projects like Pulp Fiction and Resevoir Dogs. This film is not like these. I liked this film as it shows a different side and talent to Tarantino, and shows he can write and direct anything. Other people didn't like the film because they said it didn't make sense, but this is because the film hasn't even finished yet! The directing style is definitely there, but if you're expecting a story like Pulp Fiction, then you may be disappointed. Ignore that factor. Not Tarantino's best i'll agree, but good none the same. A definite for my DVD collection. 8/10.",Null,0,1,24 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Brilliant!
","I must say like so many people i have waited for years of excitement for this film - and certainly was not disappointed!In all honesty it wasnt as good as the first, but made a pretty good sequel, with its amazing special effects (especially on the freeway sequence) and gripping storyline. Don't plan to spoil anything, but there are so many questions regarding the matrix answered, and the ending left me wanting to see the third even more!!!If you loved the first you will definitely love the second. If u didn't then theres something wrong with u! If you've not even seen the first one, where have u been?!!!Cannot wait until this comes out on DVD. Hope it's out before the next one! It will definitely be a part of my collection!",Null,0,0,22 May 2003
