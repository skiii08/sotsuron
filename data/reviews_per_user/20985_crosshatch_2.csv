Hereditary," Toni Collette made the film
","The film itself was decent. Not a great horror flick by any means. Collette's acting far surpassed the quality of the writing or the story. Alex Wolff, um, was just plain bad. First of all he was WAY too old to cast for this part. All he did was stare emotionless into the camera and the his entire character lacked any depth whatsoever. Hearing the word 'Mommie' was just...not believable from a 20-yr old playing a 16 yr old.
A few too many loose ends, weak plot points and just not enough chills to make this a great horror. It wasn't even suspenseful. Dragged a bit. 
It gets 7 stars because of Toni Collette and I didn't feel like I totally wasted my time. A decent lazy-night B-movie",7,1,3,29 August 2018
Mother!," Are you effing kidding me?
","I regret ever even saying, the words, 'Let's watch Mother!'
I could probably give you a spoiler, but you wouldn't understand it, and it can't spoil this movie any more than it already is. 
Vomit in a bucket, drop acid, drink it, and you will have a better evening. I feel so sorry for the careers of these actors.
