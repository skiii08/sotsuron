It," IT Horrified Me
","I was a bit apprehensive when I heard about the new adaptation of Stephen King's IT because I have a fear of clowns and horror movies just don't seem to scare me anymore. However, IT has most certainly managed to horrify me in the most amazing and scary ways possible.Set in the the late 80's, IT follows a band of bullied teenagers from a town called Derry who face their worst fears when a shape-shifting creature starts snatching children from the streets. Together the children set out to banish both the creature and their tormentors which takes them on a harrowing journey through adolescence.What made this film particularly terrifying was not so much the cannibal shape-shifting creature that was killing the children but rather the situations the children had to face both at home and at school. Here you have a town that is in disarray and teenagers free to roam about the streets without any proper parental guidance, resulting in a horrifying portrayal of everything that can go wrong with parenting.The brutal and real-to-life portrayal of bullying gave me the creeps and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable. From innocent name-calling to the brutal attack on a boy with a knife, IT covered the whole scope of bullying and painted a horrifying image of what children are capable of.Moreover, there was no end to the acting talent in this film with Jaeden Lieberher as Bill Denbrough and Sophie Lillis as Beverley Marsh, not to mention Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. Lieberher whom I have encountered in other films was astounding in his role as Bill. He portrayed a stuttering, grieving older brother with great ease and managed to captivate me from the beginning. Sophie Lillis whom I have never seen before IT, was brilliant in her role as Beverley Marsh and Bill Skarsgard made a pretty impressive cannibal clown.Aesthetically, the film had everything you would find in a horror movie -- gratuitous violence, blood and gore, a shape-shifting monster and jump scares that would have frightened me more if they weren't so predictable.Nonetheless, IT is a coming-of-age story that portrays everything that could possibly go wrong in childhood and how significant events can impact who we grow up to be. Dealing with themes such as bullying, child abuse, teenage hormonal angst and grief in such a horrifying way, makes IT one of the best horrors of it's time.",8,0,1,4 December 2018
Hereditary," An Uncomfortable Portrayal of Grief and Sorrow
","Hereditary is another one of those allegory films that has many interpretations which was brilliantly depicted throughout the film. The difference between Hereditary and Mother! for example, was the fact that Aster gave the audience subtle clues that hinted at many interpretations whereas Mother! left you feeling confused for weeks.The choice of acting talent was a perfect fitting for the film. Toni Collette who played the mother was astounding in her role and managed to take me through the horrifying and debilitating journey through grief. She is one of the few actresses that can personify any character.Another outstanding performance was that of Milly Shapiro who played Charlie, the daughter. There was something eerie about her performance that I still can't explain but she really gave me the creeps whenever she was shown on the screen.And let us not forget Alex Wolff who played Peter, the son. His transition from a normal teenage boy to one dealing with overwhelming grief and guilt was slow but amazing. His eyes told you everything and I find him one of the best among the new generation of actors.As for the cinematography, I felt the movement of the camera and the camera angles added to the eerie atmosphere of the film and brought it's paranormal element to life. It felt as if you were a spirit watching the events unfold from every possible corner of the house. The choice of music was also done well and obviously chosen for a reason which managed to make the hair on the back of my neck stand up.Furthermore, when it comes to the genre of the film, I wouldn't categorise it as a horror per se because while there was a little bit of everything, it didn't horrify me as much as it left me feeling overwhelmed with emotion and somewhat depressed at the end. To me it felt more like a psychological thriller that took me on a harrowing journey through grief, depicting what the mind is capable of when you suffer the unbearable loss of a family member.All in all, I found the movie disturbing in the best way possible and will definitely recommend it to my family and friends. The great thing about movies are the fact that not everyone will experience them the same way. Finally, the best part of this movie was the fact that there was no sex scenes which proves that not every horror or thriller needs sex to sell.",8,1,3,1 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Electrifyingly Beautiful
","I would like to start off by saying that I am not particularly drawn to biopics so I was a little hesitant going into 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually enjoyed this two and a half hour biopic of Freddy Mercury's flamboyant and somewhat troubled life. Considering that it took 10 years to make this stunner, I think they did an amazing job.As a lover of all things Rock 'n Roll, Queen has always been a staple in my household growing up, however, I never understood why people were so drawn to Freddy and his fellow band members until I watched 'Bohemian Rhapsody.' I now understand why he was such an amazing performer and why people could not help but love him.To start off, I would like to take a moment to congratulate director Brian Singer on his choice of cast members. The acting was flawless and very captivating. Rami Malek in particular, was astounding in his role as Freddy Mercury. He was able to mimic Freddy's unique and often ostentatious on-stage movements flawlessly and was able to bring Freddy's struggle with his sexuality to life, showing just enough emotion to draw the audience in. This was nothing short of an stellar performance.Furthermore, the editing of the final product was expertly done and even though Rami Malek was lip syncing his way through this performance, the editing of these scenes was flawless. So much so that anyone who doesn't know Mercury's unique voice will think Malek was singing all of those parts so well done to the editing team on making it look real.Moreover, the themes portrayed in the film, that of sexual orientation, music and aids were all brilliantly executed and the film gave a great overview of the man that was Freddy Mercury. As I watched him unfold on the screen, I felt myself overcome with emotion and empathy for it was his inner struggles that made him the amazing performer that he was and it is films like 'Bohemian Rhapsody' that help fans understand the blood, sweat and tears that goes into a rock 'n roll record or any other record for that matter.If you love rock 'n roll music then this biopic is definitely the one for you and even if you are not such a fan, I highly suggest you give this one a go. It was absolutely beautiful in every way and I look forward to more from this outstanding director.",8,1,2,2 December 2019
Schindler's List," A True Depiction of an Unspeakable Horror
","So I watched Schindlers' List on Saturday and must admit while I found it rather disturbing, I could not look away for the whole duration of the film. It is no secret that I have always been drawn to movies with a powerful message and find myself searching for existential meaning in almost everything I am exposed to, however, the Holocaust did not only mark a pivotal point in our human history but symbolised the most disturbing and darkest side of our human nature; our insatiable appetite for power and control, and the hateful disregard for human life.Consequently, we are repeatedly reminded of the extent to which our human indecency can go which often leaves us wondering when it will happen again. By now you would have guessed that the movie is about Oskar Schindler; a German businessman and member of the Nazi Party, who, after witnessing the deplorable way his Jewish factory workers were being treated by the Nazi soldiers, set out to help them. Liam Neeson was flawless in his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and gave the character the angelic finesse he deserved. I am almost certain that Oskar Schindler would have been pleased with Spielberg's choice of acting talent. I found myself drawn to the character in a very intimate, yet spiritual way, something I am still unable to explain. And Ralph Fiennes who played the role of Amon Goeth; the model SS soldier who became commandant at Plaszow and was responsible for the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto; was outstanding. As I watched his character transform from a devoted SS soldier to a sadistic commandant, I felt Spielberg's choice was quite fitting and became somewhat captivated by Fiennes's performance. I could almost feel the immense hatred he had for the Jews and found myself hating him back.Whilst the content of the movie was very heavy, the cinematography was, in a word, flawless. The decision to shoot the film in black and white gave it a vintage feel and added an extra layer of frightening truthfulness. The iconic soundtrack triggered many emotions which led to many uncontrollable crying moments. Fair warning though, the genuine portrayal of violence in the film might scar some sensitive viewers and should not be taken lightly. Furthermore, I found myself questioning whether or not any of the SS soldiers went through existential moments where they questioned the ethical nature of their orders and by extension their actions. There must have been times when they were emotionally distraught and unable to complete the orders that were given to them. I cannot imagine that none of them struggled to sleep at night knowing that they were murdering, no, slaughtering innocent people on a daily basis. It is unfathomable that so many people were brainwashed into believing the ridiculous antics of one monstrous man.And finally, there were three scenes which stood out throughout the movie. The first was the scene with the little girl in the red dress. It is believed that she represented the innocence of the Jewish people, which I feel is correct, however, I also think that she represented the horrifying truth of what was to come. The second was the scene where the Jewish prisoners were ordered to exhume the bodies of their fallen comrades and told to push them into a bonfire in order to dispose of them. Oskar is present at the cremation and notices a wheelbarrow containing the bodies of children, amongst them, the little girl in the red dress who he had spotted running into a building in the Ghetto when he watched the SS soldiers liquidating the Ghetto. I believe this may represent the loss of innocence and symbolised the complete lack of regard for human life. The final scene was the scene where Oskar breaks down after he is handed a gold ring that the Jews he saved had made for him to say thank you for saving them. This is probably one of the most iconic scenes in the movie because it speaks volumes as to the horrors that Oskar had witnessed and the empathetic human nature during times of hardship.",10,1,2,5 October 2018
The Lion King," An Unemotional Portrayal of a Disney Classic
","So I watched the live-action version of The Lion King last night and was left utterly disappointed. As a hardcore 90's kid, I grew up with the animation version which might make me a little biased but this version was truly remarkably underwhelming.To start, I would like to thank the CGI team for the stunning visual effects. I found myself captivated by the beauty of the Savannah and the stunning creatures that lived there. From the opening scene up to the very last one, I felt the effects were brilliant and very real-to-life. I imagine it took a lot of hard work to bring the story to life from animation to live-action and for that reason and that reason alone, I was very impressed by the visual aspects of the film.However, the voice acting was well under par. I felt many of the actors did not express emotion enough which made the whole story seem very uninviting and flat. I mean, even the great James Earl Jones who returned as the great Mufasa was very underwhelming.What was most striking about the animated version, apart from the emotion expressed by the animated characters was the fact that the voice acting was brilliantly executed and exciting. The musical stylings of James Iron who played Scar, Rowan Atkinson who played Zazu, Whoopi Goldberg who played Shenzi and even Jonathan Taylor Thomas who played young Simba drew me in from the very first moment and captivated my heart.In this version, the songs were appalling, apart from 'Hakuna Matata' which I really enjoyed, the rest were way under par. In 'Be Prepared', I could hardly hear what Chiwetel Ejiofor was singing and the iconic 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' was bland and missed the awesome Rowan Atkinson flair I was looking forward to.All in all, the cinematography was epic but the story lacked heart due to underwhelming voice acting and bland musical numbers.",4,1,1,30 March 2020
A Quiet Place," A Harrowing Tale of Survival
","When I started watching 'A Quiet Place' I did not have much hope for the film as I hold the horror genre in high regard and I have been enticed far too many times only to be left disappointed. However, 'A Quiet Place' did not disappoint at all, in fact, I could not look away from start to finish.Set in a post apocalyptic world where alien creatures with incredibly good hearing have invaded earth, a young family must do everything they can to survive without making a sound. The premise for 'A Quiet Place' is eerily similar to 'The Silence' and mimics the post apocalyptic world of 'Birdbox' the only real difference being the fact that in 'Birdbox' people have to wear blindfolds because if the creatures see you looking at them, you die.However, 'A Quiet Place' was a lot better than 'The Silence' and 'Birdbox' in that the characters seemed more realistic and the actress who played the deaf girl is deaf in real life. John Krasinski was great as Lee Abbot, a devoted husband and father who tried everything to protect his family from these alien invaders. Krasinski who directed the film, played alongside his real life wife, Emily Blunt, who played Evelyn Abbot in the film. Her performance was astounding and the chemistry flowed in abundance between the two of them.Another noteworthy performance was that of deaf actress, Millicent Simmonds who played Regan Abbot, the only deaf character in the story. What enticed me about Simmond's performance was the way she portrayed Regans' struggle as a teenage girl trying to prove to her father that she is capable of doing everything her brother can do (despite being deaf) and dealing with the death of her younger brother for which she feels responsible.As for the atmosphere, 'A Quiet Place' definitely set the tone brilliantly as there isn't much noise throughout the film and I often felt as if I was deaf. I felt empathetic with the characters and almost felt as if I was in the film with them.Moreover, the CGI aliens were brilliantly done and they are definitely the stuff of nightmares. While they did not scare me as much as gross me out, I did cringe every now and then when the camera zoomed in on their grotesque appearance and often felt myself stay quiet as I watched them approaching.All in all, I felt the film deserved the hype it was given. While there were small errors made in the film and some scenes needed a little tweaking, I felt the film captured life in a quiet world much better than 'The Silence' did.",8,0,1,22 April 2019
The Green Mile," An Emotional Masterpiece!
","There have been a few times in my life when a film moved me to such a degree that I cry for hours after the end credits have rolled... last night was one of them. I avoided watching The Green Mile for years after my very first experience left me crying for a whole week and experiencing intense nightmares about it. One could say that I was probably not emotionally ready to handle a movie of this magnitude and while the emotions I experienced were very real to me, I never grasped the underlying messages and couldn't understand the symbolism.As a matured adult I experienced the film very differently. On the surface level, this film is about the brutal murder of two young girls which led a black man to be falsely accused of the crime and sentenced to death. The film delves into the relationships formed between the prisoners and the officers in charge, and the realization that he may be innocent of the crime. However, beneath the surface, the film is riddled with deep symbolism that makes it incredibly difficult to watch.The selection of cast members for this movie was expertly chosen - each one bringing a new layer of humanity to the overall story. Tom Hanks was breath-taking in his portrayal of Paul Edgecomb, the head guard on the mile who was greatly affected by the magical presence of John Coffey. Tom captured Paul's inner struggles beautifully and brought the character to life. The late Michael Clarke Duncan, who played John Coffey was mesmerising and I could not take my eyes off of him. His muscular physique and rough exterior made him perfect for the role but it was his ability to embody the mysterious and often naive nature of John Coffey's character that should have won him an Oscar. His character's growth throughout the film and his ultimate realisation that the only way to escape this unpleasant life is to go through with his execution are what made him so heart-wrenching to watch. Moreover, the underlying symbolism in this movie was expertly hidden and handled with care. Most notably was Mr Jingles, the little grey mouse who befriended inmate Edward Delacroix and offered him some relief from the pain he was facing as his impending execution was fast approaching, symbolising the child-like nature of the human spirit and our longing to cling to life. I found their interactions very heart-warming but it was his brutal execution that awoke a sense of hopelessness and sadness in me.Another example of this was evident in the scene where John Coffey is being led out of the prison to be taken to the house of the Sheriff who's wife was dying of brain cancer; he stops for a moment to look up at the stars and tries to share a story with the officers. Later, as he is being led to a wooded area outside the prison walls, he stops for a moment to smell the leaves on the floor and then offers them to the officers to smell. In both scenes, he portrays both the child-like wonder so many of us have lost and the lack of gratitude that we have for simple things like being able to smell leaves or look up at the stars. Finally, John Coffey epitomized three of the most beautiful characteristics any person could have: love, compassion and empathy. As I watched his character unfold, I felt drawn to the pain that he was experiencing. If I had to describe my own experience with this life, it would be through John Coffey's famous line: 'I'm tired, boss. Tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. I'm tired of never having a buddy to be with, to tell me where we's going to, coming from or why. Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other.'",10,7,9,20 September 2018
