The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A total bore, left after 60 minutes
","I usually watch a movie till its end. This was the second case I left the cinema in the middle of a movie.I can't understand the people giving this uninspired movie such high scores.From the beginning till the moment we left this movie dragged along, without anything much happening. And understand me right, I've never been a fan of high-paced dull action-movies either. So, it is not that this movie is about being an action packed flick. This is about cinematography, the art of script-writing, telling an interesting story, creating suspense, of which this movie lacks all of it. The only instance of suspense was such a dumb and dull example of template-based Hollywood scripting that I wanted to rip the screen apart: I mean how creative is a scene which creates suspense by using the lever of an emergency situation, where within a 1-minute countdown all doors are closed in an underground bunker? And of course the heroine rescues her friend and the affable dog just 2 seconds before the massive steel doors would have crushed her bones and spilled the screen with blood. Having read the review of another IMDb reviewer where she details how the author of the Hunger Games series actually copied and stole the ideas from a range of Japanese movies and mangas, I totally believe that. Because this is just a dumb, uninspired copycat attempt of doing something, but lacks the heart and passion.Above all, what the hell is so interesting anyway about a teenage girl becoming a soldier? Is this a trivial attempt to recruit more female soldiers into the army? Because that is exactly how it looked like: like a remake of Top Gun for girls.Another tidbit: who on earth goes out to fight in the battlefield only armed with a bow and a handful of color coded arrows against a fleet of remote-controlled fighter jets? And above all what is the sense of color codes if the arrows are behind your head where you don't see any colors ...This movie is so flawed, I don't even know where to stop ...",1,52,86,3 December 2014
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Don't waste your time
","I've seen so many films in my life, but rarely such a bore like this one. If I could I would sue the production company to reimburse me the time I wasted to watch this.",2,0,2,7 June 2020
