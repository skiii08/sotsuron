Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Paper-thin turned into a gross understatement.....
","Needless to say, the phantom menace was one of the most vigorously anticipated movies in The Netherlands, my residence at the time of release. Before the movie hit the theatres, I watched a download off some korean site on my computer, and thought it was cool. When it finally hit the theatre, my girlfriend and I went to see it after the initial rush for tickets had died down. In retrospect, the tickets to that movie weren't worth the paper they were printed on. She even fell asleep and although I seldom do that, I can empathise. The movie becomes unbelievably dull once you punch through the enormous barrage of sound and animation, and is simply not suited for repetitive viewing.Some say the story is paper-thin... If only it was: I had to whip out a full size electron microscope to even find hints of a story. The characters were about as deep as a shot-glass, and the whole experience was just an anti-climatic.Don't get me wrong: I'm not a star-wars hater. Quite the opposite, I've enjoyed parts 4, 5 and 6 many times. This one however is a powerhouse FX movie with all the animation, sound and gadgets in the world. But a pretty thing without more to it is just that: a pretty thing. And that gets boring at an alarming pace.Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and Pernilla August are good actors in which I'm disappointed because all the big bucks in the world don't justify letting yourself be hired for this B-movie. And for those that doubt their acting skills after seeing this particular film, go see movies like 'Enskilda Samtal', 'Trainspotting', 'Brassed off', 'Schindlers list' and 'Micheal Collins'. Those that read this and haven't seen the film yet might as well have a look at the above instead.Lucas should have simply quit while he was ahead. It might make him money, but the man has lost my faith as a director/producer.",Null,0,1,17 May 2000
American Beauty," Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most normal of us all?
","After having read through a whole pile of comments by IMDB users about this film, I can't help but notice that the most badly-argumented, vigorous, total rejections of this film (one can almost call them declarations of hate) comes from people within the United States of America... Why is this? I have my theories.Somebody wrote about this film that it is not for the masses, and maybe he was right. American Beauty portrays us for what we are: Materialistic, childish, uncontrolled, selfish, intolerant people. But all is not black that we see... The beauty in this film is that every character, no matter what flaws, has their bright side. That makes it such an important document: It rubs our noses right into the fact that the American Dream, although it does exist, is not perfect and neither are the people living it or trying to live it. Albeit not an idea one enjoys being confronted with, it did make me think about who I am, what I do and how I behave towards others. In my book, that already makes it a success.The movie, although excellent, bothered me in one respect because throughout the film I couldn't help but think that it is a partial rip-off of 'Happiness', the 1998 movie by Todd Solondz. The story that unfolds in that movie is very similar with the distinction that 'Happiness' is totally non-judgmental towards any behaviour depicted, which cannot entirely be said for 'American Beauty'.I invite anyone who has enough character to look in the mirror for a while and be honest to themselves to go get this film and have a long, hard look at it. It's worth every minute. If after that you still want more I would seriously recommend watching 'Happiness' as well, but don't forget to strap yourself in for that emotional roller-coaster ride... Neither movie is for the feint-hearted or blissfully ignorant.Either which way, I'll never drive through a drive-in hamburger joint again without a smirk on my face....",Null,0,0,17 May 2000
