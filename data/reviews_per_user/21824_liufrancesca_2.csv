Marie Antoinette," good not great
","Shedding some light on to the life of one of the most famous spenders in history, I thought this film was OK. It was interesting to see how the french royalty lived, and the decadence was amazing, but the story was a little lacking. I found myself getting a little board. I would have liked to see a little more character development, I still feel like I didn't really get to know the king and queen. The costumes and the scenery were the best part. They looked amazing, Versailles is gorgeous. All the dogs, and cakes, and just food and parties in general were so amazing, I can't imagine living like that. Also, I was confused about the affair; there didn't seem to be any sneaking around, were we just supposed to assume that the king knew a didn't care. I thought this was fairly entertaining, but with a little more of a plot it could have been much better.",6,0,0,6 March 2007

","I'm not sure this movie was as good as all the hype is making it out to be. I think yes visually it is very strong. I thought it was animated when I first say the preview; I didn't realize it was real people until I was watching the film. I think it captured the epic sentiment it was going for. The speeches made by the characters were powerful, and the acting was good. But, there were parts of the film that dragged; I found my mind wandering a little bit. Another problem I had were the graphic sex scenes. I really didn't think they were necessary. A lot of younger kids were in my theater and it just didn't seem appropriate or needed to show the strength in the relationship between the king and queen.I liked that the queen is a strong character. It is good to see strong female characters especially since they are often overlooked in history. I like that the king really respected her opinion and looked to her for advice. I think this movie is definitely worth watching, but I don't think it will be one of the best films of the year.",7,4,9,11 March 2007
