The New World," Spectacular Poetic film
","I can not understand and other rating but a 10 for this film. Why? Because it didn't contain a lot of unnecessary drivel, extraneous blabber and gratuitous violence and sex? This film made me weep from the poetic and graceful depiction of the worst and best of human nature. The visual narration evokes deep emotion. Few film makers and actors can achieve such a sensory blast with music, visual, poetry and acting with little dialogue. I commend Sir Malik and the great actors who were able to transform themselves so eloquently to tell a story so moving and profound in a world where a story like this is usually told in everything this film was not. It was sensitive and touching and artistic. Something we seem to be losing.",10,1,3,18 February 2013
Divergent," Music Supe should NEVER work again
","So, since there are a ton of accurate reviews that describe the good 'enough' and lame aspects of this movie but NOBODY points out what actually does make or break this movie. If the soundtrack was good it would actually have raised the ratings exponentially, but alas, the music supervisor completely destroyed the already weak credibility of this movie. It's a shame, but a movie teetering on being so-so and lame which has total crap cheese ball horrible music for its soundtrack should just make sure that music supervisor NEVER EVER works again, they need to follow a different calling or maybe do music for IDK, their local church or something.",6,0,0,20 December 2014
The Butterfly Effect," A Sleeper in my mind!
","I think this was a GREAT film and Ashton Kutcher deserved to do a serious film that he was able to prove his versatility in. I sincerely believe he exceeded that accomplishment. It certainly seems a shame it never got the recognition it was due. I loved the story and the 'message'. I like films that have a meaningful inference. Butterfly effect was just that. It freaks me out too because of the whole 'insane' premise. Every story that insinuates that people who are delusional have time travel capabilities. I'm not saying it's possible but...what if in 500 years it turns out to be a possibility???? Food for thought(?) Basically, be careful what you wish for. Everyone of us question our lives at some point, whether it is just wishing to have changed a mere moment or to wish and hope for things to be different, better with MORE? Anyone who says they never go there...it's a LIE!!",10,0,1,6 March 2008
Ex Machina," Unexpected ending.
","This is the first film I've seen in a long time that I had NO idea what was going to happen and only a few of my story guesses were correct while the surprises were stunning. Ex Machina is a wonderful inspection into humanity, intelligence, feminism and expectations. The whole time I felt a physical tension in my own gut watching every scene. I like to play a game where I puzzle the story before the next step happens and in this film, I found it a great challenge. We think we are so smart, even when we know we are going to be our own demise, so in the end we STILL don't know the capacity of destruction the things we make can generate. The tension and the end are palpable. SO well done.",10,10,17,15 June 2015
Les Misérables," loved it! Maybe this will inspire to bring back the Musical FIlm. :)
","The movie is fantastic. It's a little sad that the movie is SO significantly better than the play. I did not really know what the heck was going on when I saw the play. And the music is good in the play BUT in the film, everything is so vivid, up close and I know I should be shot for saying this... But I actually liked the way Anne Hathaway sang I dreamed a dream better than Patty Lapone. Something about the way Anne Hathaway sang it, more personal and emotionally connected than the 'theater' version, Patty Lapone sings just made it so great. And ALL the characters are so much more tangible. Sacha B Cohen is PERFECT with Helena B Carter. Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar. The other actors were amazing too...Cosette young ..totally adorable & older Amanda S, Marius (Eddie R), Éponine (Samantha Barks) even Russel Crowe, all of them were wonderful. If you like musicals this to me is a brilliant combination of film and theater. LOVE IT!! Can't wait to see more like this. :)",10,2,3,29 December 2012
The Fountain," Only Love can save the day
","Boring unoriginal theme and I can't get the image of the monkey with his body encased in a box and only his head free to move around while the Monkey was NOT acting and looked terribly frightened.....with his arms, legs and body locked away from his head!! while in 2006 it was Darron Aronofsky's prerogative to use a sentient being against his will, fortunately, it's not anymore (2015)! I would like to use some expletives here to describe my feelings about D.Aronofsky for not caring in the least, but instead I will point out how many great SciFi films out there created by brilliant minds with love and science and future being the theme that never used ONE animal! Sure Jackman and Weisz are great actors, but it wasn't about having the cerebral capacity or not to 'get it' or having patience, the movie was unnecessarily slow. For some reason the Love story seemed 'old' to me, though love will never get old, maybe it was the way the story was told. Then again, this movie was made in 2005, released in 2006 and I just saw it in 2015, so maybe timing has a good deal to do with it. Though great stories always can pass the test of time.",3,2,5,15 June 2015
