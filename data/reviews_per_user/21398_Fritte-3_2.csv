Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a bible fantasy creation
","In the first trilogy it's easy to find, considering the empire and the republic, a lot of common points with the roman and greek history. in the new trilogy we begin to taste something that it's always deeply connected with the roman history and it is the story of Jesus Christ. It could be just an interpretation but the character of Anakin is designed as a new saver while the cities of Tatooine remember Jerusalem. Lucas created something that could be considered a generational phenomena but he didn't do it by chance he really touched our most important roots. Another reference could be easy find in the Pad race that it's a pretty present to Ben Hur. Come on and see it.",9,13,18,25 August 1999
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," the first real vision of power
","Salò is just not a movie about the terrible stories of De Sade but a real vision of the concept of power. The castle creates a a weird surreal atmosphere where it's easy to feel in deep contact with our mind trasgressions, but quickly everything appears terrible: our democratic vision of things let us impossible to follow the anarchist manifestation of who owns the power. Pasolini touched the goal he was able to create a movie that could not be assimilated in our society and that is far away from every massification, a real masterpiece.",Null,2,3,6 May 1999
