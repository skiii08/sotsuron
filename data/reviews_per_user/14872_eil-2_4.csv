Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Dark Side of the Force
","I could hardly hide my glee when viewing the teaser trailer for this, the first Star Wars prequel. I've seen it many times by now, and the sad fact is that it is pretty poor when viewed repeatedly. The acting is almost continually below par- just take Jake 'the Table' Lloyd or Liam Neeson who looks confused throughout the film. John Williams score is sadly, the worst of the series, although he manages to create two memorable tunes- Duel of Fates and Trade Federation March- but most of his score is more suited to a schmaltzy TV Movie. Jar Jar Binks (the most annoying Star Wars character ever) and his computer generated pals succeed in ruining a film which could have been so much darker (the Sith sub- plot is fascinating). All in all, less Star Wars and more Manufactured Hollywood Moviemaking. 5/10",Null,0,1,3 April 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Will Spielberg ever make a good movie again
","If this movie had ended straight after the superb opening titles then perhaps I would think more highly of it. Well, initially, it's fairly average, with a fair dash of schmaltz, but nothing too terrible... but it goes on for so long. Chase movies shouldn't last 140 minutes. CMIYC continues Spielberg's inexplicable trend of dragging the ending on forever. Surprisingly, the one good thing about the movie is Tom Hanks, playing an up-tight obssessive FBI agent. But in the end, it ain't enough. I have now vowed never to see another Spielberg movie again after this waste of time.",Null,1,1,3 February 2003
Batman Returns," Better than the original?
","It's a hard decision to make- which is better, Batman or Batman Returns, as both represent the quality end of action cinema superbly. Batman Returns lacks a truly great villain; Danny DeVito's  hammy Penguin is more sympathetic than the Joker but not as charismatic, and the finale stretches the credibility of even a superhero movie. In it's favour, Batman Returns is more exciting than the original, with brilliant performances from Keaton, Pfeiffer and Walken, playing villainous (surely some mistake) businessman Max Shreck. Danny Elfman provides a typically excellent score, and the Christmas stylings work in the film's favour. The things falls apart slightly with the script; dialogue is generally funny (in a good way), but as I mentioned above, the ending was far too silly. Batman Returns is good fun, and possibly superior to the original. It's certainly better than Joel Schumacher's camp garbage take on the caped crusader. 8/10",8,0,0,3 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Overlook the Ewoks and you've got a superb movie
","There are many who claim the final Star Wars chapter gives the Ewoks the limelight- this is untrue. Although the cutesy teddy bears are bizarrely integral to the plot, the final half of the film is a tribute to Empire- very dark. Ian McDiarmid, as the Emperor, gets so many excellent lines that I'd swear he'd payed off George Lucas for them. The final battle between Vader (my favourite character) and Luke is enhanced by John Williams' excellent music. Not all the creatures in the film are annoying- the opening sees the droids Threepio and Artoo travelling to vile gangster Jabba the Hutts palace. This is truly classic Star Wars. The scenes featuring the slug- like Jabba are amusing and the various others creatures that inhabit his palace look incredible. All in all- a good follow up to The Empire Strikes Back- 8/10.",Null,0,1,3 April 2001
