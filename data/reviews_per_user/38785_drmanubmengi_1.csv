Skyfall," Great Movie
","'Skyfall' is THE BEST James Bond Movie ever & Daniel Craig THE BEST Bond ever. Kudos to Daniel Craig & Javier Bardem for excellent performances. Everything about Skyfall is GOOOOOOOOOOD.Demise of 'M' is hurting because we won't be getting to see Judi Dench in more James Bond Movies & i really hope that Ralph Fienes fill her shoes in a great way by his excellent performances.Daniel Craig has brought emotions to the bond movies which i personally think were lacking in all the previous bonds, case being Casino Royale & now Skyfall.Javier Bardem has done a great job being the Bond Villain. The first few scenes where Silva (Javier) meets Bond are simply amazing. Javier has played his character to the fullest, the smile, the laugh, the gestures, everything is amazing.New 'Q'. Well done. The boyish charm & smile despite the fact he is playing a major role in MI6 are good but he still has to mature which we might get to see in coming bond movies.Overall a great movie, Well Done.",10,4,16,4 November 2012
