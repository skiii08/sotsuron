Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A balanced, analytical view of the film.
","The main problem when this film came out was the hype! HypeÂºD! I would consider myself a very big Star Wars fan but immediately pre-release I was expecting trash. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised and overall enjoyed a good film, all though some of my fears were true, mainly in George Lucas's failure to keep certain important elements of his original trilogy.The film's main strength is its stirring action pieces and stunning visuals, some of the special effects will blow you away if seen on the big screen. Personally however I thought too much CGI was used at times, particularly in the space scenes.  The pyrotechnics and models used in ROTJ have still to be bettered in creating a realistic and intense space scene in any film. The stunts on the other hand are perfect, mainly down to the brilliant choreography wherever Ray Park is involved.Story wise however there are some disappointments, Anakin as a centre piece could have ruined the film if the rest hadn't been up to scratch.  The script is average at best, so to get a realistic and relatable child character out of it is impossible. Anakin is unrealistically clever for his age and unlike any kid I have ever come across. To claim that the original Star Wars films were 'kids films' is blatantly wrong, they are family films and there is a difference.  The main characters were very realistic adults, and totally relatable and believable.  In this film other than Anakin the characters are very 2 dimensional and distant.One last point that I noticed is another comparison with the original trilogy, before we followed the protagonists on their own journey in a world where they are involved in the major 'galactic events' but are not what the galaxy revolves around,i.e. they are not the people in charge, in this film however the main characters are the centre of galactic affairs and we are again distanced from them because we do not have the same feeling of following realistic people caught up in something bigger than themselves!Comparisons with the original trilogy are often criticised, but don't forget that this isn't supposed to be a stand alone movie and where the older three have the same feel to them this one does not.  Admittedly it is hard with different characters and different technology for its production, but I can't help feeling it could have had better links to the other films! Overall I gave it an 8, where the first trilogy received 9,10,9 respectively!",8,0,0,25 September 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Missing something?
","The main problem I have with this film is that it loses the original style of the other films (including Alien3, which I liked) through trying to be too deep and clever. The underlying threat of the Alien is its mystery, like many things we fear even when we see the Alien its way of thinking is something vastly different to ours, simple and more primal, hence more perfect killing machine. In trying to 'delve into the Alien Psyche' the creature loses some of its scariness. It also lacks a lot of credibility storywise.  The Aliens lack numbers which is fine in a prison or a mining ship where there is no military hardware. Also where did they get bits of Ripley to regenerate when she burnt herself to nothing in molten metal, note the bits needed her DNA after impregnation!!????? Not a wholly unpleasant film but poor acting and a distinctly European feel (whose artistic emphasis lessen a necessary grittiness in this sort of Sci-Fi demonstrated in The 5th Element) mean you don't get quite as involved. Lets look to the novels and graphic novels and hope for an Alien vs. Predator again, which was planned before this apparently but got scrapped........WHY?????",4,0,0,3 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very good!!!
","****Some Spoilers***** This review is really intended for people who have seen the film, or have at least read the book.  All anyone needs to know who has done neither is to do so A.S.A.P I have been looking forward to another attempt at a film adaption of the Lord Of The Rings, and I'm not disappointed. I have followed the gradual seepage of info on this film during it's production with interest and well before its release I was happy with the final casting, the actors seemed to fit the bill well, and guess what, I was right!! (Although I find Liv Tyler a little bland, it didn't matter because Arwen is a relatively sideline character anyway) Orlando Bloom, as all the reviewers were saying, does ooze style, while Viggo Mortenson, Sean Bean and Ian Mckellen are able to pull off their unusual scripting, typical and appropriate in fantasy films, without ever seeming cheesy. At times McKellen is particularly outstanding.  But I found Elijah Wood a real surprise. Not having seen much of his other work I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleased to see he fits into the role perfectly, progressively showing inner feelings and depth as the character changes during the film. The other Hobbits were sidelined somewhat during this film, Merry and Pippin being used as a bit of comic relief more than anything else, but I expect from what I know having read the books that this will change somewhat in parts II and III, especially for Sean Astin as Sam, displayed rather strongly at the end of the film in a scene where I actually began to shed tears ( yes i felt a little sad at my age but what the hell), the friendship between sam and Frodo will undoubtably be a greater element in the sequels. And Sean even manages to pull of a semi-accurate English country accent to good effect. Action wise the film excels!! Again a key element is the style in Legolas' use of a bow and arrow, while the swordplay is inde fast and furious, without having to resort to ripping off any Matrix stylee effects as too many films in recent years have done.  Despite what another comment says I would very much liken the action to Gladiator, possibly even better.  The other strong point is the orc design.  There position is more clearly defined in this film than I remember in the book, in terms of what they are and the attention to these and various other creatures beyond their just being the foe adds more fear in their presence, much like the stylistic animation did in the animated film. Visually the film is stunning, and CGI is used much better here than in most films of recent years that have rendered exotic landscapes for films, perhaps because it seems more sparing, using a lot of genuine New Zealand landscape to keep a real feel to Middle Earth. If I have any real quibbles(?) with the film,its in minor details.  While I expect obvious liberties with plot and story events for the transfer to film, most of which seem acceptable, I wasn't too keen on the representation of scenes in either elf city.  The Council of Elrond seemed too vague, all the feeling of real planning and heavy decision making was lost, and Elrond seemed to have too little command of his own council. (also, Arwen should never have stopped the riders when it was a representation of the extent of Elrond's powers within his kingdom).  Similarly in Lothlorien Galadriel's part seems redundant of necessity to the story, the meeting seems all too short to convey anything.Again, one other minor point, although I know this is looking ahead more, but it would have felt better to have had a little more of Gollum in the backstory, and in the nearness and intensity of his pursuit of the ring during the journey of the fellowship.  But this all becomes more important when he meets Frodo and Sam in Part II. Overall though, the action and atmosphere of the film are the most important  elements.  Here Fellowship of the Ring really succeeds and it is here that people will be truly entertained.  While people not really into fantasy might not be as adamant about the films strengths as others, I see no reason why everyone can not appreciate the films entertainment.",10,0,0,19 December 2001
28 Weeks Later," I was so bored
","I saw this film last night and was so disappointed after being so impressed with the first film.I won't put any spoilers here as someone else refers to the bigger plot holes and silly set ups in their comment, but I simply have to get of my chest how bored I was.The first 30 mins or so were actually very good as it is set during the initial outbreak and has some decent characters and has a more personal feel to the situation. Then we cut to 28 weeks later and there is just so much talking rubbish, silly plot devices and boredom. No real characters are followed, the two children don't really do anything and are only the main characters because they repeatedly kill off anyone else who speaks.THe camera work was terrible and over the top with the hand held grainy look. There was too much darkness, not just shadowy eerie darkness, but just plain downright blackness! Without any suitable eerie sounds because all you could hear was gunshots or LOUD POUNDING MUSIC! I just wasn't scared or interested.Several people walked out of the showing but I only stayed because my girlfriend doesn't like watching half a film.",3,0,3,19 May 2007
American Beauty," Overrated! But not bad.
","One of the main faults I found with this film (and I will admit I looked for them because of the hype) is that many people said it reflected real-life, yet it's atmosphere was too surreal to allow the viewer to feel any relation to the film.  Likewise the characters and their situations were all too far to the extremes in their makeup to reflect the much more complicated lives we lead.In a more entertainment driven sense, however, the performances were very good and the script was well-written, funny and full of the right amount of emotion.  The story was immersive and includes a few instances that genuinely leave you guessing until the last minute.It's not quite as deep as the hype made it sound, the overall message seems fairly simple, that we should understand what we want better and try to avoid the repressive things in society or they will bring us down, basically to relax more.  If the lives in America's suburban neighbourhoods are more like this overall then I think they do have serious problems. Looking at my own life and those of people around me, even we of the working class suburbs who work most of the time lead much more varied and colourful lives than here.There is a tendency today to overemphasize the number of problems in family life, something perpetuated by the perception of problems in family life and looking too deeply into minor things that were ignored in the past because people didn't have the time to notice them and just got on.  There is no denying that there are more divorces and single-parents e.t.c. but is this necessarily a bad thing, might it just be a step forward into creating less rigid relationships that allow us to be happier, I think these are just freedoms that weren't expressed before because society didn't allow them but that the number of genuinely happy families is the same, if not higher than that of previous generations.Or am I just too much of an optimist in that sense.",7,0,0,12 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," I was actually BORED!!!!
","I loved the last Mummy film, I thought it had an edge on many other Special effects films today by still having a style reminiscent of older films. Much of the action and atmosphere were similar to Indiana Jones, and it was well scripted and acted.But this sequel lost most of the best stuff, what a pile of tripe!First and very importantly is the fact that the special effects are either the same design as the first film (or even stolen from other films....Velociraptors in the tall grass!!) or.....oooh the shame with such a large budget.....unbelievably poor!! It at times looked more like those really old movies where they just stuck a screen behind the actors that showed lots of scenery, I'm talking big thick black matte lines here!!Also, admittedly I have a thing against children in films (most of them just can't act they simply imitate what they see older actors doing and therefore don't come across natural or like the children they portray), but here the kid always looks like he wants to start laughing.  All he does is come out with all the wise cracks that would normally be given to Fraser's character, and so they are totally out of place and not as funny.The Rock is hardly in it, the acting is mediocre at best, it drags on too much, like too many films it has inferior Matrix style fight sequences in (why oh why does every action film see a need to have martial arts that looks unrealistic and is too fast to look stylish because its just blurry images on the screen?), steals ideas and lines form other films in a way that doesn't do them justice to be a compliment.It was just a big disappointment, there were hardly any laughs or screams in the full cinema theatre and everyone walked out as fast as possible.I have only seen two worse films at the cinema, Street Fighter the Movie and Maybe Baby and both were really bad!!!",5,0,0,19 May 2001
Jaws," Irrepressible admiration
","Steven Spielberg's Greatest!!!! Truly a masterpiece of film making, and should be held in everybody's list of favourite's. The film is rich in both realism and excitement, with not a bad performance in sight, and some of the greatest put on film. Robert Shaw is truly brilliant as the hard-bitten sailor Quint. The two piece story line (first the shark attacks and the fight to put more effort into a hunt, and then the three heroes out at sea against the shark and the elements) is perfect for never losing the attention of the viewers. In case I haven't quite got my opinion across................. I like this film quite a bit.",10,1,2,25 October 2000
