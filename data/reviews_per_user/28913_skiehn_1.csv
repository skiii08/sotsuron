","Before this film I thought The Wedding Singer was Adam Sandler's best film, but this one is the best yet.  This is a perfect date movie and the really nice thing is the ending isn't a cheat.  Rob Schneider's Ulla steals every scene he's in, but he stops just short of caricature.  And the walrus makes you want to take him home. All in all, a wholly pleasant way to spend two hours.",9,0,0,12 February 2004
