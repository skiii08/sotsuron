The Incredible Hulk," Great Movie
",Great film 100% better than the first one thank you Louis Leterrier and Zak Penn. I won't give anything away but the acting was great Edward Norton plays Bruce banner very well and Liv Tyler is hot. In parts it was a little over the top but you have to expect this with this type of film. I would recommend anyone to go and see it even if you was not keen on the first Hulk film as you will be surprised. I always thought the incredible hulk was David Banner until I googled it and found David was the guy from TV series and Bruce is the one from out of the comics. I wonder why the TV series did not just call him Bruce. Go and see it you won't be disappointed,9,4,7,15 June 2008
The Happening," Rubbish
","Yet another poor film by M. Night Shyamalan. It was terrible from start to finish a total waste of money. The plot was dreadful the acting was poor a complete waste of time and money in my opinion. I know you guys in America will love it though as with most of his films, I think with that sort of money a 9 year old could come up with better idea's for movies. M. Night Shyamalan must be on some sort of drugs as he keeps coming up with these ridiculous films. Plants that kill people what will be next? I preferred day of the triffids to this garbage; Come on seriously how you guys ranked it so high is beyond me. Worst film of the year so far for me.",1,3,11,15 June 2008
