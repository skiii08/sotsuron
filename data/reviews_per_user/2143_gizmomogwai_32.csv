Vertigo," Hitchcock's magnum opus
","Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 psychological thriller Vertigo has enjoyed a gain in stature over the past 15 years, not bad for a film that was thought to be totally unremarkable when it first came out. In 1998 the American Film Institute broadcast its list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, ranking Vertigo in the 60s. In 2007 they rewrote their list, moving Vertigo to the top 10- specifically #9- making it Hitchcock's highest ranking film on the list. At the Academy Awards it was nominated for art direction and sound but was otherwise ignored. It wasn't even in the running for Best Picture or Best Director. (Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Director; his only film to win Best Picture was 1940's Rebecca).The film's direction and music score are masterful, so the look and atmosphere of the film become hypnotic. That much, Vertigo's critics would find hard to dispute. But the story is also deep- in fact, so deep that Hitchcock felt the need to follow up on it with the more fun film North by Northwest (also a classic). Vertigo is about the dangers of obsession as it can affect anyone- the destruction it causes and the way it twists love. Like Rebecca, in a way it's a ghost story without ghosts or even a tale of necrophilia, like Hitchcock himself said, in that Jimmy Stewart's character believes the woman he loves is dead, but he still can't let go of her. He can't forget her. He goes out looking for someone like her. And he forces the image of his beloved on his new love interest, also played by Kim Novak.But the movie is also a tale of deception and betrayal. For Stewart's character, the world is turned upside down when he realizes the girl he loved and his new love interest are the same person. The way this ends is incredible. He lost his woman on the tower twice. That was the only way to end it- a happy ending with Stewart and Novak reconciling wouldn't have fit the overall sinister tone of the story.The movie hooked me from the beginning, because of the atmosphere Hitch created. When Jimmy Stewart is first following Kim Novak around, seemingly nothing is happening but the tension is high, the mystery is compelling. I've never understood the criticism that there's too much of Stewart following Novak in his car; Hitchcock acted in moderation. He acted in moderation again when we didn't see any nudity in an erotic scene where Novak is naked in bed.I've heard other criticism, including that the story is counterintuitive. In real life, Stewart would have recognized his new girlfriend and his dead lover were the same person, even if the hair colour was different. The movie may also lack closure. Foreign audiences got an added ending in which we see Stewart back together with his old friend Midge and news has come that the murderer is about to be arrested and extradited. The so-called 'Foreign Censorship Ending,' which is included in the bonus features of the DVD, was needed for countries that had laws against depicting murderers getting away with the crime. Hitchcock thought the added ending was unneeded, and indeed, it adds nothing to the story because the murderer wasn't emotionally a large part of the film.As for the claim that the storyline is unrealistic, some people try to get around that charge in unusual ways like asserting the vast majority of the film is actually Stewart's dream. In an early scene in the movie, Stewart is seen dangling from a rooftop, making him realize for the first time that he has a fear of heights. The movie never reveals how he survived, perhaps because he didn't survive it at all. He fell to his death, and as he was falling the events of the film are what flashed through his mind. However, the 'it was all a dream' thing is cliché. And too much happened in the movie for Stewart to imagine while he plunged to his death. The film may not be totally realistic- but it touches you in a real way.",10,1,4,12 April 2011
Gremlins," My favourite guilty pleasure
","Gremlins benefits a little from the fact that I grew up with it, but mostly I liked the sequel and since then I've realized the original is better. It's a guilty pleasure, but a well-shot, well-told one, owing partly to a classic setting and effective narration by Hoyt Axton.Gremlins is a black comedy and scores some laughs. However, its story is an inspired mythology in its own right. A young man (Zach Galligan) receives a cute but unknown creature named Gizmo who multiplies, and after the new creatures (mogwai) eat after midnight, they become monsters. Lively, entertaining monsters- connected to the legendary gremlins in the mind of a veteran of World War II (Dick Miller). In one memorable sequence, they are also connected with the urban legend of pets being blown up in microwaves- this movie definitely struck a chord by borrowing from popular mythology. While the gremlins are shown enjoying the destruction they cause, with a bar scene being a highlight of the movie, the original manages to be a simpler product than its sequel, and less is more. Additionally, the original has the paradox of horror on Christmas, which the sequel misses. With cute and passable puppetry and passable performances, Gremlins remains a nice distraction.",10,2,4,24 August 2007
The Hunger Games," A decent depiction of indecency
","A blockbuster movie about teens and preteens fighting to the death, from... the director of Pleasantville? Really? Pleasantville was a good movie but this sounds a world apart. Still, The Hunger Games has a decent IMDb rating, so I decided to give it a shot.So the plot is that in a country (I assume the United States because of the accents) that had a civil war, the victorious districts annually force the defeated 12 districts to sacrifice 24 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 ('tributes'), and force them to fight to the death, with only one winner. Katniss, our hero, volunteers to fight in place of her younger sister.To the movie's credit, there is bitter irony in the fact that the tributes are congratulated for being picked, that the sadistic woman with an accent called fighting an honour, that the whole games are called forgiveness of the rebellious districts just because there's a winner. Even if those districts rebelled, that doesn't justify executing 23 innocent kids every year after the war. As the movie conveys, the fact that people watch these games and enjoy them is fundamentally sick. This is a good concept. Adding to the sick factor is that we see some of these kids actually enjoy killing. A number of tributes team up to ambush a girl who made a fire- and then they laugh about it, mimicking her, saying 'Please don't kill me!' Evil breeds evil.But while some kids enjoyed killing so much, the idea of Katniss abstaining from killing except in defence is a little harder to swallow. Sounds suicidal to me; I didn't even think she grabbed a weapon until she took out a knife to drop a wasp's nest on other tributes. Not killing Rue is, however, quite understandable. The main weakness of the film is that suddenly allowing two winners breaks the film's own rules. Even if it were done, Peeta still should have died, killed by another player, by his injuries or by those poisonous berries at the end of the film. Letting both Katniss and Peeta live together happily ever after just feels unbelievable, a cheat. Overall, The Hunger Games is still a very decent movie: frightening, sardonic, and entertaining.",7,1,5,22 April 2012
Batman Returns," I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo: my favourite Batman movie
","With his sequel to the hit movie Batman (1989), Tim Burton is given more creative control over his project and it really shows. Batman Returns explores common themes of Burton's, and it rivals Edward Scissorhands as being his best work. It makes changes to the Batman legend but not as severe as has been alleged.Visually this movie is masterful. The movie is surreal: it's like a nightmare vision. But there's actually usually overlooked substance in addition to style. The central theme of this movie is being a freak or an outcast. The Penguin at one point struggles with Batman, accusing him of being jealous because Penguin is odd physically as well as mentally. Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle also sit on a couch and talk about being strange, with Selina making a true but odd statement that sickos are committed. In this movie, two freaks find each other and discover they can feel a connection with another person. The movie goes on to argue that when you find out that you're a creep, you can go either way- you can fight for what's right or give into anger, hatred and a drive for revenge.Being pushed around can make you a monster: it happened to Penguin who was dropped into a sewer and to Catwoman who was thrown out a window. But giving into darkness will destroy you- the Penguin at the end pushes the button to set off his missiles, and this destroys his whole world. Meanwhile, Catwoman misses out on her happy ending. The only character in the movie who appears to be truly evil is the businessman Max Shreck, who manipulates and abuses- and when you do that, one day you may just face the consequences. Shreck gets fried.The movie is packed with quotable dialogue: 'Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask.' 'How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?' One of my favourite quips is from a security guard who says he doesn't know whether to open fire or fall in love. There's much twisted humour to enjoy.The music, too, helps make this movie great. This includes the tragic music that plays at the ending, and sexy, mysterious music for Catwoman. A song that plays at the dance and over the end credits also fits Catwoman, being dark and sexy.I know Batman fans were disappointed in that the caped crusader kills a couple goons; the character is today expected to have a no-killing rule, although he didn't in the first Batman comics. Still, note Batman doesn't kill except when in combat- when you have captured an enemy (Shreck at the end), killing becomes unnecessary and dangerous, a mere act of revenge. Also said fans may not like the Penguin being a freak in the sewer- but he *is* still a crime boss who works in secret while trying to join higher society (in this case by running for mayor); he still retains his love of birds and umbrellas.This is with apologies to Christopher Nolan, but Batman Returns remains my favourite Batman movie. I don't hate Nolan for not being Burton- on the contrary, I enjoyed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and thought they surpassed Batman '89. But Batman Returns is an entirely different creature- it captures the anguish and glories of the modern freak. It's a tragedy masked as a superhero movie, unique and beautiful.",9,7,16,7 May 2010
Juno," Charming, unique movie and cast
","Juno is a unique movie with a wonderful cast- From Arrested Development, Jason Bateman and Michael Cera, from The West Wing, Allison Janney, and of course there's the star of the show, Ellen Page, who is charming and a stand out. Page plays the title character, a 16-year-old intelligent outsider girl who has sex with her best friend and winds up pregnant. She first considers abortion, but at the clinic she decides that's not for her, and instead she confesses to her parents and decides to give the baby up for adoption. She finds adoptive parents, Vanessa and Mark, with Bateman and Jennifer Garner putting in great performances. But Juno soon finds the adoption won't be as perfect as she initially imagined.Juno is a comedy that relies on characterization and dialogue, and while some people won't get all the cultural references (I didn't), Juno is generally a charming character who was worth meeting. The movie also has a wonderful, artsy soundtrack. Juno generally has fewer flaws than Little Miss Sunshine, but a few jokes in Little Miss Sunshine were funnier than Juno. Nevertheless, Juno is an amusing movie and it's not to be missed.",8,5,15,17 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Sufficient conclusion to the original trilogy, but should have been great
","Return of the Jedi is the third film in the Star Wars series, and the last of the original trilogy. It is sometimes seen as the weakest of the three. The reason? Ewoks, ewoks, ewoks. These furry aliens have been deemed too cute for Star Wars, too much for kids, too much for merchandising. But personally, I don't loathe the ewoks like some do. I actually think it was neat to see how such primitive weapons could beat the Empire, which after all was Lucas' intent. Nevertheless, I agree this is the weakest film of the original trilogy. It is, however, a sufficient conclusion.What's good about it to make it an adequate conclusion to the film series? A few things. This is where we first see the gangster Jabba the Hutt (not counting a bad new scene inserted into the first film). He has become a famous movie villain in his own right. The best part about this is that we see Princess Leia half-naked when Jabba puts her in a golden bikini (though, arguably, she's *still* wearing too much). And, some of the scenes with Darth Vader and the Emperor, complete with the famous music associated with them, recaptures some of the feel of The Empire Strikes Back. There's emotion when Luke finally fights Vader, especially when Vader brings up Leia, and the music in this scene works well.On the down side, we have some fake-looking puppets here. Granted the 1977 original had some fake-looking aliens too, but Return of the Jedi came out only a year before Gremlins and that movie shows Hollywood could have done better. Also in Return of the Jedi, we have a death star blown up, and that had already been done in the original. I don't think the conflict Luke felt about his father was intense enough; the idea that Vader was good after all was unconvincing. If this film could have been darker like Empire Strikes Back, instead of having questionable compassion for Vader, Luke could have felt self-loathing, a kind of guilt for being the offspring of a monster. Luke's compassion could have perhaps shown up only at the end. Still, even if Return of the Jedi isn't great, it's a must-see to get closure on the first two classic films.",8,2,4,26 December 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Worth watching
","Long after someone recommended it, I decided to watch this after hearing just one joke on the trailer, where Greg Kinnear's character talks about sarcasm being the language of losers and someone replies with a sarcastic answer. Unfortunately, the movie has just a few other moments that are as funny, but this quirky dramedy is altogether worth watching.In touching on familiar subject matter for this genre- dysfunctional families, angst-filled teenagers, homosexuality and suicide- Little Miss Sunshine adds little to what other movies like The Royal Tenenbaums have already done. Little Miss Sunshine's strengths are in playing with the idea of being a loser, a main theme of the movie, aside from its disturbing take on beauty pageants. Not recommended for anyone who hates movies that aren't action adventures.",8,0,2,15 September 2007
North by Northwest," Joining Hitchcock's fan club
","Until a couple years ago I didn't see what the big deal was with British/American director Alfred Hitchcock. I had seen his '60s movies Psycho and The Birds and thought they were overrated. However, my curiosity was sparked when the American Film Institute put Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) in its top ten American movies of all time. Having seen it and more recently Rear Window and North by Northwest (also on AFI's list), I can say I now see why Hitchcock is considered one of the greats.North by Northwest is about spies and the Cold War, and for this reason has been compared to the later James Bond movies. Yet this movie still feels like it was made for Hitchcock- the suspense, the mystery, the thrills and murder are all here. There's also some humour thrown in for good measure. This movie centres around a case of mistaken identity as an ordinary guy (he says at the end of the movie that his wives divorced him because he was dull) finds himself in a dangerous game. There's also a woman he meets. Critic Danny Peary is quoted on the DVD back cover as saying there's 'a great deal of sex,' but really there's none, just sexual innuendo. Still, it enriches the plot. With generally believable dialogue and acting, North by Northwest is a winner.",10,1,4,25 March 2010
Coriolanus," Ralph Fiennes is the dragon, again
","Finally, after over 50 film versions of Hamlet, someone ventures into new Shakespearean territory, bringing the Bard's last tragedy, Coriolanus, to the big screen for the first time. Some may complain it's a lesser work- as if they want more of the same, and showing the audacity to pan Shakespeare- and specifically the play TS Eliot considered the Man from Stratford's greatest! In truth, Coriolanus is a perfect play for times of political turmoil, probably simpler than Hamlet but rich in its conflict, with international war tied up in domestic politics. We have a protagonist who heroically serves his country, but his tragic flaw is his anti-social nature and smugness that makes him unpopular at home.We can see the decision was made to recast the play, based in ancient Rome, to the modern era. It's a device we've seen before with Romeo and Juliet (1996) and Hamlet (2000), and while it would seem appropriate to place the first Coriolanus film in its own time, the story translates to an age of media and modern warfare relatively well. Slate magazine considered the argument that placing Coriolanus in a new setting and making it work proves it is Shakespeare's greatest play. However, the magazine rejected that argument, noting Hamlet has been placed in every setting imaginable. Certainly, Macbeth as well has been adaptable- Orson Welles transported it to the 19th century Caribbean, while Akira Kurosawa brought it to feudal Japan. While this film may not prove Coriolanus is the best of Shakespeare's plays, it nevertheless reflects that the neglected play is brilliant.Fiennes' film has a strong look and helps the viewer feel some of the intense conflict, though it's not a great film. Reading the play for the first time this week, I felt the politics were a lot more gripping than what was brought to the film. Ideally, Fiennes' film might encourage other filmmakers to make their attempts at more successfully adapting Coriolanus, or bring it back to its original setting. Alas, the poor box office performance of this film will likely discourage that- but I still salute Fiennes for his effort.",8,3,5,13 February 2016
The Shining," Still shining thirty years later- and forever and ever...
","Continuing my reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed shows throughout October, here's one of the all-time great horror flicks: Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Based on a novel by Stephen King, the movie tells the story of a family who look after a closed hotel during the winter, only for the ghosts of the hotel to drive the father Jack (Jack Nicholson) insane and determined to kill his wife and young son.Oh, right, and one other thing: the kid is capable of telepathy and precognition, something that seems unrelated to the ghostly phenomena, as if the two things were thrown into the mix just to make for interesting results. Or that may not be the case: according to the character Dick Hallorann, all these things are related to shining, something supernatural and slightly incomprehensible that certain people and places are able to do.First, dialogue about a past tragedy at the hotel allows for some foreshadowing of ghosts and murder to come. Nicholson plays a convincing psychopath, originally a man who seems to hate his family. There are early signs of insanity (maybe a little too early) as he smiles while talking about cannibalism on his way to the hotel. On the other hand, he does scream at a nightmare of himself killing his wife and son. The ghosts fan the flames, but what are their motives? The novel explains them, or so I've heard, but the movie keeps them a mystery. Maybe we're expected to understand that ghosts, like people, can be malicious.Certain parts of the film, like seeing the boy on his little bicycle exploring the hotel, are well-shot and nearly hypnotic. The horror itself unfolds in some surreal ways; a sexy naked woman turns into a hag, a metaphor of Jack being seduced by the hotel's evil. An elevator door opens and blood pours out: perhaps this is the blood of native Americans, and Bill Blakemore suggested the whole movie is a metaphor for the violence of whites against natives. It would explain the otherwise inexplicable reference to white man's burden. The ghost girls are eerie, as are the ghosts Wendy sees, and the 'novel' Jack writes. In the end, Jack freezes while his family escapes. Kubrick evidently knew what Shakespeare knew- that killing off tragic characters is often the only way to go.Happy Halloween.",10,3,4,2 October 2009
The Exorcist," Horror at its finest
","The Exorcist is a classic horror movie, nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture which I understand was rare, and it actually won an Oscar for writing. My main regret is that I've never seen the movie as it was in 1973- the dominant version on DVD is the so-called 'Version you've never seen.' Not that it doesn't have its own charms.This movie is scary and intense, depicting an innocent 12-year-old girl acting increasingly strange and violent, and then demonic. She says she's possessed by the devil, but that's likely a lie (isn't Satan's schedule too busy to target one little girl?). It's more probable that it's a regular demon.Still, ever since I first saw The Exorcist, I've always toyed with the theory that maybe the possession wasn't real. Regan may have been just mentally disturbed and obviously lost control of herself, but not to a demon. As characters in this movie themselves say, psychology is powerful and the exorcism may have only had the power of suggestion. I realize the fact that things around Regan move by themselves may be evidence that the possession was real, but it might not be- if you believe in the concept of psychokinesis. Similarly, her knowing information about the priest may be explained by telepathy. The doctors also explain how it might be possible that she could become stronger. And this may explain why the demon reacts violently to tap water- Regan thought it was holy water, and in her mind it became true. Of course, her head turning around may be the best evidence that something supernatural is happening, but still I think this matter can be seen as being up to interpretation.Either way, The Exorcist achieves its power because we can be concerned about Regan and we can feel the damage this does to her mother. Seeing the possessed Regan stabbing her own vagina with a crucifix is appalling and terrifying. Her speech is obscene, her appearance becomes grotesque. This movie isn't afraid to take on what a possession might really look like. For a religious person this movie might be seen as having a good message- indeed, I heard the voice actress behind the demon took the script to her priest who approved. But even for a secular person like me, The Exorcist is one hell of a ride.",10,3,5,31 August 2010
Independence Day," Stupid, but sensational
","Here's another page in my chapter of movies I used to love but don't any more. Actually this one had a huge effect on my life- not only did it give me an interest in aliens, but believe it or not, the president in this movie inspired me to look up real life politicians, and got me intensely interested in history and social sciences. All of my upper year schooling was centred on those subjects. Now, I recognize this isn't a particularly deep film, but for an action movie and special effects spectacle this is still a pretty good effort.The plot- an alien mothership arrives at Earth and sends city-sized spaceships over the great cities of the world, including Washington, DC, New York and Los Angeles. The dramatic music associated with these spaceships give them godlike importance (I've heard it said before that religious music and science fiction music are often alike). The movie tackles the interesting question of how people, including politicians and ordinary people, would react, showing panic, awe, and celebration. But I'd have to say Contact, the Jodie Foster movie that came out a year later, does a better job at thinking how people would react to aliens- that movie replaced this one as being my favourite alien movie (post-Star Wars). But the aliens attack the cities, which would be devastating since they're so important. The explosions look pretty convincing; the destruction of the American cities is seen but the movie lacks an international view (the scenes showing the attacks on non-American cities were cut). And we get the satisfaction of seeing the humans winning. Along the way we get some comic relief from, among other things, Jeff Goldblum's character arguing with his father, and Brent Spiner.We get some good material but there are some flaws- including an overly sentimental and cheesy subplot following the Russell character. I don't see why we should care about this idiot's issues with his children's respect, his wanting to prove himself. He's out for revenge, having been abducted by aliens years ago, so writers Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich predictably make sure to provide him the opportunity. Upon hearing he was abducted, people react to him like he's crazy even after the aliens arrive, and one has to wonder why when the world has seen conclusive proof that aliens do exist. Incidentally, Russell says the aliens have been carrying out abductions for years to learn our weaknesses. It seriously took these super-intelligent aliens *years* to learn fire hurts us? Another disappointment is with the aliens themselves- octopus men. They should have gone with the greys- they're the ones associated with Roswell, after all.The president (Bill Pullman) isn't always helpful- upon being told he's short on pilots, his order is 'Then find them.' He does give an inspiring speech, though. Jeff Goldblum is also good- he was also attached to two other huge money makers, Jurassic Park (1993) and its 1997 sequel The Lost World. Will Smith is the other star, and he's not bad.",7,3,4,27 June 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Exotic and grand, for reasons I can't fully explain
","Recently I was told I have attention deficit disorder, which admittedly, wasn't too much of a shocker. Over the past few years I've found more joy in short films than the longer ones; hence, why I loved the Canadian show ZeD since it featured lots of short films. I also watch some TV shows where episodes are only 20-22 minutes long. I enjoyed The Dark Knight (2008) but thought it was a bit too long- two hours and twenty minutes. Then there's Lawrence of Arabia (1962)- almost four hours long! Yet the movie is good enough that I actually don't resent it for its length. I don't think I'd cut anything from it. I'm not sure if I've seen it in one sitting, but it's actually compelling viewing.The film is set in World War I with the British hoping to undermine one of its enemies, the Ottoman Empire (here mostly called Turkey), by assisting the Arab revolt against it. The British officer TE Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole) particularly becomes committed to giving the Arabs their freedom- even from his own people, the British. He leads Arab warriors to some victories over the Turks.Lawrence of Arabia won the Oscar for Best Picture and the American Film Institute twice ranked it as one of the top ten best American films ever, although Lawrence of Arabia is typically considered to be a British movie. Still, it is deserving of the praise it gets. Maybe for cinematography, but I've heard that's really most impressive on the big screen. I've only seen it on my small TV and laptop, so I can't say that's really why I enjoyed the movie, although I did find the setting exotic. I'm not totally sure what the message of the movie was, and sometimes I found some of the scenes difficult to understand. But I am particularly interested in history, politics and war, and I guess that probably explains a lot of the film's appeal. Lawrence of Arabia captures the subject of achieving greatness. This includes a single man becoming great, with Lawrence becoming a hero to the Arabs and an inspiring figure to the British and Americans (through media attention), and with Prince Feisal becoming a king. O'Toole plays Lawrence in an interesting way, with emotion and conviction. Feisal, an Arab, is played by Alec Guinness, who is decidedly not Arabic- but he plays the part well, giving the character a feeling of power and wisdom. It also includes the story of how a people became great- Lawrence calls the Arabs a 'little people' at the start of the movie, but they're not by the end. Perhaps it can be said Lawrence achieves greatness by finding his place in the world, among the Arabs, showing one can find one's place in the world anywhere. But he does leave Arabia at the end of the movie. Maybe he was one of those unfortunate people who couldn't find his place anywhere. This movie, however, has a definite place in cinematic history.",10,3,5,29 June 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," I liked it
","I saw the Jurassic Park movie before reading the novel and read The Lost World novel before seeing the movie. I preferred the Jurassic Park novel to the movie because it was more complex- more characters, more dinosaurs (particularly, diverse dinosaurs), more challenges, more story. I know few people would agree, but I actually prefer The Lost World movie to the novel for the same reasons I prefer the Jurassic Park novel to the movie. The film version of The Lost World is more elaborate. There are more characters, there are more dinosaurs- not just raptors and rexes which were emphasized in the novel, but the compys played a big role, and we got to see the triceratops attacking rather than being sick as in the first one, and we got to see stegosaurs for the first time, and a pterosaur for the first time. The movie adds the twist of setting the rex loose in San Diego. This is the first time, and so far the only time in the Jurassic Park movies where we got to see the battle between man and dinosaur in an urban setting. I liked it. Just like I like how King Kong moves to the city. One guy even got stepped on, which was definitely something different!The Lost World movie has its flaws, though. One of them is Vanessa Lee Chester. Who asks their parents to be stricter? And are we really supposed to believe she can kick a raptor out the window- even after yelling at it and losing the element of surprise? And there's not much characterization. But the special effects are improved in this one and I believe they're the best in the trilogy. There's plenty of action and humour. It's altogether a good effort for its genre.",7,7,10,10 February 2008
The Theory of Everything," A brief history of Stephen Hawking
","The Theory of Everything tells the story of one of the most respected living scientists, Stephen Hawking, from his days as a young, brilliant physics student to his struggle with Lou Gehrig's Disease, and becoming the man we know today, with the mechanical voice.As a person who admires but doesn't fully understand science, or the real-life Hawking's contribution to it, I liked that this film attempted to explore his work a little, in lay man's terms. The film brings up God's role in the universe a lot, effectively dramatizing the science- Hawking is into the big questions. But The Theory of Everything is mostly a personal story, his trying to cope with being a brilliant scientist losing all voluntary physical movement and speech. It's frustrating to see him trying to explain his theories, but gratifying when the Soviet scientist announces the little man has done it. It mainly follows his family life and the difficult situation he and his wife Jane are in, and essentially makes Jane out to be a saint.Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, deserves real credit for being able to portray a character from a young, able-bodied (but still shaky) man, to a man struggling to speak, to wheelchair-bound and speechless. His triumph- or Hawking's- is inspirational.",8,2,3,13 December 2014
Ghostbusters," Who you gonna call- besides the priests from The Exorcist or Buffy the vampire slayer?
","In the summer of 1984, two horror-comedy films came out, in direct competition with each other- Gremlins and Ghostbusters. Both became blockbusters. I grew up watching and loving both of them, but Gremlins is my favourite. Nevertheless, with Halloween nearly here, I've been reviewing horror-related movies/TV episodes/whatever, and Ghostbusters became a must-see again.In this movie, three scientists in New York City have found a way to catch and contain pesky ghosts. It's horror-related in that it deals with ghosts, but there's really no horror here. Ghostbusters is first and foremost a comedy. It's not non-stop, laugh out loud humour, but there's some good humour in jokes like book stacking and 'Get her!', as well as Ray's enthusiasm for a building and car of dubious value. The part where they catch Slimer, their first real job, is perhaps the best part of the movie for humour. Eventually they come to the big job, which makes the movie feel big- stopping the end of the world, with a Mesopotamian god called Gozer coming to New York. The Gozer and Zuul material makes for good myth, but it probably would have been more fun if they had found real ancient gods to use in this movie. Gozer was made up for Ghostbusters. They do tie in Gozer's coming with Biblical legends of the end of the world, particularly with the dead rising. Meanwhile, making Gozer a marshmallow man was inventive.This movie made me admire Bill Murray. He brings some colour to the movie, with one character comparing him to a game show host. On this re-watch, however, he didn't come across as totally likable. He's not an honest man, and when his ex-boss calls him a 'poor scientist,' I couldn't help but think that was probably true. Nevertheless, his warning that cats and dogs may one day live together should be taken seriously.Issues with the movie start with the whole concept- isn't it cruel to imprison ghosts forever? Why does the Environmental Protection Agency always have to be the bad guy? Is environmental protection necessarily sinister? The part where Gozer tries to kill the ghostbusters for not being gods was funny- but why didn't they die? On the whole, though, Gozer is a good villain, and Ghostbusters is a fun, memorable movie.Happy Halloween.",8,0,0,30 October 2009
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
","And now the movie that made us debate endlessly: 'Are we supposed to watch it on Christmas or Halloween?' Obviously a brilliant concept from the guy who dreamt up Vincent (1982), The Nightmare Before Christmas' idea of blending a kid's two favourite holidays has attracted and sustained a fierce cult following. The basic idea is that holidays are places, and when Jack Skellington, king of Halloweentown, stumbles into Christmas Town, he feels a need to take it over. See, he's tired of Halloween, what anyone would feel if they were living the same holiday everyday. If he spent time in our universe and discovered we celebrate Christmas three months straight, he'd no doubt grow weary of it, too.In spite of being a Tim Burton fan, Nightmare Before Christmas wasn't regular viewing for me- I watched it once when it came out, and I may have been a bit young for it. Some things, like talk of Santa Claus being chopped up, are kind of freaky for a kid who, you know, still believes in Santa Claus. But as well, watching it now for the first time in years, the movie is lacking in a few areas- namely, the songs. One guy I went to university with complained 'This Is Halloween' was the only great song in the movie, the rest was like nails on a chalkboard to him. Actually I'd say 'Sally's Song' is great, too- a memorable, hauntingly sad tune I've been humming to myself for years. Beyond that, some songs are just forgettable- I just watched it, and I can't even remember what it sounded like when Jack decided to take over Christmas. What does 'Making Christmas' sound like apart from the chorus? Other songs have elements of quality in them but drag on too long ('What's This?'). So yeah, for some kids, and adults, it would be a drag to see this movie. I love villains, but Oogie Boogie was also very underwhelming ('Let's make him a gambler! Why not?'). The mad scientist was a lot more interesting.Still, there's little denying the merit in the creativity, or the strange yet beautiful look of the stop motion animation. No wonder this movie has its fans.Happy Halloween.",7,1,1,25 October 2013
Jurassic World," You gotta Respect the Raptors
","As a fourth film in a franchise (not a good sign) coming 14 years years after the last film (not a good sign), Jurassic World gives us a fully-functioning Jurassic Park open to the public, in which Henry Wu (the only character from the original to return this time) designs a completely new dinosaur in an attempt to respark interest (as if interest would ever be lost in a real-life park like this). Of course, 'Indominus Rex' and some pterosaurs break loose, and it may take the classic dinosaurs of the original to stop them.First, some good points off the bat- I liked seeing Jurassic World open for business. In the first, Jurassic Park is a ghost town, with the staff inexplicably deserting in the middle of their first tour. In the sequels, small parties journey to Site B. Here, we see some imagination in what the park might look like- people explore it by train and hamster ball, and gather around a tank a la Sea World. Bringing back Mr. DNA is a nice touch. The negative points are mainly confined to the first half- our leads are hollow characters, walking stereotypes presented by actors giving less than stellar performances. Bryce Dallas Howard's, in particular, is flat as cardboard- motivated by profit and business, lacking humanity and passion. Vincent D'Onofrio is the two- dimensional bad guy even more concerned with profit, and also obsessively (and bizarrely) interested in sending million-dollar animals (that would never be put at risk by a sane corporation) to war. The two kids are the typical teenager and the boy excited by dinosaurs, but depressed about his parents' looming divorce. 'Indominus Rex' is no better as a character- just a killing machine, not a real animal at all. Incidentally, they tell us right off the bat it's mostly a T-rex, but keep the other species it was blended with a secret. It's only towards the end that they reveal it's part raptor- was that seriously supposed to shock? That was my first guess! A YouTube video put forward a much more interesting theory that it was a blend of more than just two species- including human. The film also reveals Indominus Rex only 30 minutes in, whereas Spielberg kept his carnivores concealed until half-way through. And when Indominus Rex breaks loose, they don't evacuate the island right away. Riiiiight.So are there any good characters? Actually, the most flesh-and- blood, real, relatable characters aren't human at all- they're the velociraptors. The trailers made them appear completely controlled, with Chris Pratt even in the pen with them, and then showing them hunting Indominus Rex. Reminds me of what Hammond says in the novel- 'Domesticated dinosaurs? Nobody wants domesticated dinosaurs!' But it turns out the trailers were a little misleading- Pratt's character is only in the pen for emergency reasons, and narrowly escapes death himself. And the raptors at first recognize Indominus Rex as one of their own. And when Vincent D'Onofrio tells them, in English, that he's on their side, of course they don't understand- they kill him. They only spare Pratt moments later because they imprinted on him. They're a little tamer, but they're still animals and carnivores. So, more so than the trailer suggests, this film respects the raptors- and I respect that. Indeed, the second half battle between the classic dinosaurs and Indominus Rex is a bit thrilling, so despite a weak first half, I did walk a way at the end feeling some satisfaction.",7,4,18,12 June 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Dream-like art
","My embarrassing confession is that lately I've been having trouble following movies. I was worried for a while that maybe I was becoming dumber, like I couldn't understand great films any more. But maybe it was because I stopped following certain movies because they actually weren't that great, and hence they lost my interest. I say that because two movies I've watched lately, Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) and now Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), both of which are complex movies, actually did manage to hold my attention and I loved both of them.So what's good here? Although the movie is categorized at the local video store as a comedy, I was looking for something heavier- a serious drama- and this hit the spot. There's little funny here; at most it's a drama with some comic relief. The writing is smooth and that's no surprise because it's from Charlie Kaufman, the man behind Adaptation (2002), who with that film and this one, is establishing himself as one of Hollywood's best writers. The acting is good. The storyline is interesting- it's about a couple named Joel and Clementine (played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet) growing unhappy with each other, so they go to a special clinic where they can have their memory of each other erased. But during the procedure, Joel soon regrets his decision to erase Clementine and desperately tries to hide her deep in his memories. The way this unfolds is very dream-like, with surreal sequences as things in the memories begin to disappear and blur. This took some imagination and you have to admire it. The movie won an Oscar for writing and probably deserves more recognition. It's a latter day classic.",9,1,3,7 November 2008
The Artist," An obnoxious stunt film
","In a modern age of cinema, directors sometimes opt to go with black and white for artistic reasons, and it often works for those films. I rewatched Schindler's List after seeing The Artist for the first time yesterday, and the 1993 Best Picture winner was totally worthy of the honour. A silent film for the sake of 'artistic' reasons, on the other hand, you pretty much never see, until this. There's a reason we stopped making silent films, after all, as it's generally a lower form of art. A film, at least for me, is usually defined by its dialogue, and an actor by his/her delivery. And it's the way drama is supposed to be. If you went to a Shakespeare play at the Globe Theatre, would you be able to hear the actors, or would you just see them mouth their lines, occasionally with cards held up indicating some of what they said?The Artist explores a cliché concept, a silent actor struggling to adjust to sound, that we've seen done before, and better, with Sunset Blvd. (1950) and Singin' in the Rain (1952). This one is simply distinguished by an obnoxious stunt, being silent (or mostly silent), with the usual problems that come with it. Most of the dialogue is not only inaudible, it's not written on the cards, leaving you to guess what it is, unless you're HAL 9000. And to tell a story not worth retelling. What was the point of this film, aside from anything we hadn't seen before from Sunset Blvd. or Singin' in the Rain? Just to see the cute little doggie? A low point among Best Picture Oscar-winners, to claim this is better than The Descendants or A Separation baffles me.",4,6,12,27 April 2014
A Clockwork Orange," Rated X for excellent
","With A Clockwork Orange (1971), Stanley Kubrick gave us no doubt one of the darkest protagonists of renowned film; this punk teenager Alex engages in acts of brutal violence ('ultra-violence') and rape. It's repugnant and I didn't have a lot of sympathy for him; he's apparently the worst kind of person, completely uncaring about the feelings of others, with little in his background that seems to push him into this. If anything, he's the one who's pushing. He likes Beethoven, indicating he's relatively smart and should know better. A Clockwork Orange is set in the future (when exactly, I don't know- it may be the present day by now). Is this really where the makers of the show thought we were headed? A place where it's just part of growing up for everyone to be raping women as part of everyday teenage rebellion? That can't be allowed, rape is too harmful a crime to society.But then the movie shifts to examining what's to be done with criminals like Alex; after the boy is sent to prison for accidentally killing a woman, he's subjected to a new technique intended to make sex and violence physically distressful for him, and he is then released. One can definitely sympathize with the goal to cut down crime, but as it is pointed out in this movie, this doesn't make him good in his soul. And the movie makes an argument that this kind of psychological control is a bad idea. Prison, it seems, is a better though not perfect solution. The movie talks a bit about rehabilitation. Is the film's message that it's futile? That we need criminals and shouldn't change them? I don't think so, I believe in most cases rehabilitation works; but I agree with this movie that that might be better achieved through prison than psychological control and torment. This is the kind of movie that makes you think, that you can have arguments over, and that's what makes it a classic.I can definitely see why this was rated X- it's fairly extreme in violence and sexuality. Even one of the victims has a room full of erotic art. The language of the movie is also interesting- with new words, you have decode it but it is understandable, reminding me of Shakespeare. All things considered, it's fairly horror show.",10,5,8,19 December 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's last hurrah
","Just as he did in A Clockwork Orange (1971), Kubrick enjoys putting a lot of female nudity in this movie and still keeps it above the level of porn. There's some unnecessary nudity in Eyes Wide Shut- a female patient passed out naked, a topless woman being examined by her doctor. Yet the film is beautifully shot, almost as hypnotic and surreal as Kubrick's The Shining, and the story is a tasteful, believable look at exotic sexual indiscretions.The movie is basically about a doctor (Tom Cruise) who, behind his wife's back, seeks out a prostitute and later sneaks into an orgy. However, the mysterious masked participants know he doesn't belong there and the doctor may be in danger.The main problem with this movie is the casting of Tom Cruise. I just did not buy him as a doctor, particularly with his dumb 'look at me, I'm so cute' smile. Nicole Kidman is his wife, both in real life and in the movie. She does better than Cruise and she's nice to look at (As a kid, I had a crush on her after Batman Forever), but she actually isn't in the movie that much. The movie explains some things to us, or so it seems (who the lady who came to the doctor's aid was, and why she died), but keeps other things mysterious, particularly the meaning of the orgy and the identity of its participants. It's not the most intriguing thing I've seen but it's not without worth. A fine movie to end a distinguished career with.",8,0,0,28 July 2010
Dark Shadows," One vampire I wouldn't mind driving a stake through
","I'm a fan of Tim Burton, at least his older work, and Dark Shadows, as a dark comedy, may seem right up his alley. Much of the look of the film is technically sound, and the actors, particularly Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Chloe Moretz, do what they can with the material. Alas, that material is weak, and Dark Shadows becomes a drag to sit through. The story follows Barnabas, a man cursed by a witch to become a vampire, and is then locked in a coffin and buried by the village people for 200 years. He is released in 1972 (Deliverance is playing at the theatre), bent on reuniting with his living family, restoring the family business and triumphing over the witch, who has gone on to found a rival company.Except for one crack about equality of the sexes and the bit about stoning the vampire, all of the jokes fall flat. There's many of the same old tired jokes we've seen before in stories about someone from another era or world falling into our own- looking for a sorceress songstress in a TV, Depp saying inexplicable things and Pfeiffer's character covering it up as best as she can. Stale jokes about immortal breasts not ageing fail to impress. As well, none of these characters are endearing at all. Reciting The Joker doesn't make Depp's character lovable enough to pardon him for mass murdering innocent workmen and hippies. Let the Right One In (2008) had a killer vampire you couldn't help but hope would survive and get away. I wouldn't mind driving a stake through Barnabas myself; at least the movie would end quicker. It's under two hours, but feels longer. This certainly isn't Burton's best work; at least it's better than Mars Attacks!",6,0,0,3 July 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," Dark. Disturbing. Emotional. Compelling
","What makes The Silence of the Lambs, which won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1991, a classic? It's not the story, involving a serial killer kidnapping a senator's daughter. There's nothing wrong with this story, but it's rather the characters that make this movie so memorable and powerful. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter, one of the greatest villains in movie history (if not the greatest), a perceptive psychiatrist turned cannibalistic killer turned prisoner. Jodie Foster plays Clarice, an FBI trainee who gets to know Hannibal, hoping he can help her with a current serial killer case. Hopkin's performance is mesmerizing. He's intelligent but a monster. He's frightening because, as Crawford tells Clarice, 'you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.' But Clarice lets him inside her head, and breaks a number of other rules regarding how to talk to Hannibal. As Hannibal asks Clarice for details on her personal life, their meetings become a sort of twisted therapy, developing Clarice as a character and allowing Foster to deliver an impressive performance of her own when telling her lamb story.The Silence of the Lambs is compelling, and frightening. The moth is creepy. Lecter's escape scene is, for me, the scariest thing in the film; his face is calm as he's killing the guards. The movie ends with Hannibal free again, a cliffhanger ending that (unfortunately) resulted in a disappointing sequel ten years later. The Silence of the Lambs is one of my all-time favourite films.",10,1,1,28 February 2009
Godzilla," Godzilla, featuring a cameo by Godzilla
","The US just hasn't had much luck adapting the Godzilla legend; the latest attempt is better than Godzilla '98 and possibly King of the Monsters, but that's not saying much. Godzilla (2014) pits the title monster against two other giant creatures, Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms, which feed off radiation and pose a threat to humans once unleashed. The story is told from the perspective of an American family, a guy who lost his wife to a mysterious explosion and his son, in the Navy, who just wants to be with his own family.The movie is somewhat misnamed, as, indeed, Godzilla is barely in it at all. I've heard the director was influenced by Spielberg's Jaws (1975), in which the shark was kept hidden for much of the movie. Except, while we didn't see the shark, the film was certainly about the shark- we very much feel the shark's presence and see what it does to the community. This movie seems to take a while to get to the point, focusing on this family whose characters weren't particularly deep, with nothing particularly endearing. By the time the monsters do show up, it's mainly the MUTOs we see and hear about. And even then, we see far more of the human characters, mainly military characters and scientists outside the core characters we were following earlier, debating how to kill them. The whole point, the billed battle between Godzilla and the monsters, is confined to the climax and feels very brief. Roger Ebert had a favourite story that comes to mind, about a reporter covering a flood who wrote 'God stood on a mountain top here today, and surveyed the damage that His floodwaters had wrought.' The editor replied, 'Forget flood. Interview God.' Forget all this, interview Godzilla.",5,0,1,28 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Spectacular movie
","I remember when this movie was re-released in theatres about 10 years ago I went to see it with my family and was disappointed. I definitely preferred the sequel The Empire Strikes Back. Star Wars (by which I mean Episode IV) seemed to lack energy in comparison. Recently I rented it, however, and my opinion of it has changed. This is a candidate for being the best movie in the series. I watched it three times. Although you wouldn't think you'd need to mature to appreciate an action movie, this is a smart movie and the action actually is good. It would probably be thrilling had I not known that the Death Star would be destroyed- just as it was about to destroy another planet! There are times, admittedly, where you can tell this is from the same guy (George Lucas) who wrote the appalling dialogue from Episodes I and II. Episode III was better because Lucas sought help. But Episode IV is mostly fine because Lucas keeps it simple and to the point. The biggest redundancy is a later addition; the new scene with Jabba the Hutt is awful. It adds no information to what we got with the scene with Greedo. But as this is an added scene, I won't hold that against the original movie.",10,0,0,29 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Matches the original, though good for different reasons
","The Empire Strikes Back is the first sequel to Star Wars (1977), a thrilling and lively action/adventure movie, but Empire is actually a different kind of movie. It's darker, more thoughtful and slower. There's less action.At the end of the first one, which is confusingly called Episode IV, Luke had joined the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire and had destroyed its most powerful weapon, the Death Star. With Empire (aka Episode V), the imperial forces pursue the rebels through space, and Luke travels to a swampy world to learn from a Jedi master named Yoda. He receives visions from the future that his friends will get into trouble, and leaves his training, against the advice of Yoda and the ghost of Obi Wan, to rescue them. Luke confronts Darth Vader, who informs him that he is Luke's father.For a movie about a war, this is pretty low on violence, with little action happening between the fight on the ice world and the climax where Luke faces Vader. That's because The Empire Strikes Back tries to be a different kind of movie. It is not so much light entertainment. It instead features thoughts on the Force, in scenes where Yoda instructs Luke, which basically means a discussion of the nature of good and evil. Evil is strong and tempting, and anger leads to it; but goodness is stronger. The Empire Strikes Back is thus a heavier work, though it's not exactly high art. Still, one should not get the wrong impression from the AFI lists counting Episode IV but not Episode V as one of the 100 greatest American movies. Episode V is as good (or better!)- much of it, including Yoda who is not in Episode IV, is iconic. By the way, Yoda is, from a special effects point of view, passable puppetry.What else can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's got a score that has become legendary in its own right. The plot twist of Vader being Luke's father is also famous and weighty. Altogether, an effective portrait of the struggle between good and evil.",10,0,0,21 October 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," The audience loves Jamal, I did not
","Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was a show that took the US and Canada by storm in 2002. It was sensational, suspenseful, dramatic, immense (a million dollars!) and made for one heck of an event. But as Regis Philbin admitted, the network needed to make it a regular show rather than a rare event. The novelty wore off.A few years later, here's a film, Best Picture-winner at that, trying to recreate that feeling. Jamal is a character on the Indian version of the show. But when the question is posed at the beginning- how is Jamal winning so much money- my sentiment was still, 'Who cares?' As the film then goes through Jamal's life story and how it provides him with the information that comes in handy in the game show, I still never built an attachment to his story. There is a story here, not necessarily a bad one, but who is our hero? A rather flat character to whom things happen- he doesn't come across as much of a person, a send-in for ourselves. The same can be said of his love interest, Latika. Even as a story about poverty in a foreign culture and the descent into criminal life, there's not much here than can hold a candle to, say, City of God (2002). How Slumdog Millionaire wraps it up- destiny in finding a lost love, destiny in picking a random answer and getting it right- appears to have inspired much of its audience, but I didn't find it believable and was unmoved.",6,3,4,16 December 2014
Macbeth," A bloody yet bloodless Macbeth
","This version of Macbeth has plenty of violent scenes, yet the performances themselves lack blood- by which I mean, passion and feeling. This is a version of Macbeth so lacking on enthusiasm or effort that it's puzzling as to why it was made and why the filmmakers thought it was necessary. The lack of imagination is first apparent on our first look at the witches, who are just... women. Their appearance is meant to be otherworldly (indeed, in the play they have beards, though I've yet to see a production of Macbeth that keeps that detail), but in this film they're anything but. And they mutter lines, hailing Macbeth, that should be said with a little fire. That's just a taste of what Michael Fassbender gives us as Macbeth. He's learned his lines, but apparently saw no need to act them out, speaking monotonously and saying things that don't match what we see. He refers to his hair unseated and his heart pounding- they're not. He tells Duncan he will be joyful while frowning. When debating whether to kill Duncan, he shows not a trace of fear or conflict. After Duncan's death, he says he wishes for death, but no one would believe him. Upon seeing Banquo's ghost, he says he is white with fear- he's not. Later, he calls a servant cream-faced- but he's not.Marion Cotillard does much better as Lady Macbeth. When we first see her reading the letter, her voice, unlike Fassbender's, actually varies accordingly to what she is reading. But there's not enough of her in the film, and the other characters lack any interesting traits. Our spirits who mislead Macbeth are supposed to be a severed head and a bloody fetus, but here they're just ordinary people. And plenty of the action lacks imagination as well- showing Duncan's murder, and having Duncan wake up just before, is ripped off from Roman Polanski's 1971 film. See Polanski's version instead- because a monotone Macbeth equals a botched Bard.",4,2,3,16 March 2016
Jurassic Park," An extraordinary movie experience
","I was 9 when this movie came out, and it became a big part of my childhood. I watched it many times. To me then, it was the perfect movie. Hence, it's hard to look at it nowadays and rate it objectively. I'm familiar with it and still love it, but it's not the kind of film I most love these days. How do you express that this movie is still extraordinary and entertaining while also admitting it's not very deep concerning story and characters? (Although I liked the characters). Should I admit that the ending, with the rex sneaking into the building somehow and eating the raptors, is imperfect? How'd it get in? Does it matter? Was seeing the rex one last time worth it, as Spielberg thought? Spielberg was, at any rate, at fine form here, with such great detail packed into the film. This was King Kong for its generation- the recreation of ancient dinosaurs, only this time more convincing than ever. The special effects are great, better than Jurassic Park III's and only outdone by the first sequel The Lost World.I think, with such great dinosaurs, one shouldn't overlook the fact that the humans are good too. Sam Neill and Bob Peck play their parts well, Laura Dern shows range from charming enthusiasm to fear to disgust to professionalism, Richard Attenborough's enthusiastic and proud. What of Wayne Knight? I believe Ebert said something about his part not really fitting, but I don't see it that way- again, having grown up with this movie, it became a standard for other movies, and I see little wrong with it. The music in this movie is also excellent. Still a great film, even if not the greatest film.",9,4,5,8 February 2008
The Simpsons Movie," It's just okay
","The Simpsons just aren't what they used to be. The Simpsons Movie is a strong effort for the franchise as of late, in that it was often funny, but it's still missing the depth of the classic seasons. That, and Mr. Burns, who should have been the main villain but was reduced to a cameo- one of the greatest villains of animation brushed to the side when he had his greatest chance to shine.Some jokes- Homer stuck between a rock and a hard place for example, seem Simpsonish. But the movie as a whole didn't have much of a point, unless you've been faced with the dilemma of living inside a giant dome and you've got to destroy it, and what about the environmental problem posed earlier in the movie? No solid conclusions, solutions or coherent plot needed, just laugh, please.And, for the record, Spider-Pig was not that bad.",7,3,4,17 August 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Modern man making myth
","Michael Crichton wrote in his 1987 novel Sphere that whereas Greek mythology was 'common knowledge' in ancient times, today there are educated people who do not know it. Is it that we have abandoned myth altogether? Maybe not- he goes on to write 'Perhaps these are our new myths. Dorothy and Toto and the Wicked Witch...' The Wizard of Oz, the classic 1939 movie, attempts to bring a modern-day, American-made mythology to life. And there's no doubt it succeeded. The film has reached legendary status, to the point where others have referenced it- Oz references appear in various places in my DVD collection, from Arrested Development to Futurama, and from The Simpsons to Gremlins 2.What gives the movie its power? There is some emotion in the movie, thanks in part to Judy Garland who played Dorothy. I felt sad for her when her dog Toto was taken away to be put down. The dog escaped and went back to her, and she ran away to keep the dog safe. Then a tornado hits- and she's lost in a fantastic land. First off, I'll note Oz has great colour- better colour than some movies made decades later. The things we see there are a triumph of imagination: talking trees, a horse of a different colour, flying monkeys. Some of it is twisted- the munchkins celebrate the death of a witch, complete with a munchkin coroner. That's a little morbid, and later the wizard sends Dorothy and her friends to kill the other evil witch. If this is a little dark, well, so was Greek myth.The underlying message of the movie is that 'There's no place like home'- don't leave home. Of course, we often do have to leave home when we grow up. And what about Toto? When they go back to Kansas, the dog still might be put down, right? This is a point that may have been too bleak to say outright in the movie- the dog probably will be put down, but that's not a reason to run away. So the 'don't leave home' message is aimed primarily at kids, it seems. Maybe there's stuff of interest to adults too- maybe the scarecrow and the tin man represent the common people, farmers and woodsmen, subject to powerful people who can be either good or wicked (the witches- the Wicked Witch's Kansas counterpart is said to be a major land or business owner). Either way, the movie is a landmark in the history of fantasy fiction.",8,3,4,12 January 2010
