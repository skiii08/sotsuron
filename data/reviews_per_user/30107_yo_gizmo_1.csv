Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," That Star Wars Feeling
","This is one of the few movies I want to watch over and over again. It can't tip Episode IV, though, but still no reason to dislike the film. It's great because of the musical score and the graphics. No other Star Wars movie can tip the graphics of Episode I, not even the Special Editions of IV, V & VI. The characters are great, the story is great and the lasers sword fights are.. well... simply fantastic. What I also like is the sound. Apart from the score from John Williams, the sounds are great, especially the lightsabre and ship sounds. TOP! OK, you might think that I am in some sort of trance now, but I'm not. If you haven't seen it I would strongly recommend it, but be sure to have seen Episode IV, V and VI before, or else you won't know what they are all talking about! I gave this movie a 10. Ecxellent, I can't wait for Episode II: Attack of the Clones to arrive.",9,7,10,26 January 2002
