The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing but not a total loss.
","Hi All!I finally got to see BWP & I have to say I was disappointed.  My biggest problems with it included: 1) The actors, whom I felt just weren't that good ('Mike' was OK, 'Heather' was variable, & 'Josh' was annoying); 2) The characters, who tended to act in such a way as to best advance the plot--sitting & sulking when they should be getting the heck out of there, and getting helplessly lost in the middle of the crowded eastern seaboard. I mean, even a tenderfoot like me knows to follow a creek downstream to find civilization.  And why didn't they bring a cell phone--a necessity for camping out in the 90's?; 3) The technical qualities in some instances--the sounds the characters heard, for example, were muddy & indistinct, at least in the theatre in which I saw the film.  All these things detracted from the ability of this viewer to suspend disbelief, something very important for a horror film.On the other hand, I did like the jumpy camera work & the fact that the characters weren't very sympathetic people since those things *helped* the reality of the film.  And the townsfolk who appeared at the start of the film were pretty good, especially the little girl who helped add to the anticipation of scariness.  What she did looked so unscripted that it seemed really creepy.  In sum, I think BWP is similar to the Exorcist--a not that scary movie which drives people crazy due to their expectations of being scared.  Maybe the sequel will be better.p.s. In fairness, I should note that I saw the movie in a theatre with a bunch of chatty, restless people & that didn't help my enjoyment of the film.  But I don't think my opinion would have been much different had I seen it under better circumstances.  I would say that this may make better viewing on video than in the movies.",6,0,1,5 August 1999
The Longest Day," Great Movie But Dated
","Everyone else seems to think that this is the best war movie ever made (or close to it), including several friends whose opinion I value.  However, although I agree that it is one of the best war films of its time, I feel that it has not aged well and is now dated & not as interesting as more recent efforts.My biggest problem is the depiction of the Germans vs. the Allied characters.  The Allies tend to be shown in a silly or comical way--snapping their little plastic noise makers, cracking jokes, & engaging in other low comedy (i.e. Sean Connery).  Meanwhile, the Germans are all depicted as deadly serious, realistic characters.  One gets the feeling that the tension in the film comes from whether these bumbling comedians can overcome the serious, goal-driven Germans.  While the film is faithful to Ryan's book, the choices of what to show and how to show it are not well made.  This may not have been that big a problem in 1962, but in 1999 it is a significant one.A further problem is with the idea of the 'all-star' cast.  The stars tend to overcome the characters they're supposed to be playing.  Again, other than the German characters who are given more depth, there is a tendency to toss big names at the audience and the significance of the character they're playing is minimized.I'm not saying this is a bad movie (no movie with Robert Ryan in it can be said to be truly bad).  What I am saying is that it has lost some of its sheen over the years.  I have to admit to preferring 'A Bridge Too Far' when it comes to 'all-star war movies'.  For all the flaws in that film, it puts its actors firmly into character and doesn't fall for simplistic sentimentality.  And the low humor is kept to a minimum.",Null,0,2,9 August 1999
Gladiator," Good Film but Very Derivative of Braveheart
","Think a minute & tell me what film I'm describing: It's an historical drama which is only loosely based on history.  Its hero is a strong-willed man who only wants to live his own life but whose wife is killed by an evil ruler & who vows revenge.  In later portions of the film, he dreams of being together with his wife in an idyllic setting.  He has a loyal Irish sidekick & the film features airy music & large & violent battle scenes.  The hero of the film is fighting for freedom and against tyranny & in the end, although he dies, he succeeds in bringing freedom to his people.  Sound like any movie you know?  Maybe...Braveheart?  Well, all those features also apply to the new film Gladiator, a shallow but entertaining Braveheart rip-off set in the Roman Empire c. 180 A.D.	Maximus is a popular general of the Roman legions for whom the Emperor Marcus Aurelius has just bypassed his son, the incompetent Commodus, as his successor.  Marcus wants Maximus to bring power to the Roman senate & bring freedom to the Roman people who have been living under the yoke of the Emperors.  Unfortunately, when Commodus learns of Marcus' plan, he kills the old man, kills Maximus' family, & tries to kill Maximus himself.  But Maximus escapes & winds up a slave in North Africa where he is trained as a gladiator.	Eventually, the gladiators are brought to perform in Rome where Commodus has ordered a lengthy series of games to improve his popularity.  Various schemes ensue until there is a big showdown in the gladiatorial ring between Commodus & Maximus.	The film at least has the honesty to admit (in a blurb at the end) that, while it contains historical characters, the story it tells is fictional. It is an entertaining movie but it's not as good as it could have been.  The opening battle scene, while suitably noisy & crowded, is not up to any of the battles in Braveheart (the Romans' German opponents look like a bunch of poorly armed old men--the sort of soldiers who, centuries later, would have been guarding the Fuhrerbunker in 1945 & not a formidable opponent for the Roman legions).  The gladiator scenes are mostly good, although like most of the film they lack the feel of authentic history. However, while the action is pretty good, the whole bit about Maximus' desire for revenge & his goal of freeing the senate is uninvolving & the plotting between Commodus' sister Drusilla, the senators, Commodus, & various others seems to be there mostly to fill screen time between gladiator matches.	There are a few good bits in the film.  In particular, the scenes of the gladiators seeing & then entering the Colosseum for the first time are impressive & the battle scenes of the legions have their moments. But the numerous & often weird & gratuitous `borrowings' from Braveheart (both films even have the hero voice an aphorism about death-`Every man dies, not every man really lives'-Braveheart vs. `Death smiles at all men, but some of them smile back'-Gladiator) leave a bad taste in one's mouth & make one wish that the `creative' forces behind Dreamworks had used a little bit more of their *own* creativity on this film & not relied so extensively on the creativity of others.  I'd give it two stars out of four, but add a star if you didn't see Braveheart.",Null,0,0,9 May 2000
