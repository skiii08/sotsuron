Blade Runner 2049," I give up
","I've tried to watch this about a dozen times, but it's so bloody boring I just can't stay awake.",1,3,5,2 May 2020
The Irishman," Yawn!
","One of the worst movies I've ever sat through. It took 3 sittings to get through it, and I only persisted because it kept getting good reviews, so I thought I must be missing something. Only thing I was missing was the 3 hours of my life I can't get back. If you like really long, and boring stories of old men, doing little more than getting older, this one's for you. Is hollywood so starved for actors that they have to resort to making old men look young? Why did they have young actors playing the younger women, and older women playing the older parts, and these sappy old men playing the young and the old? When Joe Pesci calls DeNiro 'Kid' at the start thought it was going to be a comedy, but that was the only funny moment in a very long and very boring movie. Send it back to the cutting room and cut at least another hour off this thing and it might be worth another run. Just using well known actors and directors doesn't turn  into a gem.",1,2,4,31 January 2020
Spotlight," Probably the best movie I've seen in a very long time
","If you haven't watched this one yet, check it out. Great to see a movie with a story for a change. No need for special effects if the story is solid.",9,0,0,2 May 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The woman who'll play Woody Harrelson's next wife hasn't even been born yet
","Great movie, right up to the end, then it was like they couldn't think of an ending. Do the deadbeat cop and the bitter crone just go around the country now, and clean up crime? Such a disappointing end. It ruined an otherwise good movie. Good story, good character development, awful ending. Was Woody Harrelson's character some kind of  predator that married a child he'd groomed many years earlier? Why are his wives getting younger in movies as he gets older? It's like he and Kevin James are having a competition.",2,2,6,31 January 2020
