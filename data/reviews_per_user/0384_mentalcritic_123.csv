The Blair Witch Project," In case I didn't make it clear before...
","...this is a Nazi propaganda film masquerading as independent cinema. A blue-eyed, white skinned girl tells you as clandestinely as she can that all Wiccans are murderers guilty of infanticide, and people hail this piece of trash as an independent miracle. Adolf Hitler was more vague about calling for the murder of all those beside the Anglo-Saxon white Protestant male. Maybe you feel comfortable endorsing a film where the death of all non-Christians is called for, but when a film like this gets a ringing endorsement in a country like America, I feel chills of fear going through my body.This is to say nothing of the fact that I could have made this film in my back yard for a dollar. Maybe people mistake the grinding, painful feeling associated with extreme boredom for suspense, but I am not fooled. Eighty minutes of waiting for some tangent of a plot that can be reported to a publisher does not equal suspense for me. It equals annoyance, boredom, and anger that such an absolute piece of trash can get such major recommendations. Here I am, struggling to make a career in writing, and the bozos who made this pile of garbage are on a gravy train from strapping a camera to the head of a dying seal. The only reason I haven't sued my previous editor for aggravated assault is because he warned me that this film was nothing but Nazi propaganda, and that he wanted me to report on this film so that a semblance of balance could be injected into the media.Honestly, I am not bashing this film because of tall-poppy syndrome or any other such phenonemon. I am bashing it because I value my life, my liberty, and my ability to pursue happiness, and the fact that so many people have something vaguely positive to say about this film makes me fear for all three of those things. Since this film hit the shelves, other pieces of normalist propaganda like Wonderland have hit the shelves, too. Has anyone who praises this film as a masterwork actually gone to a real Wiccan and asked their opinion of this film? I thought we all had it bad when pieces of garbage like The Craft hit the shelves. If you really value the religious freedom granted us by the First Amendment of the US Constitution that little, then by all means, keep praising this film as a miracle of independent cinema.All in all, I am giving this film a score of zero. It is not over my head, it is not something we misunderstand, it is a piece of Nazi propaganda masquerading as an independent production, pure and simple. Those of us who have understood the message in pro-liberterian cinema like the mini-series called V should all express disgust that this load of bollocks even got the green light, leave alone a sequel. Artisan should be hanging their heads in absolute shame. Bible-belt America has a lot to answer for.",1,1,6,30 May 2001
The Blair Witch Project," A celebration of Nazism that has been mislabelled a classic...
","Frankly, if I wanted to see a film in which outright lies were told about Wiccans, I would turn on my television and watch a Pat Robertson speech. Or dig up one of the propaganda movies comissioned by the German government during the mid-1930s. When I went and saw this tripe at the flicks (at the behest of a friend who publishes a magazine), I was simply appalled at the sort of Nazi-esque garbage that Republican America considers acceptable. Indeed, during one of the asinine speeches given by Heather, another member of the audience jumped up and screamed 'sieg heil' in disgust. This comment got more applause and positive reaction than the film ever did. Indeed, by the time this appalling film was over, one patron near me was heard to remark 'you've got to be [expletive deleted] joking!'. This was the most positive comment I have heard about the film from a flesh-and-blood human to date. Indeed, when Heather is bawling her little eyes out for the camera in one of the film's last shots, another patron was heard to yell 'don't tell us your problems, Nazi bitch'. I think that just sums this entire film up.Indeed, this film has inspired me. It has inspired me to commit to making a response of my own. One day I will make a film about a young woman in Europe during the Middle Ages who is kidnapped by Christian thugs and taken off to destinations unknown where she is repeatedly raped and tortured by 'men of the cloth' before being burned alive, solely because she attracts the unwanted attention of a Nazi pig no different than those who made this film. Unlike this film, however, what I will be showing in my film project actually happened in Medieval Europe, Colonial America, and numerous other Christian blights on history - many times over. Indeed, the only reason why the makers of this film haven't been sued for slander is because the Christian menace still controls the political system of America.It's a sad state of affairs when slanderous propaganda like this gets financial backing and then hailed as a classic by pond scum who don't know any better.",1,1,7,16 December 2000
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An exercise in self-indulgence...
","Had Kill Bill been directed by a more talented action director such as Paul Verhoeven or Tobe Hooper, the project would have been restricted to one film that would have had a maximum running time of three hours. Not that either of these directors would have needed this much. There is nothing in the combined volumes of Kill Bill that a director who understands the need for efficiency couldn't tell in 130 or 150 minutes. Any other director would be constantly asked if this or that scene moves the plot forward.Interestingly, volume two is approximately half an hour longer than its predecessor, but half as much happens during this time. Half of what we see in this volume is irrelevant drivel that could have been left on the cutting room floor. Budd's job and Beatrix's training are the least of the problems. In the end, the final moment with Bill seems like a two-hour buildup to a five-second payoff.Between Tarantino's constant homages to himself, we get more of the Tao Of Tarantino in which one of the characters bore us to sleep with Tarantino's philosophical gems, this time about Superman's perception of humanity. One suggestion I have for Tarantino that could make these films more viewable for those of us who have grown beyond trends is to keep these gems separate, and publish them in a book instead. Then he ought to get an accurate picture of how wise or brilliant people really think he is. Apparently, Quentin doesn't mind paying homage to himself by referencing products that he has 'disowned', either. Can we say 'hypocrisy', children?Given that the typical Tarantino formula is basically pornography that replaces sex with violence, Kill Bill part two basically resembles a porn film with no money shot. Tarantino's constant claims to be offering a commentary on violence would hold weight if he showed it in a realistic, believable manner (a la RoboCop or Total Recall) rather than the eliptic, implied manner that typifies Hollywood. For all the statements about how violent films don't make violent children and so forth, I'd love to see Tarantino put his money where his mouth is for once and show the actual consequences of violence.Ah, to be a director who has an audience that will kiss the ground he walks on no matter how boring or indulgent his films are. George Lucas used to have that, so I guess the lesson to take from that fact is to learn to stop abusing this. Then again, given the low common denominator that the films aim for, I suspect that Mr. Tarantino does not hold his audiences in high regard.I gave Kill Bill: Vol. 2 a one out of ten. Devo apparently named themselves in reference to a belief that humanity was 'devolving'. I think that this film could receive a standing ovation proves them right.",1,15,29,17 October 2004
Alien 3," All the special effects in the world cannot hide a poor script...
","...and Alien 3 has just that: a poor script. Gibson's version of the Alien 3 script, parts of which were incorporated into Alien Resurrection, is by far superior to this literary accident. One glaring factual error mars the script before the Alien even gets any screen time: cholera is not a virus, it is a bacterium. A reference to bubonic plague or ebola would have been far more appropriate, given that we're talking about a dead body in that scene.However, the fundamental problem in Alien 3 is the humans. In the previous two installments of the series, you could have almost called the films 'Human' and 'Humans' respectively, because the alien was often incidental to the way the human characters related to one another. The alien seemed to exist only to highlight the dangers of curiosity without caution or cooperation at times. Add to this the fact that both the films feature the best simulations of alien creatures outside of the digital era, and you can soon see where Alien 3 falls down.A special effects company who won't be mentioned here rallied hard for the contract to do the CGI effects for the alien in some shots. Funny that, because when one rallies to be awarded a job, one normally tries to do a good one. The alien in this film was so poorly simulated during CGI shots that it is quite clear which shots are the man in the suit, and which ones aren't. But by far the worst aspect of the film is the manner in which the human characters are conspicuously reduced at one point. It highlights the fact that the characters are not fleshed out enough for anyone to care.Another problem that becomes apparent when watching making-ofs is that the film was rushed into production without even a script to work from. The manner in which cast and crew members defend director David Fincher, highlighting the fact that he had to start shooting without a script, really suggests where the blame should be laid. Of the crew, only Alex Thomson is willing to openly blame the studio, but the fact that he is long since retired makes it clear that Fox particularly has a big problem with the dismal failure of this rush job.I gave Alien 3 a two out of ten. The first thought that came to mind when I saw the third Alien film at the theatre was one of disappointment. The last thought was that at least they couldn't screw the series up any worse. Alien Resurrection didn't prove me wrong as far as entertainment value was concerned. This movie sucks like a Godfrey's showroom.",2,485,521,11 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A retrospective look at what really happened in 1999
","In the middle of 1999, I went with family, and friends of family, to see a film that fans of George Lucas' original series had been waiting for over a period of sixteen years. The level of anticipation that had built up over that time was such that no film could live up to expectations, but the film was enjoyed as a singular experience anyway. The main reason for this is the difference an audience can make. One advantage of a midnight screening at a George Lucas film, at least in this market, is the absence of small children, idiots, and other problems likely to disrupt enjoyment. Nobody goes to this much trouble to see a film unless they want to be hit in the face with every piece of dialogue or every sound. While disappointment can be blamed to some extent upon false expectations built up over a period of years, the film also displays many symptoms of Lucas taking his audience for granted. It is hardly helpful when a director surrounds himself with yes-men that confirm the validity of every decision he makes, regardless of its presence.First and foremost, the problem with The Phantom Menace is the dialogue and acting. Liam Neeson looks able to fake his way through the scenes, but Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman in particular look very uncomfortable in environments that are ninety percent bluescreen, and nobody can blame them. Any actor will tell you that having something to react to is a vital tool in their profession. It has been said that Neeson looks like he is staring far away when he is meant to be talking to Jar-Jar Binks, which is untrue. It has already been well-documented that an actor was on the sets at all times, standing in for the character. No, the real problem is that, shots in Tunisia aside, most of the sets are entirely blue. Looking at some production shots of these sets, you can see for yourself that the actors are meant to be riding on and interacting with things that give them no reaction at all. A nightmare for any actor, for certain.The dialogue is also quite stilted. A memorable piece of trivia about the original series was that both Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford told Lucas at various points that his writing was ordinary, if not in so many words. While the screenplays were of significantly better quality than is the case here, the problem is that Lucas has, in the meantime, surrounded himself with yes-men that dare not question him in the manner that Ford or Guiness displayed. Indeed, as one noted critic said about the next film in this new series, one has to wonder when the last time someone said the word 'no' to Lucas was. Perhaps Liam Neeson or Brian Blessed said this very word to him during production, and he chose to ignore it. When you can command almost a billion dollars in film sales and merchandising, ignoring criticism can tend to be something of a natural skill.If there is one thing that The Phantom Menace gets right, it is in the duel coordination. Here, the main event is a duel between one Sith lord and two Jedi. The event was highly anticipated among fans, and it is the one that doesn't disappoint after the perspective of time is added. Here, everything is perfect, at least once you edit out the space battle (which was still plagued with daft dialogue) and the infantry battle (which was just plain daft). Stuntman Ray Park proves that he was hired to do this film for a reason, while Neeson and McGregor show that they took their instruction with stunt coordinator Nick Gillard very seriously. The camera-work during this duel is also excellent. In contrast to the other two films, and many others of recent years I could name, the positioning of the camera relative to the duelists is very well chosen. Never is there any confusion as to who is making what move, even during the occasional closeup. This is especially amazing when you consider that the duelists generally move faster than many a Kung Fu action film star.It is for that reason, more than anything, that I gave The Phantom Menace a five out of ten. In essence, this is a couple of duels and the introduction of a little boy in search of a coherent plot. Anakin Skywalker as a child was unnecessary and annoying, while the future mother of his children never gets beyond the superficial. After the recent triumph of the third prequel, this hollow first effort becomes a real disappointment. It is worth watching once, but barely more than that.",5,2,3,20 May 2005
The Longest Yard," Underrated
","After reading Roger Ebert's review of this remake, I tend to believe that one's view of a film is skewed somewhat by the end of the cinematic bell curve they lean toward. Ebert, for example, lives to review films like The Godfather or The Empire Strikes Back, and his perspective on films that achieve less than these milestones in history reflects this. Me, I am very much at the opposite end of the scale. I view films like Ghosts Of Mars or From Justin To Kelly and see all kinds of cinematic delights, mostly in guessing how the makers will screw up next. Now, while I was expecting neither extreme from The Longest Yard, I did not expect it to be as enjoyable as it turned out to be. Easily Sandler's best film since Happy Gilmore, The Longest Yard sets out to do one thing, namely to make the viewer laugh, and it does so quite well. Others have commented that it is not the original and we should all get used to that. I agree. I have seen both remakes of The Longest Yard without having seen the original. If the original is better reflected by Mean Machine, then I would even hazard a guess that this particular remake is better.Of course, the biggest hurdle for this film is selling Adam Sandler as a star quarterback. In a sport where two metres in height is often the minimum requirement for a professional career, Sandler does have a hard sell. Instead, he chooses to emphasise the has-been aspect of his character, playing up the drunken antics until one is ready to believe that yes, this obnoxious moron really did make a living throwing a ball from one end of the field to the other. The opening scene is calculated specifically for this purpose, and in the sense that it suspends disbelief, it is a success. The pace slows a bit when we are establishing the prison, where the character finds his notoriety more of a hindrance than a blessing. Missing from this remake is the 'you had everything they would give an arm for and threw it away' that was so memorable in Mean Machine, but this remake makes up for that in more crafty, subtle ways. Also of great benefit is the characterisations, painted in far broader strokes than the British remake. It helps to distinguish the characters a little.Some would say that the Adam Sandler routine gets in the way of the story, but I truly believe he enhances it. Sandler works best when his character has a second or third dimension. Granted, attempts to graft these dimensions onto his character have backfired before (Big Daddy and 50 First Dates spring to mind). But Sandler and the script he is working from are working in sync rather than against one another, and the scenes are integrated together rather than seemingly cobbled from different films. Other unlikely heroes pepper the cast, with Chris Rock in particular standing out as the only cast member who looks less likely to be an American football player than Adam Sandler. Burt Reynolds shows up for no readily apparent reason other than including someone who was in the original, but he too makes the viewer believe in the role. The myriad of small roles portrayed by men so large that crane shots are required to keep their heads in frame with those of the stars are one-note, but oh what a nice note it is.About the only real problem I have with this remake is that I had some expectations which weren't met. The original has a reputation as a social satire, whereas this remake is about as deep as a puddle. Once the first layer is peeled away, there is little going on underneath. It's just that the first layer is so hilarious at times that this hardly matters. Even Courtney Cox is better than her usual self here, providing setup for the introduction that hints she may have a future in real comedy. Chris Rock even manages to get in almost a solid hour of screen time without being annoying. Just as hilariously bad films have to happen by accident, The Longest Yard is the kind of film that seems to have just come together naturally. Adam Sandler fans will find much to enjoy here, although he restrains the more obnoxious side of his schtick for obvious reasons. It is also a credit to him that he does not hog the spotlight, instead sharing it with his co-stars or foils, which in turn allows the characters he is bouncing off the appropriate level of development to be funny.On a scale of one to ten, I gave The Longest Yard circa 2005 an eight. It is nowhere near the same sport as classics like The Godfather, but it was never meant to be. Instead, it simply tries to deliver a good laugh, and succeeds for the most part. It shows that Adam Sandler's pool of comedic inspiration might not be totally dried out just yet. See it with a couple of friends and a keg of beer.",8,0,1,30 April 2006
Marie Antoinette," A step backwards...
","In 2003, an enterprising filmmaker brought the world a human drama set in one of the most heavily-populated yet despairingly lonely places of the modern world. It was a success unexpected, giving its director a level of fame and interest that kept all eyes on her next effort. Of course, it did not hurt that this director just happened to be the daughter of one of Hollywood's most successful and well-regarded directors. So for her next project, Sofia decided to create a biopic of one of history's most controversial and maligned historical figures, Marie Antoinette, Queen of France and Navarre. French history is not a subject of interest to me, and my selection of this film was more a whim based on positive experience with Ms. Coppola's previous effort, Lost In Translation. So when I say that Marie Antionette circa 2006 is a real disappointment, I can only do so with a serious and heavy heart. I wanted to like this film, and there are even times when I do. But for a film that was ostensibly made with the goal of setting the record straight, it is disappointingly shallow.The film begins with the titular character being introduced to her husband-to-be, who just happens to be the Dauphin of France. As the Dauphin's consort, she is expected to produce a child with him with all haste, and much is made of the fact that this will strengthen the French-Austrian alliance. A problem arises when the Dauphin is unwilling or somehow unable to perform the required actions on his part to produce an heir. As Marie begins to receive the proportion of the blame that eighteenth century courts placed upon women that were not producing heirs, her influence with the court begins to weaken. I must admit, the device by which we are shown the two extremes of her popularity in France's court are quite novel. However, a problem arises as we notice increasingly during the running time that very little exists beneath the surface. We know so little about Antoinette during the opening reels, but we know almost nothing else by the time it ends. In effect, we are simply seeing people dance around in period costumes.Speaking of dancing around, numerous sequences are shown in which the cast and extras hunt, dance, or eat to the tune of post-punk songs that anyone who grew up during the 1980s will recognise at least a few of. Some of them are exceptionally well-chosen in light of the visuals that they accompany. Others, not so. Watching Marie descending stairs as The Cure's Plainsong plays in the background is a feast for the eyes and ears. The use of All Cats Are Grey over the ending credits, on the other hand, just seemed like a decision based on the need for a sound to fill the void. Not that it is a bad song, but considering the tone of the closing scene, there are a thousand songs from this era that would have done far more to build the appropriate mood. Antoinette's story is a sombre one, and an ostensibly painful transition in France's history. So It is unfortunate, but the music really does reduce the whole affair to the feeling of a music video. Sort of the opposite to what happened with Lost In Translation, in other words.The performances are also somewhat mixed. Kirsten Dunst is way out of her element as Marie Antoinette. She has portrayed individuals from the eighteenth century on previous occasions, and she has also demonstrated a talent uncommon among actors of her generation. So her performance in this mess probably is not her fault. I am also loathe to blame it upon Sofia's direction, as her prior two films were enthralling even if they took a couple of viewings to get into. However, Sofia's writing appears to have more of the fault than anything else. Some stories rely on sex scenes to keep the viewer interested. Some stories rely on violence to keep the viewer interested. Some stories rely on extremely peculiar characters to keep the viewer interested. I am still in a state of wonder as to exactly what the story is reliant upon, in fact. It seems to have no buildup or payoff. Perhaps Ms. Coppola wanted to write the ultimate 1980s music video, but that already exists in the form of a film called Repo Man.Another problem Marie Antoinette suffers from is that it drives in the stricter, lower limits of the Australian PG rating (honestly, the American system must be run by 100 year old men), and this severely impacts the story. One of the women seen farewelling Marie as she leaves in exile ended up with her head being paraded around for Marie's benefit, a fact that could have done much to put the story in its proper historical context. Much of the film is so perversely tame and restrained that one starts to wonder if anything is going to happen. It is just another example of how overly restrictive America's rating system really is. This is where the whole problem of the film derives. Ask any writer, director, or producer what the one unforgivable sin of telling a story is, especially where film-making is concerned, and they will always tell you the same thing. You can make a good film, you can make a bad film, you can even make an indifferent film. But heaven and the entire chorus of archangels will not help you if you make a boring film.Thus, I gave Marie Antoinette circa 2006 a four out of ten. Some of the music works, but that is about it.",4,2,3,9 May 2007
The Ring," Why can't Hollywood make more films like this?
","Taken at mere face value, The Ring, has much going for it, in spite of some small minuses. It's no secret, of course, that it is a remake of a Japanese film based upon a Japanese novel, which is in turn based upon an obscure text about people dying after reading a book. So while it isn't quite as original as it appears, it deserves major kudos for not going down the same road as almost every other Hollywood cookie cutter horror film of the past fifteen years.I'll deal with the negatives before I go into the positives. They won't take long. First of all, there's people who compare this film to The Sixth Sense simply because it has a somewhat spooky child as one of the main characters. The Sixth Sense was a copy, and not a very good one at that, of the Richard Matheson novel A Stir Of Echoes, out of which a far superior film of almost the same name was made. The reason Stir Of Echoes was far superior to The Sixth Sense, ability to acknowledge its source material aside, was that the child character was actually likeable. In The Ring, the child character is tedious and unsympathetic, a major problem that occurs in nearly every Hollywood film where children take part.Second, as has been mentioned before, the equine deaths mentioned in this version are unnecessary and pointless. They add nothing to the character we're supposed to be afraid of. The screen time used to detail this element could have been put to better use in linking the episodic days together with more strength.The strengths of this film can also be mistaken for weaknesses. For one thing, it is good that we know next to nothing about the little girl whose voice we hear after the video is watched. All we need to know about her is that she has had a harsh, tragic life, one that she is none too happy about. The tagline that you see a ring before you die is pretty literal, but it's learning why one sees a ring that makes this part of the film interesting. In essence, the film knows what to tell the viewer and when, which is essential in making any horror film work. This is one of the few Hollywood films that gives our imagination something to do.Another high point of the film is the special effects, or the restrained usage thereof. So many horror films rely on numerous effects to paint this or that character to be the most horrific thing you'll ever see on celluloid. The problem is that the viewer winds up drowned in so many effects that they become numb to what they're supposed to be horrified by. In The Ring, videotape viewings aside, the special effects are sparse and, at least by appearance, mostly practical. The points when it stops looking 'real' are those when it suits the story not to do so. Which only helps the situation. I'd rather have five minutes of 'bad' special effects in a two hour film than two hours of being drowned in 'good' ones that only seem to remind me that they are effects.If original ideas, or at least ones that don't resemble every other that is coming out at the time, were more frequent in Hollywood, it would be safe to say that The Ring would not be getting as much praise as it is. However, since there's no jingoism, propaganda, or feel-good crap to be found here, The Ring is indeed a rare product from Hollywood. The absence of any obvious pandering to focus groups alone makes The Ring worthwhile. In all, I give it an eight out of ten.",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A classic adventure
","Maybe it's just me, but I always rooted for the bad guys in this classic adventure tale. Actually, I rooted for all the characters equally, but this is one of the few films where the bad guys are just as developed and three dimensional as the good guys. Even the sequences that didn't turn out exactly as intended (the death of the swordsman being the best example) are stellar moments in filmmaking.Giving such a simple explanation of Adolf Hitler's fascination with religious relics was a bit of a cop-out (the man was actually raised in a Catholic family), but that was okay. This is a simple story and bogging it down in details would have been a mistake. This is why so many weapons, vehicles, and military divisions are shown in the film when they didn't exist for years after the film's date. All of these details are bent in order to serve the story, which is quite a compelling one at that. How could one not be fascinated by a race between good guys and bad guys to recover a relic that could save or destroy the world?Then there's the score music. John Williams is generally about as subtle as a train wreck, but this works so well in favour of the film because the story has even less subtlety. I doubt that anyone who's seen this film can think of adventure films without thinking about that strangely appealing rhythm. Sure, it gets on your nerves after about a hundred or so repetitions, but varying it in accordance with the onscreen action is what makes John Williams' scoring style so compelling. There's very few composers in the world today who can match him in complementing the film.Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones like he was born for the role. Hearing that the sword-swinging sequence was filmed the way it was because Harrison was suffering diahorrea on the shooting day was quite a revelation. I defy anyone to have picked that from watching the film without having been told so. His sense of humour about the whole production comes across in favour of the end result, too. When asked about safety concerns on the stunt sequences, he simply told the press that he wasn't concerned because they would have filmed more of the film first if he was in any danger. What a trooper.Raiders Of The Lost Ark is worth of ten points, no question. It is one of the most enjoyable film's I've ever sat through. Just try and get the Indiana Jones theme out of your head after the film's over!",Null,1,1,21 May 2001
Fight Club," This film should be compulsory for all psychology students...
","It is not often that a film captures Christian America's need to define itself through arbitrary means so well, but Fight Club succeeds admirably. As anyone with a basic understanding of human psychology knows, there are a few basic drives that all humans feel a biological and psychological need to satisfy: food, sleep, and sex. None of these drives can be denied, and Army experiments to see the results of depriving the first two turned up some interesting results. Soldiers placed on low sustenance diets became obsessed with food to the point where they began hanging pictures of food items in their lockers. Soldiers deprived of sleep became obsessed with resting to the point where some attempts to deny them rest resulted in violence.Similarly, it is no coincidence that America is both the most sexually repressed and most overweight nation in the First World. Many young adults in America who are denied an outlet for their sex drive due to religious or societal considerations try to satiate this drive by the arbitrary method of stuffing oneself (no pun intended) with junk food. Fight Club simply took these three observations about how screwed up our society really is and translated them into real-world terms.This, in a nutshell, is the basis of Fight Club. A man who has become the definition of modern homo sapien's need to define itself by arbitrary means meets a man who has found a way to shed those things and bring his life back to a point where it satisfies only the three basic drives of all sentient animals. I experienced this in some form last year during a holiday. I could live without my DVD player and all my toys that I don't really need. What I can't live without is a sense that I am a free man with direct control over the direction of my life.It's amazing that this film works so well, because it is only a series of interactions between three principal characters: Jack, Tyler, and Marla. Everyone else is pretty much inconsequential to the plot, even Bob or Angel Face, in spite of how well they are played. The novel might as well have only had those three characters, in fact, so it is a real credit to the director and screenwriter that the latter two characters make any impression at all. Edward Norton is mesmerising as Jack, playing a role that would tie a lesser actor up in knots, all without skipping so much as a beat. Brad Pitt is excellent, and it looks as if Tyler Durden is a role designed to make us feel that we've finally found something he does well.The real surprise here, however, is Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. This is a character that could have easily dissolved into an insult to all those in our arbitrary society for whom television and digital audio are simply not enough. Instead, Helena brings a depth and sympathy to the character that is completely absent from the story in its written form. Angelina Jolie be damned, Helena was really the most deserving recipient of a best supporting actress award here.If I had to pick any flaws with the film, it's that the story is a major contradiction of real cases of Dissociative Identity Disorder. It is rare for sufferers of DID to have only one alternate who is so similar to them, and don't blast me about that because I know real sufferers of the disorder. Compared to some real alternates I've seen and heard, Tyler and Jack might as well be twin brothers. Another contradiction is that those with DID cannot simply switch into an alternate personality and do what they wouldn't normally do as themselves. Hence, if Jack has moral objections to stealing fat from a liposuction clinic, so too will Tyler.However, these minor plot problems, which are necessary to plot movement anyway, are carried over from the book and are quickly overshadowed by the virtues of the film. All in all, I believe Fight Club is worthy of ten out of ten. One of the best films it has been my pleasure to review on DVD (and I pity anyone who tries to watch it on VHS). A definite ten out of ten film.",10,1,2,5 November 2000
Memento," Utter garbage gets into the top 250 yet again... are IMDB users brain-dead or just retarded?
","The 56th best movie of all time? What on earth have you people been sucking on?I have diabetes. I wanted to rip Mr. Nolan's lungs out when this movie was over, since I have been fighting a battle to stop people within my own damned family from treating me like I'm some kind of invalid for the past few years. Considering that diabetes afflicts one in every hundred people in the world (this translates into about 300 or so million people), and of that percentage, another one in every hundred is insulin dependent, the fact that this film got made is another testament to how low an opinion mainstream directors and writers have of our intelligence.The first thing I did when I left the theatre, other than recover from the urge to punch people who were talking about this film as if it was made with one shred of intelligence, was apologise to members of my family for talking them into seeing this piece of dung. As a mental patient, films come out all the time that mis-represent me and thousands of others like me. I'm used to that. But next time you hear someone say this film is a masterpiece, consider the fact that if I didn't have diabetes, I could very easily win boxing matches with the likes of Liam Neeson or David Prowse in spite of the fact that they are half to one foot taller than me. This sort of lapse in fact-checking should not be allowed to happen in any mainstream film, regardless of the budget. I want an apology from the Nolans for their writing efforts, and I want it now.",Null,3,13,13 April 2001
Underworld," A load of...
","The horror and action genres have become so overloaded with clichés that to some extent, they now must resort to great lengths in order to seem mildly unique, leave alone inventive. Underworld attempts to become unique by pitting two overused creatures of myth and legend against one another. Unfortunately, the writer/director is a first-timer, as are both of the writers where feature films are concerned. Sometimes, one can disguise the fact with flashes of brilliance or inventiveness. Nobody would suspect that RoboCop was Edward Neumeier's first sold screenplay, for example. Unfortunately, Underworld wastes no time in showing that Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride have about as much writing talent between them as Edward Neumeier's nose hairs displayed in RoboCop. Indeed, a comparison is fair between RoboCop and Underworld because both try to reinvent a stale genre. Underworld fails where RoboCop succeeded because it has no idea when to break the rules, or how. The fact that it dates itself without stopping for breath does not help.Underworld concerns itself with the seemingly endless battle between the aristocratic vampires and the savage, ornery werewolves. In another attempt to distinguish itself, the word Lycan is used in place of werewolf, despite the fact that Lycanthrophy is generally used to refer to morphing into a number of animals these days. And that highlights one of the most major problems with the film. The makers have a poor attitude, having the nerve to claim that audiences were indifferent to the film because they did not 'get' things like the use of the word Lycan. This attitude has apparently not changed in the sequel, where the screenplay progressively reverts to werewolf. The problem here is that this telegraphs both the kind of audience the makers were aiming for, in addition to their contempt for the audience. From the editing to the hideous photography, Underworld announces itself as an R film trying to pander to a PG-13 audience. As a result, it winds up in no man's land, trying to appeal to everyone and pleasing no one.Failing to help matters is that the characters have all the extra dimensions of puddles, and the actors are unable to combat the effect. Bill Nighy looks especially uncomfortable trying to deliver his atrocious dialogue, which is heavily burdened with trying to set up the rules instead of putting them into effect. Which only serves to highlight the film's most fatal flaw. In its attempt to make something the audience have never seen without the expertise to make it make sense, Underworld gets bogged down in exposition to such an extent that the middle section could be used to prove Einstein's theory of relativity. In Einstein's most simple explanation of the theory, when one spends an hour with a beautiful woman like Kate Beckinsale, it seems like a mere second, but when one spends a second with their hand on a hot stove, it seems like an hour. The second act of Underworld, in which Selene attempts to secure Michael against those seeking to use him to their ends and expose the truth about Viktor, is like having a wart burned out with liquid nitrogen. The middle of Underworld literally makes one feel as if time is slowing down in order to amplify one's discomfort.Apparently, the makers of the film felt the boredom was insufficient, because they have delivered an extended cut that replaces eleven minutes of existing footage while adding another twelve. While I cannot comment on the extended cut of the film, I can say that it would take a lot more than replacing eleven minutes to address the film's most stunning problem. In contrast to the recent sequel, in which Selene and Michael managed to show enough character to make viewers care about their plight, the entire cast here might as well be dolls with human mouths blue-screened over theirs. One knows even less about them when the film is over compared to when it began. Viktor suffers the worst from this terrible storytelling, with his character having no other purpose to betray his own kind and be an insufferable so-and-so. Matter of fact, the only characters who do not warrant a good punch in the face throughout their screen time are Selene and Michael, which is just as well when you consider that they are the characters upon which the entire film hangs. Even George Lucas was able to give characters like Anakin Skywalker a second dimension during his prequel trilogy, if only barely.As I said in my comments about Underworld: Evolution, the sequel is a bit of an improvement. But when you have a lead-in like this, even the third Matrix episode constitutes an improvement. By comparison, the two recent X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer take a first act that generates tear-inducing sympathy for the most important characters from an educated audience, and adds a second act that has the audience cheering on the mutants as they wage war, regardless of their actual goodness or whatever. By comparison, Underworld is a sleeping pill followed by a dash of coffee. Due to differences in the way my neurochemistry works, neither have a discernible effect upon me, and I would not be overly generous in the description of the effect they have on others. And thus, the failure of Underworld is summarised: in spite of trying to pass for adult-oriented entertainment, it barely has enough to excite the teen audience the studio had in mind. In fact, I feel I am insulting teenagers with that sentence.I gave Underworld a two out of ten. It is too good to be bad enough to be good. Thus, it winds up firmly stuck in no man's land. I have heard it jokingly called Underpants by detractors, and I say if the shoe fits, then wear it.",2,5,12,9 March 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Allow me to revisit...
","It has been months since I originally saw this film in the theatre, and having caught sight of the director's apparently preferred cut of the film on DVD-Video (which, from memory, doesn't seem all that different to what was shown in Australian theaters), I felt some things needed to be said. For all of the praises sung for this film, it really is quite a hollow and disingenuous shell.I don't know where the fast zombie trend came from, but it really does the whole concept a disservice. George Romero's zombie films, to me, represented a commentary on modern commercial society. No matter how slow, pathetic, and stupid the zombies were, they would eventually get their hands on you simply because there were so many of them. In this day and age where garbage like American Idiot supposedly gets untold millions of viewers while more intelligent television such as Quantum (no, not Quantum Leap, just Quantum) gets cancelled faster than a baby at Planned Parenthood, the zombie film commentary on society has grown more relevant with every passing day. Zombies are the lowest common denominator, and the good zombie film shows how their numbers grow as those who can think for themselves diminish.One featured comment has the gall to compare this shallow piece of trash to Paul Verhoeven's work on the basis of having 'completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore'. Wrong. Paul Verhoeven's unique characteristic, at least where Hollywood was concerned, was his ability and desire to show the consequences of violence. You never saw a 'you got me' reaction shot in a Verhoeven film. What separates his work from this bottle of parade gloss is that he also had something quite relevant to say about society in between his bouts of putting his characters through every layer of hell. Without the use of what the zombie represents, relative to modern society, this remake has absolutely nothing for the viewer to think about.The soundtrack, more or less entirely composed of contemporary numbers chosen by the MPAA/RIAA machine, is one of the most insipid things you will hear outside of a political spiel. It furthers the theory that Hollywood's film and rock stars live in their own self-contained bubble from which they gain absolutely no insight into the functioning of the rest of the world. Really, the number they try to use to show how 'x-treme' they are is about as hardcore as my seventy-two year old, Bing Crosby-worshiping neighbour.It is somewhat ironic that of all the zombie films that could be remade to modern standards, this is the one they chose. The original Dead series had meaningful, relevant things to say. In spite of a generally languid pace, they created tension that the viewer could really feel. This modernisation tries to move along at a rocket pace, but in so doing loses everything that the viewer can have an emotional investment in. The characters are little more than pieces in a chess game like that played by two of them a little of the way through the film.Plot improbabilities also plague the film. I don't know exactly where a sixteen year old girl is going to learn to drive a truck like that, but I'd love to find out. Exactly how one becomes a zombie isn't really even defined until the last minute, and then it smacks more of plot convenience than a planned plot element. Exactly why they had to situate our heroes in a shopping mall that doesn't have a gun store boggles the mind, too.In all, this Dawn is worthy of about five points. It keeps the viewer amused for a couple of hours, but once you start to scratch away the gloss and polish, you find that there is very little underneath.",Null,0,0,18 October 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Good, but not great...
","Not having seen the original DOTD, but having seen the originals of the other two episodes, I thought I might give this remake a try. I knew the basic plot of a bunch of civilians getting trapped in a shopping mall by a horde of zombies, but that was about it. So I thought that on a night where theatre admission is $10 for two, I'd go and check it out.Like a lot of remakes, or modern films in general, have both good and bad points. The good points stand out more in this case than the bad. You can stop reading now if you want to be kept in suspense about some story elements.The good points:* Ving Rhames does the military-man-caught-in-extraordinary-situation bit very well. He is the glue that holds together the rest of the cast. He is, in fact, the only one that stands out. Why they don't give this man more leading roles is beyond me.* Sarah Polley does the ordinary woman part extremely well. The stages of shock, denial, and bitter acceptance were well-caught here. She is probably the only cast member in this piece who doesn't go through all of these stages of development within five minutes.* The decision to drop the use of zombie dogs from the film was a good one. The original Dead trilogy was more of a comment about humanity, and the only series that has made mutant/zombie animals work well would be the Resident Evil games.* Mekhi Phifer managed to play the 'black surburbanite hood' stereotype without being annoying or boring. That takes some effort.* The 'humour' was kept appropriate both in level and timing, instead of being wedged in there like a turd into a pool filter exhaust. Peter Jackson could learn a thing or two from the writer and director of this remake.The bad points:* The zombies are shown running as fast as a bus or, worse yet, a sedan. This might quicken the pace of action sequences, but it takes away the creativity of setups. I know of few, if any, other zombie films that have done this, and I suspect that is for good reason.* The human tension element was mostly absent. Apart from the birth sequence and the initial moments with the mall security guards, the tension of the situation was undermined by how cooperative the living turned out to be.* The film obviously relies upon the original Dead trilogy for its story to be clear. A lot of references to events in Night Of The Living Dead are thrown in willy-nilly, and the rules as to how one becomes a zombie are not spelled out enough. The original makes it very clear that any kind of death is sufficient, whereas this version implies that one has to be bitten (yes, specifically bitten) by the zombies. A few minutes somewhere in this film to set the ground rules, instead of relying on the audience to know them from previous zombie films, would have helped a lot.* Explaining why the army helicopter simply passes the heroes by would have been a big help, too.* Leaving the ending to the imagination, rather the summing up what happens to our heroes during the credits, would have been much more effective. A simple shot of them floating out in the ocean, wondering where they can go, would have been far more effective.All in all, this is not the worst film I have ever seen, but it isn't going to replace the original Dead films. Still, it is better than some modernisations I could name. As a zombie film, it gets 7 out of ten. As a general film where the normal rules apply, I'd rate it at about 5, but it is entertaining for most of its running length, which is more than I can say for a lot of other films that receive more acclaim.",Null,0,0,15 June 2004
Iron Man 2," Did Brian Lowry and Kirk Honeycutt watch the same Iron Man films I did?
","...Because the Iron Man that I saw had me checking my watch constantly throughout its running length. It was basically a lot of talking with a few paltry action sequences that ended too soon and had no real oomph. Had it not been for Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey junior, Iron Man would have been another Hulk. And by Hulk, I do not mean The Incredile. The improvement shown in Iron Man 2, by comparison, is like the improvement between X-Men and X2, only five times over. The difference being that X-Men had been 98 percent awesome to begin with. Maybe if this trajectory of improvement continues with the inevitable third Iron Man film (which in itself would be an awesome feat), it will be in the same ballpark as X2, or maybe even as awe-inspiringly brilliant as RoboCop, the exercise in suffering for the most wonderful art that the comic book Iron Man helped inspire. But I digress. The point I am trying to make here is that anyone who uses words like 'less fun' as a put-down in context of reviewing a story like Iron Man 2 should be shot in order to lessen the pollution of our gene pool. I happen to find stories that deal with serious concepts like revenge and hatred far more fun than catchphrase fluff, Brian and Kirk.You cannot have a superhero film without a good actor to play the titular superhero. Whereas Christian Bale is hampered by his director's ego and an inability to be intelligible, and Hugh Jackman is currently chained down by some of the worst superhero film scripts since Batman & Robin, Robert Downey junior and his script are at the top of their game here. Originally when I heard that the story in this film would show Stark descending into alcoholism, I thought they at least picked the right man for the job. But the script provides something more in giving Stark a very credible motive for it. Downey is very convincing when pretending that he is dying and deciding to destroy himself as a result, but the arc of how an archival message from Howard Stark causes Tony Stark to lift himself out of the hole and fix the problem that is killing him is touching in multiple senses. And I speak as someone who has dealt with multiple addictions and compensatory life destructions here.But the real star of the show is Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, the real villain of the piece. Ivan is to Tony what Khan was to Kirk, only more so. Whereas Khan had the eventually-fatal flaw of not having as much experience in where he engaged his enemy, Ivan if anything knows quite a bit more about the world he is taking on than Tony. The desperate poverty we see him in at the beginning lends itself to that. When he goes out onto that racetrack and starts to chop up cars, he knows to expect no quarter, and thus tries to not give any. Lengthy speeches are also a tricky thing to pull off in any kind of film, lending themselves to ridicule or contradiction. But in a ten-second speech, Mickey Rourke gives the audience every reason to believe that his character has a right to feel hard done by. There is a reason why Rourke is experiencing a minor new surge of interest, and it is on display in every frame that features him. It is a credit to Robert Downey junior that he can stay credible whilst sharing the screen with Rourke.One of the most controversial aspects of Iron Man 2 was Marvel's choice to replace Terence Howard with Don Cheadle, their original choice to play Rhodes. Howard made much noise about it, but Marvel made the right decision here. Cheadle is far more credible as the Colonel despite being noticeably physically smaller. During one scene in which Cheadle dons the suit and acts in a fight with Downey, his delivery of the dialogue ('you are not fit to wear this suit!') is much more credible to boot. Also holding up their end of the platform are Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson in some of the best support roles thus far seen in a superhero film. Paltrow in particular scores top points for performing as a responsible woman trying to hold up a boss she cares for like a husband but is psychologically disintegrating into a mess before her very eyes. Jackson, for his part, plays the same Jackson he plays in every other film he is in, but it works well with the role of Nick Fury, so why not.The story itself is fairly simple and linear, without any extra layers or references for the viewer to take something out of. But instead of seemingly endless dialogue that has very little linguistic verve interspersed with the aforementioned so restrained it feels like a dog collar action sequences, Iron Man 2 has mostly very riveting dialogue and action sequences that, although nowhere near the standard set by the likes of Verhoeven, are at least entertaining to watch and contribute something to the plot. In fact the only aspect of the original that I prefer over this film is the score music. Whereas the Iron Man score had powerful themes that lifted certain shots well above the drudgery of the rest of the film, Iron Man 2's score is almost non-existent and remarkably tame. And while we are on the subject of music, whilst the Iron Man of the Black Sabbath song and Iron Man would not recognise each other if they met, can we please get something better than AC/DC? They have not released a single good record since I was born.Iron Man 2 is a ten out of ten film. To paraphrase a line from an early sequence: **** you, Brian and Kirk, **** you.",10,5,21,1 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," It tried, and that's more than can be said for the next sequel...
","The first time I heard of Alien: Resurrection was when a reader of those Hollywood magazines reported reading about a new Alien sequel rumoured to be in the works. According to his statement, Ripley would be 'brought back' by cloning. Given that Sigourney Weaver insisted that she be killed off at the end of the previous film, those in the know were skeptical that she would even appear. In spite of all that, they found the right price for her, and the rest is history. Thankfully, she had the good sense to avoid the dreadful Alien VS. Predator project. Apparently, she read that script and said it sounded like a dreadful idea, which makes one wonder why Fox has never examined some of the ideas in such sources as Dark Horse comic books.Thankfully, Fox learned their lesson from the Alien 3 experience. Instead of rushing an incomplete script into production, they hired a decent writer and gave him time to come up with something watchable. As with Aliens after Alien, the decision was also made to attempt to follow up a slow, languid science-fiction/horror piece with a fast-paced, breathless science-fiction/action piece. The results, while not even remotely able to compete with the best of the series, are such an improvement upon Alien 3 that it makes the elements of Gibson's Alien 3 script that can be seen in Alien: Resurrection a bitchslap to Brandywine Productions.However, a number of problems keep Alien: Resurrection from really achieving its potential. One of them is the casting. While Brad Dourif can be believed in a film like this in spite of his relatively tiny size, Winona Ryder screams out 'miscast' like Roseanne Barr would as the lead in a porn film. Not only is she tiny even in comparison to Dourif, her mannerisms and voice scream a softness that the world of the Alien series will not suffer. That she lives to see the end while more appropriate characters like those portrayed by Michael Wincott or Dominique Pinon bite it about forty minutes after they are introduced indicates that plausibility was a secondary concern to the director.The design of the Alien-Human hybrid in particular makes one wonder exactly what was going on in the minds of the production team. Apparently, a more crab-like version was originally proposed, but changed in order to make it seem more 'plausible'. That... thing... is meant to be plausible? I must have been asleep when they redefined that word. The statement that the Alien Queen also now has a Human reproductive system is a bit of a joke, given that it is implied in the same monologue that she reproduces asexually. Then again, given that the prologue expects us to believe they can obtain an Alien by cloning someone who carried one once, I doubt that respect for the audience's sense of the plausible was a big concern.To the credit of the film, Ron Perlman makes an excellent addition to the canon. Unlike Ryder, one has no trouble believing Perlman could survive well in a universe like this. Weaver has also grown in terms of acting to the point where the role of Ellen Ripley fits her like a glove. She could practically portray this role in her sleep, so there's not much chance of her not giving an awesome performance. With the new direction the character is taken in, she shows that there is nothing she cannot do if given a chance.In the end, however, the flaws outweigh the strengths. I don't know whether the seven minutes added to the Special Edition for a 2003 release fix this, but I doubt it. As a result, I'd rate Alien: Resurrection a six out of ten. It is far better than its most immediate predecessor, but long-time fans of the series had a right to expect more.",6,1,2,21 December 2004
12 Monkeys," Terry Gilliam's other masterpiece
","Terry Gilliam excels at portraying a world gone mad. That much is clear from a single viewing of either 12 Monkeys or Brazil. What 12 Monkeys has that Brazil does not is a little more experience and expertise. By contrasting the maddest kind of future with an equally mad past, Gilliam creates a nightmarish science fiction world where contrast is the meat in one very odd sandwich. For Gilliam, it is one of many masterpieces. For lead actors Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, it was the turning point in careers of varying prestige. Although Pitt had yet to truly make a splash as the darker half of a strange personality in Fight Club, Willis had literally turned portraying the vulnerable, less than superhuman hero into an art form some seven years previous in Die Hard. Both have since gone onto bigger, although not necessarily better, things. Willis is asking the sky for a fourth Die Hard film, and Pitt made no less than twenty million dollars for his most recent film. Neither of them could have achieved that without this film.What makes 12 Monkeys especially stand out in their careers is that it refuses to follow a conventional storyline. While it does have the tragic heroine thing all through the main story, it evolves in a manner rarely seen in Hollywood. Madeleine Stowe proves herself in a role that must have taken quite a toll on her physically and emotionally. Her disbelief at the start of the film and her growing sense of belief in Willis' story towards the end is very palpable. Brad Pitt manages to feign a kind of insanity in a very convincing manner. The moment where he feigns being cross-eyed as he enters a room is frightening. But the real star of this show is the story, which links together fragments from alternating periods of both the past (our past, that is) and the future in a manner that gives the film a great sense of economy. There is nothing redundant in 12 Monkeys, just a plot that leaves the viewer gobsmacked at the end.If there is a weakness in 12 Monkeys, it is in the scenes of the future. Borrowing heavily from the playbook he used in Brazil, Gilliam builds a future where scientists coerce cooperation from prisoners, often by drowning them in visual and audio stimulus. I doubt that Gilliam's intent was to paint scientists as a cruel, evil mob. Perhaps he tried to contrast the scientists with Stowe's compassionate doctor, but the Monty Python-style acting of the future scientists does get on the nerves. Christopher Meloni sticks his head in as a police lieutenant who delivers one of the best gags in the film. It is the one that, in fact, makes a convert out of Stowe's character. This way of linking the past with the future as her character spraypaints a message onto a wall as Pitt spouts out a theory about how she could know what he is up to becomes one of the classic moments in cinema. I will not speak of the film's ending, but when you see it, you will be amazed by the continuity links. This is one tightly put-together film.Paul Buckmaster creates an original, timeless score that punctuates the wild mood swings Willis' character endures. As Willis acts out the questioning of his own sanity, a desire to be what he calls 'well', and eventually his acceptance of a patently impossible situation, Buckmaster's score delivers a suitably downbeat punctuation. The music is part of what makes the misery of the situation so tangible. As Willis recites the last half of Stowe's message to the future, the music turns the action into a ghost story. The real kicker is the string and accordion theme when the army of the Twelve Monkeys appears perfectly conveys the sheer nuttiness of its leader. Many of the people who have changed our world, for better or worse, were very much mentally divergent, as the film puts it. Einstein, for example, is believed to have been a sufferer of Asperger's Syndrome. Pitt's character, a real sod by the name of Jeffrey Goines, will never be as loved as Einstein, but Pitt does manage to inject some Einsteinian quirks into the character. In spite of the fact that 1996 is now the past, the scenario depicted seems more believable than ever.I gave 12 Monkeys a nine out of ten. I am still in two minds as to whether it or Brazil is Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. Either way, it is worthy of watching at least once. If you enjoy science fiction without the need for an uplifting message, then this film has a good chance with you.",9,1,1,15 July 2005
Shaun of the Dead," One of the funniest satires of the past ten years
","Shaun Of The Dead, depending on how you look at it, is either a satire of the zombie concept itself, or a satire of how Hollywood really seems to fail to get it. The film starts out in an almost quiet, sedate fashion, reminiscent of many a British soap opera. Indeed, when our hero passes by some of the recently reanimated dead, he passes by them with such nonchalance that one has to wonder exactly how soon we would notice if the dead started getting up and eating our neighbours. No explanation is offered for why they start doing so, and I doubt that one is really needed. By now, the zombie concept is so entrenched in imagination that it defies belief that the films people think of when one mentions zombies are not those made by the great George Romero.Unlike the excerable Resident Evil: Apocalypse, which effectively sent itself up, the comedy in Shaun Of The Dead is subtle, fully intentional, and even well-orchestrated. As in any good zombie film, social normalities are messed with, people's expectations of how their actions will turn out are defied, and more humans are killed by the stupidity of their peers rather than any direct contact with the zombies. As is promised in the theatrical trailers, you will get to see zombies being killed with every household or gardening implement imaginable. Even the old record collection gets a try. By far the funniest moment in the film, however, is the ending, which is where the implication that this film was intended to satirise the commercial film system's inability to understand the zombie concept comes from. I won't spoil it for you, but it will bring to mind images of the attempts to make certain sequels as family-friendly as possible.Interestingly, product placements are also minimal in this feature. In the ninety-odd minutes it ran for, I could not count a single instance where a product was displayed for no other reason than flashing a logo in the audience's face. Not that having recognisable products in a film is necessarily bad, but after some films in which one can play Guess Which Phone Company Paid For Production, the contrast is nice. Given the minimal budget involved, they wouldn't have needed product placement in order to make a profit. More on that anon.Unlike a lot of zombie films, especially the aforementioned Resident Evil sequel, Shaun Of The Dead uses the 2.35:1 frame very effectively. Shots of zombies being shot in the head are staged very smoothly, and some of the outdoor scenes have a dynamic framing that Leone would admire. Indeed, one would never guess that it only cost four million dollars to make from looking at it. That's almost as impressive in low-budget terms as Mad Max. But what really keeps the film going is the story. Simple and to the point, it gets the horror element going without resorting to the usual big conspiracy ideas that some zombie films sadly trip themselves over. Whoever thought that so much could be made out of a trip from the apartment to the pub, by way of mother's home?When I think about what kind of score to give Shaun Of The Dead, an eight seems most appropriate. The humour is often culture-specific, and there are only a few outright belly-laugh moments, but it is entertaining from start to finish, unlike many of the recent entries in the genre it is attempting to satirise.",8,1,2,23 April 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Fantasy for infants
","One of the great things about fantasy as a genre is that it can be used to satirise aspects of our own world that we find repugnant. However, the trap of all fantasy films is that a certain grounding in reality has to take place. When a plot device is used, its function must be explained. When a character is able to perform a great feat, the reasons and means must be laid out. Before I go on, I should point out that one video critic laid out a series of rules for judging motion pictures by their titles. One such rule is that the longer the title, the worse the film will be. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very, very long title. And in spite of having a special effects budget that would have had C.S. Lewis salivating, it becomes a very average, ordinary film. Then again, Lewis only gets it as bad as his more famous contemporary, relatively speaking.There is another saying in creative work that when you adapt something into a new medium, you inherit the source material's flaws. Lion inherits quite a few of them, not least of which is Lewis' childish conception of a fantasy world and how it works. Characters are repeatedly killed, turned to stone, or otherwise unpleasantly dealt with. Prophecy, magic, and general plot devices are used to undo all these events. Gee, a world where there is no conflict, no death, and no consequence. You can keep this world, mister Lewis, because it sounds like the same thing as being dead to me. Admittedly, it has been a while since I read the novel on which this extended Play School was based, but I do remember a serious problem with being able to deal with consequence or change there, too. I know this will come as a shock after I have talked about how fantasy epics such as The Lord Of The Rings suffered from the director's wholesale mauling, but this is one case where a big difference from the source material would have helped.Another amusing moment comes when a Santa Claus figure, riding a sleigh into the edge of a forest, hands three of the four children tools for their quest. He tells us that MoneyMas has not been celebrated in Narnia for a century, since the oh-so-evil White Witch came to dominate this land. The audience they are quite obviously aiming this film at might be too young to appreciate this, but as films like Bad Santa helped us appreciate, MoneyMas is only a celebration when you have succumbed to the brainwashing. So Jadis does not celebrate MoneyMas? Okay, get a fantasy creature army going on me, because I do not celebrate it, either. One more amusement is when Dwarrow are shown in the film as simply being diminutive Humans (and yet the presence of regular-sized Human children and adolescents seems so significant). Granted, this is Lewis' fantasy world and not necessarily meant to make physiological sense, but sending such creatures into battle does not tend to strike me as a good tactic.Unfortunately, it is the battles of the film that let it down the worst. After years of viewing such delightful films as RoboCop, violence without consequence easily equals boring to me. And as I indicated earlier, consequence does not seem to have been a word in Lewis' vocabulary. There is no situation from which our characters cannot be given a reset button. Nor, it seems, is there any blood when a five hundred pound lion leaps on a woman who has to weigh a hundred and seventy pounds, tops. And therein lies the fatal flaw that has killed every fantasy film of the past ten years. Lion tries so hard to appeal to that mythical audience of all ages, and winds up appealing to nobody. Tilda Swinton does her best to appear menacing, and she does a decent job in some sequences, to give her credit, but the script literally undercuts her at every turn. It would have been interesting to see how Lion and the next Harry Potty film would have clashed together at the box office, because heaven knows they are made with the same mindset.Words fail me when I try to describe the positives of this exercise in driving in the middle of the road. The film is slower than dragging a dead lion across a yard up to the end, when it suddenly attempts to give the sleeping adults in the audience some positive memories by staging a very ordinary battle sequence. To the credit of the director, he manages to resist the urge to shake the camera about, but the framing of shots is still nonsensical from the point of view of anyone who wants to see anything. To be fair, the film also manages to give viewers a sense of the chaos and suffering that drives the children into rural England in order to set up the action. It is rather amusing to hear Roger Ebert, a man who has been criticising films for several decades, describe Lion as a film sitting on the line between traditional family fare and some new kind of action-oriented family fare. To me, this is symptomatic of the MPAA's utter inability to recognise that there are adults in the audience, and they also have a right, as one expects when they pay obscene amounts of money, to be entertained.I gave Lion a four out of ten. I was gnashing my teeth over whether to give it a five as I gave Jackson's abysmal attempt to put half of The Return Of The King on the silver screen. I even said to another audience member that Lion was a better film, as it certainly had a better sense of pace and flow. However, I lowered the score to four when I realised that so too do most test patterns.",4,3,5,17 January 2006
Elizabeth," Drier than oatbran
","The story of Queen Elizabeth I is one as mired in controversy and speculation as President Dubya's terms. Some say that she was the best thing to ever happen to England. Others say that she was a manic warmonger devoted only to causing bloodshed. Indeed, the mentality of everyone living in England or Europe at this time is apparently quite bizarre, but then, so too is that of the director of this film.The story of anyone involved with government in the Middle Ages is a goldmine for entertaining material. It is therefore a real mystery how Shekhar Kapur and Michael Hirst managed to make something so dull. Each scene seems so flat and underacted that it tends to resemble a daytime television show. Maybe it is just my flat affect talking, but moments when characters are meant to be at each others' throats simply failed to register for me.Indeed, it is a sad indictment upon this exercise in the pedestrian that one starts to wish that Miranda Richardson, arguably the best actor to ever impersonate Queen Elizabeth I, had been cast instead. Her little 'First I'm going to have a little drinky... and then I'm going to execute the whole bally lot of you' speech would have worked wonders here. Elizabeth I was, like her predecessors, a violent tyrant who would not think twice about removing her own daughter's head if it meant protecting her position of power.One big problem here is that the film tries to cover almost the entire reign of Queen Elizabeth. Such a subject simply cannot be compressed into two hours and remain interesting. Indeed, one constantly asks themselves who she is meant to be fighting and avoiding from one scene to the next. There is little transition from moment to moment. Characters with little or no introduction are killed off in montage scenes that make their deaths seem of little importance or consequence. Given that these are members of Elizabeth's court, I don't think Kapur meant this to be a commentary on people's places within the Kingdom.I gave this dull and monotonous film a two out of ten. I wasn't even going to give it the satisfaction of a one. Only films that are so bad they're amusing deserve a one, and Elizabeth is so dry and by the numbers that amusement is virtually impossible during its running time.",1,5,11,22 November 2004
Black Book," I have seen the best film that will ever be set in World War II...
","and it is called Zwartboek. Rather than recap the plot and point out a few details that make it so great, I will simply focus on the things it does better than others. I am an extreme fan of Paul Verhoeven, of course, so the man can almost do no wrong in my eyes. However, for the sake of understanding why Zwartboek moved me to tears at times whilst other World War II films had me stone-faced and unimpressed, one must contrast it with not only other films of the genre, but other films in general. First, however, let me get the most gushing praise out of the way. I knew Zwartboek was going to be a good film for Verhoeven, being that it seems to show him learning from all the mistakes of the past twenty years while purging the demons that drove him to make them. What I was not expecting was the best film I have seen since RoboCop. Where one shows a younger Verhoeven adjusting to the quirks and idiosyncrasies of a very different film industry, the other shows him as a master fully in control of his art.Now, onto the reasons why Zwartboek is the best thing I have seen in twenty years. There are a few films that have attempted to use diabetes as a plot device in the past. Thy Neighbour's Wife and Memento are easily two of the worst recent examples. Zwartboek avoids their mistakes by bearing in mind that killing someone with insulin requires that someone's trust, even if it is gained through deceit. It also requires a larger amount of insulin than shown in most films where this device is used. Zwartboek shows a bit of a hint at just how much (five milliliters might be fatal, by comparison the largest standard syringe used for the purpose of injecting insulin has a capacity of one milliliter). About the only place where Zwartboek departs from reality is the rapid onset of hypoglycemic symptoms and how little our heroine eats to counter the attack, but these points can be explained away by complex factors. Verhoeven has shown the right way to portray diabetes in Zwartboek.Another problem with the vast majority of World War II films is that the good guys are shown as so very good and the bad guys so very, very bad. Zwartboek, like Soldaat Van Oranje, shows that there were good Dutchmen as well as bad Dutchmen before taking the bold step of showing that there were also good Nazis and bad Nazis. Sebastian Koch shines in his portrayal of what we see at first as a very bad Nazi until understanding of the situation and political backstabbing motivate him to take up the cause of good. But it is a scene in a prison for accused collaborators after the war is over that will be burned into my memory forever. For the most part, Verhoeven has shown us heroic Dutchmen who resisted the occupation in any way they can, but then he turns our perceptions right on their head by showing how they celebrate their victory. Carice Van Houten acts with a grace and dignity throughout the film, but it is when her character's own countrymen are dumping the camp's filth upon her that Houten really shines.In contrast to most of Verhoeven's films, Zwartboek is mostly told in flashback. But it is the scenes set over a decade after the end of the war that really seal the deal. When we are first shown Rachel, she is an ageing teacher in a school within a camp located in what the audience would presume to be the Israel of the 1950s. We are given some hints that the war has caused her to grow old well before her time, but it is not until we see her again at the end of the film that we fully understand. As she leads her family back into the camp to the sounds of sirens, and we see soldiers lining up behind wire fences, we see Verhoeven's most subtle and effective use of symbolism ever. Yes, Leonard Maltin, Verhoeven knows WHEN to be subtle. What one takes from this scene depends a lot on what they take in before they see it, but to me, it symbolises the fact that no matter where Rachel goes from now on, she will always be in some way stuck in the Netherlands of 1944.Like all Verhoeven films, Zwartboek is bloody and graphic. People are shot, stabbed, beaten, tortured, and sometimes all of the above. Paul Verhoeven has said previously that his goal is to be completely open in how he films a story, and Zwartboek is one of his most open films to date. Without the MPAA or American political system breathing down his neck, the honesty Verhoeven brings to Zwartboek reinforces the tragic nature of the story. The film also contains what would have to be the single most *subtle* death Verhoeven has ever portrayed on film. Yet, in the mind of the intelligent audience that he is catering to, it comes across as also being one of the most gruesome. In this day when directors attempt to shock us by severing ears without giving us a context (or a realistic amount of blood for that matter), Verhoeven's honesty and educated approach is king. In a way, the symbolic scene I just mentioned also symbolises how Verhoeven apparently remembers World War II, and he is utterly unflinching in demonstrating how that affects him to this day.Zwartboek is the epitome of a ten out of ten film. Once, I told a relative that if I were offered a dollar to let Verhoeven adapt one of my writings into a film, or a billion to let Peter Jackson do the same, I would choose Verhoeven every time. Zwartboek is a perfect demonstration of why.",10,6,9,21 July 2007
Troy," Tries a little too hard...
","One major problem that seems to face Hollywood adaptations of literary material in the last twenty years is a fundamental lack of respect for the tone of the source material. Recent Stephen King adaptations have tried to be family-friendly, The Lord Of The Rings was robbed of the scenes upon which its peculiar characteristic depends in favour of overlong battle sequences, and then you have Troy. Troy, being based upon The Iliad, has a lot to live up to, especially given that The Iliad and The Odyssey are considered such great landmarks of literature.Where O'Brother, Where Art Thou? wore its loose relationship to The Odyssey on its sleeve and instead tried to present an answer to the question of how it would read were it written during America's so-called golden era, Troy tries to present itself as a dramatic and literal interpretation of The Iliad. It doesn't work in that sense. For one thing, it tries to tell years worth of events in a pace that implies mere months. It's almost as if modern filmmakers cannot even be bothered implying the passage of time.Another major problem is in the casting. We truly have an international cast here, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. However, when you listen to the cast speak during this film, it becomes obvious in a hurry that the only member who has any Greek ancestry is, ironically, playing a Trojan. Brendan Gleeson and Brian Cox don't even bother to hide their Irish or Scottish accents, while Brad Pitt often makes one wonder if he is about to tell us that the things we own end up owning us (ironically, a line that wouldn't have gone amiss here). Poor little Orlando Bloom looks utterly lost during most of the running time, and it becomes obvious at the end that he just cannot act without a bow in his hand. A new version of the action hero syndrome.However, Troy also manages to get a few things right. The battle sequences are shot with a stable, steady camera that, while often too close for the audience to comfortably see what is happening, at least doesn't induce nausea. The actions of the characters doing the fighting actually make sense, too. Compared to Rohirrim charging the hundred-foot tall Mumakil during The Return Of The King, simple things like the Spartan warriors hiding behind the shields they join together are a welcome change.Connie Nielsen and Diane Kruger get a decent shake as the feminine quotient of the film. Nielsen must be feeling quite angry that she wasn't even considered for an Oscar after Gladiator. Every scene she appears in, she seems to have a look on her face that seems to say 'my career has tanked, and horsemouth won an Oscar?'. If anything, she seems even more forceful than at the end of Gladiator. Kruger, on the other hand, gives a measured, soft performance that leaves the viewer in little doubt as to why Paris would risk provoking war for her.I gave Troy a five out of ten. This is the same score I generally give to all films that appear reasonably good, but waste so much potential. Sure, it is worthy of a viewing, but in this market where a film comes out every week, this just isn't enough.",5,0,1,1 November 2004
Ed Wood," Ed Wood...
","It is hard to believe that a man so obviously short of talent could have such a big influence over people who have such an abundance of it, but this biopic goes a long way to explain how. First, however, one must understand that this film was not intended to be a literal account of this period in Ed Wood's life. It is easy to mistake it as such after Jeffrey Jones delivers his Criswellian monlogue, but it isn't. Tim Burton appears to have more intended to make a film to celebrate the life of one of Hollywood's most creative failures.The film covers the shooting of three of Wood's best-known films. In the order they appear in the film, these are Glen Or Glenda, Bride Of The Monster, and of course the infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space. The telling how all these titles were changed, and why, from those that Ed originally gave them, is hilarious in itself. Between the shooting of each film, we also get to see representations of how Ed found 'talent' and financing to make these films. During these sequences, the film becomes the Spinal Tap of the film industry.Johnny Depp is in brilliant form as the titular character. It is hard to get into a character who is so oblivious to his own lack of talent, and keeps such a brave face in spite of such crushing knockbakcs. Depp does this so brilliantly that it's a wonder he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Speaking of Oscars, Martin Landau is dynamite as the ailing, forgotten one-time king of the horror silver screen. As Bela Lugosi, he is so in character that it gives a unique insight into the final days of Lugosi's life. As we learn what happens to Lugosi while Wood is hammering the final nails into his career's coffin, it's hard to say whether we shed tears for Lugosi's unfortunate demise, or because Landau portrays it with such conviction and sympathy.If there is a weak link in this film, it is Sarah Jessica Parker. In one of life's ironies, as she is portraying Delores Fuller and reading a review of a stage performance, she asks if she really has a horse-like face (or something to that effect). I bet she didn't have to do much research in order to learn how to do that convincingly. Only Gary Busey, Jake Busey, and Julia Roberts exceed Parker for being obnoxiously ugly. The fact that she can't act worth a damn also lets the side down, although not as badly as one might expect, given that everyone who plays an extra in Ed's films is expected to turn in a rotten performance.Some of the quirks that make Ed's films as great as they are were left out of the film. Jeffrey Jones, for example, doesn't even try to imitate the weird back-and-forth movement of Criswell's head as he explains that future events such as these will affect you in the future. However, one of the funniest incidents on the Plan 9 set, an actor playing a policeman scratching himself with his gun, is captured here with a certain kind of uncanny accuracy. From this, one gets the impression that Jeffrey Jones didn't care nearly as much about researching his character as did Martin Landau or Johnny Depp. In the end, however, the positives outweigh the negative quite dramatically.All in all, I gave Ed Wood a 10 out of 10. It entertains from start to finish, which, like the titular character's actual films, puts it well ahead of numerous films that made a lot more money or garnered a lot more critical praise. This is another film that proves quality is still possible in Hollywood, in spite of how hard the system rails against it.",10,0,1,7 July 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Greenpeace's idea of product placement
","In case you are wondering where the summary comes from, the man who founded Greenpeace, Patric Moore, once described his former organisation as 'a band of scientific illiterates who use Gestapo tactics...'. Things like facts, accuracy, or plausibility don't matter to the likes of Greenpeace, and it is pretty apparent that they don't matter to Roland Emmerich a hell of a lot, either. If the slightest shred of doubt that Emmerich was practically living on another planet after Independence Day or Godzilla existed, The Day After Tomorrow has completely erased it.NASA has actually stated that the events depicted in this film were so ridiculous that they could never occur. Emmerich has it that they could occur, but he sped up the time frame. Given that Emmerich can't even hold a camera without insulting someone's intelligence or ethnicity (seriously, Godzilla was one of the most racist films of the late 1990s), I know which side of this story I believe.The major problem with the film is that when we're not being subjected to shots of impossible action from the weather, the film is as boring as hell. Even some of the action sequences, such as the Vertical Limit ripoff, are about as interesting as the constant scare campaigns that anti-choice groups such as Greenpeace come out with. It is a supreme irony that during one of the book-burning sequences, one character states that he wants to preserve the Gutenberg bible because it represents the greatest achievement of mankind. The written word has been with us far longer than the Gutenberg bible, and since the original purpose of the written word was to share knowledge, it is more of a great misuse.Apparently, plausible story elements are not the only thing that Roland Emmerich forgot about. During one shot of the sky as birds migrate to who knows where, said birds go straight through buildings. Then we have a sequence where three of our heroes are attacked by wolves who traveled across Manhattan to find them. Apparently, wolves are invulnerable to all the spontaneous tornadoes, blizzards, and tidal waves, we witnessed earlier. And don't get me started on the infected cut plot device. It is truly amazing how film characters can defy the laws of physics in one second by outrunning a tidal wave, and be on death's door in the next.In all honesty, I want to know how much Greenpeace contributed towards the film's budget. If plausibility were essential to box office success, The Day After Tomorrow would have been the biggest tax write-off in the history of Hollywood. If things ever get to the stage where we have to burn books in order to keep warm, it won't be in spite of people like Roland Emmerich. It will be because of them. Ergo, nobody should be surprised that I gave this pile a one out of ten.",1,5,12,24 October 2004
X-Men," Very good... almost great in places...
","As far as comic book adaptations go, there seem to be two kinds of film: the good ones (Tim Burton's Batmans) and the hideously bad ones (Superman IV, Batman Returns, Batman Forever etc). The 2000 adaptation of X-Men belongs in the former category, thanks to some excellent casting and a well thought-out story.People have criticised the film as deviating too much from the official X-Men canon. I kind of suspect these people are the same 'geniuses' who levelled the same criticism at Batman, so I will run the following question by you all: suppose that you had some kind of trait that made you extremely different from the rest of the populace. Would you be running around in multi-coloured spandex, parading around like a hero, or would you be having deep crises about how you react to other people's fear. As a sufferer of a present-day equivalent of the mutations shown in this film, I know what my answer is. The modification of the story to show Rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke. Not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are (more so than the normies in this film, as a matter of fact), but casting a delicate, intelligent young woman like Anna Paquin in the role was a perfect capitalisation on the writing. Coupling this with the way Wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiement who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea, too. Hugh Jackman was a perfect choice for the role. As a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters' histories in a more figurative sense, I found these two actors utterly believeable in all respects.The only thing wrong with the movie, in my view, is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written. Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth just don't have the same level of character development allocated to them as Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops, and Storm. Mystique gets one line in the whole film (the rest are her pretending to be someone else), and Toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots. Capping that off is the fact that Magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the Nazis. Granted, he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants, but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for Magneto to become so like his real enemy.Aside from the uneven development of the characters, however, this is another near-great modern adaptation of a comic book. It works on numerous levels and is extremely pleasant to watch.",10,0,0,3 April 2001
Resident Evil: Extinction," Humanity has reached a new low...
","There are statements people can make that instantly tell you everything you need to know about them. When Albert Einstein stated that the simple version of relativity was akin to how quickly time moved in different situations, for example, it told the world they were dealing with an intelligence too great to be easily understood. So when a person tells you that Resident Evil: Extinction is a good film, you instantly know that they are a grade A moron who is best swiftly removed from the gene pool. And it is not like the filmmakers failed to try this time. After the exercise in failure to deliver that the previous sequel turned into, this installment simply had to get better by comparison. The unfortunate downside to this being that a lot of mouth-breathers who have obviously never seen a Romero or Fulci film have the unfortunate habit of confusing 'better' with 'good'. Websites dedicated to the savoring of bad films will tell you that a film is in trouble when it starts to remind you of better ones. RE:E takes less than four minutes to remind viewers of the substantially better original.By now, we know better than to go to a Resident Evil film expecting anything like good acting or a well-told story. But what separates the first film from its sequels is a little quality called atmosphere. Simply put, the look, the feel, the music, and even some of the performances, were 'right'. Resident Evil took the time to suspend the viewer's disbelief and draw them into its world. The sequels absolutely fail at this deceptively simple step because they take it for granted that the viewer has been drawn in. This becomes painfully obvious when voiceovers describe how the T-virus has somehow dried up the oceans or other such rot. No matter how lethal and easily transmissible a virus can be, one that destroys the environment that it is meant to thrive in is not well-equipped for long-term survival. But since we are meant to accept this virus as being able to instantly adapt to whatever needs the plot requires, we also accept that making sense is not high on the list of priorities the filmmakers have.If only the film having a voice of its own was a higher priority to these filmmakers. As said previously, RE:E wastes no time in reminding the viewers of better films. Aside from the original in the series, RE:E also attempts to steal from not one, not two, but three George Romero films, all from the same series. Say what you will about Day Of The Dead especially, but Day Of The Dead's subplot about attempts to domesticate the zombies made an interesting metaphor for the intolerance human society was and is developing for natural behaviour that does not meet the expected norm. In RE:E, this subplot is handled with such clumsy focus on attempting to move the plot forward by any means necessary that any social commentary is lost in the disbelief at how inept the storytellers seem. The concept of parties raiding old towns for supplies is also about as original as a third-generation fax, but it is done so badly here that it truly makes one appreciate how Land Of The Dead negated questions about what the heroes are going to do when the leftovers run out.And even if RE:E fails to remind one of much better films, the philosophy that less is more completely and utterly backfires. One reason the Resident Evil sequels remind this viewer a lot of Romero's Dead series is because Romero's Dead series allocated sufficient time to explore enough of the characters that their plight and struggles seemed real and compelling. The manner in which the shopping mall environment slowly evolves from a safe paradise to a prison is very palpable due to the acting in Dawn Of The Dead. The real Dawn Of The Dead, I mean. When you see Omar Epps return for another performance in RE:E, all the toning down of the bling bling act in the world cannot help but bring back memories of his performance in the previous film. Which in turn leaves audiences who can read and speak at an adult level wishing to see his character die a gruesome and horrid death. While RE:E is not quite as softcore as its immediate predecessor, its seemingly unending ability to leave the viewer wanting more is a stark contrast to how Dead films can make even the most hardcore viewer wonder if they are perhaps going too far.All this leaves one wondering exactly what Capcom think of how these second-tier studio gatherings have used their property. The first film in the series at least had a freaky sense of atmosphere and some replications of game conventions to tie it to its source material. If you changed the titles of the two sequels and removed all references to the Umbrella corporation, they would be unrecognisable as connected to Capcom's games. Simply put, the Resident Evil title is nothing more than a transparent ploy to fanboys and video game addicts to pay for films that are increasingly poorly-written. If truth in advertising laws were more stringent, they would be required to be titled something along the lines of We Have No Respect For You At All, Videogamers: Just Give Us Your Money. The saddest part of it is that this kind of corporate shill film designed to whip consumers into a money-shedding frenzy is exactly what previous, far superior works such as (the real) Dawn Of The Dead were trying to warn us about.Resident Evil: Extinction is a film so bad that it makes misfires like Day Of The Dead seem like Zwartboek by comparison. It is a two out of ten film in every sense: too bad to be worthwhile, not bad enough to be entertaining. Avoid.",2,3,5,7 March 2008
The Prestige," Show stolen by David Bowie...
","Christopher Nolan films and I have something of a varied history together. While I found Memento insulting, poorly-written, badly-researched, and generally wearing its total lack of knowledge regarding a key plot device on its sleeve, other Nolan films like Batman Begins have sort of redeemed him. In essence, this makes him a bit like the drunk uncle who occasionally has something of import or interest to say. In any case, The Prestige, an intriguing concept that escaped my notice during its theatrical run, is one of the more interesting pieces to come out of the major studios during 2006. Naturally, the title makes no sense to anyone who is unfamiliar with the profession of the central characters, but a masterfully-delivered monologue by Michael Caine explains it all in a manner that leaves one unable to help thinking that it all works beautifully. If nothing else, Nolan knows how to get the best from his actors, and in storytelling of any variety, that tends to be half of the proverbial battle. Especially in a film like this where the performances are central to the story.The Prestige, named after the final stage of every magic act, concerns itself with a sibling-like rivalry between two stage magicians as portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The one point where the film lets them down is that their characters are so identical in nature that one is not really sure until the final act, and not even then in a way, which one is meant to be the hero. Perhaps this was intentional, although it does come off as a goofy accident. Nonetheless, for most of the film's length, we see the two attempt to one-up each other as they vie for the attention of a fickle London audience, performing sleights of hand and other such illusions in a time when stage performance was very much an industry like modern television. The clear difference between the two characters that drives much of the story is that one is a better magician while the other is a considerably better stage performer. Jackman and Bale sell their characters so well that the lack of distinction between actor and character becomes irrelevant.So when I say that David Bowie performs the greatest trick of all during the film's running length by stealing the show, it is important to understand my full meaning. Bale and Jackman are performers at the top of their game, making films that cause the audience to rally behind them even when they are competing with more experienced or even better actors. This is a feat only a small percentage of today's acting pool are really capable of. Jackman in particular has accomplished the virtually impossible by making himself even more memorable than Sir Ian McKellen. So when Bowie walks into frame amidst a shower of lighting as Nikola Tesla, the classical misdirection here is that he is the most captivating and earnest performer. Recreating Tesla's seemingly insane experiments with AC electricity must have kept the special effects team up for weeks. But Bowie performs around them just as the real Tesla would sell them, by acting as if they were the most natural thing in the world. And Bowie even demonstrates they probably were to the real Tesla.Hence, when Bowie is not in the frame, the film tends to lose an otherworldly spark that he exudes as naturally as sweat. Not that this is a detriment to the film in any sense. During many sequences, Jackman and Bale make it clear that to their characters, this is just another day at work. All the awe and wonder we feel when we witness a great magic trick or an awesome performance act, even one as ridiculous as that of the Tokyo Shock Boys, simply does not translate from the seats to the stage. The Prestige makes that so abundantly clear that we are left with little wonder that performing clowns can be such maladjusted or sombre characters when the show is over. In an age where not even the ability to capture audio-visual displays as a string of ones and zeros amazes us anymore, The Prestige gives us a rude reminder of just how jaded we have become. It has been a long time since the DVD-Video format has held me in the same wide-eyed wonder as when I first experienced it, but boy did Bowie's introductory shot come close.At its heart, The Prestige is a story of obsession, a fact that is referenced in the dialogue so many times it might get monotonous to some viewers. Both Bale and Jackman seem consumed with the desire to show each other up that it makes the things they are willing to sacrifice in the process seem quite creepy. And the amazing thing is that it mostly works. With both characters appearing ready to sell out their own mothers to steal glory for a fleeting moment, it gives a whole new historical context to the invention of the American HDTV standard in order to snuff out the Japanese equivalent, and so forth. Whether the film industry would be in the comparative dire straits it is in today if all films worked so hard to create an illusory feel is probably irrelevant. What matters is that The Prestige destroys the argument that modern film does not make the effort to transport the audience. It shows the viewer something that they have not seen in quite this form before, and that is something of an achievement in an industry where it became all about the bottom line years ago.I gave The Prestige an eight out of ten. Parts such as the first half-hour lost me, but the image of Bowie walking through lightning will be burned onto my brain forever. See it just for that.",8,3,5,7 May 2007
Silent Hill," Huh?
","I've read so many comments calling this film a good or accurate video game adaptation. If it is accurate, then I intend to never play the games. But good? Well, let me put it this way, if the people telling me this film is good told me that the sky at midday is blue, I would get another opinion. To me, there are three kinds of video game film. The good (Resident Evil), the ones that are bad but funny (Wing Commander, Double Dragon), and then there is the kind that Silent Hill are. So excruciatingly boring that they make one feel like time has come to a complete stop. Einstein's theory of relativity is proved here, because having a modeling file poked into my urethra for two hours would seem to take less time than would watching Silent Hill once more. Maddox once wrote of Daredevil that the two most important characters, Transition and Cohesion, were missing. These characters are almost all that Silent Hill has, with Motivation, Background, or Investment sitting somewhere backstage with their fists stuck in varying orifices.From what I could discern, the plot revolves around an adopted daughter whose constant fits of sleepwalking and cries about a place called Silent Hill drive a woman to take the girl to the town she has been moaning about in a strangely coherent manner. Shortly after arriving there, we are given the impression that these two have somehow entered a parallel dimension in which strange demonic creatures roam the night, and the town is somehow deserted save for a group of cultists during the day. None of the mechanics of the situation are explained to us. Whereas Resident Evil was kind enough to inform us from the get-go that it would be concerned with an evil conglomerate that funds its aggressive incursion into the free market with secret biological warfare research, Silent Hill expects us to piece together the background for ourselves. The problem here is that unless you have played the video game on which the film is based, you are going to have a very hard time understanding the how or why. For two solid hours I waited in vain for something to explain the situation.What makes it even worse is that when the film does stoop to explaining what on Earth has been going on for the last couple of hours, no real answer is provided. We hear how a girl has been burned to death by some incredibly sick people and that she somehow disrupts the entire spiritual balance of the town around her so that it is sucked into the tenth level of hell. No word, however, is given on what mechanics allow her to accomplish this. It is literally as if the director chose to cut out every scene or piece of dialogue that would allow the story to make any kind of sense. No explanation is offered as to what the various creatures of the Hill are, either. Often, their powers or abilities are displayed only for plot convenience, or because the director thought they might look cool. Look, maybe I am going about this the wrong way, so I will ask you a question about building in order to get my point across. If you build a flash-looking brick house that has three layers of brick all forming an outer wall that little can break through, yet build the foundations out of cardboard, do you expect the house to stand up? What makes it even worse is that a great cast is wasted upon this abortion. Radha Mitchell, I was against from the get-go for her part in Mozart And The Whale, another piece of garbage written by a screenwriter who simply cannot write. Sean Bean is so grossly underused that you could literally blink at the right times and miss most of his scenes. Deborah Kara Unger and Alice Krige could have made great foils, but the script does not allow their characters a semblance of nuance. Their performances seem phoned in because their characters are cardboard cutouts. Laurie Holden does the best she can with the role of a policewoman, but she ends up bearing the brunt of the nonexistent foundation. Her character has no real motivation to follow our hero and her daughter up the road, and even less to join our hero on what would undoubtedly seem like delusion. None of the characters behave like real people, even when they have all sorts of convincing plot reasons to do so.All this could have been forgiven, but Silent Hill also suffers from having half an hour worth of plot stretched to a length just north of two hours. The Twilight Zone used to wrap up this kind of plot in around forty minutes or so. I swear, if I had seen that same shot with a silhouetted girl running away from the hero one more time, I was going to burn down the cinema in protest. Speaking of protest, I thought it was a rule in cinema that when you have a vague or symbolic ending, you do something beforehand to explain what your symbology means, or give your audience a clue to react to when the credits roll. Which brings me to summarising what Silent Hill is. Just as Jennifer Lynch tried to confuse us into acquittal with Boxing Helena, Christophe Gans tries the same trick with Silent Hill. Just as Lynch failed, so too does Gans, although the real failure in this case comes from Gans' laziness. It becomes incredibly obvious after thirty minutes that he just did not give a crap about this project.For that reason, I am giving Silent Hill a two out of ten. I have seen plenty of bad films made out of video games, but this is the first I can officially call boring.",2,2,5,5 September 2006
Snatch," Ritchie shows up Tarantino once again...
","Funny and entertaining from start to finish, Snatch once again shows that an American who can't stop verbally masturbating is no match for an Englishman who doesn't take himself so damned seriously. Just as an indicator of how good the script in Snatch is, it convinced Brad Pitt to do the film for much less than his normal tens-of-millions fee, something you never see in Hollywood these days.Brad Pitt also manages to convince the audience that he is a far better actor than anyone who has appeared in a Tarantino film. Just seeing him put on a 'pikey' accent less than a year after taking on one of 1999's most difficult roles in Fight Club has definitely changed my mind about his acting skills. This man could really go places if he keeps it up. Jason Statham and the rest of the Lock-Stock-Gang put in riveting performances as boxing promoters or pikeys, and Vinnie Jones is his usual thuggish self. However, unlike certain other films in which actors play thugs, these actors are convincing. How many of the actors in Reservoir Dogs have ever even strode onto a football field, leave alone been sent off as many times as Vinnie?Alan Ford also demonstrates another thing Ritchie's films have over those of Tarantino: subtlety. Compare the scene in which Ford's character explains his position in the underworld to the jewellery store men with anything Tarantino has put on screen of a similar nature and you'll see what I mean. This sequence is funny, driving, and straight to the point with full convincingness.All in all, I give Snatch ten out of ten just for being a REAL gangster film.",Null,1,2,21 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Underrated...
","By 1983, the market had become so saturated with Star Wars and science fiction clones that programs were beginning to fail left and right. Even the mighty Doctor Who was faltering under the weight of its own canon, and new ideas had become thin on the ground. Many people criticise Return Of The Jedi as suffering from creative burnout, or Lucas getting too offended that the best film in his series has been the one he had the least amount of control over. There's a certain level of truth to this theory, but when you strip back the Hollywood politics and look at the story, you simply see Lucas being Lucas.At its heart, Return Of The Jedi is the story of one boy who has (finally) grown into a man, and started to face his destiny. He starts off in this by demonstrating that he has mastered one aspect of the Force, in that he can reliably use its powers to his advantage. After doing so, he is told by one of his old mentors that he is just about to face the real test of resisting the temptation to use it in an overtly evil fashion. It's painfully oversimple at times, and sadly indicative of Lucas' tendency to see everything in black and white, but it works.What makes it work is not Lucas' creative direction, but rather the input of others. The climactic phase of the duel on the new Death Star is a perfect example of this. Here, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Mark Hamill, John Williams, and Richard Marquand all band together to deliver a performance that, in 1983, had every audience member holding their hands over their mouths in sheer tense panic at what they thought was happening. When it twists and turns back and forth to its climax, the surprise factor is enough to make the audience forget that it really is clichéd to an extreme. In other words, it works.It also highlights one thing that Lucas seems to have forgotten in the past twenty-two years. Namely that in any film, regardless of its theme, the human performance element is always the most important. In contrast to later films, the majority of what the viewer sees here was built on a set and could be interacted with in front of the camera while the film was being shot. In simpler language, the performances have more impact because the actors aren't struggling to plant themselves in the reality of a scene where they are almost the only things on the set.Another area where Return Of The Jedi excels is its sense of humour. The numerous booby traps and improvised war machines improvised by the Ewoks deliver some well-timed laughs. Peter Mayhew must have been glad at this time to not be the only person on the shoot who had to struggle with being covered head to foot in fur, too. Matter of fact, it seems the entire cast is more relaxed this time around.If there is one problem with the film, it is that dialogue which would have helped the human element of the story to some degree has mostly been left out. Questions like what Yoda would think of his last student going on such a major rampage against an admittedly despicable crime figure, for instance, are never answered.Delving for a minute into another slight problem, the special edition 'improvements' were just a bit unnecessary. One has to wonder what the crew who invested countless hours into making the puppetry work for the musical number in Jabba's palace thought of the new number. Putting aside the annoying performers for a second, the number they chose is really awful. It seems we are going to have two competing visions of the future, music-wise. Lucas appears to support the Backstreet Boys version. Seriously, the number in the palace is so clichéd and predictable you can predict every repeated line without having heard the song before. Give me Basil and Zoë Poledouris' number in StarShip Troopers, any day.Overall, however, I felt Return Of The Jedi was worthy of nine out of ten. It was a slight improvement over A New Hope, and a slight letdown after The Empire Strikes Back. However, even compared independently of the prequels, it is a fun ride that involves a little higher thought on the part of the viewer, which is always a good thing.",9,0,0,27 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," It's hard to know where one stands on this film...
","Back in 1983, Star Wars was the hottest thing that had come out of Hollywood. Ever. Children were lining up in droves to get their hands on the toys (which were actually well-made in those days) and adults were either lining up with the children, or buying tickets to see the film. Repeatedly.Sadly, it didn't take film studios long to realise after this film had finished its theatrical run that merchandising, not ticket sales, was where the real money could be made. This fact is quite wittily referenced in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs, but today, we have really bad films with childish merchandising like Harry Potty, or really great films on which some mediocre merchandising is based, such as The Lord Of The Rings. Or really mediocre films on which good merchandising is based, such as Tomb Raider.After The Empire Strikes Back was mostly done without George Lucas' creative input, he threw a tantrum and basically promised the world that he'd never let go of creative control again. A real tragedy, I am sure you'll agree. While Lucas was still vaguely aware of his creative deficiencies, and he hived off the direction and writing tasks, he just had to slip more merchandising tie-ins for the benefit of the audience, and his wallet.Most of these merchandising tie-ins weren't too bad, however. The Ewoks made for good symbolism, with an evil, technologically advanced empire being defeated by midget teddy bears who have only the forces of nature (and the Rebellion) on their side. The creatures in Jabba's palace were an example of Lucas at his most outrageous, but the Special Edition of 1997 turned them into a farce. However, what I really craved at the time, and I still do, is a proper scale replica of the Super Star Destroyer. Sure, the cost would have been horrendous, but it would be worth it.The conclusion of the whole Skywalker saga is surprisingly effective, if a little sappy in places. The motivations and the acting are done well, but some of the dialogue is utterly appalling. Half the time, I didn't know whether there was going to be a lightsaber battle or a Blues-Brothers style Christian revival meeting. All they needed was for James Brown to come out from behind the Emperor's throne and all would be lost in a sea of madness.One area where the Special Edition is an improvement, however, is the celebration scenes after the end of the battle. With the Emperor dead and the entire galaxy liberated, the original theatrical release just got plain silly. Many overzealous fans have claimed that the lyrics of the original finale music translate into something like 'Have some droppings, bad actors, but please pull the burrs out of my butt fur'. Seeing the revelry in all the places we've visited in the previous two films, as well as Coruscant, makes for a far more satisfying conclusion by comparison.Okay, it's not a perfect film, but at least in 1983, George didn't insist on complete control over the films, and that is exactly where the new episodes are going wrong. Sure, the special effects are a thousand times better and the lightsaber duels make those of the earlier three films look like old men hitting each other with their canes by comparison, but at least they managed to make us care about the characters in this effort.",9,1,2,14 April 2003
Scary Movie 2," Hollywood sinks to a new low...
","First they give Jim Carrey something other than a mop job, then they let the Farrelly Brothers make a film that isn't a documentary about the use of pooper scoopers, then they give the Wayans Brothers a budget to work with. Will the people in charge of the green light at Hollywood ever learn?It's ironic, really, that people from In Living Colour actually have careers some ten to twelve years after the show was cancelled. I don't know what Jim Carrey did on that show to convince anyone that he should get money for anything other than being severely brain damaged, but after Scary Movie 2, he seems like the lesser of two evils. Which is also ironic considering that the original Scary Movie was actually quite funny in places. Maybe this is a call for more editors and script doctors to be employed in Hollywood?I won't get into critiquing all of the points in this film that others have already bashed to death. It's just a waste of time. What I will do is go over a few things that I found ridiculously wrong with the film. First of all, basing the majority of a film around a similar setting or premise to The Haunting is only going to get you in trouble. The actual film was an unmitigated disaster, even when Owen Wilson got his head chopped off, so trying to satirise it in any way, shape, or form is a bad idea - it satirised itself very effectively.Secondly, when you're choosing source materials or directors to satirise, it is generally a good idea not to pick someone who is obviously at least twice as intelligent as you are (although that could mean billions of people for the Wayans brothers). I am, of corse, referring to the utterly pathetic and childish attempts to satirise Hollow Man. Whereas the original made a good, satirical swipe at the empty morality of the New Testament, as well as provided a good story about a generally decent guy gone power-mad, the satire here was obviously conceived and executed with no idea whatsoever as to what the film was about. This is hardly surprising since, in a Christian-dominated society such as America, hardly anyone is going to properly understand what Hollow Man was about, but trying to match wits with one of Western Europe and Hollywood's most ingenious political satirists with a string of fart/body fluid/stoner gags is like trying to take on the entire American armed forces with a .22 - it just ain't going to work.Lastly, while the America-centric humour of a lot of the gags in Scary Movie was countered by the possibility of seeing the original commercials or films, the former being shown on a 'greatest commercials' show ('Whazzup!' is actually an ad for Budweiser beer for all those people from the antipodes who don't watch 'greatest commercials' shows), it falls flat in Scary Movie 2. The attempt to satirise the Nike ad was cut down in flames here by the fact that NOBODY had seen the commercial in this country. The fact that the satire was about as funny as a basketball match didn't help very much, either. Even though I like to think I am more cultured than most of my peers, I am also stumped on what the hell that gag involving Shorty's 'brain' was about.So to sum up, Scary Movie 2 is an unfunny film written by a bunch of juvenile dipsticks, much like the original, but this time nobody thought to edit the script and bring some semblance of humour into the film. 'What the hell,' thought the studio execs. 'We'll just print this crap up and show it on the screen - the kids will love it.' Well, sorry, Dimension, but adolescents are generally far more intelligent than films like this one give them credit for, and most adults like myself outgrew this sort of drivel so long ago that we can hardly remember when it happened.",Null,3,6,14 September 2002
Pan's Labyrinth," Not the best film of 2006 by a long shot, but so close...
","It seems ironic that the films considered by many to be the best films of the previous year are both set in an episode of history long since past, but should never be forgotten. El Laberinto Del Fauno only misses out on being the best film of 2006 because Zwartboek took so awfully long to enter production, but its virtues exceed its faults by such a long way that it will always be a benchmark in storytelling. When I say it is based to a great degree on ancient fairy tales such as those written by the Grimm Brothers, it would be all too easy to mistake El Laberinto Del Fauno for being aimed at children. And that would be selling it oh so very short. Like all of the fairy tales that have been bastardised into something puerile by Disney, El Laberinto Del Fauno is a story that every adult should learn from. Children will be frightened and saddened by it, but intelligent or hyperlexic children (or both, such as I was), will get far more out of it than the G-rated tosh that they seem to expect intelligent children to enjoy nowadays.Set in a remote farm outpost in Spain during the Civil War, a forgotten episode in what is indisputably the darkest days of the twentieth century, El Laberinto Del Fauno concerns itself with one extremely dysfunctional family. The mother has just married a Captain of the Spanish army, an incredibly evil man who is without redeeming feature. It is amazing to see another film in the vein of RoboCop, Total Recall, or Zwartboek where the true villain of the piece is so unremittingly evil that one is unafraid to hate his guts for the film's duration. It makes the payoff at the end of the film that much more satisfying. The torments and injuries the Captain endures through the course of the film are gruesome enough, but we are allowed the luxury of believing he deserves every bit of it. As a nemesis for his stepdaughter, the Captain is one of the best-drawn middlemen of evil since Darth Vader. Yet, in spite of how he can gouge a man's eyes out without pausing for breath, he is by no means the most frightening thing in the film.El Laberinto Del Fauno, as you would expect with a film bearing such a title, is entirely in Spanish. This obviously necessitated the use of subtitles to translate the dialogue in countries where Spanish is not the primary language, but the nuances of the language would also make dubbing a crime. Even if you do not understand the phrases being spoken, their enunciations make the intent in every sentence plainly obvious. El Laberinto Del Fauno moves and plays like a silent film, where the combinations of body language and music allow the viewer to draw their own conclusion regarding the scene. One could even treat scenes like the Captain conducting his torture sessions as being a comedy if that is their inclination. Quite frankly, I feel it is a sick one, but that is the viewer's prerogative. To be quite frank, scenes in which participants torture one another have a much better aural quality to them when the dialogue is in Spanish. As a result, El Laberinto Del Fauno is the only film I have seen to date, other than Paul Verhoeven's Dutch-language efforts, that I feel uncomfortable watching at times.Special mention must go to the special effects team who, for one reason or another, chose to make the film using practical effects for what amounts to a majority of the screen time. CGI seems to have been limited to such tasks as painting out an actor's real legs or other such fine details that could not otherwise have been accomplished. The faun is such a marvel of practical costume design, puppetry, and digital erasure that one wonders if the whole team did not suddenly become possessed by the ghost of Jim Henson. However, unlike Ludo, Kermit, or Animal, the production team in this case has mastered the one emotion that Henson was never able to invoke in an adult audience: fear. Yes, even this grown man who continues to stand in horror as the realisation dawns that we have not learned a thing from the time this film is set in feels a shudder of genuine fear when the faun appears to lose his patience with Ofelia. Perhaps it has something to do with the complexity of the character.If you have not already seen the film, I advise skipping this paragraph, but it is necessary to discuss the final moments in order to illustrate a point. I must also praise the writers for the maturity and power of their story. The ambiguous nature of how the ending is phrased can lead the viewer to entirely different conclusions. If they choose, they can believe the princess was rewarded for her willingness to shed her own blood in place of her half-brother's. Conversely, they may also choose to believe the reward was little more than a dying hope on the behalf of yet another victim of a senseless war. Either way, praise is due to writer/director Guillermo del Toro for refusing to take the easy way out and simply throw a clearly happy ending into the audience's lap in order to appease them. This is a bold move that Peter Jackson especially fumbled by failing to execute in a satisfactory fashion. And that is partly the point. In spite of not being based on one of the most celebrated novels in the English language, El Laberinto Del Fauno will be remembered long after The Lord Of The Rings In Name Only is forgotten.El Laberinto Del Fauno is a ten out of ten film that everyone, but especially those with an interest in storytelling, should see at least twice.",10,8,15,18 August 2007
Alien," A study in coupling primal terror with a slow, languid pace
","In the wake of Star Wars' release some two years previous, science fiction films, dramas set in a science fiction world, or action films set in a science fiction world, became all the rage, so to speak. The idea of a horror film in a science fiction setting was somewhat more obscure, but that doesn't mean it wasn't under the spotlight. As a result, there was a wide audience for Alien, and the methods used to make it in particular were under great scrutiny even before shooting began.The first hour or so of the film sets up the Human protagonists. As I have said in my comments about the third film in this franchise, you could almost title this film Human, because in the end, it is the hostility with which the Human characters interact that becomes their doom, metaphorically speaking. It is also interesting to note that of the four Alien films to star Sigourney Weaver, this is the only one where she does not receive top billing. In fact, Tom Skerritt gets this rather auspicious honour in spite of the fact that he is more or less written out about halfway through the running time.Speaking of which, I am going to restrict my comments to the original theatrical release of the film. While the director's cut follows the usual Ridley Scott curiosity of a director's cut being shorter than the theatrical release (at least if the IMDb is to be believed), I have yet to see it in spite of some of the negatives I have heard about it. Scott is also on record as saying that he prefers the theatrical version, making one wonder at how the minds of Fox marketing work.It is not until about halfway through the film that we get to see the titular antagonist, and boy what a sight it is. Unlike the sequels, in which the Aliens often move about so rapidly that it is hard to make out the details, the Alien portrayed by Bolaji Badejo or Eddie Powell, depending on the danger factor of how the Alien is meant to move, takes its sweet time to move anywhere. There's a few possible explanations for this. Either this particular Alien is meant to be some kind of drone, or it takes on the characteristics of the animal it came from (the Human from which the Alien is 'birthed' is established as being a bit 'slow'). Then again, perhaps Scott realised that with all the work H.R. Giger put into the level of detail, it was a good idea to show it off. Another factor is that the Alien here is not facing a group of professional soldiers or mercenaries, and knows it can take its sweet time.After much thought and debate, I gave Alien an eight out of ten. There are moments when the languid pace counts against it, although they are few in number, and Veronica Cartwright really fits the role of the protagonist you look forward to seeing killed. In spite of those factors, Alien really gives the viewer something to leap out of their chair to. As such, it will stand as a relic of a time just before Hollywood bought into the 'dumbest buy the mostest' mentality.",8,1,3,20 December 2004
Full Metal Jacket," You people have got to be kidding...
","Sorry, guys, but this is numero uno for the single worst war flick ever made. Based on Gustav Hasford's classic semi-autobiographical novel The Short Timers, Kubrick's film version fails to get half the detail on screen. In spite of the fact that the novel is about 180 pages in length and mostly consists of expletives. The entire third act of the novel is missing, as are the death of Rafter Man (probably one of the most gruesome parts of the novel) and Joker's promotion to Sergeant.The fact that this abortion of a film has been voted into the top 250, and is being described as 'the best' by so many IMDB users pretty much invalidates the entire concept of the IMDB. If you want a great film about war, go and see The Bridge On The River Kwai or Three Kings instead. This film is a sad joke that insults everyone who has read its source material. The greatest trick Kubrick ever pulled was convincing anyone that he had directed a masterpiece here.On a positive note, however, Lee Ermey puts in a great performance with the material he had to work with. Even though the best sequence of the book that involved his character was, not surprisingly, left out of this film, he grabs hold of the role and rides it like there's no tomorrow. Such a pity that the rest of the cast have no idea what to do with their lines, and the director couldn't make a decent film out of his source material if he even tried. This is easily the single most overrated blot on the history of Hollywood to date, although The Matrix gives it a good run for its money.",1,35,89,10 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This film takes 130+ minutes to say what Black Sabbath said in less than six with Iron Man...
","I have one scenario in my mind that explains how George Lucas came up with the idea for this film. I can just picture him sitting in his office, trying to come up with the inspiration to write a 'darker, less happy-meal-friendly' Star Wars. Since he didn't do most of the writing on The Empire Strikes Back, this would be a harder task for him than one might believe.So one day, Rick McCallum hands him a copy of Black Sabbath's second album, Paranoid. Through the first three songs, Lucas has no idea what to make of it until song number four starts blaring out of the speakers - a poetic and guitar-riff masterpiece called Iron Man. Obviously, Lucas was so blown away by this song that he copied the concept and story described in the lyrics into his script. There is not a single idea in either prequel so far that hasn't been used as the basis for a song by at least Black Sabbath or half a dozen of the literally thousands of true doom metal bands that follow in their footsteps. No, not the poseurs like Slipknot or the likes of Rob Zombie, I mean the real thing such as Cathedral or Electric Wizard.Of course, Lucas wasn't totally out to lunch when he made The Phantom Menace. There was one sequence in the original story treatment in which young Anakin finds a Tusken Raider who has been wounded in battle or transit, whom he sits with and tries to help until the Tusken's clansmen come back to reclaim him. Including this scene in Episode I would have made the scene in Episode II where Anakin kills an entire colony of Tusken Raiders without pity or judgement all the more ironic (something that the film could have used, in fact), but at the same time, it would have made the idea that Lucas was listening too hard when Ozzy Osbourne sang the words '...kills the people he once saved...' a little obvious to those who haven't been totally hypontised by eMpTyV.Another area where Lucas errs is all this crap about a 'prophecy' that Anakin is supposed to fulfil. The Jedi treat Anakin as if he is some kind of commodity, despite the fact that he has lived a large portion of his life as a slave and had none of the emotional comforts that most human beings should be allowed to take for granted. Not only that, but the apparent rules of the Jedi organisation completely and utterly contradict normal, healthy human behaviour. Whereas the Force and its users seemed more like a spiritual connection to the life of the universe and those who were in touch with it during the other three films, the Jedi order has so far been made out to be more like a violent offshoot of the death cult which has begun threatening democracy in America during the prequels. At least they are timely.It is hard, therefore, for the educated, enlightened, thinking audience to give so much as a rat's about the idea that the Jedi will almost all be killed in the forthcoming episode. Just as I wouldn't give a damn if Pat Robertson or Kenneth Copeland were used as target practise by a mob of stormtroopers, I could not give a damn what happens to these high and mighty hypocrites.It's hard to say where I stand on the romance subplot. On the one hand, I can understand why Anakin and Padmé are so awkward with one another. They've already been through so much together that any feeling they have towards each other is going to be to their emotions what a small dose of pure, hospital-grade Morphine is to the average human's sense of pain. On the other hand, making out like they've had no contact with other human beings of the opposite sex beyond what is permissible in a G-rated film (ironically, this is the first of Lucas' Star Wars saga to be rated above a PG in Australia) is a big, big mistake. Any human being above the age of 13 is going to find this just too unbelievable. And then Lucas commits the ultimate blunder - giving us no reason to believe that a strong, powerful woman like Padmé would fall in love with a whiny brat like Anakin. There ARE ways to display extreme negative emotions (which are a natural part of life, contrary to what the saga's mythos will tell you) without whining.Barney, the purple dinosaur, would understand this update of the saga very well. He has said in many an episode that his wards are not good unless they have good feelings - if you substitute that for some of the dialogue in Episodes II, V, and VI, the story would make just as much sense. Lucas also seems to be into showing 19 year olds as having the same emotional and intellectual responses as nine year olds. Another Barney trademark. About the only time the level of this film is raised to something vaguely adult is when Christopher Lee is on the screen. Like Liam Neeson, he always manages to raise the standard of the film he is on a notch or three, and it is during the duel(s) with Obi-Wan and Anakin (plus the battle leading up to them) that this film manages to become at least partly satisfying on an intellectual level. The duel with Yoda spoils it slightly, with the attempt to show that training Jedi for 800+ years does make you a better fencer getting way too cartoonish and clumsy for its own good. However, the closing scenes with the clone army (by the way, why is it so trendy to portray a technology that could rid us of things like cancer for good in such a bad light?) and Anakin's wedding set a tone that should have been kept up during the entire film. It's as if in those closing moments, someone remembered what made Episodes V and VI so damned interesting.To cut a very long story short, this is nowhere near as good as the people who say this is one of the better episodes would like you to believe, but it does constitute a valiant effort to deliver a more adult science fiction story, something that Lucas should know by now that he is incapable of. Overall, this episode gets a 5 out of 10 from me, and three of those points are for Christopher Lee. The climax of the film was great (if a little sloppy at times), it's the rest of it that is the problem.",5,2,5,14 April 2003
Corpse Bride," Burton returns to what makes him work best...
","In a nutshell, Burton works best when he is at his mildly weirdest. For all seventy-four minutes of The Corpse Bride, we get the Tim Burton who made such gems as Ed Wood or Beetlejuice, as opposed to the Tim Burton who made such unmemorable pieces as the 2002 Planet Of The Apes or Big Fish. In essence, The Corpse Bride is Burton simply being Burton, rather than a big studio filtering Burton through their lens. It is far from perfect, but it is a charming little piece that is really on fire when it works. Much like Ed Wood, Burton brings back a core cast to provide voices for his stop-motion creatures. Some of the voices, such as Tracey Ullman or Jane Horrocks, hardly have any distinction. Others, such as Christopher Lee and Johnny Depp, remind you why Burton chose to work with them in the first place. In fact, it is Christopher Lee's voice acting that steals the show during most of this piece. When his ridiculously-shaped character is present, one almost salivates in anticipation of his next statement. For certain, this is one of Tim Burton's most satisfying creations.The stop-motion animation is also brilliant, although one has to wonder if the painstaking work done to achieve it was worth the result. Sure, these puppets move so subtly that one could mistake them for real actors if not for their ridiculous body shapes. Observant viewers will note the use of stop-motion legend Ray Harryhausen's name on a piano, but I think that Harryhausen would look at this piece and wonder if maybe just a little too much effort is involved. On the other hand, compared to the so-called ultra-realistic effects of such films as the recent Star Wars episodes or Final Fantasy, perhaps the obvious fakery combined with the smooth and strangely lifelike motion has its own peculiar charm. In that sense, Burton's greatest charm, his ability to mix the absurd and unreal with a grounding in reality, is what makes The Corpse Bride work. The film is a delight to look at, one more than just one level. The attention to detail in the backgrounds of some scenes alone is breathtaking.Sadly, the weakness of The Corpse Bride is in its soundtrack, and to some extent its story. I do not know whether this was partly the fault of the theatre I saw it in, which gets worse every week, but critical moments such as when we learn how the Corpse Bride became a corpse in the first place were almost indecipherable. Were it not for an exceedingly obvious plot and some pre-release hype, I would have had no idea exactly what drives the Bride to so doggedly pursue Depp's character. The Van Dorts and the Everglots are about as deep as a puddle, and Barkis Bittern only exists to give the audience something to sneer at. Fortunately, Burton is also wise enough to give this character the send-off that he anticipated the entire audience would be chanting for by the time the film finished. But aside from Victor Van Dort and the Corpse Bride, we know about as much about every single character in the story by the end of the film as we did at the beginning. It is this absence of dimensions that scuttled both Planet Of The Apes and to a large extent Sleepy Hollow.However, if Tim Burton manages to control his propensity to create shallow characters, he could potentially reach even greater heights than his biopic of Ed Wood. His scene composition and design are beyond reproach. He must also be given credit for occasionally turning to the kind of subject matter that Hollywood would not normally dare touch. It is he who gave us back a Batman who gave a reason for doing what he does other than the opportunity to nance around in a funny suit, after all. Helena Bonham Carter should also be reminded that this is easily her most non-mainstream role since Fight Club, and not coincidentally, also her best. Johnny Depp proves that apart from providing a distinctive or memorable leading man (he doesn't here), he can also be depended upon to put in a solid performance. Anyone who is familiar with Burton's dramatic leanings will have no trouble guessing who Victor Van Dort is meant to be a proxy for. That Depp restrains his urge to make his presence felt in order to fit the wider dramatic picture is a true credit to him. And the animators, of course.Out of ten, I gave The Corpse Bride an eight. It is not Burton's best work, nor is it the most compelling film I have ever seen. What it is, on the other hand, is a walk through the imagination of a non-standard man that manages to be entertaining and charming as it is also puzzling. And I know I will not be the only one to say that Hollywood needs to make more of those films.",8,4,5,20 December 2005
The Godfather: Part II," I prefer the first film, but this compares well
","The Godfather, Part II is one of the most revered sequels of all time, if not the most. While I prefer the original for a few reasons, this sequel is not without more than its fair share of merits. However, it also has one or two flaws that, if I am going to be fair, I have to mention. Since they will take up the least amount of space in my comments, I'll get them out of the way first. The first flaw, in my opinion, is a jumping sense of focus. As the story goes from one part of America to Cuba to Sicily to another part of America, one can get a little giddy with the to and fro. The other problem is that when the screenplay doesn't follow Mario Puzo's original writings, it doesn't quite work. The big conspiracy with a Jewish smuggler and unnamed Italian rivals in the New York or Nevada underworlds doesn't quite seem to gel. Both stories, the historical story of Vito Corleone and the present-day story of Michael's decline, really needed three hours of their own. It is interesting to note that of all the deleted footage that went into the Godfather Legacy miniseries, the majority came from this film.The acting from all concerned is top-notch, especially from Al Pacino, who sells himself beautifully as the dangerous head of a mafia family in spite of needing to be on platforms to appear at the same height as many of his castmates. Robert Duvall gives a workman-like performance, but he has little to do here other than act out the part of the ever-loyal brother. I think the fact that he was almost irrelevant to the storyline here has a lot to do with Duvall's refusal to join the cast of the third film. The real surprise here is John Cazale, who fleshes out Fredo Corleone far beyond anything in either the first film or the novel. It is unsurprising that all of the films Cazale has been in have been nominated for Best Picture. He portrays the rejected brother who just wants what he feels is his fair share with an uncanny grace. But these are just the highlights. The entire cast give top-notch performances, even the extras who appear for less than ten seconds.The best thing about a Godfather film is how it builds a simple story of a family who, whether they wanted it or not, happen to be in the business of organised crime. The bloodshed of this film, much as was the case in the original, is secondary to the simple premise that these are ordinary people in an extraordinary position. Francis Ford Coppola has previously stated that he saw The Godfather as a (relatively) modern King Lear, and that style is kept up in the sequel. Michael is in essence the new King of the realm, but he learns the hard way that the more he tries to tighten his grip upon what is his, or what is loyal to him, the more it slips away. This is the film in which we learn why this is not what Vito Corleone wanted for his youngest son. Sadly, fate has a way of getting in the path of our best intentions, and nowhere is this more evident than in Diane Keaton's dialogue. Some of her speech to Al Pacino really sounds like it was either written at the last moment, or by someone who didn't have a whole lot of experience in writing films.Like the other Godfather films, the most satisfying moments are when the opponents of the Corleone family get their hash settled in a big way. The montage shown in Part II is not as graphic as that of the original, but it brings the whole thing to a satisfying climax. Lee Strasberg's speech to the press after his character being deported from Israel is priceless, as is the manner in which it ends. Unfortunately, the etiquette that dictates I cannot reveal what happens at the end of the film means I cannot tell you anything about the most satisfying death in the film. Being one of the most debated and criticised scenes among Godfather fans, I am fairly certain that anyone with an interest in the film is going to hear about it elsewhere anyway. In spite of the fact that it, and the necessary lead-up, takes up most of the second half of Michael's plot segment, it will leave many a viewer stunned. But that is one of the things that detracts slightly from this cinematic tour de force. With the screen time so sharply divided between two stories, sometimes the linking between plot points seems to fall by the wayside.I gave The Godfather, Part II a nine out of ten. In contrast to the original, I noticed the passage of time on a few occasions in its two hundred minutes. Still, if you're out to see a good drama, and you've already enjoyed the first Godfather, then this is worth a couple of viewings. If every director adaptating the writings of others into a film format took as much care as Francis Ford Coppola had here, then the world would be a better place.",9,3,5,8 May 2005
Predator," What a pile of...
","First of all, Predator is NOT Ah-nuld's best film, not by a long stretch of the imagination. That honour belongs to Total Recall, one of the few Ah-nuld films that can be described as intelligent. In fact, Predator is one of Ah-nuld's most ordinary films, especially in light of the comparison between he and his co-stars' macho posing in this film and the real actors in the sequel.There is one highlight of the acting in this film - Carl Weathers. His acting raises the bar above pantomime during the sequences he is in, but the story and character development don't give him a lot to work with. Granted, this is supposed to be an action film, but the best action films develop their characters to some extent during their running time. The recent X-Men feature is a great example of this.What's even more appalling is that actors from this film are winning positions in America's government. I thought they learned the lesson from when Ronald Reagan became president - actors do not make good leaders. Macho posturing worked in the film industry of the 1980s, but it is not what I'd like to see in government at any era.Unfortunately, as time goes on, it gets less and less kind to this film. Ah-nuld's track record has certainly gotten worse in the last ten years, with him obviously forgetting that people don't go the theatre in order to have some right-wing Fundie agenda pushed at them (eg End Of Days and The Sixth Day). None of the other actors have done anything memorable since, and it's probably just as well.All in all, I'm giving Predator 3 out of 10. It's entertaining to watch once or twice, but that's about the extent of it.",3,8,54,1 April 2002
American Pie," I guess it is funnier if you're American...
","By 'American', of course, I mean your attitude towards sex and sexuality is more tightly wound up than that of Fred Nile or Pat Robertson. It would be much easier to relate to this film under those circumstances than say, if you and your girlfriend were having threesomes with her best friend once a month by the time you were seventeen. It's a little harder to sympathise with the characters of this film if you happen to fit that profile.The saving grace of the film, of course, is the characters. In spite of them being pulled from something Pat Robertson might have read as a boy, they are genuinely sympathetic and easy to relate to. The dialogue during the prom lifts this film out from under the weight of gutter humour and gives it some kind of moral. There was definitely a sense of closure to the end of the film, rather than the usual disbelief that marred the sex comedies of the eighties. I guess this comes from the fact that the characters seemed to have genuinely matured and changed as a result of their experiences, rather than remained idiots.All in all, a genuinely enjoyable film with well-written, genuinely likeable characters who, in spite for their Americanisation, have shades in them that everyone can recognise. Now all we need is a film that combines the premise of this film with a more Fight Club sort of mentality. Maybe I should get around to writing that autobiography...",Null,1,2,12 August 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Having just seen it for the fifth time in three days...
","...I thought I would embellish upon my earlier comments, because there is just no way to describe the perfection contained within this film. Ever since I was a boy and had just finished reading The Lord Of The Rings, I searched high and low for other places where respect would be paid to my intelligence. Through years of having to call teachers nasty names in Spanish or just being basically disappointed, my faith in the human race has been at an all-time low, much like Elrond's is in this film. However, from seeing the love and care Peter Jackson has poured into each and every frame of this film, my faith in humanity has been somewhat restored. It is films like this, ones that show creativity and the balls to not aim for the lowest common denominator, that make me glad I live in a world filled with beings who are capable of thinking up things which do not actually exist.While Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Uruk-Hai, and Hobbits do not exist, and maybe never existed, one can easily forget this during the hundred and seventy-two minutes this film runs for (I timed it on my stopwatch). The effects and tricks that were used to make Elves like Elrond and Legolas appear two to three feet taller than the Hobbits are perfectly seamless, despite what the nay-sayers will tell you. And contrary to what a certain other nay-sayer out there has written in his comments, this film does NOT have too much fantasy mumbo-jumbo, as he puts it. Compared to the novels, in fact, the speech in this film is highly restrained. Not dumbed down for those who aren't literate enough to follow the novels, mind you, but a lot of the speech that relies on English expressions no longer in common usage is absent from the film. Whether this is a fault or a good move is something I leave to other Tolkien fans to decide.I've also changed my mind about a few things in this film. After seeing the performances of Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett a few more times, I have come to the conclusion that they were actually quite well cast. After all, Elves are meant to have an ethereal, other-worldly sort of presence about them, and these two actors captured that. I also found the scene in which the fellowship is trying to cross the mountain quite funny, as Legolas stands atop the snow while his companions are literally in it up to their neck (or over their heads in the cases of the Hobbits). This is not a goof, for those who don't understand the world of Tolkien: Elves are supposed to be exceptionally light on their feet (this is how other Elves are able to sneak up on the party without their knowledge later in the film).The battle between Gandalf and the Balrog was exceptionally rendered. This one sequence will make cinema-goers vow to never use the word 'impossible' again. The Balrog looks exceptional, almost exactly like I imagined him after reading the novel. The cave troll that appears slightly earlier is also exceptional. I can't wait for the DVD-Video version, hopefully loaded with extras that explain how they accomplished these shots. The battle sequences are exceptional, although some shots show a little too much camera wobble for my liking, but what really stands out is the dialogue. Although it is truncated, and at times quite severely so, compared to the novel, it is still brilliant and poignant almost all of the time. What little bits we do lose from the novel are not missed - it seems that everyone in Tolkien's conception of Middle Earth is a dreadful windbag, anyway.There are few films that I can watch again and again. There are even fewer that I would pay good money to see more than once in the same day, and The Fellowship Of The Ring has proven to be one of them. It was clearly a labour of love for every single person involved, and while Bashki's rotoscoped version had Tolkien rotating in his little Hobbit-hole, Tolkien would be proud of The Fellowship Of The Ring as rendered so faithfully by Peter Jackson. I urge everyone out there: see it at least twice, take your friends, take your family, take a total stranger and enlighten their imagination to a degree that very few other films can offer. It's going to be interesting next year to see what happens when Star Wars and The Two Towers lock horns for the box office dollar. My money is actually on The Two Towers after having seen Peter Jackson deliver in a big way on his cinematic promise.",10,0,1,27 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the greatest novels of all time becomes one of the greatest films of all time...
","Star Wars... The Godfather... Soldaat Van Oranje... the greatest films ever made... and now they have great company among them... The Fellowship Of The Ring joins the super-elite class of films and lays all that has tried to compete with it to rest. Chris Columbus, J.K. Rowling, Steven Kloves, Ralph Bakshi, Peter S. Beagle, and Chris Conkling can all find themselves several large holes to bury themselves in. Peter Jackson, Frances Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, take a bow! John Ronald Reuel Tolkien would be proud of this film, despite the opinion that he and many others had that The Lord Of The Rings was 'unfilmable'. Digital technology and the love of a fan who would one day grow to direct has put paid to that word.Of course, there are some liberties taken with Tolkien's masterpiece: details have been condensed, such as dialogues and some of the acts performed by various characters, and you have to expect this to a certain extent, but surprisingly less of this than you'd expect has taken place. The most obvious example of this is that Arwen Undomiel has taken on both her own and another character's role. I forget the name of the character that has been merged into her part, but I feel this was actualy a smart move, as were the rest of the condensations. The film has taken the story and made it more concise, easier to follow. However, this does not detract from the film in the slightest sense. Indeed, like running the journey of the four Hobbits parallel to the betrayal of Saruman, this keeps the story comprehensible to viewers who have read the novel and those who have not.It is clear from the prologue that explains how Bilbo Baggins managed to get the One Ring out of Gollum's hands and into the Shire that Peter Jackson has treated the novel with the love and respect that it deserves. As Gandalf, played with an uncanny accuracy by Sir Ian McKellen, rides into Hobbiton for the celebrations of Bilbo's eleventy-first birthday, with are introduced to Bilbo's nephew, Frodo. Frodo is played with an uncanny accuracy by Elijah Wood, as is Bilbo by Ian Holm. After we are introduced to Frodo's companions, all played with a certain kind of wonder, we are introduced to the brilliance of the novel in a manner that it rightly deserves.Even the very minor flaws, such as the portrayal of Arwen by Liv Tyler or the portrayal of Galadriel by Cate Blanchett, can be excused. It is very clear that Peter Jackson intended to turn the most brilliant book of all time into the most brilliant film of all time. Don't miss it.",10,0,1,25 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Shining example of what is wrong with Hollywood these days...
","The original Matrix was a Hong-Kong-cinema-derived action extravaganza with a huge special effects budget that managed to make a profit, so the makers immediately began claiming it was written as part of a trilogy. Considering that the first story was self-contained and tight on its own level in spite of being a derivative load of garbage, the first words out of my mouth were 'I don't think so'. That, in a nutshell, sums up what I had to say about the final instalment.My father, after seeing the second episode with me, told me that every single scene went on for too long. Given that this man regards Battlefield Earth as a kind of Citizen Kane, that's a pretty damning indictment. But still, the makers have to press on with this trilogy claim, hoping to squeeze a few more dollars out of the Hollywood system. And then it happens... the film they bring out is, in fact, so bad that it makes me even demand my money back rather than make me kick myself for having spent it in the first place. And I did get it back, believe me.The main problem with the film is that it makes no sense a lot of the time. And by the way, stop reading now if you give a damn about any surprises in the film. The attack upon Zion is probably the most stellar example of this. Neo finally defeats his nemesis in a manner that is oddly reflective of the way fans of the films attempt to treat those who point out the gap between what the fans make them out to be and what they really are. So with no further ado, the machines, who have no connection whatsoever to said nemesis, pack up and leave with Morpheus screaming that the 'war' is over and the people of Zion cheering.I DON'T THINK SO. Anyone who has studied warfare in which the two sides are bent on genocide of each other will know that one side will not just suddenly pack up, leave, and live peacefully on their side of the fence. The war keeps going until the last man in the other side dies, end of story. To end a war like this in the manner shown here makes not the slightest bit of sense. Not that making sense was a strong point of the so-called trilogy to begin with - the reason given for the Matrix's existence is a scientific impossibility.Continuity is also a problem here. When our beloved Agent 'absorbs' the Oracle, one is reasonably expectant that she will never be seen again, so what the hell is she doing in the final scene? Then there is the childish posturing and dialogue. Doesn't anyone else get the feeling that the Wachowski brothers went to one too many Sisters Of Mercy concerts and began to wish they could make their videos? Every shot in this film reeks of a pose. Send them back ten years and they'd be a member of Poison or something.In short, this film is trash, and everyone seems to know it except its fans. The series was trash from the very beginning, but this episode sinks to depths that not even Terminator 3 or Freddy Got Fingered could plumb. Giving it one out of ten is like giving the crippled, retarded child in the back a prize for coming last.",2,2,4,30 November 2003
The Thing," A textbook example of suspense and horror
","Much as Star Trek: Nemesis was released terminally close to The Two Towers and fell well below box office expectations, Universal chose to try and kill the then-rising star director John Carpenter's career by releasing The Thing a mere two weeks after a little feel-good piece called E.T. It is somewhat funny, the spin history can put on things, because now as a Lucas-like special edition has failed to reinvigorate interest in the family-friendly box office hit, The Thing has found a new life as a cult piece. This is not to put down Spielberg's career-building piece, as it is a well-made film in its own right. But years after I have forgotten Spielberg's effort, and dismissed it after he tried to make even more suitable only for infants, I still remember the mood it put me in, the first time I saw The Thing, and watched as the creepiest score I have heard in at least a thousand films played over elegantly understated credits. Put simply, The Thing should be shown to film-making students as an example of how you build suspense.The film starts out innocently enough, with what appears to be a husky running from a helicopter as a (lousy) sharpshooter tries to kill it. Running and flying into an American research station, the husky tries to bond with the present staff as the sharpshooter emerges and tries to warn them in broken-sounding Norwegian. As the helicopter is accidentally destroyed and the sharpshooter shot dead, the husky works its way into the confidence of the camp, eventually placed in the kennel at the insistence of one of its edgier residents. The new husky soon reveals itself to be an alien creature, not that this is any surprise to the audience. As the alien absorbs the other huskies, the men at the research centre are fortunate enough to get to it before it finishes. Whether one of them has already been absorbed before two of them pay a visit to the station the Norwegians came from is a matter of debate, but things take a definite turn for the worse when they bring back some artifacts from the site.Screenwriters like Ehren Kruger could learn a lot from The Thing. Although the scenario itself is incredibly harrowing, especially when you consider what could happen if the chameleon found its way into civilisation, its the details that make the story what it is. One of the men, considering the what could happen question, destroys every means the team has to call for help or leave, cutting them off completely. While most of the others do nothing quite so dramatic, their anatognism towards one another makes scenes that would normally be test patterns into something that may make viewers bite their nails. In contrast to the The Thing From Another World, this tension comes from the important fact that destroying the evil alien is almost secondary to identifying it. And in one of those happy coincidences, the scene where our hero does learn to identify the alien is far from the end of the tension. In point of fact, the scene in which he administers the test to identify who has been absored is unequalled in American film when it comes to tension. I still leap out of my seat in the quick shot where the 'infected' blood sample is tested.Although it is generally bad for a film to rely on its special effects, both the story and said effects are top of the line here. The Thing was the eighth film on which Rob Bottin provided special makeup effects, and is among the films cited when his godlike reputation in the field is discussed. Regardless of whether one considers makeup effects an extension of special effects or otherwise, both can be summed up as an art where the goal is to fool people into believing they are seeing something they're not. I doubt that anyone is going to believe they are seeing an alien organism of any kind until it becomes commonplace, but like the acting, writing, and music, Bottin's artwork is a wall in a tense atmosphere that dares the viewer to look away. As in all the best films that ask the viewer to accept unreal elements, The Thing does this the right way, by suspending disbelief in graduating steps. By the time the most outrageous unrealities are unleashed upon us, we have been so drawn into the world of the story that there is no going back. It never ceases to amaze me how much the filmmakers of the 1980s could get away with in terms of stretching reality compared to their present-day cousins.This would be (at least) the third of many collaborations between Kurt Russell and John Carpenter. The two never work better than when they work together. Russell has shown a number of different modes under Carpenter's direction, from the loud arrogance of Big Trouble In Little China to the hoarse understatement of Escape From New York. In The Thing, Russell starts at the latter end of his acting spectrum and ends a couple of steps toward the former. Not that Russell is the most versatile actor in the world, but this film calls for an everyday man type, and Russell more than fits the bill. The audio commentary recorded for the Laserdisc goes into the less than noble motivations the men have for being at the research station, and Russell is best among this cast at giving the viewer a character they can see the events through the eyes of. Not that the rest of the cast let the side down in any way. Everyone from Wilford Brimley to David Clennon gives their character all three dimensions, and the story benefits enourmously from it.I gave The Thing a ten out of ten. In a season of remakes for the sake of remakes, see this for an example of a remake done right.",10,5,11,28 May 2006
Pitch Black," A nice low-key science fiction
","Pitch Black was the inauspicious ramp into public consciousness for both director David Twohy and star Vin Deisel. Although nobody knew who they were before Pitch Black, nobody who paid attention during the credits would forget later. Twohy has since gone on to direct several B-level features along similar lines, whilst Vin Deisel has gone on to appear in a number of upstart action franchises, for good or ill. Indeed, one of the features planned for next year is called Hannibal. What the hell, it cannot be any worse than the last film I saw that was called Hannibal.In this rather strangely-plotted piece, Deisel portrays what appears to be a vicious criminal. It's only after we're introduced to the rest of the cast that we discover there is more than meets the eye. Once Riddick is introduced, we are given a shallow, but curiously engaging Aliens-style premise. The use of bleach bypass in order to make the desert of Coober Pedy look like an alien world was a master stroke. Indeed, Deisel aside, the real star here is the cinematography.Keith David gets an underdeveloped, underutilised turn as a Muslim cleric who, in spite of having three tenths of nothing to say, is strangely sympathetic. As tragedy befalls him, his dialogues about faith and belief with Riddick give the whole affair an ironic undertone that is strangely enjoyable in spite of being at times a little too confronting. Don't bother looking for other big names in this feature, however. I think they must have pillaged every location they shot in to find people who will play the (very) minor characters. Their artificiality makes it clear that they are from the Antipodes, and they won't be working in much else any time soon.According to the trivia entries, Pitch Black was shot in the same desert as Mad Max. This doesn't seem right, given that Mad Max was short in locations to the North of Melbourne. Mad Max 2 was shot in a place called Broken Hill, a bit of a ways away from Coober Pedy. In fact, no Mad Max film has ever shot in a Queensland location, and the only possibility would be Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome being shot in Coober Pedy, which still makes this statement a little inaccurate (apparently more shooting on Mad Max 3 took place in New South Wales than South Australia, where Coober Pedy is).Nonetheless, this film shows a clear reason why many productions are going to Australia rather than shooting in America or England. For one thing, in spite of all the horrid things I say about them, when an Australian in the film industry tells you they're going to keep quiet about your production, they mean it. George Lucas shifted production of his last and about-to-be-released Star Wars films to Australia for this very reason.Another advantage of working in Australia, locations notwithstanding, is efficiency. An Australian crew can be trusted to get things done without delays or labour disputes, provided you don't abuse them. That shooting Pitch Black only took sixty days should convince one of this fact when they consider that films like this can often take twice as long. The film's estimated budget of a mere twenty-three million is also a mild shock when the opposed impressions of the shooting location and the strangely elaborate special effects are taken into account.I gave Pitch Black a seven out of ten. It's not a classic, and it may not even be remembered in another ten years, but it is entertaining enough to watch a few times. This is an excellent example of how sometimes the smaller budgets produce better films. I'm glad I took the time to see it theatrically.",7,0,1,19 November 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Sinking as low in two hours as commercial television has in twenty-five years...
","Arnold, I am able to remember way back in your career when many saw you as just another idiotic hero who couldn't speak intelligible English, a poor man's Sylvester Stallone, some called you. But your films appealed to me as a child for their raw violence, macho bravado, and the fact that in a supposed democracy, even a man whose only outstanding attribute was his biceps could make it big.Unfortunately, you seemed to forget something around the mid-1990s, namely that your primary audience was young men who loved nothing more than the thrill of seeing how hard you could hit an enemy, or how creatively you could come up with a smart remark after creatively dispatching him. Instead, you began pushing this choice-removing agenda and making your films as family-friendly or ham-fistedly political as possible. The 6th Day is a good example of this - I am one of the millions of people whose life could be substantially improved by the cloning of singular cells.Terminator 3 has me asking how much further you are going to turn your back on the things that made you a star. Few of the things done in this film to protect John Connor or Kate Brewster make any sense, and even fewer manage to satisfy the audience. Do you honestly think that not killing a singular person in this film somehow erases the ultra-conservative's stigma that you've killed more on-screen bad guys than any other actor in Hollywood?But to get away from knocking Arnold and his lack of respect for the audience mindest that made him one of the richest actors in Hollywood for a moment, he isn't the only one showing a profound lack of respect here. The screenwriters in this turkey quite obviously read half of the scripts for Terminators 1 and 2, then thought to themselves 'wheee, I can do that!'. Unfortunately, Confucious hit the nail on the head when he said that when you only read half of the sentence, you lose all the meaning. Terminators 1 and 2 were famous for pushing how far one could take violence in a film that is approved for teen viewing, but they also had a certain intelligence and moral to the story. Terminator 1 in particular showed us that even the most timid, seemingly useless person can rise to be a king (or rather queen) when given the right circumstances. Not because it is their destiny, or even because they are pushed in that direction, but because they have the good in them to make the right choice at the right time.Terminator 3 ditches everything the other two films told us about how our lives are not dictated or set to a script. Instead, we are told that Judgement Day is inevitable, and that we will kill ourselves for our own feelings of insecurity, no matter what. That's strike number one against the script. The next fatal error is to tell us that Skynet was no physical system at all, but rather a sentient program that is capable of writing its own digital virii to manipulate enemies to its will. Can you hear the screenwriting committee say 'hey, we need to make this story more MODERN, more NOW'? Remember when Madonna said that about the theme for Advertise Another Day, and what happened after that? Sometimes 'modern' and 'good' are two seperate things, guys.The third strike against Terminator 3 lies in the cinematography. Granted, it's a real challenge to be compared to James Cameron and the people he likes to work with in this department. After all, he is the only director who knows how to compose a scene on Super 35 negative that looks the same no matter what ratio you frame it in. But even directors who use Super 35 and quite apparently don't know how to do this, such as David Fincher, can make films that are more pleasant to look at than this. Doesn't anyone know yet that the thing that made Terminator 1 in particular shine was that sheer mayhem was going on in front of the camera (cars going through front walls for instance), but the camera stayed as still as an oak so that one could see exactly what was going on? Well, in Terminator 3, Jonathan Mostow resorts to the tactic of wobbling the camera to keep us confused as to what is going on during key action sequences. Put simply, this is not good enough.I won't get into all the continuity issues between this and the other two films in there series, but I will get into one issue. When Terminator 2 wrapped (and Arnold still had a career), James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd called it the final chapter in the story. As in that's it, we won't be coming back to this again, we'd rather be CREATIVE. Well, fast forward ab out ten years, and Arnold's career is tanking because he has turned his back on what made him a star in the first place. So he goes to James Cameron and moans 'puh-lease writer another Terminator so I can keep making films'. Cameron told him where to go, but conveniently, Mostow stepped in and said 'yeah sure, we'll have a good time wiping our butts on the film that made you the big star you once were'.In short, to the writers of this pungent turd, I say shame on you for dragging cinema even further down into the 'dumbest buy the mostest' philosophy that the summer blockbuster has been driven by for the last ten years (and yet they say ticket sales are slumping... gee, wonder why). To Arnold, I have the following to say. You are a sell-out, a hypocrite, and you are washed-up. You might call that statement cruel, but hopefully someone will read it to you and you will realise why the same people who made your career sparkle in the 1980s are turning their back on you. Until at least that happens, there is no hope for the intelligent action film. If Terminator 3 proves nothing else, it certainly proves that.On the plus side, however, it wasn't nearly as bad as the committee-butchered Alien 3 that made it into cinemas, but it does stand alongside it as an example of an unnecessary installment in a franchise being slung out to make a quick buck. Both of these films have received a very generous four out of ten from me.",4,1,1,29 July 2003
The Shining," Another piece of trash in the IMDB top 250...
","Shortly after posting some comments about A Clockwork Orange, one of the few Kubrick films I can stand to watch, an enraged fan with in inflated idea of their own intelligence or strength began posting me abusive messages, so I thought I would start pointing out all the Kubrick films I have seen that do a half-hearted job of stealing someone else's creative work. Of course, The Shining is the most obvious example, being based on one of Stephen King's most popular novels, but what may not be obvious is just how bad the film is compared to the novel.I think my mother said it best when we discussed the film during a drive to the doctor's in order to get a minor skin cancer taken out of my face. She basically said that unless one had read the novel by Stephen King, you wouldn't have a clue what was supposed to be going on in the film. That's one point where the film falls down, but it is a minor one in comparison to others. Things like the unstable heating system in the hotel, the reason why Jack Torrance is out of work and needs the job in the hotel, and all the things the Torrances had gone through before the point where Jack is employed in the hotel, are the most important ones. These things play an extremely important part in the course of the rest of the story, explaining why Wendy suddenly turns on Jack, why Jack so easily falls under the spell of the spirits in the hotel, and so forth. Admittedly, it has been a while since I last read the novel, but this is just one juncture in a long pattern from Kubrick: a total display of disrespect for the author of the source material he was using to further his own career. Stephen King has also disowned this version of his novel, so it's not as though I am just making it up.Which is a shame, really. After the abusive messages I have been receiving from one insane Kubrick fan who obviously has no idea what the point of democratic society is, I have really lost every little piece of desire to see another Kubrick film. Never again will Stanley Kubrick's directorial work get the chance to prove to me that, contrary to the impression Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket, The Shining (especially), A Clockwork Orange, and Dr. Strangelove give me, the man wasn't an overrated hack. I bet that jrockwell will be proud of themselves.",Null,0,3,23 September 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Overrated
","Terminator 2 is a very clear example of the hype becoming more important than the product. That's not to say the product isn't good, for it is certainly a better film than anything Dolph Lundgren or Jean-Claude Van Damme had been headlining at the time. The problem is that when one reads the commentaries after the fact, they expect to see a film that is as exciting to sit through as a ride in a Lamborghini down an autobahn. The reality is that for a substantial portion of its running time, Terminator 2 is anything but. Honor where honor is due - James Cameron managed to convince a film studio to give him a nine-figure budget to make a film, and it turned a not-insubstantial profit. That feat alone takes excellent film-making skills along with a good understanding of one's market. Combining this with the fact that Carolco Pictures was about to go bankrupt anyway, and the idea of publicising a film online was well over the horizon, makes the film's success even more extraordinary.The film slightly revises the story told in the original, but since this was necessary to make the new story work, we'll let Cameron off the hook for that. Not to mention that unlike the dire Terminator 3, the story still makes sense on its own terms. In essence, Cameron decides to put the machine created in his groundbreaking original against something so radically advanced that not even a machine designed to be invincible is assured of success in stopping it. Realising this new enemy was accomplished through a series of robotic, makeup, prosthetic, and computer effects. This is supposedly where most of the extraordinary budget went, and it shows. Sure, the scene in which we scene a Terminator with much of his skin missing telling a truckie to get out of his own vehicle was amazing, but Cameron really tops it here. When the 'get out' line is repeated, we totally believe that it scares the helicopter pilot enough to make him leap sixty feet to the ground.The battle sequences in the film are exceptional, too. From the opening combat in the future to the small-scale duels that run through the rest of the film, the battles are exceptionally choreographed and executed. The absence of camera-shaking or, for the most part, far-too-close shots makes this one of the best films for battle sequences. The escape from the hospital and the siege at the computer manufacturer's offices are far-fetched at the best of times, but they set a cracking pace that leaves the viewer with next to no time to consider this. It is also good to see people spraying blood all over the place when they get shot, in spite of young Connor's ludicrous 'don't kill anyone' directive. They could not have chosen a better actor for the new Terminator, either. Robert Patrick really gets the mannerisms shown in the original film down pat, and takes them to a new level. Although he is somewhat small compared to Ah-nuld, he has sufficient presence to not be totally overwhelmed by his massive co-star.Unfortunately, and this is what I have been saying all along, Terminator 2 is let down by a very tedious middle section. One could almost divide the film in two. On one hand, we have an exciting series of battle sequences that, while bridged by some dialogues, rocket the viewer along with a kind of glee. On the other, we have a film where Cameron wears his philosophical waxing on his sleeve, where the characters seem to do nothing but talk and talk. Not only that, but they often state the obvious in a manner that could be considered patronising. I am told that the segue in the desert only takes up about half an hour of screen time, but it feels like ninety minutes. This, and a daft, unnecessary, amount of effort to negate a future that seems already carved in stone by talking a computer scientist into abandoning his research, well, it works in the story, but one cannot help feeling that this film could have been pared down to ninety minutes without any real loss.In the end, The Terminator series should have stopped at one episode. This sequel is very good, but I just cannot help feeling the whole thing is redundant. One cannot blame Ah-nuld for wanting to return to the franchise that made him a household name, especially in light of the failures he had around this time, but one expects a bit more creativity from James Cameron. Still, Terminator 2 is worth watching once, which is more than I can say for a lot of other films I have seen in recent years.",8,6,12,19 May 2005
Apocalypse Now," The standard by which all war films should be judged
","In the 1960s, the Indochine conflict that had been raging for most of the twentieth century finally boiled over into the Vietnam War. America went into this war with a tribal, technologically underdeveloped people, firm in the belief that if they committed enough weaponry and soldiers to the battle, the conflict could be won quickly. Obviously, they were wrong, and one of the many things that Apocalypse Now does brilliantly is illustrate some of the reasons why. One officer of the Viet Cong army, I forget who, told the Americans that they would get tired of the war before the Vietnamese do.This absolute chaos was reflected in the production of Apocalypse Now. Taking over a year to shoot, and around three years to massage into a shape for release, it has become the definitive war epic, not just for a generation, but for all time. Part of this stems from the fact that it is neither pro-Vietnamese nor pro-American, but simply telling the story of one man's terrible journey, leaving the viewer to make up their own mind what to take from it. This is in spite of a fairly slow, even languid pace, and even the great possibility in the late 1970s that it might never be released at all.In 2001, Francis Ford Coppola released a new version of his masterpiece, complete with a remixed soundtrack and forty-nine minutes of footage that had not been integrated into the cut when the distributors, getting nervous about the production woes, demanded that Coppola release something to the public. The resulting 153-minute cut was hailed as one of the best war films ever made. In spite of this, it did show a little incoherence at times. Scenes seemed to jump from one to another without transition. So the 202-minute Redux addressed this in two ways. First, it obviously added a good deal of footage that gave more development and background to many of the characters, especially Martin Sheen's burned out Captain. It also reorganised existing footage into an order that made somewhat more sense. The scene in which we are introduced to Robert Duvall's insane airborne commander now flows much more smoothly, to cite the best example.In a much lesser film, it is said that a dream of one war is a dream of all wars. Apocalypse Now is a great expression of this fact. By proxy of a fictional report on the war's progress, we are told in different words that unless we adapt ourselves to our battlefield, victory is impossible. We are also told how technology and manpower alone will not win wars. The film more or less tells us that commitment is far more important in the key to winning a war, and this seems to be a lesson that America is still struggling to learn. If anything, Apocalypse Now is more relevant today than it was in 1979. We are still lying to ourselves, our fearless leaders still lie to us, and we still have the same delusions we call morality.Strangely enough, Apocalypse Now's signature scene comes early in the piece. The flight of the helicopters over the village to the tune of Wagner's Ride Of The Valkyries is so memorable that the two have literally become one. Many a listener can no longer hear the music without thinking of the film. Unlike many other films, the contemporary music used here also perfectly complements the on screen action. Hearing Jim Morrison sing 'can you picture what will be?' as helicopter flybys fade into Martin Sheen resting in a Saigon hotel is one thing that convinced me contemporary music could work in films that were not themed around it. Matter of fact, some of the music heard in this film is just as haunting as the story being told. Which is saying quite a lot.Not only is Apocalypse Now one of the best war films ever made, it is also one of the best adaptations of existing source material ever made. In this case, the film is somewhat loosely based upon the Joseph Conrad novel Heart Of Darkness. Rather than attempt to create a word-for-word adaptation, Coppola transplants the story into what was then a modern setting and embellishes it with all the things that setting allows. As a result, we have something here that stands head and shoulders above other adaptations of novels set in the Vietnam war. Just watch the eerie, surreal bridge sequence here, and compare it with the sniper hunt sequence in the truly abysmal Full Metal Jacket. The difference in quality when a filmmaker is willing to put his health and sanity on the line to capture that authentic feel of a world gone utterly mad. Forget the Windtalkers or Saving Private Ryans, this is as close as one will ever get to live warfare on the screen.I gave Apocalypse Now a ten out of ten. In spite of flawed editing in its original incarnation, it deserves this rating in both the original and Redux edits. Like RoboCop or X-Men 2, it simply must be preserved as a record of the world's mentality at the time it was made. It is a classic that every storyteller should study intently. You have not truly seen the dark side of humanity until you have seen Apocalypse Now.",10,2,5,17 March 2005
Edward Scissorhands," Tim Burton's most personal and relevant film...
","Edward Scissorhands was a transitional film, not just for its director, but also its star. While it was often overlooked and avoided by the mainstream audience when it was first released, people who have more in common with its titular character than they realised at that time have since embraced it with open arms. Watching it seventeen years later, I can understand how it put some members of the audience off, as it is also Tim Burton's most serious, least light-hearted film. In contrast to Batman, Ed Wood, or even Corpse Bride, Edward Scissorhands is played completely straight, with every note of the story intended to be taken seriously. Or so one might think from experiencing the manner in which the story is presented. Although it is tempting to think of Edward Scissorhands as being intended as satire or a joke, everything that the public knows about Burton suggests that he was totally and utterly serious about the message of the film, both those intended and those that the people the film particularly appeals to have discerned.At its heart, Edward Scissorhands concerns itself with an Avon saleslady named Peg, who finds the titular character within a haunting-looking Gothic mansion after a particular bad day at the grindstone. Unsure what to make of her new acquaintance, she brings him home and embarks on an effort to domesticate him, for lack of a better word. Figuring that all one needs is love, she slowly introduces Edward to the rest of the family, and eventually the neighborhood. At first, everything goes swimmingly, with Edward finding his rather strange condition allows him to do things the stiff-minded townsfolk would not deem possible. But with such sudden acceptance also comes a degree of unhealthy curiosity, not to mention jealousy. As Peg's daughter, played by Winona Ryder in one of her rare fits of relevance, takes more of an interest in the new arrival than she probably should, the normie element starts to deliberate about how to besmirch Edward's character. The manner in which they subsequently behave will strike many who have something in common with the director as oddly familiar.Much of Edward's background is told through the use of flashbacks that not only detail how Edward lived before he was discovered by the bored housewife, but also why he is in the state he is in. The film, or rather its publicity materials, describe him as being unfinished, but I really hesitate to use that word in this context. Unfinished, incomplete, or variations thereof have a very specific connotation, and the reality is that this connotation is very different from the Edward Scissorhands we see in the film. For certain, he lacks fingers, but he not only comes across as being far more sincere than those around him. He also demonstrates that what he lacks, a fully formed set of hands, is far less important than what the townsfolk he is introduced to in the first act lack, an open mind or an imagination. It is no coincidence that the hairstyles and greenery sculptures that he creates using his bladed fingers take on shapes that never occur in the imaginations of the townsfolk. Or within the imaginations of members of the audience, for that matter.As I said, the film marks a transition. Director Tim Burton was starting to be taken seriously as a director with a unique creative vision. Batman had just made so much money that one of its stars wound up being paid more than some small countries make in a year. Beetlejuice was prompting grapevine talk of this weird director who portrayed the afterlife as being warmer than the world of the living. And then there was the star of Edward Scissorhands, a former teen idol by the name of Johnny Depp. Although the effect took more time to become more discernible for Depp, this is but one of the films that began to make audiences and the press alike take him more seriously. Even though he was already twenty-one when he made his debut, it is easy to look back on his early appearances and realise he demonstrates more talent than anyone he shares the screen with. After working with Burton for half a dozen films, I am sure Depp must realise just how perfectly they are matched. The only other actor that comes close to benefiting so much from Burton's direction is Michael Keaton.Indeed, regardless of the colour scheme Burton uses for the different environments of his films, he manages to make one sharply repulsive compared to the other. The mansion in which Edward is found is dark, foreboding, and haunting. Yet it is at the same time so warm and inviting, thanks in no small part to a strong score by Danny Elfman, that one wants to run away with Edward and tell this normalised world they are never coming back. Indeed, after being denied knowledge of what I am for so long, and seeing normies get away with what would be called perjury in a just world during this film, I have to ask those normies one thing. Yours is a world of respect with trust, and mine is not? Tim Burton is therefore not just a director of unique and extraordinary vision. He is the voice for a neglected minority that is being assaulted from all sides by normalists and negationists. Whether he intended this is beside the point, as Edward Scissorhands demonstrates. That he does it so well, and so passionately, makes the end result infinitely more watchable.It is for these reasons and more that Edward Scissorhands is an unqualified ten out of ten film. Burton does not just offer a piece of himself here, he reaches out and touches so many.",10,2,5,5 May 2007
Van Helsing," A disturbingly bad idea...
","The idea for a sequel to the woefully miscast 1990s production of Dracula had been floating around for some years when the decision was made to make Van Helsing younger and turn him into a mercenary. Anyone who is aware of how religious fanaticism and science were virtually at war in the nineteenth century can see how inane this idea is. Hollywood makes its Christian ownership all the more obvious, however, by failing to recognise this basic fact.That aside, the story started out well, with a raid upon the Frankenstein manor culminating with Dracula and the monster taking off to parts unknown. The problem is, once the titular hero is introduced, it is all downhill. The most profound example of the film's lack of respect for the audience's intelligence lies in the scene when Van Helsing meets Whatshername. As the harpies come out of the woodwork to assault the town, Van Helsing sets about taking them down with an automatic crossbow. So far, so good, but the way in which Van Helsing fires, one would be hard pressed to credit him with being able to hit the sidewalk using a can of paint. Naturally, no villagers are killed by friendly fire despite the fact that hundreds of crossbow bolts are fired in every direction.It gets worse from there. Much, much worse. One of my favourite scenes is the vampire egg-hatching sequence. Seriously, our heroes just wander through this area with no regard for what might happen if they are discovered. The usage the villains get is incredibly uneven, too. The Frankenstein monster is little more than a plot device, and the Werewolf is only there to facilitate how Dracula is brought down. Making this all about Dracula might have worked if Dracula had not been so incredibly non-charismatic.After Underworld, Kate Beckinsale needed to appear in something decent fast before she killed her career. Van Helsing is therefore the definition of a bad career move. If Beckinsale is capable of defining her characters through anything other than costume changes, she'd best prove it in her next appearance. Van Helsing sure hasn't done David Wenham any favours, either. The goofy sidekick routine is now so old and tired that he starts being annoying as soon as his character is introduced, and never really stops.I won't get into the use of special effects here, as while they were quite obviously the focus of the film, they aren't the real problem. Nor is the acting as such, although obviously it didn't work against the limitations of the material. The problem here is that the story was given about as much thought as a pop song, if that. Even after watching the film for a second or third time, one is hard pressed to remember the precise details of the story. The words 'tacked on' can be used a lot to describe some plot elements, with the final fight between Van Helsing's group and Dracula being convoluted beyond belief. It's almost like time slows down during this part of the film.I gave Van Helsing a one out of ten. After such fun pieces as The Mummy, one would have expected something better out of Stephen Sommers. With this film, he gets dangerously close to the status of one-trick pony. It defies belief that Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are not rising to meet production budgets when they are spending said budgets on dreck like this.",1,4,8,10 October 2004
Dark City," An interesting premise let down by weak exposition
","Don't read these comments if you haven't seen the film, as it will ruin the surprises.So, what do you expect a character to do when he wakes up in a strange place with no memory of who he is or how he got there? I thought we'd already covered this in Total Recall, but the extra element of this particular character being elaborately set up as a serial killer just didn't work for me. Rufus Sewell is barely believable as an amnesiac, leave alone a man with the required intensity to kill people, although this begins to work in the film's favour when we are introduced to such characters as the wife, played indifferently by Jennifer Connelly, and the detective who is pursuing him, played equally indifferently by William Hurt.Indeed, Kiefer Sutherland steals the show here just by putting a little emotion into the character he is portraying. Comparing Connelly's cardboard cut-out performance during the musical number in the club with the way Sutherland performs his nervous, often hysterical character in a subsequent scene highlights the first major flaw of the story: the characters are just too indifferent to be cared about. The second major flaw in this film is the way that the exposition of the story is let down in the final stages of the film. Rather than resolve the story in a manner that either satisfies curiosity or leaves the appropriate sense of mystery about the Strangers and their purpose, Sutherland's character proceeds to explain everything about how he got to be involved with them and why they are conducting their experiments. Considering that he already explained this enough in the opening sequence, I found this part of the film to be completely unnecessary. The climax is pretty weak, too. I found the wholesale destruction of the Strangers' city to be most unsatisfying, and this whole Shell Beach thing really seemed like the usual happy-ending cop out. The way the Strangers execute their powers must have taken a lot of effort from the actors to stop them laughing, and there's really not much I can say about Melissa George's hideous cameo.However, if there is one impressive thing about this film, it is the set design. The Strangers' underground civilisation in particular was very well realised, and the rapid changes in the city above them really must have given the continuity editors a lot of headaches. This is truly a film that demonstrates all of DVD's superiority, as almost all of the film takes place in darkness, which means the superior shadow detail and lack of the low-level noise that is inherent to VHS really comes in handy. Oh, and let's not forget, this is another one of those films that you haven't really seen at all unless you've seen it in its proper widescreen ratio.All in all, I give this movie a seven out of ten. The acting loses it three points (it would have been at least five if not for Kiefer Sutherland), and the weak story resolution loses it another two, but the set design wins those two points back. Give Dark City a try without expecting too much beyond simple entertainment, and you will be justly rewarded.",Null,1,3,30 May 2001
Aliens," Action and science fiction combined to make a punishing masterpiece
","I'm what you'd call a serious non-fan of James Cameron. As a matter of fact, I happen to think he is an egotistical blowhard whose claims in the area of storytelling are rarely backed up by his end product. Titanic and Terminator 2 are good examples of this. The former was not a patch on earlier films about what remains the worst maritime disaster on record (I think), such as A Night To Remember. The latter just doesn't cut it compared to the grittiness of the film it follows on from, which was a blatant example technophobia passed off as science fiction. So what is it about Aliens that makes me watch it time and time again in spite of having been directed by one of my least favourites?In a word, it is the human characters that make this film what it is. Like Alien before it, Aliens is not so much a story about monsters attacking humans, but humans being done in by collective irresponsibility. The interaction between the humans is what makes these two films as compelling as they are, and the lack of it is what makes the two films that follow this sequel as disappointing as they were. Who can forget the banter between the colonial marines as compete to see who is the most macho?The film does take its time to set up the situation, with a long narrative drive before any of the aliens are seen at all. This is in keeping with the original, and just as in that situation but the lengthy setup pays major dividends. Once the action gets started, it only ever stops long enough to set the focus of the remaining action, or to give the viewer time to catch their breath.There are some glaring technical faults in this film, which makes Cameron's claims about his attention to technical accuracy all the more amusing. For example, when asked what the M41A pulse rifle fires, Lieutennant Gorman says 'ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless'. Yet, in the retreat from the makeshift base later in the film, shell casings can be clearly seen coming out of Vasquez's pulse rifle. The idea that a squad of marines, even the most obedient kind, would contemplate entering a nest full of such vicious creatures armed only with flame throwers is too ridiculous to even contemplate. The idea that they would handle a combat situation with creatures that have acid for blood in such a clumsy manner is even more ridiculous.But in the end, what makes this film work is that it is more of a human drama than a science fiction film. You could almost call the film Humans, as a matter of fact. The relationship between Newt and Ripley slows the pace a lot, but the cross-fire between the marines more than makes up for this. After a while, one really gets the feeling that the marines are more ready to go to war with each other than the aliens. Then again, if you had to put up with guys like Gorman, Hudson, or Burke for such extended periods of time, you'd probably want to kill everyone in the room, too.All in all, Aliens is a nine out of ten film as far as I'm concerned. The only part where it loses a point is the slow, awkward moments with Newt's character being developed. Aside from these moments that really could have been left on the cutting room floor, the film rockets along at a pace which makes it difficult to think about the plot inconsistencies.",9,0,0,21 May 2001
The Exorcist," Genius? I think not!
","Black Sabbath was a work of genius. Star Wars was a work of genius. The Lord Of The Rings was a work of genius. What do these three pieces of art have that The Exorcist doesn't? The ability to entertain as well as offend certain people. The Exorcist is just plain offensive, and not for the most obvious reasons that are beaten to death (and then some) in the film.To put it simply, The Exorcist is a film that set back the cause of mental health by decades. Having done several tours of state mental hospitals in the past ten years, nothing offends me more than the absolute garbage in this film where everyone screams at the young priest that he is wrong simply because he is using his head rather than an ambiguous tome of lunacy as his guidance. And let's not ignore the fact that, in reality, Satan is the hero of the Old Testament. Don't think so? What would you do if some absolute jerk where you happen to work made himself out to be omnipresent and omnipotent, and threatened to destroy you the minute you got out of line (ie you didn't brownnose adequately). Speaking as probably the only rational man who is going to comment on this atrocity of a film, I would quietly pretend to worship him, then kick his miserable butt at the first opportunity. Which is exactly what Satan did in the Old Testament.This film is almost as bad as the Blair Nazi Project. It's just a bunch of ignorant Christian scum jerking off in front of a camera. I can't wait until genetic engineering becomes a dominant science and puts these Nazis right back where they belong.As for the film itself, now that I've discussed the mentality behind it, I am just going to say this much: this film offends me as a human being, as a mental patient, and as a writer who is expected to check his facts at least somewhat properly. The fact that this film is hailed as a classic just goes to show how weak the Christian disease has made humanity.",Null,2,6,26 September 2000
Saw III," Why aren't you listening, Hollywood?
","After listening to the bitching and moaning exhibitors put on about how films are making less this year than last year, one has to wonder who is in charge there. Saw III proves a few things, not least of which is that spending two hundred million dollars to make a film is unnecessary. There is also a claim made by studios that a film has to be aimed to 'please everyone' in order to make back its money. Saw III also turns that claim right on its ear. Saw III is indeed the first horror film, and indeed only the second film period, I have seen this year that could solidly be labelled as being for adults. And it grossed back its production budget three times over in one week. Why Hollywood does not take a cue from this is beyond me, and it seems to be beyond Hollywood, too. Although reception among critics and fans is sharply divided, Saw III is also easily the most intelligent and philosophical of the series to date. Although most people will miss the fact, it has quite a lot to say about our ability to confuse justice with revenge.At heart, the Saw films are about people undergoing tests. Where Saw III distinguishes itself from its predecessors is that the tests are no longer about survival. The penalties for failure are still fatal, but the tests are a little deeper than those of the mere will to live. And everyone, save for the ringmaster that is Jigsaw, is being tested. Viewers who wondered what kind of apprentice Amanda would make after Saw II will be shocked and satisfied. In contrast to Saw II, however, the plot does not revolve around a group of individuals arguing with one another. Jigsaw is less in control of his games this time, leaving us with less cryptic (yet exceedingly obvious) clues to laugh at. Yet there is nothing he has failed to think out in advance, with every angle and variation accounted for. In another life, he could have been a championship chess player. However, one loose end remains for him, that of who will succeed him when the tumor that caused his epiphany in the first place finally gets the better of him.Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are literally on fire in this film. Smith plays an emotional wreck so convincingly it makes one wonder what she had been up to in the time she had seemed to disappear from the media. Anyone who doubts her acting chops will be floored as she acts out the consequences of Amanda failing to realise that she is being tested. The big drama of Saw III is that Jigsaw is now so frail that he can no longer set up his games unaided, and thus Amanda carries out most of the work for him. Kerry, the detective from the other two films, investigates the latest of the Jigsaw killings. She suspects something is afoul when she deduces that this trap was impossible to escape from. Fans of the first two films will remember that Jigsaw is all about playing by the rules, or at least being consistent with the rules he sets. I do not believe it is giving much away to say that Amanda has been playing a little game of her own in between carrying out Jigsaw's wishes, and that Jigsaw is not terribly impressed by this.Woven into the story is the test of a man whose son was killed in a car accident, and forgotten by the justice system. In most Hollywood films, this would dissolve into a comment about how liberal our justice system is. Not so in Saw III. In Saw III, Jigsaw places his victim on a path to confront the people most directly involved both in the son's death and the minimal punishment the offender received. His challenge is to overcome his hatred of these people for long enough to be able to save each individual from some of the most ludicrously cruel contraptions seen in the series. Of course, it would not be a Saw film if people did not die in ironic ways, but the change here to leave the lives of several participants in the hands of another is exactly what is needed after familiarity with the standard scenario had been enforced by the other two films. The most peculiar variation on the original scenario comes from the fact that Jigsaw knows his death is imminent, and he delights in weaving that fact into the tests he sets those around him.In case I have not made it clear enough, credit is due to the creativity of the filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez has said in at least two audio commentaries that once you turn on the money hose to wash away creative problems, you cannot turn it off again. Every dollar of the twelve million spent on filming Saw III was used to much greater effect than a lot of films that spend ten times that amount. Having seen the insides of my own arms and one of my feet, I can say without hesitation that in contrast to almost every other effect in horror films, the removal of a fragment of Jigsaw's skull made me ill. Special effects is meant to be an art of fooling people to believe they are looking at something they are not, and Saw III is one of the few feature films of recent years to accomplish this. I am sure a neurosurgeon or effects artist would be able to point out flaws in the scene other than the varying mark indicating drilling depth, but this scene alone is enough to put the fear of mortality into even the most jaded viewer. Rarely do I walk out of a theatre feeling this satisfied.I gave Saw III a ten out of ten. If you are like me and prefer your horror uncompromisingly brutal, then it is essential viewing.",10,3,6,7 November 2006
Duck You Sucker," A step back for Leone
","Fresh off his artistic success with C'era una volta il West, Sergio Leone began to create another 'trilogy', of which Giù la testa is supposedly the middle chapter. Unfortunately for Giù la testa, it never really comes close to the dizzying heights Leone reached with C'era una volta il West. Which is a pity, because C'era una volta il West is a timeless classic that, in one ten-second shot, slaps the viewer in the face so hard their eyes will rattle for weeks after the fact. Indeed, Giù la testa marks the first Leone film I watched while doing other things where I was more engrossed by those other things. I therefore have little apprehension about labelling it as Leone's weakest work, although his weakest is still far above the strongest of some directors I might mention.At its heart, Giù la testa is a comment about the effects revolutions have on ordinary, regular people. It depicts two men, a Mexican tribe leader of some sort, and an Irish terrorist. After demonstrating his ability with explosives to the Mexican leader, the Irishman is co-opted into serving the Mexican's political goals. It is here where Giù la testa starts to get muddy. The exact cause of the Mexicans is never fully established, and who they are fighting against is hard to figure out, too. In later sequences, we see an army that looks vaguely German, but we're never quite sure exactly why they are fighting these Mexicans. There does not seem to be enough explanation.Another weakness of Giù la testa is the truly abominable score music. During any scene in which the Irishman has a flashback to his past in the UK, we hear repetitive vocals that we are to believe are Irish/Celtic in nature. What they really are, other than dated beyond belief, is annoying. They sound more like something one would hear in a trashy 1960s sitcom such as Gidget. That's not to say the score is all bad. There are some themes that suit the on screen action well, but this is hardly what we could call Ennio Morricone's best work. Especially not after the aforementioned C'era una volta il West. Indeed, the 'keep your loving brother happy' scene haunts memories thanks in no small part to the droning guitar sound of the score. Giù la testa has no such moments, although it does have a missed opportunity in its place.Like all Sergio Leone films, the big strength of Giù la testa is in the cinematography. There was a reason why the 2.35:1 frame was invented, and it was Sergio Leone. Some have come close to matching his sense of scene composition, but none have consistently performed photographic miracles like Leone. Leone is a stunning example of why Pan And Scan should be outlawed under penalty of death by being cut in half. Other minor strengths include a very calm, balanced performance from James Coburn, who took the role because Henry Fonda told him that Leone was the greatest director that he (Fonda) had ever worked with. High praise indeed, given that Fonda had worked on around seventy films at the time C'era una volta il West was released.Fortunately, Leone would return to form with the third installment of his 'three historical periods which toughed America' trilogy, namely Once Upon A Time In America. But lest anyone think I feel this film is all bad, let me reiterate that if every director's off-days were like Leone's, Hollywood would be facing much less derision. Giù la testa, for all its flaws, earns a solid eight out of ten from me. Three of those points are for the cinematography.",8,4,8,24 February 2005
Resident Evil," One of the best films I have seen in a while
","Actually, it's something of a mixed bag, but the good far outweighs the bad in this case. I'll start with the bad first. The bad news is that the film seems a little tame in comparison with the computer games, which are some of the bloodiest and most creepily atmospheric releases the video game world has seen. Often, when you want to see blood gushing everywhere, all you will get is a relatively nice and clean death. A bit disappointing, but that's to be expected when the Moron Picture Association of America steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that adults watch films, too.The good news is that the same creepy atmosphere that made the games so grand, and made such interesting films as Night Of The Living Dead the way they are, is well-represented here. During each and every scene, one almost leaps out of their seat, anticipating the attack of a spider or a licker. The clever references to the games are also quite well-done, as is the reference to Day Of The Dead. Milla Jojovich really does a great job of bringing Jill Valentine to life, and the rest of the cast, anonymous though they may be, do a bang-up job of supporting her.Frankly, I cannot wait for the director's cut on DVD. I want to see more blood and gore.",10,0,4,29 April 2002
Gone with the Wind," The true worst film of all time
","I didn't think Plan 9 From Outer Space was the worst film of all time. I think either The Creeping Terror or Gone With The Wind. At least, that's what the interviewee I refer to in my summary said. Not having seen The Creeping Terror myself, I will just nominate Gone With The Wind. The reasons why this film is horrible and overrated are numerous. Some of them may be considered politically correct, I don't know. But even the politically correct reasons have some pretty solid sub-reasons built into them.One such reason, and it shows the mentality of the times, is Prissy, the maid who simply cannot seem to talk in a normal tone of voice. When she is telling Scarlett how she knows nothing about birthing babies, I could have sworn that if the lines were being ADRed (highly unlikely in those days, but bear with me), someone in the studio was putting a live wire somewhere where they probably shouldn't. African Americans constantly complain about how they are unfairly stereotyped, but I never hear them complaining about this film, which bewilders me to no end.The opening crawls describe the lifestyle led by the so-called heroes as something 'gone with the wind', hence the title. Well, things die for a reason. It's funny how they don't mention the rampant smallpox or measles that killed more Americans than the last five wars (that's wars, not three-month skirmishes) put together. Eras are only as wonderful as your investigations allow them to conclude. There are people, after all, who seem to believe the Middle Ages were a better time to live simply because the church had greater control over our society. Never mind things like bubonic plague (and people wonder why I consider Paul Verhoeven, maker of such realism exhibitions as Flesh + Blood, one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived).Clark Gable makes a decent fist of his role, playing the cold, cool heroic character that has served as a prototype in everything from Elvis pictures to The Godfather. Vivien Leigh, on the other hand, is utterly annoying, and comes off more as a spoiled, bratty child than a heroine. Seriously, listen to her 'fiddle-dee-dee's enough, and you'll be instantly reminded of that brat whose head got stuck in the lavatory bowl in a boarding school on a regular basis. Such a scene would have improved the film immeasurably.And that, in a nutshell, is why I gave Gone With The Wind a one out of ten. People look back on the pre-civil war days with fondness, perhaps, but they only do so because of the rose-coloured glasses they look at the past with. Were I to make a film about the eMpTyV era that I grew up in, I'd describe it as an era that has gone with the proverbial wind, and like the one depicted here, I'd thank my stars that it has.",1,19,71,21 November 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Alien and Predator for Barney's primary audience...
","If you give a toss about the story, stop reading. But believe me, this comment couldn't possibly ruin the film for you any more than Fox has. Spare a thought for Paul Anderson as he struggles to make a film that hasn't been neutered by the MPAA or a cowardly studio. Once Paul Verhoeven left America to resume his stellar work in Europe, I guess the MPAA had to have someone to pound upon. After moronic parents who took their single-digit-age children to see Resident Evil complained, I guess it was inevitable that future Anderson projects face an even bigger butcher's knife.But I am getting ahead of myself here. There are two things that made the Alien and Predator franchises work. The first was human interaction. In essence, the films were about humans trying to screw each other over for power, with the titular enemy there to deliver the consequences of not working together. A non-subtle and somewhat shallow social statement, in other words. Then there's the gore factor. Once the human drama is set up, who cannot help but feel for the survivors as a marine's face is melted by Alien blood, or when a train full of commuters are torn to pieces by a Predator who doesn't fully understand what is going on around him?AVP tries to set up the former factor with Lance Henriksen's character anxious to find the strange artefact under the polar cap before he dies. Unfortunately, where Aliens in particular excelled was that it managed to give every character a third dimension. Here, only Henriksen's character gets such effort. So every act of violence or mayhem is given a feeling of absolutely no consequence. It's almost like a video game.Paul Anderson is on record as saying that he made the film with every intention of it being screened with the MPAA's R rating. Apparently, Fox, fearing it will alienate children, decided otherwise. Never mind that the audience which kept both franchises in the black are now either in their mid-twenties or middle-aged. Forget creativity or making something that people might enjoy. The lowest common denominator rules here. Those parents who complained when the studio didn't accommodate them because they were too stupid to realize a film based on a video game which is in turn based on Night Of The Living Dead might not be a good babysitter, I hope you are proud of yourselves. Meanwhile, if any studio wants to let Anderson make a film without tying his hands over his audience's eyes, I will gladly pay to see it multiple times. Trust me, you will make more money this way once backlash is accounted for.AVP also marks the first Anderson film I have seen in which the shaky-cam technique is used. Here, they don't even bother to try and make their excuse that it puts the audience more into the action seem plausible. Every shaky-cam frame might as well have the phrase 'we are shaking this camera to preserve our PG-13 rating' stamped across it in big, bold letters.You may have noticed that I haven't said anything about the actual characters yet, apart from mentioning Lance Henriksen by his own name rather than that of the character. There is a reason for this. If a group of film characters became any more generic, they could all be played by the same actor. The Aliens and Predators do not fare any better. Seriously, why on Earth didn't they just base the script upon the first comic book series? These comic books showed more for the audience to get interested in with one issue than this film shows in its entire running length.The story also shows every conceivable sign of not being thought through. The humans discover an alien temple a couple of thousand feet below the surface of a polar cap. Great, but wouldn't that mean it is basically submerged in the ocean? So when the intrepid humans decide to go and check it out, the Predators oblige them by firing a beam from Earth's orbit into said polar cap, tunneling the thousands of feet needed to find the entrance. I guess the budget cuts at NASA meant that nobody could notice the massive hulking ship above the Earth. I'm also guessing that Alien blood and armour made from Alien parts gives one special powers, such as the ability to stand below a spacecraft as it takes off without being burned by the thrust. Or did they just not see Danny Glover's race to get away from the Predators' ship at the end of Predator 2?In short, this film insults the fans of both franchises, sci-fi action fans in general, as well as the basic principle of adults being able to watch and hear what they choose to. I strongly urge the viewing, DVD-buying public to give this film the butt, lest more be made in this kindergarten-oriented fashion. Fox, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.",2,113,224,12 December 2004
Batman Begins," The good, the bad, and the (somewhat) ugly
","The previous Batman series, whilst ending in utter disgrace, proved a very good point about comic book adaptations. Namely, the more seriously one takes the comic book material, the better the adaptation works. And it is this lesson that was taken most to heart by Warner Brothers when it decided now was the time to bring Batman back to the big screen. While I did avoid this film during its theatrical run due to the presence of Christopher Nolan at the helm, I have to say the man has gone some way to redeem himself here. While Batman Begins is still a vague second to Tim Burton's directorial essays on the character, it does work as a great prequel. I just hope they have the good sense to pay the 1989 and 1992 films their proper respect, as I doubt that superhero films would be as polished as they are now without their contribution to history. As the original blockbuster, the original certainly still stands as one of the best. But this is all a moot point, for no film franchise can have a chance of success without a good film. On that respect, Batman Begins delivers.One improvement in Batman Begins is that Bruce Wayne becomes a much more complex character. The other two good films used Wayne as a setup for the action sequences, making Wayne a lot less interesting than the suit he dons. In Batman Begins, a lot of thought and screen time goes into explaining exactly why Bruce Wayne puts on a suit and, to quote Jerry Seinfeld, smacks the crap out of people. We see everything in the evolution of the character, albeit in a highly compact, time-efficient manner. The murders of Bruce's parents by Joe Chill, the subsequent trial, and how this sends Bruce along the path to superheroism, are given exactly the kind of exploration they deserve. Had Batman Begins been all about this element, it would have scored a perfect ten from me. Unfortunately, some storytelling decisions leave the film with difficulties in reaching its true potential. Chief among them is the lack of focus in villains. No less than four antagonists are presented to us in this episode, and instead of enhancing the storyline, they confuse the issue.Another major problem with Batman Begins that has me preferring the 1989 film is the camera-work. While the camera is not rattled or thrown about as in so many films by moronic directors who insist that it puts us further into the action, master Nolan really could learn how an action sequence benefits from having all its participants in a frame that only moves slowly, and when necessary. Hyperactive camera motion does not make a film more exciting or immersive, it destroys what little illusion of realism celluloid can actually have. Speaking of destroying realism, while the cable gun used to such great effect in Burton's films is given passing mention here, Batman is shown using his cap to glide, or leaping from tall buildings with no show of his means to slow himself down from reaching the ground at a fatal speed. One of the things that made the best Batman films so compelling is how they used Bond-style gadgetry in the right manner, both filling in interesting details and emphasising the fact that Batman is really human.On the plus side is the acting. Christian Bale might be as tall as the canonical Bruce Wayne, but he also makes it clear in the first reel that he is an actor of a calibre comparable to the great Michael Keaton. He was well-chosen. Supporting him is an excellent choice as Alfred, the great and always-likable Michael Caine. Caine prevents any comparison to actors who have previously played the part by making the role entirely his own. One could accuse him of merely playing himself in this role, but that's one thing that stands out about his performance. Caine is a perfect match for the character. Another character who plays his role almost identically to his others is Liam Neeson. Etiquette prevents me from ruining surprises by talking too much about his character, but this is definitely the role he would have preferred to play when he signed up for the new Star Wars. Some of his lines raised the spectre of Nolan's lack of insight, but the story structure redeems the film brilliantly.A protagonist is only as good as his antagonist, and this is where Batman Begins has problems. While the surprise back-flip of one possible ally does keep the audience on their toes, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, and Rutger Hauer are sold short by a script that cannot make up its mind who the primary focus is. Hauer is an actor's actor, giving every line and movement its proper presence. His lack of screen time and disconnection from the structure of antagonism only hurts the film. Wilkinson only serves to detract from Murphy's screen time, using up the screen time or development that Murphy's character so desperately needs. The film is all about setting up Bruce Wayne as a three-dimensional character, but had the same effort been expended with just one of his opponents, it would have also done him a world of good. Still, the story is solid, and it is unusual to have a hero more interesting than its villain, so these are only minor distractions. I guess I am saying here that Batman Begins is a good film that a few minor problems held back from becoming a masterpiece.Out of ten, I gave Batman Begins an eight. As a superhero film, it is on par with the ilk of Superman II or Batman Returns. The only frustration is how a few minor tweaks could have put it in the same league as X-Men 2.",8,1,1,28 July 2006
The Princess Bride," Slightly overrated
","Before you jump on my head about the title of my comment, please hear me out. I definitely do not think The Princess Bride is a bad film, per se. I have heard it called all sorts of things, from a timeless classic to a great fantasy romp for all ages. Neither of those things are quite true. The film is as dated as most of the Nightmare On Elm Street episodes (especially the Clown Freddy ones). It also falls into the trap of trying to appeal to everyone, and as a result limiting its audience more than it otherwise would. But what it lacks in classic status, it (almost) makes up for in some other areas. On one hand, I can see why I was so reluctant to see the film when it was recommended to me around ten years ago. It was, after all, released in the same year as the holy chunk of awesome that is RoboCop. On the other hand, I can see why it was recommended to me on two occasions that span over a decade apart. I won't put this in my list of favourite films, but I admire it for its uniqueness among the fodder that was made in the same year.I will get the negatives out of the way, since they are the smaller part of this comment. The extraneous storyline involving Peter Falk playing a grandfather who reads this tale to his grandson, played with impeccable irritation by a very young Fred Savage, was utterly unnecessary. They get in the way of the story rather than enhancing it, especially when the action is interrupted to make some comment or to beat us over the head with how universal the story supposedly is. The characters are about as deep as a puddle, and we get no sense of why Westley loves Buttercup (or vice versa) so dearly. None of what passes for motivation or character development here is shown to us, it is all told. Some of the locations shown in the film have names so daft it will make your eye muscles twitch. Yes, there were names with a daft factor in adventure films like The Goonies (a far better children's adventure film in spite of what the IMDb would have you believe), but The Goonies succeeded in making the audience not notice (or care).Now that the problems are out of the way, let's concentrate for a moment of the film's strengths. Mandy Patinkin would have been a far better choice for the focal point of the story, as he runs with the campiness of the story at a speed that would impress Olympic champions. Christopher Guest portrays Patinkin's nemesis with a grace and, dare I say it, subtlety that could have worked wonders if it had transferred to the rest of the film. Robin Wright does the best she can with a very unidimensional role. She is mainly there to tell off the villain or beg for the hero's aid. The real jewel of the cast here is André the Giant, one of showbusiness' true well... gentle giants. As he is making comedy based around his knowledge of how big he is, the softer side of him that realises he is not in the best of health even for a forty-one year old shines through every time he delivers a line. Granted, one can only understand half of what he says at best. But of all the performers in the film, André is the one that will be remembered long after the rest have been forgotten.Some of the trick shots or effects sequences are lousy. The shrieking eels sequence was obviously meant to induce tension in the target audience, but even in five year olds, if the manner in which it is set up doesn't induce laughs or groans, the eels themselves surely will. Others, however, are very well-realised, and work well enough to make the film watchable. When André the Giant carries his castmates up the face of a cliff, one does not see whether it is just trick photography or a set, but it suspends disbelief enough to leave one in awe of the character. I don't know why the IMDb lists the stunt rider of André in the final ride-away scene as being obvious. Maybe I am not as cynical or jaded as I would like to believe, but this shot sold itself well enough that I could feel sorry for the horse. This, friends and neighbours, is a sign of a well-made film.In summation, The Princess Bride is a lot better than I thought it would be, but it is nowhere near as good as many make out. For fantasy adventures, I am far more inclined to recommend The Goonies, which is far more realistic in the sense of being less normalistic than is the case here. Nonetheless, if you have already seen The Goonies, then The Princess Bride is worth a look. I gave it a seven out of ten. Of the hundreds of DVDs I have around me, it is far from the last I would watch.",7,4,12,29 June 2005
Zulu," As dated as a box of corn flakes, but still brilliant
","The ending of Zulu gives an excellent summation not only of the film's content, but also of its character. At the time the film premiered, it had been a century since the British army created the Victoria Cross, an award for extreme valor in the face of the enemy. Sort of the British answer to the Congressional Medal Of Honour, if you will. In that century, the Victoria Cross had been awarded less than fourteen hundred times. Eleven of them were awarded to participants in the battle depicted in this film. Unlike many films that revolve around massive battle sequences that have come since (Return Of The King, anyone?), Zulu makes the fear, tension, and bravery of the battle very palpable. Simply using some clever photography, a boatload of extras, and some awesome music, Zulu hooks the viewer from the time the battle starts to the time the battle finishes. The bragging Peter Jackson has done about the length of his battle sequences in his last two films rings hollow indeed when you consider the entire second half of this 140-minute film is almost entirely devoted to battle.Another plus for this film is that the Zulu warriors depicted throughout are played by real Zulu tribesmen. I do not doubt that the land has grown more civilised, but then, the Apartheid laws in South Africa at the time prevented these men from attending the premiere of their own film. So maybe we are not so much more civilised as we would like to believe. Nonetheless, they give as good as they get in pure acting terms, and while they do not have any actual lines of dialogue, they are one of the best parts of the film. The rules against revealing too much of the film prevent me from discussing their finest hour (actually, it's more a few minutes), but it comes as such a pleasant surprise toward the end of the film that it earns Zulu five stars on its own. The other three are for either an attention to nineteenth century battle tactics that borders on the amazing and a powerful string of performances.Zulu's influence on other films can be seen over forty years later. Paul Verhoeven obviously liked Zulu a lot. StarShip Troopers, which was made thirty-three years later, features a very similar sequence of shots and camera angles during the battles. Some of the dialogue is identical and even some of the musical cues sound eerily similar. Whereas Verhoeven was able to build on this influence and create a battle sequence or three that were legendary in their own right, this feat seems to have been lost on many other filmmakers. While factual errors, anachronisms, and even some very revealing mistakes are abound, such is the manner in which the characters are built that one would never notice them unless they knew in advance. The battle sequences, on the other hand, are impeccably staged, with soldiers firing in rank or strategically laying in the line of fire to test the strength of the defenders. The tension this adds to the later battles cannot possibly be overstated.I will confess to being somewhat ignorant of 1960s-era British cinema, and admit right now that of all the names involved in this production, Michael Caine's is the only one familiar to me. Those who are only familiar with him through more recent productions such as the flat remake of Get Carter, indie British films such as Shiner, or the steaming pile that was Jaws: The Revenge will see here why Caine is one of the best-regarded film stars of the twentieth century. The dispute over command he portrays with Stanley Baker, and his manner of acting out a soldier stretched past breaking point (just wait for the ending), leave me feeling that the makers of Zulu had every right to feel robbed when they were only nominated for a singular BAFTA for best Art Direction or some crap like that. Even if you ignore the acting, especially from the extras, or John Barry's awesome score music, the cinematography alone deserves a pair of Oscars at the very least.The only reason I gave Zulu an eight out of ten rather than a ten out of ten is because it is dated. Not as badly as Goldfinger or the two Bonds that came out in the two years previous, but the colour and presentation of the film (at least as it exists on Region 4 DVD) stamp the year of 1964 on every frame of Zulu. Not that this is anything to be ashamed of, but it does make the film less accessible to modern audiences. In spite of that, if you give the drama enough of a chance and want to see a battle sequence done correctly, you cannot go wrong with Zulu. Everyone should see it at least once.",8,9,13,29 June 2005
28 Days Later...," It started out well...
","I don't know exactly what stops me from enjoying 28 Days Later, but it just doesn't strike me as being nearly as good as others have made out. Maybe it is the inordinately slow pace. I really don't know. I think part of the problem is that the characters carry about the same level of importance to the average viewer as a badly-articulated marionette. In any case, 28 Days Later could really have been titled 28 Days Long, because it certainly takes its sweet time to get anywhere.The introductory sequence in the research lab was a nice touch, and it started the film off on a great note. We've grown all too used to film scenarios in which some kind of army biological weapon brings about the destruction of the world. 28 Days Later takes the heroic step of placing the blame where it really belongs, in the hands of ignorant activists who care nothing for the consequences of their actions, so long as the world is brought into line with their backwards, retrofit philosophy. The real problem begins after the outbreak, when we're following our rather scruffy hero around the empty city.I don't think it was such a good idea to use music over the top of most every shot, for one thing. Films like C'era una volta il West managed to effectively use near silence in order to induce strong feelings, but it appears that today's directors just don't understand the value of a mood or how effective silence can be when it comes to inducing it. Another significant problem lies in the characters. We see them do terrible, even unforgivable things, but very little in the way of explanation is given. The audio commentary refers to keeping the exposition short and relying on the audience to fill in the gaps. The problem here is that the director and writer do too much of this. They also rely upon the viewer to find excitement or interest where there are none.It was a bold move to not have any Hollywood A-list stars in the film at all, although this was probably more because of a small budget rather than any artistic concern. Cillian Murphy is an excellent protagonist, combining a certain naïvete with a decisiveness you don't normally expect after seeing the character's other qualities. He is a more believable version of the characters that populate films like Resident Evil, to put it bluntly. Indeed, it is caring what happens to this guy next that keeps the audience watching.It is when we meet the soldiers that things start going downhill. Up to this point, regardless of what one might think of the central characters, they all had redeeming qualities that made them seem like human beings rather than pieces in a game of plot chess. The soldiers, on the other hand, have no such qualities. They are as interesting as a bag of hammers, and generally about as intelligent.You will note that I haven't said anything about the fast-moving zombies. I think the writer deserves kudos for getting around that problem by making the story about an outbreak with traceable biological causes, as opposed to the usual mysterious causes for zombie outbreaks. The normally incongruous moments when the zombies are running faster than the living are deftly explained away by this setup, something that would have made the Dawn Of The Dead remake work substantially better if they'd even tried it.All in all, I gave 28 Days Later a six out of ten. It has enough intriguing concepts or foundation to keep the viewer interested for the first viewing, but it doesn't have the legs to keep up a lasting viewing experience. The writer and director sum it up brilliantly when they talk about how they set up a whole heap of rules for their story, then ignored them at will.",Null,4,6,16 October 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," As Alien 3 is to Aliens...
","In 2000 and 2003, two films appeared in cinemas that reaffirmed the old adage. The more you take the source material seriously when adapting a comic book to the big screen, the more successful the adaptation will be. There is another adage in film these days, namely that when the first sequel is as thrilling and life-affirming to watch as X-Men 2 was, the next sequel will be a horrendous disappointment. X-Men 3 upholds this adage like a badge of honour. To be fair, I was expecting a disappointment, but alarm bells started to ring in my head as soon as I saw that Brett Ratner had asked someone to proclaim that Einstein was not a mutant. It has been confirmed both through archival footage and the testimony of individuals who knew the man that Einstein, like Bill Gates or myself, was as close to the real-world equivalent of being a mutant as it gets. And unfortunately, with a war of words raging being Aspies and the normalists who wish to 'cure' them, the rest of the film is insulting to the same people who cheered for X-Men 2.Among Brett Ratner's problems is an attempt to weave two plot lines together. The aforementioned curebie war is enough to sustain at least one three-hour film. Sadly, Brett tries to weave it in with the Phoenix saga, a piece of X-Men lore to which a mound of comic books as thick as a standard hardback has been devoted. This, combined with a running time that cannot sustain either plot idea, dooms the film to a ceiling of mediocrity. Another problem for Ratner is his inability to treat the demands of his cast in the manner they deserve. Halle Berry, the worst actor of both previous films, demanded a leading role, and her name appears in the leading credits of the theatrical poster. Bryan Singer would have listened to her demands before informing her the door is behind her. Put simply, she is not capable of carrying a film, and hopefully X-Men 3 will be the last time she gets the chance. Hugh Jackman does his best to outfight her mediocrity, but it is no coincidence that the worst scenes all feature her prominently. Contrary to what she seems to think, she is about as much a mutant as I am a normie.Another big problem lies in the action sequences. The previous two films kept them small, on the level of duels. As a result, the camera-work made them easy to follow, and the judgement of which side was doing what was easy. In X-Men 3, the camera whips around like a drunk in occasional shots, and making out who is fighting what gets confusing in a hurry. Making matters worse is that, in a total contrast to X-Men 2, Ratner is unable to provide a compelling reason for Xavier's mutants to fight Magneto's. Sure, Xavier and his people are dedicated to forging an alliance with humankind, but considering the behaviour of the humans in this film, that Xavier's soldiers would stoop to defending the human contingent from Magneto and his cohorts beggars belief. Find an Aspie and ask them if they would defend people who are trying to force a cure upon them from an organised Aspie army looking to prevent forced cures by any means necessary. Brett Ratner seems to think the answer is yes. Looking up the words Aspies For Freedom on the Wikipedia, for instance, will tell you a very different story.And that is the one crippling problem that X-Men 3 cannot get past. I do not know if this story was put into production because someone half-read the war of words I just spoke of and thought it would be topical, but they fumbled the ball from the get-go. What I do know is that aside from Rogue, no mutant in this film has a shred of motivation to take the cure. Were I making this film, I would have included at least one scene of a mutant who has suffered terrible abuse due to their mutations being told happily that there is a cure by family members who fail to understand the extent of their suffering. Said mutant would tell them what to go and do with themselves, simply saying 'I do not wish to become any more like you'. Considering how much abuse the normalists put anyone who shows any difference, positive or otherwise, from them through, one would expect this scenario to be literally dominated by such scenes.Are there good parts to this film? Well, yes, it is not a complete write-off. Ian McKellen proves once again that he knows far more about the subject matter than either director in the series, and that is not meant to be a put-down to Bryan Singer. Ian just hits the right notes without fail in every scene, no matter how badly written or directed it may be. I still wonder if Ratner really intended for the final shot to so accurately depict how one of our world's real mutants would feel about being cured. Hugh Jackman also manages to hit the right note every time he is in a scene, and proves himself to be at least worthy of acting in the same set as Ian. Kelsey Grammar is a very pleasant surprise, as I had always associated him with Republican politics. That he is able to portray an intelligent mutant struggling to diplomatically solve the communication problem is a credit to him. Vinnie Jones also gives a great performance as Juggernaut, portraying a mad and dangerous man as only Vinnie Jones can. So we can say at least they got the casting right, although Ratner criminally underutilises some of its best parts such as Anna Paquin.In short, X-Men 3 is a three out of ten film. On its own, it is decent, but compared to its two ten out of ten predecessors, it is insulting.",2,12,20,26 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Dividing fans down the middle again...
","I've read the books in the same near-religious manner as Christopher Lee since I was about six years old (thank heavens for parents that take the time to teach their children literacy). So for the better part of twenty years, I have been immersed in the world of Tolkien and his characters. The simple fact of the matter is that while this film takes a lot of liberties with the novel, for which it cannot honestly be blamed, it does so for the overall good of the story.The novel is often a confused tome. Events in it take days and even weeks, and it feels so when reading the damned thing. In spite of being the shortest volume in the series, The Two Towers takes the longest time to read. Partly because very little happens in it, but mostly because Tolkien's habit of describing his characters a little less than the falling leaves is in full swing. Even some of the most literate and knowledgeable people I've met who are reading the book for the first time find themselves flipping back and forth through the pages, trying to determine exactly who the hell this or that new character is.I also find it pretty amusing when people who cannot spell Arwen's name, a name that is probably one of the simplest in the Tolkien world, presume to critique the films for making more out of her romance with Aragorn than is mentioned in the novels. This is actually a very good move. All we read about Arwen is a few sentences (if that) in The Fellowship Of The Ring, then maybe a chapter or two in The Return Of The King. The appendices explain a bit more (and numerous elements of them appear in this film), but Tolkien erred in giving us no reason whatsoever to believe that Aragorn would choose a seemingly docile Elf-woman over a valiant human princess as his wife. The film fixes this by making Arwen the strong, determined character she should always have been.Now where do I begin in describing the film? My only problems with it are that there is a tad too much jump-cutting, and the visuals can sometimes give the viewer a headache during the battles. But aside from these problems, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Elrond stops telling people 'YOU must do this, YOU must destroy that', drops the almighty pretense, and questions himself as to whether he is doing the right thing by leaving Middle-Earth while it is in such peril. And where do I begin with Gollum? We've all seen how all-digital characters can really distract from a film before, thanks to George Lucas, but Gollum is so well-made it is almost as if he really existed and the crew just photographed him. He gets the hook into the audience right from the get-go - he is so treacherous and bitter, but so sad and pathetic at the same time, that one fears seeing how he became what he is rather than what he might do to our heroes.Treebeard and his fellow Ents are little different. They look so real, and yet so unreal, that they completely sell the world of Tolkien to the viewer. Seeing the early stage of their battle in Isengard, I fully understood the meaning of one of the Sindarin themes in the score music. The English translation given in the lyrics sheet reads something like 'The forest has declared war', and by the time the film is over, you will feel it is quite the understatement. Speaking of the score music, Gollum's Song is enough to bring tears to the eyes. With lyrics like 'Don't say I didn't try' or 'We are lost, we can never go home', it puts the viewer/listener in Gollum's hobbit-feet and makes one feel how it is to shake on them for a while.You might want to skip the next paragraph if you don't want to ruin any surprises.At first I was a bit perplexed by the ending. The novel ends with Shelob poisoing Frodo and Frodo being taken by Orcs while Sam takes the Ring and makes a solemn vow to complete the quest, while the film simply ends with Gollum muttering to himself about how 'she' will take care of those nasty, tricksy little Hobbitses. However, this is actually a great note to end the film on, as it leaves the audience hanging in anticipation - the literate ones anticipating how Shelob will be realised, and those who haven't read the book wondering what Gollum is on about now. And more than anything, the changes in expression on Gollum's face as the Halfling he used to be argues with the monstrous thing he is now sells the contrast between Frodo's kindness and the monstrous cruelty shown to Gollum by Sam and the Men Of Gondor. As the film ends, and the credits roll over Gollum's song, there isn't a dry eye in the audience.To cut a long story short, skip the inferior imitations and take your children to see this film. They will be grateful in later years that there was a story/film that respected their intelligence and didn't just sit there saying 'goo-goo gaa-gaa' for two and a half hours at them. Who knows... after reading the novels and seeing these films, your children might even want to grow up to become linguists or the scientists who discover a way to do away with fossil fuel once and for all. Yes, this story, and the film(s), really are that inspiring.",5,0,0,26 December 2002
Hero," I am somewhat confused...
","Confused, mainly because when I saw Ying Xiong on DVD-Video recently, I did not see the masterpiece promised by many others. What I saw was very entertaining, granted, but perhaps the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino's name as a 'presenter' on the cover art put me off. This man needs to get his head out and realise he is not the messiah of cinema that he so often tries to project. Having said that, however, those who are fully involved with the film give it their all, and the results are frequently awesome. Forget all the stereotypes you know about poorly-synced Kung Fu flicks. This is a film with a serious story to tell, and that the story allows for many a fleeting display of martial arts skill is mere coincidence. All the elements for a brilliant epic are here, but something feels like it is missing. If I had to take a rough guess, Ying Xiong tries to be China's (or Japan's) answer to Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo, but doesn't quite get there for a number of reasons.Perhaps it is because of the comparatively short screen time. I am always the first to complain if a film goes on for longer than it should, but the ninety-nine minutes I saw here did not seem adequate to the storytelling task. The story, for what it is worth, revolves around an assassin who is known as Nameless. In the years before China was a unified country, he faces down three assassins who plot the murder of the feudal Lord who would unite the provinces into one nation. The film is told in a flashback style, detailing how Nameless fights down each of the assassins, and to be honest, this is where part of the problem begins. Until I read the IMDb summary, I had no idea that the film was about a warrior preventing the assassination of a King. With the flashbacks, flash-forwards, flashbacks within flashbacks, and everything in between, I was lost and confused. I have enjoyed other films where flashbacks occur within flashbacks, Ghosts Of Mars being a good example, but this risky cinematic technique was done well, as well as sparingly, in those films.In spite of the confusing edit and screenplay, Jet Li proves that he is currently the most famous lead in straight-faced Kung Fu films for a reason. His acting, especially the physical mannerisms, help to sell the character where the dialogue often will not. Some of his most striking scenes involve his complete silence. Unfortunately, the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style of choreography is used here, with actors moving about on wires and going through impossible motions that really do not suit the story. Yes, the style worked well in CTHD, but I really felt, given the tone and serious context of the story, that a more down-to-Earth style would have helped. It is not a good sign when an even more outlandish Jet Li film, The One, features a more believable style of fighting than this one. Especially given that The One was basically a load of the proverbial, albeit one with a very sound background explanation. The fact that it had Carla Gugino, a far more likable lead actress than I have seen to date in any Asian film, didn't hurt.I admit, once the confusion over the nature of the plot is settled, it does make the film somewhat more entertaining. Unfortunately, it also raises a lot of questions that the film fails to satisfactorily answer. The question of why one would want to protect this King, who is seemingly responsible for the annihilation of a village as depicted in the early stage of the film, is high among them. Also taking a high place among the unanswered questions is why there is all the need for this study of calligraphy to defeat one of the three assassins. Yes, I realise that it is meant to improve fighting techniques, but the amount of time devoted to calligraphy in the film makes this easy to forget. I also found the derivation of swordsmanship secrets from calligraphy a bit hard to swallow. Maybe someone can figure something out about me from the way I always write in heavy block, but I doubt it will hold true once they take the time to make further observations. Still, the rolling out of the armies in each scene of this kind were impressive enough to justify the viewing time. Even if the repeated calls for Nameless' head towards the end of the film got on the nerves a bit. I am somewhat curious as to how the arrows were shot, too. If they are CGI, then they are the most impressive CGI I have seen for a while.In all, I gave Ying Xiong, or Hero as it is known here, a seven out of ten. It is not the best Kung Fu feature you will ever see, nor is it an indispensable classic of human drama. What it does have going for it is a very solid lead actor who should appear in more films, and some absolutely stunning cinematography. Fans of martial arts-based cinema need look no further, while those of us who prefer solid story or characters will also do well with a singular viewing.",7,4,5,14 May 2005
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," More like the Barely Adequate Four...
","Thirty years ago, when Star Wars was just being released to theatres and Superman was in production, this film might have been impressive. Twenty years ago, a little before Tim Burton slapped a lot of expectations upside the head and redefined the way comic book adaptations are filmed forever, ROTSS as I will call it henceforth might have been mildly impressive. But the thing about storytelling is that once your audience has seen or heard a good story told in an impressive fashion, the bar is instantly raised. Ten years ago, in the wake of the stink that was Batman Forever, this half-baked offal might have seemed passable. But after the incredible statements on how far we have not come since 1945 that the real X-Men films turned out to be, ROTSS is woefully inadequate. As I stated in my comments about the previous Fantastic Four film, ROTSS is more a case of X-Men Dumbed Down For Infants, and the fact that director Tim Story was not fired after his appalling effort on the first film demonstrates that not everyone at Fox has their act together.One of the most commonly-cited complaints about the original Fantastic Four film was that the characters seem largely indifferent to their newfound powers and their situations. This was because, with the sole exception of Michael Chiklis, the actors are never given any time to explore their characters, their characters' emotions, or their characters' situations. We ended up knowing less about the Four than we do most characters in a soap opera, and as a result, they seem less real. Even in Dark Angel, arguably a top ten contender for the worst-written dialogue ever heard on television, we had more reason to care about the support characters there than we do the titular heroes in ROTSS. And that is the one big problem which ROTSS just cannot recover from. Because these so-called heroes live like celebrities and are treated like rock stars, we end up with no reason to care what happens to them. In one memorable (for all the wrong reasons) scene, as Reed is using his flexibility to impress women in a nightclub, we cannot help being reminded of Rogue's abject fear of even touching someone.In the original Fantastic Four, this effect was bad enough on its own. Its poor time economy and seeming inability to properly develop the characters left this sequel with little or no foundation to balance itself upon. Where X-Men 2 had the inevitable attack of the Normalness Patrol upon its heroes and its anticipation, the biggest event in ROTSS when going in is the wedding of two characters. Since the two characters have about as much character as the leads in an episode of Neighbours, we are not just indifferent to this event. We literally just flat out do not give a crap. And considering that ROTSS has to make do with a mere ninety-two minutes of running time, you cannot count on any story development to give you an investment in what happens to the characters, either. When Victor Von Doom steals the silver surfboard for his own purposes, one ends up being too aware of how little time remains in the film's running length to really get worked up about the possibility of anything exciting.Not helping anything is the mostly-droll acting. Jessica Alba looks more comfortable here whining about the inevitable challenges of her nuptials than she does convincing us that she regards the safety of our world as her responsibility. Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans are just there, and just basically adequate. Even Michael Chiklis is ultimately reduced in this sequel due to his character being given all of the perks of fame without a single drawback being given the slightest exploration. Julian McMahon could not play Victor Von Doom on the most maudlin day of his life, and in this film his credibility as a genuine threat is almost as sorely missed as that of the Silver Surfer. Speaking of the Silver Surfer, the film attempts at one point to flip gears and make him into an unwilling servant of a much greater menace, but one ends up caring a lot more about those millions of civilians who were presumably killed when he dug one of his little holes in the Earth's crust. This is not helped by the fact that when the Silver Surfer attempts to explain why he does what he does, it amounts to a lot of tell and no show.Not helping matters any is the parameters of the softcore PG rating. Exactly what convinced the MPAA this film was even nearly as adult in tone as either of the real X-Men films is going to be one of the great unsolved mysteries years from now. The action is about as intense as the effort with which I blow my nose, and only a delusional crackhead could find any suggestive content here. You could probably shave another five minutes off this film and get it a G rating in Australia. And when you consider that this film is dealing with the possibility that every life on Earth might be extinguished, such beating around the bush is simply not on. I am not saying that the film needs to be another RoboCop, but when you present the audience with a situation in which people will inevitably be killed, reminding the audiences that there are consequences to detaching a chunk of a building from its foundations is actually a good thing. And no, the impalement at the end does not count, because like one of those ghastly Narnia films, the director cannot resist the temptation to invoke the magic reset button.Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer is the epitome of what I call a two out of ten film. Even twenty-five years ago, I would have told the nearest adult to turn this kiddie trash off.",2,3,6,28 October 2007
Transformers," Quite a lot less than meets the eye, actually...
","It seems Transformers splits viewers firmly down the middle, with people either denouncing it as a lot of crap or saying they loved it. I do not denounce people because they have an opinion, not unless they want to tell me I am diseased and incapable because I was born different to the expected norm anyway, but this... film... goes beyond the limit of bad writing. Hence, when a defender of this film tells me that the sky is blue, I will ask someone else for their opinion. You see, I was a hyperlexic child in 1986 (that means I had a wider vocabulary when I was in elementary school than most people have when they enter tertiary education). Hence, I not only enjoyed The Transformers, the real Transformers, I could have explained to you in very lucid terms why the physics of their abilities are not only impossible but, in light of feasibility on a planet that is not blessed with a literally infinite power source, completely ridiculous. Why do I say all that? It is very simple. This film does not just insult my intelligence, it assumes that I am like my onetime elementary school teachers and have none.Like all the truly bad films, there are moments when you start to just care about some of the characters. The soldiers who first meet one of the titular robots are likable, genuinely interesting guys. The teenagers that the film spends the majority of its time following, on the other hand, are the most insipid and annoying pieces of human filth it has been my displeasure to watch. In contrast to the Spike, Chip, or Sparkplug that gave the audience an element to relate to in the real Transformers, the Sam, Mikaela, and Maggie that pollute this abortion of an adaptation slow down the interest factor to a halt. It is one thing to make a film about a war between disparate factions of intelligent robots uninteresting. It is another altogether to make the human factor so monotonous and cliché that even the moments of interaction between people are boring. The 'oh my god I do not know how to talk to another human being because it is feminine' act is so 1950s, guys.Adding to the misery are the action sequences. Yes, the parts of the film that are meant to give relief from the monotony of the dialogue or the who-cares tepidness of the human characters actually bring the most pain. This is because director Michael Bay, like all directors who do not know how to make an action film interesting when all else has failed, resorts to the tried and tired method of making sure the audience cannot see what the hell is going on. Michael Bay, if you are out there and can read this, I promise you that if we ever meet, I am going to make you feel as dazed and nauseous as your piece of crap film has made me. I will sign a contract to do so in blood if you want commitment. Bay should really have trusted his original instinct, as he has made nothing more than a stupid toy film. Put simply, I did not just hate this film. I turned it off feeling like Bay had just shaken his ding-dong at me for two hours.And what of the characters we were bracing ourselves to see on film? Well, Bumblebee is the one we get to see first, so let us deal with him. Put simply, Bumblebee's function in the real Transformers was to demonstrate that size alone does not make a person worthy. In spite of being not much bigger than your average Human, he often steered his fellow Autobots out of danger when it was really needed. Or rescued the human element. Take your pick. But in Michael Bay's conception of the world, everyone who is worth anything is at least 6'7' and weighs 250 pounds, minimum. Do not try telling him Albert Einstein was a mere 5'9', it will fall on deaf ears. And it gets worse from there. The real Optimus Prime was a leader because of several things. One, he was as intelligent as he was large (that's right, Michael, intelligence counts for A LOT in battle). Two, he was unafraid to serve the greater good, even if it came at the cost of his own life. Three, he led by example. Four, he led by example. Five, he led by example. Six, well, you get the idea.When you add all these things together, you find they contradict the very nature of the robots Michael Bay presents to us and asks us to believe are the Transformers. Optimus Prime in this film cannot even take one of his human wards to retrieve a vital element of their mission without crushing major backyard ornaments and, along with his fellow Autobots, making enough noise to alert an entire city block to their presence. Oh, and by the way, Jazz had class. He was not a twenty foot tall expression of bling-bling culture. Ugh, being that I could read Tolkien when Darius McCrary was probably failing elementary school English, his presence in this film is an insult to everything the original series was about. It is one thing to have characters who are, to quote George Clooney, dumber than a bag of hammers. This film goes a lot further This film assumes that its audience is made up entirely of four year olds who have never read a cereal packet. In so doing, it takes everything that such writers as Dennis O'Neil and Bob Budiansky created and perverts it.Transformers as directed by Michael Bay is a two out of ten film in every sense. Avoid.",2,7,15,31 October 2007
Children of Men," An amazing vision of the future
","Every so often, one sees a film that affirms everything they believe in, or changes the way they see the world. Children Of Men is a little of both, not least because it constructs the world in which it takes place with meticulous attention to detail. Based on a story describing one of our greatest nightmares, Children Of Men can even be loosely interpreted as a metaphor for how we would respond to living in a world where we perceive everyone around us as taking for granted what we consider an impossible dream. Set in a somewhat distant future, Children Of Men tells the story of an England that is part of a world where infertility has become the one universal trait for every woman in the world. Through a number of visual cues, we are informed that infertility rates started to accelerate until around the year 2009, no woman will conceive or carry a child to term for another eighteen years. The result is a society in which youth is so highly prized that it can bring instant fame to those in possession of it.The story begins with the news that the youngest known citizen of the world has been killed. As tragic as this news seems, things are about to get even worse for Theo, a rare good performance from Clive Owen. Theo is a former activist working at a government bureau who finds himself being suddenly abducted by still-active activists, led by Julian, an even rarer good performance from Julianne Moore. So far as Theo knows at the beginning, Julian is simply asking him to help escort a woman to safe haven. But after the first stage of the trip goes haywire due to the intervention of one political faction, Theo is shown the Earth-shattering truth by the woman he is escorting. Not only is this the first woman to have conceived a child in around eighteen years, she is also the first who looks like she might actually deliver. Never mind that she looks all of fifteen years old, as they say, this event is so highly amazing, it is a credit to the filmmakers that they can make something so mundane seem like the second coming.During the first seventy minutes of the film, the world our characters inhabit is so well-realised that we accept its reality within ten minutes. Suspending disbelief is a lot like teaching someone to swim. You either do it in slow, graduating steps, or you throw the person in and hope they float. The latter approach is the riskier of the two, but it can be done if the right set design or props are in place. Both of these things and more are present in Children Of Men, and I was frequently left wondering where all of the seemingly abandoned locations were found. During the 1980s, films that depicted a bleak future with the world on the verge of collapse, or already in the throes of collapse, were becoming a flood on the market. None came so close to selling the illusion that they were live photography of what they were depicting as is the case in Children Of Men. This is as close as a film in the English language has ever come to depicting a world after its end, or is ever likely to.Alas, the film is not entirely perfect. The last twenty minutes in particular degenerate into a repetitive action scenario, with the final struggle to get Kee and her newborn child to the promised land in particular letting the side down. It almost feels as if the writers got to the final act and decided that getting the child out to sea without a mass gunfight was just not climactic enough. Also letting the side down is the photography. While there is no deliberate shaky-cam, overuse of the wrong camera technique can lessen the impact of what one sees. Sleepers, for instance, suffered badly from the constant steadicam work, and Children Of Men falls victim to the simple fact that there is just too much hand-held. I fully expect people to defend this decision by claiming it puts the viewer into the action. The meticulous set design and storytelling did that for me already. What the wobbly camera does is give me the feeling that I am watching a drunk uncle's home video. And trust me on this, my uncles' lives are not that interesting.Speaking of the photography, most of the film is shot in long, continuous takes. Unlike the hand-held, this artistic decision pays off in spades, giving the effect that the hand-held, and the shaky-cam in other films, fails to. The initial sequence in the car when we are introduced to Kee is a continuous twelve-minute take that must be seen to be believed. Speaking of things that must be seen to be believed, the moment when the soldiers stop firing to watch as the baby is brought past them is one of the most mesmerising shots out of all the two dozen films I have seen this past fortnight. They went to enormous trouble to accomplish what was intended in this film, and the end result has made it worth every penny. The hand-held camera and final action sequence aside, Children Of Men is one of those happy accidents of film-making where all of the elements come together exactly at the right time. It always strikes me as ironic that the most affirming and encouraging films or stories often come from their creators being willing to face up to the darkness in all of us.Children Of Men is a flawed masterpiece denied perfection only by a few ill-advised artistic decisions. A nine out of ten film.",9,3,7,9 May 2007
Event Horizon," excessive gore? you people are pathetic!
","'The excessive gore was unnecessary' blah blah blah... well, here's a surprising revelation. This film was toned down in order to get past the MPAA with an R rating, which goes to show what a crock America's film classification system has become. The original conception of the ending, in fact, had the Event Horizon making its jump with all of the new crew still aboard. The intention was to show us a slice of the other dimension and just how awful it is.Maybe this film appears shockingly violent to Americans, but to people with more sense or who live in countries where the censors emphasise classification over cutting, it's really just standard horror fare. Oh wait a minute... did someone actually mistake this film for science fiction? I would have thought the mere premise would have cleared that one up: spaceship disappears, spaceship comes back like a modern day Marie Celeste. Pretty easy to work out that we're not taking this trip out into space to be awed by special effects shots. We're doing it because we want to be revolted by the darker side of human nature.Having said that, gore is what makes a horror film watchable in spite of a bad script and bad acting. However, Event Horizon is not hobbled by either of those things. The mostly British cast realised that they were mostly props for bad things to happen to, and it shows in the way they act out their roles. It makes a nice contrast with American acting, where they seem to expect at least a thousand lines of clever dialogue.My only serious complaints about this film are that it isn't long enough to have a story which makes you care about anyone besides Fishburne and Neill, and that it isn't out on DVD here. Oh, and don't try to watch this film on VHS. The low-level noise in the dark areas of the picture and the loss of about 33% of the picture severely cuts down the film's impact. Part of the attraction at the cinema was the wide shots out in space. That and all the blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood.",Null,1,1,12 October 2000
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," An insult to its predecessor and the audience
","I used to believe that Paul W.S. Anderson was not getting a fair break from the Hollywood studio system. It's an easy belief to support, given that every film he has made so far has been hacked apart by the MPAA or a film studio acting upon MPAA orders. This evening, however, I witnessed a film so indescribably awful that not only do I believe my mother's pet silky terrier can puke up a better script, it has erased any respect I might have one had for Paul Anderson.The MPAA's R rating is quite meaningless, and that studios cut their film in order to get it is a telling sign of what is wrong with Hollywood today. In Australia, Resident Evil: Apocalypse was passed with the very softcore M rating, and this attempt at a film is a mild M at that. The atmosphere of the first film is absent, and the violence is so toned down that it resembles one of those Modified For Television cuts that were so reviled here in the 1980s.I now know why they changed the name from Nemesis to Apocalypse. There was once a belief that the Nemesis name is cursed, given that the Star Trek film with the same secondary title tried to compete with a Lord Of The Rings film and failed miserably. I have a funny feeling that Capcom saw the script, imagined what it would look like on film, and quietly asked that it not be associated with their excellent video game. The Nemesis in this film isn't so much an unstoppable killing machine as he is a drooling idiot in need of a friend. The Hunters/Lickers also take a beating here, too, having been confused with Speedy Gonzales.The cinematography and editing in this film are beyond a joke, too. Like all incompetent directors, Alexander Witt rarely keeps his camera still for more than a few seconds at a time. During the hand-to-hand fight scenes, the extraneous camera movement is enough to make me fight off the urge to vomit. I doubt I am the only one, and it certainly makes me glad that I don't have epilepsy. Contrast this with the stable, well-angled shots of the original. Better yet, watch the fight scene with the Nemesis, then contrast it with the shot of Alice putting her foot in the final zombie dog's head during the original. The camera-shaking fad has outlived its welcome by a major factor. Then there's the editing. In the original fast-paced action sequences were mixed in with slow, languid sequences that helped set up an atmosphere.That's another thing basically lacking from this sequel. Atmosphere. As there is rarely a shot or sequence that lasts more than two minutes due to the incoherent editing, none of the characters are given enough background to seem even slightly human. Anderson spent some time explaining the skills that his characters were meant to have, so it seemed natural when they made use of them. In Witt's film, characters constantly display abilities or skills that the audience was never made privy to before. Constantly-repeated, blurred, obscure footage of doctors injecting a character with their virus do not count.The worst part, after all these insults to the viewer, is the ending in which we're set up for another sequel. After the dog barf that was served up in the other 85 minutes of this film, to spend another five suggesting that there's going to be more is like a punch in the eye. They should have ditched their plans for a sequel and instead filmed another half-hour of footage for this one. An extra half-hour of exposition or setup would have saved this accident from being a total write-off.I gave Resident Evil: Apocalypse a one out of ten. The MPAA is constantly moaning about how piracy is eating into their profits, and yet they continue to make garbage like this. Seeing an organisation that controls billions of dollars worth of assets in this kind of denial is really sad to observe.",2,2,12,26 October 2004
Mulholland Drive," Lynch simply being Lynch
","David Lynch has, in his own funny way, become sort of like a cinematic McDonald's. You know exactly what you are going to get before you order, and in some way, the dishes are all alike in spite of some fundamental differences. In a Lynch film, you know you are going to get a lot of surreal imagery, stories that would make sense if you could take the pieces and rearrange the order, or soundscapes that promote a creeping sense of unease. Sometimes all of the above. But then, Lynch must also have quite a lot of talent as a director, given that he is able to coax decent and genuinely good performances out of two women who used to appear in Please Go Away. Critics of the film have attacked it for being an excuse to show minimally-simulated lesbian sex scenes or making no sense, and I cannot deny that they have some cred in a sense. Without reading an explanation or theory of the plot in advance, Mulholland Dr. tends to make little sense. However, unlike Eraserhead, it does not allow for thousands of theories that may not coincide with what Lynch had in mind.Many scenes in the film are referenced later, or even in advance, and some are repeated from a different perspective. What makes Mulholland Dr. watchable is the theory that it is the story of a young woman's emotional breakdown as her career stumbles into a quick decline. Originally made as a pilot for a TV series, it appears to be a series of reflections on experiences in the director's life. The illusion and perceived glitz of Hollywood is contrasted with its hidden squalor and dirty politics. If one simply sees it in this way, then the film is otherwise just a string of bizarre coincidental images. Lynch has given a series of clues in order to unlock the hidden meaning of the film, but I honestly believe he neither knows nor cares about any hidden message himself. Not that he is deliberately confusing the audience to hide a lack of skill. Rather, he is simply feeding his own legend in order to promote the story. Exactly what the point of scenes such as the Ryan Entertainment meeting is, he would rather we just make up for ourselves. You have to respect a director who is willing to do that.As I mentioned, the film contains performances from two women who appeared in Please Go Away, the television series that has come to symbolise everything I loathe about Australia, its culture, and its people. Naomi Watts is the more prominent of the two, and there is no way one would guess from watching her in this film that she was somehow involved in that utter talent vortex. In a strange way, it is her wide-eyed, innocent portrayal of a woman new to this strange land called Los Angeles that keeps the viewer focused. The real star of the show, however, is Laura Elena Harring, who has no connection whatsoever to the aforementioned soap opera, and it shows. Starting the film as a mousy, frightened woman with no memory of who or what she is, at least half the shocks and revelations of the plot come from her. Justin Theroux provides the rest of the film's heart as the director who simply wants to retain artistic control, but slowly transforms through the film when he is harshly reminded of who has the real power in Hollywood. It has been suggested that this is an autobiographical character based on Lynch's reflections on the production of Dune, which would not surprise me.By far the most puzzling and interesting sequence of the film is the play in the club Silencio. It is worth sitting through this sequence a few times in order to catch everything that Geno Silva says during his monologue. I do not speak Spanish fluently enough to understand how the statements made in the language during the song affect the plot, but it would not surprise me to learn that much of the entire plot is revealed in this sequence. Another memorable scene occurs when a mob heavy comes to the Kesher house, in search of the esteemed director. A lot of people who wanted to punch Billy Ray Cyrus in the face for Achy Breaky Heart will live vicariously through this scene. Many who suffered through the introduction of Lorraine Kesher will also find this scene quite satisfying. I cannot reveal the most satisfying scene in the film, however, as it is basically the end of the film and just left me dumbfounded when I first saw it, as I suspect Lynch intended. Then again, Lynch and dumbfounded often belong in the same sentence where reaction is concerned.Out of ten, I gave Mulholland Dr. an eight. It suffers somewhat from its TV pilot origins, and a few plot threads seem to be left quite loose, but it remains by far Lynch's most accessible and satisfying work, at least from what I have seen. Even if you despise other Lynch films, as Roger Ebert seems to do, you might just find Mulholland Dr. strangely rewarding, as Roger Ebert also seems to do. In fact, Ebert says it best with a quote from his review: 'the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it'. Amen, Roger.",8,1,3,22 January 2006
The Evil Dead," Cabin Fever Splatter
","I've read many criticisms of this film which state that the first twenty or so minutes of the film are the best. I could not disagree more. Once the actors stop trying to act as if they are relating to one another, and start chopping each other up, it all gets much better. The best part of The Evil Dead is that, unlike the second and especially the third episode in the series, it can be taken seriously. In fact, it is a lot more enjoyable if you take the film seriously and try to imagine how Ash is feeling when stuck in a cabin with only a pair of Deadites for company.The makers of The Blair Witch Horsedung could have learned a lot about low-budget horror film making if they had taken the time to sit and watch this film. Real horror comes from being able to relate to the characters (is there anyone who didn't feel a certain revolted confusion when Scotty chopped up Shelly with an axe? thought not...), not from false claims passed off as publicity and shaking the camera so much that the viewers have a headache afterwards. Granted, the acting from most of the players in this film is just as bad, and the special effects are almost as non-existent, but moments like when a possessed Cheryl begins laughing as she is locked in the fruit cellar show that if you spend enough time and energy building an atmosphere in a horror film of any budget, the splatter you show for the rest of the film will be much more effective.(seriously revealing plot information ahead, don't read past this point if you haven't seen the film)A case in point is the moment where the book is thrown into the fireplace, and the two remaining Deadites suddenly stop in their tracks. I didn't know whether to throw up or laugh when I first saw them falling and rotting apart (I suspect I did both at one stage, as I first saw the film a long, long time ago). As both bodies rot away into pools of goo, we don't see any explosions or other such dramatic poise as we do in films like Final Destination. Instead, we simply hear a disembodied voice that Darth Vader would find impressive calling to Ash: 'Join us... join us...', and then we see Ash walking out of the cabin as another disembodied spirit comes after him. A million times more effective than any of the 'oh, look at those scary funny twigs' moments in Blair Christian Propaganda could ever hope for.In other words, anyone who hasn't seen this film has not seen what a real triumph of low-budget horror filmmaking looks like. The first sequel is a nice adjunct to the film, but forget about Evil Dead III completely. In my rulebook, if a sequel is made to an intense piece like Robocop or The Evil Dead, and it fails to recieve an MA or R rating from the Australian Office Of Film And Literature Classification, it is not the genuine article.",Null,1,2,13 January 2001
The Piano," 'Piano' must be Maori for 'self indulgent wankery'
","Amidst a storm of publicity and hails as the new ultra-feminist zenith of masterpiece, The Piano hit international cinema like a plague, and suddenly it was 'cool' to watch the thing, as well as talk everyone else into seeing it, whether the film suited them or not. Contrary to what a previous commentator implies, Anna Paquin deserved her award for this film, and then some, as she acts rings around the adults in the cast. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill play the most utterly despicable men, and given that this is meant to be some post-modern feminist essay, they are also as unidimensional as a piece of paper. Holly Hunter's character could have been at least likable, but the presence of voice-over from what is meant to be her character (but sounds more like Anna's) ruins whatever character she could build through her silence. James Cameron was able to create a character that intimidates the audience despite speaking less than a hundred words in a hundred minutes. Jane Campion as a writer is to James Cameron as a one-cell protozoan is to Professor X.All the elements for a good story are in place. A mute woman is sent to colonial New Zealand for an arranged marriage. Her one treasured possession in the world is a piano, hence the title. The twist is that her new husband's refusal to help her keep her piano results in her having an affair with one of the locals. In the hands of a director like Paul Verhoeven, Tim Burton, or even Christopher Nolan, this could have become a classic. In Jane Campion's hands, it is overlong, paced like a racehorse with three broken legs, and entirely uncompelling. If you don't believe me about Verhoeven's ability to tell this kind of tale better, then you clearly haven't seen Keetje Tippel or Turks Fruit. That aside, the location scout sure earned their money. Campion knows how to make the best use of the countryside and its natural beauty, I will give her that much, but this does not add up to much in light of the myriad of problems. You can make a good art film, you can make a bad art film, but heaven help you if you make a boring art film.Roger Ebert takes a long walk off a minuscule credibility pier when he tells us that Campion 'understands better the eroticism of slowness and restraint'. If you want to see slowness and restraint used well in film, rent Michael Mann's 1995 film Heat. Mann gives the audience enough reason to care about every character that he can include an entire minute of footage that features little more than two of his actors staring into a camera, and keep viewers glued to their seat. Heat is literally one of the most languid films to have emerged from an English-speaking country in the past twenty years, yet it is also one of the most compelling. The Piano tries to use slow and languid to seem artful, but in failing to give us characters we want to follow through to their eventual fates, it simply becomes overlong. You could seriously excise at least thirty minutes from The Piano and nobody would know the difference. Hell, when I write, I look back on what I have written and ask 'does this scene contribute anything to the story?'. I have deleted enough words to make a full-length novel from my writings this way, so that Campion can get this rubbish published unasked is offensive.Of course, people will respond to my previous criticism by telling me that The Piano made money at the box office, and it is true that money speaks a lot louder than artistry. The problem with that defense, however, is that any film film made after 1980 could make a profit on the back of a mere seven million dollar budget. Exactly how Campion was able to enlist such actors as Keitel or Neill and stick to such a budget is a bit of a mystery. Perhaps she was able to convince them, like her audience, that she was making an art film. After seeing both of them in other films, I know they are definitely better actors than Campion deserves or knows what to do with. But to get back to the point, much of The Piano's profit has come as the result of pressure-marketing. The marketeer barks that this is a compulsory film for feminists or art students, and they jump. This is not art or even skillful economics, it is a form of cultural terrorism. The real pity of it is that Campion will have you believe she made a statement, and some will believe her.The one area in which The Piano can be thanked is the introduction of a young actress named Anna Paquin. As I said earlier, she acts rings around the rest of the cast, giving us the only character who has any illusion of being three-dimensional. Unfortunately, much like later films in her career, she is sadly underutilised, and in another display of femininity according to Campion, is only there when Holly Hunter or someone giving Hunter a good serve needs something to bounce their total blankness off. Had the film been entirely about her, or from her perspective, it would have been a lot more watchable. But then, I could watch Anna reading the phone book for two hours, so I might be just a little biased. Such is the quality of her performances that she has made several write-offs (All The Rage comes to mind) eminently more watchable. Ironically, she continues to act in real art films that are far better than this nonsense, yet receives not even half the recognition.For that reason, I gave The Piano a three out of ten. Anna earns all three stars. If you are a fan of Anna like I am, this might be worth the two hours. Otherwise, don't bother.",3,14,28,28 July 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," More overrated Tarantino self-indulgence...
","One has to constantly wonder what would happen were Quentin Tarantino put in a prison cell with Mark Brandon Read for a day or two. Given that the latter really has had his ears cut off and knows what happens during such impromptu surgery, I think the conversation alone would be rather interesting to say the least.But this is a digression. Tarantino at least had the honesty to come out and say that this opus was a work of pure fantasy. This, however, does not save it from falling prey to Tarantino's trendiness. One has to hand it to him for being able to make something seem hip in an era where nobody seems to know what is 'cool' anymore. Nonetheless, Kill Bill revels in its own supposed hip-ness to such an extent that in twenty years' time, it will no doubt be viewed with the same kind of contempt reserved for the likes of The Brady Bunch rather than the admiration films like RoboCop get as they near the age of twenty years.Speaking of that august piece of true ultra-violence, Quentin Tarantino only serves to prove in this effort that in spite of all his pretensions, he is no Paul Verhoeven. In spite of his efforts to pull the same literal crucifixion of his hero, no emotional connection to The Bride is ever offered. The Bride is simply a loud bitch who kills people in front of their families or sadistically chops them apart. No good reason is given to want to see the bad guys dead, and thus the emotional impact of their death is non-existent.To its credit, Kill Bill part one is very entertaining when one doesn't know what is going to happen next. The weird Kung Fu-style mentoring scenes with the swordsmith and the hospital scenes certainly stand out. The problem is that once you know what is going to happen, it just gets incredibly dull. The House Of Blue Leaves is probably one of the worst examples of music in a film I've seen outside of a blaxploitation effort. I would have given real money for that band to shut the hell up. Obviously, Tarantino was never told about what an impact the right music in a given scene can have upon the dynamics of a scene.Uma Thurman was also a poor choice for the heroine. Someone like Lucy Liu, I could believe doing all these things, but Uma comes off as being too homely and sedate. Not to mention that she looks like she's from another planet, although that might have been an intentional aspect of her casting. In the end, I wanted to see Julie Dreyfus in action.I gave Kill Bill, Vol. 1 a five out of ten. It is excellent proof of that old saying about first impressions being the best impressions. It is worth renting once, and once only.",5,1,3,21 September 2004
Saw II," We need more like this
","Like its predecessor, Saw II proves that not only is there a market for hardcore, adult-oriented material, Hollywood is only hurting itself by ignoring the fact. Made for a mere estimated four million dollars, Saw II has already given a RoboCop-like return to the tune of eighty million, and it is only just coming to the home video market. To call this a spit in the face of the Everything Must Be Suitable For Four Year Olds mentality that is making Hollywood painful is like calling a nuclear missile a subtle expression of disdain. But I am getting ahead of myself here. All the box office data in the world does not mean a thing without the answer to an exceedingly simple question. Namely, is the film any good? Does it keep one interested during its running length? The answer to these questions, in spite of a few artistic decisions I am not sure I agree with, is a big yes. Everything that the horror film industry got wrong in the late 1980s or early 1990s, Saw II gets right. The film gets them very right, as a matter of fact.Saw II has a similar plot to its predecessor, but with some important differences. The scope of the story is broader, the cast is larger, and the game is more complex. Where the original revolved around two men chained to the piping in a disused bathroom, this sequel gives us a small group of very confused characters who all have unsavoury histories. In Repo Man, we are told by Agent Rodgersz that no one is innocent. Darren Lynn Bousman and Leigh Whannell must have been paying attention during this shot, because the only character in their script for Saw II that comes remotely close to appearing innocent is Daniel, the son of the detective portrayed with a great fury by Donnie Wahlberg. As Daniel attempts to survive by psychologically manipulating his peers, Wahlberg's Eric Matthews tries to coerce Jigsaw into being a little less exceedingly obvious. Tobin Bell once again gives us a stunning portrayal of a madman who just wants people to appreciate what they take for granted. He survives the comparison to classic film villains such as Darth Vader brilliantly.Obviously, when the budget on your film is this small, you are not going to have elaborate special effects or amazing feats of action. The real kicker in Saw II, like its predecessor, is in the fiendish traps and puzzles designed by the production team. It is impossible to describe these traps to someone who has not seen their kind before. It is also impossible to explain exactly what Jigsaw is doing without giving away the plot. Suffice to say that Jigsaw is extremely literal. As one reviewer has pointed out, one of the trademarks of the old 1980s serial killer characters that devolved in annoyances with the progression of sequels is that everything must be complicated beyond belief. When Jigsaw speaks, it makes the film exceptionally enjoyable to bear in mind that he is never lying or elaborating. It is the people he speaks to who defeat themselves by assuming complication and deception where none exists. We should be able to say this kind of dialogue and plotting is not unique, but in a manner of speaking, it is. But as I indicated earlier, this is by no means the only way in which the Saw films set an example others should follow.I have but one complaint about Saw II. Where its predecessor was a tad overlong at a hundred minutes, Saw II feels too short. Yes, it is well-paced and holds the viewer's interest for its entire running time, but in expanding the cast, Saw II presents a few too many characters in too little time. Some of the deaths are just too brief, and some characters could have done with a little more background. The upside to this is that in contrast to some films that are short and yet feel too long, Saw II leaves the viewer waiting for more. If every film that ran for ninety-three minutes could say the same, Hollywood and its product might just be experiencing a little less consumer hostility. While I cannot say anything about the ending for fear of spoiling the surprise, I will say that the performances of Shawnee Smith and Donnie Wahlberg will leave this scene echoing in the viewer's memory long after the credits roll. Tobin Bell also gets in a few cracking lines, but this truly is Smith's and Wahlberg's show, through and through. Both deserve far more work than they have received of late.I gave Saw II a nine out of ten. It is not the kind of life-affirming experience that I found X-Men 2 or Eegah to be, but it does give one hope for the future of film. See it with a friend, or with someone who likes to do something with their brain while they wear their eyes down. You will both be glad you did.",9,1,1,15 February 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton delivers once again
","If you consider being made to sit in the school library and watch the 1971 adaptation of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory starring Gene Wilder a happy memory, this film is not for you. No, in making Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton goes back to what he does best, making films for people who share his refined sense of individuality, and in so doing makes something that would not have author Roald Dahl turning his back on the film industry. The difference is in respect for the audience. Willy Wonka (henceforth, WWATCF) presumed that by selling only to the four year olds in the audience, it could make a quick buck. Yet those who rubbish CATCF want you to believe it is nothing but a cynical exercise in making cash. Can we say 'hypocrisy', boys and girls? Anyway, Burton sets himself apart from other adapters of existing source material in the same manner he accomplished this on 1989's Batman. Namely, by taking the saccharine pump and not only reducing its output, but switching the damned thing off altogether.Key to this approach of saccharine-free film-making is the cast. Much has already been said of Depp's performance as the famed chocolatier, so more on him anon. The real pleasant surprise here is in the support cast. Arguably the most pleasant surprise of all is David Kelly in the role of Grandpa Joe. Rather than adopt the 'oldie knows best' routine that comes as a spit in the face to everyone on the same spectrum that Helena Bonham Carter is convinced Tim is on, Kelly portrays Grandpa Joe as a demure, helpful guardian who is simply there to keep Charlie out of harm's way. He is more akin to the real Doctor Who here than what those of us who grew up in the 1980s expect from a 'children's story'. And while her part is small, Helena Bonham Carter is no slouch in the acting department, either. Putting on the affect of a woman who lives in what appears to be a one-room house with six other people is no easy task for someone who is not really living it, so she deserves credit for playing the part so well.But the biggest surprise in the film by far is Deep Roy as the entire Oompa Loompa tribe. Rather than simply present them as caricatures that are seemingly designed to induce nausea, Burton and Roy create the illusion that Wonka really found them in the heart of a great jungle and made a deal with them fairly typical of the time in which the novel was written. While they certainly all appear similar, there is a sense of individuality about them that the 1971 film could not have achieved had it hired the entire population of Australia as extras. But the real gem in Burton's film is one shared with Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Namely, a former television poster boy by the name of Johnny Depp. Just as Depp's acting provides the heart and soul of either man named Ed, his acting here is what makes Willy Wonka seem three-dimensional. Forget the nauseating, vapid anthem about what the candyman can do, Depp makes it plainly obvious, as Dahl likely intended, that what the candyman cannot do is far more important.Roald Dahl once said that the formula behind his success as a children's story author was conspiring with children against adults. Burton follows this formula like a roadmap, as the introduction of the four children Charlie embarks on the tour with makes clear. While the casual viewer will walk away thinking of the children as monsters, the clear message of the story is that these children would be very different indeed if their parents behaved differently. It is a story that, unfortunately, parents of the real world never quite seem to learn the lesson from as youngsters are sent to face the world with inadequate education, training, or even logic. If you really believe that Charlie is not an indictment upon parenting flaws taken to their logical extreme, then take note of how every child in the film is a replica to a disturbing degree of their parents. Just as Charlie mirrors his parents' patient, passive nature, his four companions on the tour mirror their parents' lack of will, hygiene, or intelligence. It is a terrible shame Roald Dahl did not live to see this film made, for I suspect he would have quite enjoyed seeing that someone in Hollywood finally 'got it'.If I did have to state a complaint about the film, it would be that the story seems a little off the pace. Scenes designed to explain Willy Wonka's immense interest in the manufacture of sweet consumables slow the story to a crawl, in spite of masterful performances by Christopher Lee. Fortunately, they add up to a payoff with Depp and Lee portraying the reconciling father and son in the manner of two great professionals. The only other problem is that the mostly-CGI sets give the film an unreal, artificial sheen that, while preferable to the Play School style of sets seen in the 1971 film, gets a little hard on the eyes after a while. Not that I normally have a problem with CGI, but we all have our limits as to when a good thing becomes too much. The scene with Charlie's companions leaving the chocolate factory in various warped forms after suffering the consequences of their inability to respect Wonka's house rules is somewhat difficult to watch for this reason. It does not look fake, per se, it is just disturbing to look at, which I am not sure was the intention.All in all, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory circa 2005 is a nine out of ten film. If you enjoy seeing people who talk to children as if they have an IQ to match their age getting slapped in the face, this film is for you.",9,1,3,23 March 2007
"Girl, Interrupted"," Interesting time capsule...
","From the years 1800 to 1960, very little progress was made in the understanding or treatment of mental illness. Part of this stagnation had to do with the fact that religious repression of medical science was still being shaken off at the time, but the biggest culprit was the inability of society to wake up and realise that just because a fat suit behind a desk said all was well didn't necessarily make it so. Given that Australia calls itself the 'lucky country' in spite of having the highest youth suicide rate in the entire world, it doesn't appear that we'll be getting over that hurdle any time soon.But the treatment of the mentally ill in the 1960s is a radically different beast to what it has been since the patenting of Prozac and Zoloft in the mid 1990s. In the 1960s, it was belived by medical staff of all walks that patients of any description had no real rights, and that they had better do what was ordered or look out. Nowadays, hospitals and doctors can be taken to court for trying to make a patient take pills without informing them of what the pills are meant to do. That's one area where progress has been made, and films like this are useful in this way as they provide a bit of information about how things used to be. Maybe in another thirty years, they will make a film about the treatment of mental patients in the 1990s. I'll probably get around to writing my own memoirs by then, so Hollywood can give me a call if they are interested. I have some stories that will make their ears bleed.That's the one flaw with this film. The results of the primitive and often excessive treatments given in this film are very much prettied-up for the Hollywood audience. The 1960s is a time when such things as Deep Sleep Therapy, a treatment where patients were put into drug-induced comas and given ECT, were thought of as a good idea. Many a patient was killed by this treatment, and to not have such barbarisms mentioned at all in a film that is almost entirely set in a mental hospital is a mistake.Winona Ryder in the lead role is a bit of a non-event. While it is true that she resembles a lot of archival photos of the real Susanna Kaysen, her flat-as-a-plank delivery makes her patently unconvincing. In a real mental hospital where patients are often climbing the walls, it is truly difficult to believe that this woman would be kept there for the entirety of a day. If anyone needs to know why Angelina Jolie is one of the most well-regarded actors of her generation despite some shocking script choices, this is the film to look at. She truly steals the show here, and absorbs every last bit of audience sympathy. She acts rings around the entire cast, including Whoopi Goldberg.All in all, I gave this film a seven out of ten. It is just too prettied-up to have any impact, but it does provide an interesting look at how far things have come (as well as remained the same) in around thirty or forty years.",8,4,5,28 August 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," Leone turned down The Godfather to make this. It was the right decision.
","Don't get me wrong, I love The Godfather and all, but the story does not suit Sergio Leone's unique and distinctly European style of direction. Once Upon A Time In America, on the other hand, was a story practically made for the man. Running at over three and a half hours in the most complete cut known to exist today, its pace might be leisurely and its action incidental, but one other thing it has in common with other Leone films is that it is never slow or boring. As a film about gangsters, it is a fine example. As a film about looking back upon the twists and turns life can take, it is a masterpiece. Although there are moments when its sets or props reveal the time the film was shot in, OUATIA is a timeless exploration of how the bonds between boys stretch, alter, and even break as they become men. The tagline ('As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did.') is surprisingly accurate in summarising the film in spite of the fact that it gives very little away. It was Leone's last film, and a more fitting memorial simply does not exist in the medium.Ironically, for a film directed by a man who has yet to be equalled for using the 2.35:1 frame in a dynamic fashion, Once Upon A Time In America is the first film Leone shot in the 1.85:1 ratio. I have to confess the cinematography disappointed me somewhat, with this narrower composition clearly allowing fewer opportunities for creative crowd shots. However, there still are fine examples abound of why a film should never be pared down to fit the box-like television that is now thankfully on its way into the kind of nostalgic past that this film spends a lot of its time depicting. Complementing the visuals is a score by Ennio Morricone that, while recalling shades of C'era Una Volta Il West, also provides a more subtle, emotional undercurrent for the visuals. The strings and choir heard when a rather young Jennifer Connelly is visible remind one of the haunting soloist heard when Jill McBain steps out into the train station being built at the end of the aforementioned C'era Una Volta Il West, only it is just as good and far more restrained.Of course, no film can be what it is without actors, and Once Upon A Time In America has some of the best. The featurette included with the DVD-Video edition features James Woods describing how privileged he feels to have worked with Leone, and his performance in the film indicates he felt that way from the first. De Niro is also impeccable as the adult Noodles, portraying a young man, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man filled with regret using equal levels of skill and artistry. But in a contrast to Leone's other films, the surprise here is in the bit parts, where even the small walk-ons are portrayed with aplomb. Also surprising are the performances of the youngsters who portray our heroes during the earlier stages of the story. The aforementioned Connelly is a delight to watch, but Scott Tiler and Rusty Jacobs excel as youthful versions of De Niro and Woods. Even if you dispute Leone's composition and writing skills, one thing this film erases all doubts about is his ability to choose the right actors for the roles. Or perhaps he just brought out the very best in people.Roger Ebert has said that editing is the soul of the cinema. He also said it was The Brown Bunny's salvation. In the case of Once Upon A Time In America, excessive editing was its damnation. For some reason too illogical to contemplate, the distributors chose to cut OUATIA from its intended length down to a little more than two hours. As Ebert has also mentioned, this decision, as well as that to arrange the scenes in a chronological fashion, made the film seem far longer than the more complete 229-minute cut, and also deprived it of that critical ability to make sense. If you hear someone telling you that this film is lousy or not well-paced, make sure to ask them which version they have seen. Leone has said that he would have liked the film to be anywhere from 250 to 265 minutes. One can only wonder what this other footage would have revealed, but alas, it is in a raw and possibly unusable state. Leone reportedly wished to finish these scenes for a future release, but we all know what happened next, sadly.The use of transitions is also nothing short of brilliant. Early in the film, we hear a telephone ringing quite persistently, and the first twenty or so minutes feel quite disjointed. It is a testament to how well the film comes together that not only do all the pieces fit together like a sports car, the sound of a telephone ringing later in the film feels quite ominous. It is also a testament to the makeup artists' skill that Robert De Niro and James Woods appear at the chronological end of the film looking so old and ragged. About the only slip-up is that several of the main characters change eye-colour when they switch from their adult to child incarnations, and vice versa. For a younger cinemaphile seeing the film for the first time, it can be fun simply to see actors we have been taught to revere in the roles they played before they made portraying mobsters seem routine. After seeing OUATIA, I have developed a whole new appreciation for James Woods as an actor.Out of ten, OUATIA is an unqualfied ten. Were I asked to choose a hundred films to send to an alien planet to demonstrate the creativity of mankind, at least two of them would be Leone's work, and OUATIA is certainly one of them.",10,6,15,20 June 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," The only negative to this movie...
","...is that people mistake it for being an accurate reflection of an entire genre. In its purest form, British doom metal was actually concieved as a form of rebellion against an agonisingly empty and desperate existence in a city that still had bomb damage left over from World War II. Similarly, Norwegian black metal was concieved as a form of rebellion against a Christian government that had stripped the country of its rightful heritage. So no, neither art form (and those are they only basic true forms of the music that plastic bands of the 1980s like Poison et al were trying to imitate) is as childish or asinine as this mockumentary wishes they were. They both are marked by strong social, political, and psychological messages that ring very true even thirty years after the first album of the elder genre came out.As a sendup of the lame, plastic, tryhard imitations that the major record labels of the 1980s flooded the market with in a cheap attempt to weaken the legacy set by Black Sabbath in the 1970s (and still admirably held up by such bands as Cathedral and My DyING BRIDE), however, Spinal Tap is impeccable. In fact, one can argue that the message of This Is Spinal Tap is to remain true to yourself. Spinal Tap are obviously a clone of all those bands out there that were created in order to fill a booming market, and the film shows what happened to the 'Tap when the fickle tastes of the market changed, leaving them out in the cold. In that sense, it was well ahead of its time, as the market for soft, poppy versions of what Napalm Death and Cathedral did so well during the mid 1980s and early 1990s (respectively) didn't actually dry up for another six or seven years after the film's release. Excellent foresight.Another myth that this film puts forward is that a band will sound the same regardless of who is drumming. Anyone who's heard the difference between the My DyING BRIDE albums of 1991-1996 and then heard the two that were released in 1998 and 1999 will tell you this is far from the case. While it is hard to distinguish oneself on the drums, those who achieve it are all the more notable for doing so. But one thing I like about this film is how it illustrates one truth: the more effort a band puts into posing, the more plain and ordinary their music generally sounds.So if you're searching for an accurate reflection of a musical genre, then skip this film and grab the remastered version of Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid' album instead. But if you want to laugh yourself senseless at some jokes about poser stupidity and some hilarious references (one guitarist's voice is identical to a manager's from Led Zeppelin's 'Song Remains The Same' movie), then this is the film for you.",Null,1,4,13 November 2000
The Mummy Returns," Better than some would make out...
","When The Mummy hit theatres in 1999, critics everywhere panned it as being a poor man's Indiana Jones. While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.The Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.Most people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there, but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is matinee-style material at its (almost) best. Get the DVD when it comes out, it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over.",Null,74,88,21 May 2001
Saw," Not the classic people say it is, but quite good, nonetheless
","With the film industry reportedly experiencing major downturns in its intake, and studios contemplating bankruptcy, stagnation is the order of the day in mainstream film. Everything must be toned down in order to appeal to the broadest audience in a curious disregard for the fact that trying to please everyone ends up pleasing no one. Yet Hollywood seemed genuinely surprised that this film, made for a mere 1.2 million US dollars, made back fifteen times its budget and then some on its opening weekend. I can sum it up quite simply. Saw is the first horror film in over a decade to recognise that its audience will almost exclusively be made up of adults, and plays its material accordingly. In case some glass-eyed film executive reads this comment, I cannot stress enough the difference this makes. Saw and its sequel (which I actually watched first) are the first two horror films, at least if you go by production date, that have actually made me horrified since I was in my teens. Perhaps its success will finally mean the end of all the I Know What Your Breasts Did Last Summer types.Yet for such a remarkable film, Saw's premise is amazingly simple. Two men wake up in a filthy bathroom, unable to remember how they got there. As one begins to fearfully wonder if one of his kidneys is missing, we learn the other is a surgeon. Slowly, we are filled in on the existence of a bizarre serial killer whose chief delight is in testing how far his victims will go in order to preserve their lives. In so doing, he puts his victims in traps, then very casually explains to them how they can get out. The kicker is that he does not lie to them or hide the salient details from them. He gives them a very good, and very obvious, clue. So obvious, in fact, that our victims often overlook it. In the case of the two men in the bathroom, for example, he leaves them chained to pipes against a wall, with hacksaws to be easily found. The pipes and the chains are too strong to be sawn through in the time it would take them to starve to death. Those who have seen the original Mad Max will know exactly where this puzzle is going (one has to wonder if this was a deliberate reference).Surprisingly for a film with such a low budget, Saw also contains a few recognisable faces. Danny Glover is the most famous man to appear in Saw, and one has to wonder exactly how such a cheap production secured his services. A Nicholson-like promise of box office percentage comes to mind. Shawnee Smith gives a brief turn as the one victim of Jigsaw to get away, and it is remarkable that for a character whose vocabulary mostly consists of screaming and crying, her performance is quite watchable. Dina Meyer fills in for a scene as a detective, but her role probably amounted to less than a day's work on this set. Her role is considerably expanded in the sequel, which was green-lit the weekend that this film opened. But it is the performance of Tobin Bell, the man who plays Jigsaw, that really hooks the viewer. For the most part, one only hears his voice, and I am not going to spoil the surprise, but suffice to say that you see him throughout most of the film. When it is finally revealed who he is, you will not know whether to laugh, cry, or throw up.Yet, for all its simple charm, Saw is not without problems. The cameo-like appearances of some actors is somewhat jarring, and plot threads that feature them often seem to go nowhere. Shawnee and Dina get about five minutes of screen time at the most, and some of the scenes they appear in leave one to wonder what happened to this or that plot idea. It is also very difficult to make a film that focuses on two men in a room retain its tension, and the director seems to recognise this, too. There are an awful lot of sequences outside of the room showing the situation of ancillary characters where leaving it to the viewer's imagination would have worked so much better. I suspect that the director realised this in the sequel, too, because aside from moments of the police trying to find where the victims are, the entire film focused instead on seeing the situation through their eyes. So yes, there are some flaws to Saw, and it is not a ten out of ten film, but it comes so much closer than anything else the majors have the nerve to call horror these days.In all, I gave Saw an eight out of ten. It is truly deserving of the cult and mainstream following has, even if it is not a masterpiece. If Saw and its success does not wake the MPAA up to the fact that people are sick of their modern Hayes Code, then they ought to be cast aside.",8,1,2,12 December 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's best film
","I guess I am what you would call a complete non-fan of Stanley Kubrick, although I would never call him a pervert (displaying sex in your films hardly makes you this) or proclaim thankfulness at his passing away. I do, however, find that it is hard to enjoy all but two of his films: Dr. Strangelove and this one.The reason why A Clockwork Orange is Kubrick's best effort is because it is his most faithful adaptation. Just about every Kubrick film was based on literature of some sort, and he almost always messed up translating it to screen. You can see this in Full Metal Jacket, where he leaves out more than half of The Short Timers in spite of its very short length. A Clockwork Orange also sees Kubrick leaving out details of his source material, but in all but one case, these weren't important. I'll deal with the one that is.Stanley Kubrick's conception of the ending was based upon the American version of the novel, which simply ends with Alex having the effects of the Ludovico technique reversed. While this is a neat ending that allows one to speculate about his next step in life, it cuts out the very heart of Anthony Burgess' story, one that is especially relevant in this day and age where child psychologists are shoving Ritalin down children's necks like mobsters electrocuting dogs so they'll be hungrier to tear into one another. That point, in a nutshell, is that being bad by choice is far preferable to being good because you have no other option. When Alex is suffering the vengeance of the so-called good folk, you just wish he could get up and start smacking the crap out of them again. In the chapter of the novel when he gets that back, seeing him make the choice to live a normal, peaceful existence anyway is a great triumph of the will over mind control. Not including that in the film was a big mistake, and it is a matter of record that Burgess was more than a little upset with the US publisher as a result.The reason why Kubrick's film is preferable to the novel, however, is that the novel often borders on being incomprehensible. Rather than asking you to read and try to decipher a very unstructured slang, the film just shows you what Alex is talking about, giving it to you in clear red, green, and blue. The novel is very rewarding if you get through it, but it smacks of having been written as a political statement and takes a lot of effort, which gets in the way of the horror factor. Sometimes, being able to sit back and watch is a big advantage.Nonetheless, Kubrick's film has earned him my respect as a filmmaker. He did this his way, he tried to make art in his pictures, and he even managed to succeed at points like this. Which is more than I can say for the Wachowskis and Tarantinos of this world.",Null,2,3,16 September 2001
Total Recall," Another Verhoeven masterpiece...
","Everyone in this film is at their best: Paul Verhoeven, Sharon Stone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox, and even that dummy they used for Johnnycab. Yes, that last one was a joke. Just another film that was ripped off in order to create The Matrix, Total Recall's claim to fame is being the first film to be released in Australia with two seperate VHS versions. Of course, the R-rated VHS version was deleted due to commercial reasons, but we Verhoeven fans are having the last laugh now that DVD-Video is driving VHS towards its well-deserved extinction, with the full R-rated cut available in all its digital gory glory.I wonder if anyone actually kept a tally of the number of people that were killed during this film? More people get shot during Doug Quaid's escape from the subway station than during the entirety of End Of Days, and Total Recall is still Arnold's best film ever. I'm not sure if it still is financially, but it certainly is in terms of plot and acting. Ronny Cox puts in a performance that, like his turn in RoboCop, I like to think of as an exhibition of a schoolteacher with some guts. Michael Ironside is a delight to watch in this film... it was like watching myself in a film where someone's turned the clock ahead by about thirty years. Sharon Stone, of course, proves that even with the massive improvement granted to all involved, she still can't act, but she is only in the film for a total of about fifteen minutes at most. My only complaint about the film is that I wish they'd cast someone a little more appealing or believeable as Mileena. She was the only weak spot in the film as far as I am concerned.When Paul Verhoeven commits himself to a film, you know he's going to give it his all, regardless. Even when he churns out a real turkey, it is plain to see in elements thereof that he put his heart and soul into it. When he builds a total masterpiece like Total Recall, which is rumoured to still be less violent than the cut he originally wanted, he puts that much more oomph into every aspect of the film that you just can't help but watch. Violence and intellectual stimulation have been the two saviours of my life to date, and Total Recall provides them both in spades. Nine out of ten (ten for the director's cut when it comes out some day).",Null,0,4,3 April 2001
Pretty Woman," They don't make them like this anymore (thank the stars...)
","Usually, I am in two minds when I view any film. I want to be entertained, but I want to be entertained in a fashion that doesn't completely disrespect reality or my intelligence. Unfortunately, films like Pretty Woman, and pretty much everything Julia Roberts has ever been in, do both.Granted, I have been prejudiced against fairy tales for a long time, but that was only through learning that they were, in actuality, religious stories from ancient, more respectable cultures that the Christian menace had stolen, rewritten, and basically stripped of all their significance. Unfortunately, Pretty Woman takes this even further by taking a modern 'fairy tale' and stripping it of even the most vague connection with reality.Every adolescent boy has a fantasy about meeting the proverbial 'hooker with a heart of gold', but those who have experienced it in real life will always tell you that it always ends in tears. Anyone who thinks that a woman can work the streets for as long as is implied in the character while retaining the youthful appearance of Roberts and remaining disease-free needs help. Seriously.So is there a redeeming feature to this turkey? Well, Laura San Giacomo puts in a reasonable performance with the limited time she has, but she has appeared in much better films both before and since. Aside from that, it's just another example of Julia Roberts phoning in her performance with an expression on her face that conjures up mental images of a brain-dead chipmunk. And yet they decided to give her the Oscar in 2000 rather than Connie Nielsen. I think the rumours that the entire Academy just picks a winner at random and never watches films at all are actually true.",Null,1,2,6 May 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A great example of the UK's superiority to the USA...
","England has Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels... what does America have? Pulp Fiction. Says it all really. Unlike Pulp Fiction, LSTSB is actually funny, entertaining, and it coincides with things that happen in real life. The score music makes it as funny as hell, and the dialogue is so riveting that listening to the film from start to finish is almost mandatory. When was the last time you saw an American crime story with these attributes?At it's heart, LSTSB is a story of four young men who invest their money in a card game that turns out to be rigged, and they wind up owing five times their investment. They then have a week to come up with the cash before they start losing fingers. But what really makes this film is the myriad of stories that are interwoven with this central theme. The grass-growing hippies, the thugs who plan to rob them, and the insane black crimelord who actually employs them are the main ones here. Then there's the bumbling idiots who are employed by the crimelord our four heroes owe money to, who are entrusted with the task of stealing antique shotguns. Oh, and let's not forget the machinations of Big Chris, who spends most of the film being so polite to the people he's employed to rough up that it immediately brings up images of 'Chopper' Read. Trying to find good guys amongst this lot is somewhat like trying to find a good Tarantino film.The best part of the film is undoubtedly Rory Breaker's conversation with Nick The Greek, the one in which he finds an affinity for repeating 'I'll kill ya!' several times. But unlike most American films where everyone is vying for their unfair share of clever dialogue, everyone gets a chance to say something funny in this film and it all flows together so smoothly like a mid-1970s David Bowie album.The best way to watch LSTSB is in groups, with the sort of people who don't normally watch British movies. They're usually the ones who laugh the most due to the surprise factor.",Null,1,1,17 February 2001
Titanic," James Cameron's worst film
","I've seen a lot of overblown films in my lifetime, and I know that a lot of people believe the credibility of the Oscars died when Tom Hanks won two Best Actor awards in sequential years, but this film is what really killed the Oscars. The idea that Ben Hur could set a record for winning the most is hilarious when the story is taken into account, but the idea that such a contrived load of nonsense like this could equal it while a really well-made film like Gladiator only gets four awards... well, you get the picture.I won't bore you with a detailed speech about the plot, because I am sure that anyone reading this will have been subjected to exactly that enough times already. Instead, I will just go through some of the things that really stood out in this film.One thing that always bugs me about this film is how James Cameron claims to pay attention to the most minute detail in his films, and yet the pistol used by Billy Zane has pretty much been positively confirmed by numerous gun collectors as not having been put into production at the time the film was made. It would have been more factually accurate to put a gun from the old Spaghetti Westerns in this film, as a matter of fact. Another thing that flies right in the face of the facts is that a rich power-mad family such as that which our heroine is from would basically beat it into their daughters from birth that they had to take any crap a suitor would dish out at them. It might have been politically incorrect to put this on the screen, but that's the way the society such websites as ChristianAnswers.net wants us to return to actually functioned.Another aspect of the film that bothers me is Leonard DiCraprio. When we first hear his dialogue about his world travels, well, I was laughing, because he hardly looks old enough to go to the coffee shop unsupervised. Kate looked like she outweighed him by a good fifty pounds, at least, and I'm sure the other passengers who were slumming it in steerage would have introduced him to the concept of how prisoners love each other. There's nothing quite like a guy who looks like a girl after being locked in a dank, smelly hole with your average underclass member of a repressive society for a few months. Naturally, the film goes out of its way to make you hate the rest of the passengers, so the proposed idea of having Arnold Schwarzenegger blow up the iceberg and save the day wouldn't have saved the film anyway. Unfortunately, I also found Kate's character rather unconvincing a lot of the time, too. Her behaviour just doesn't quite sync up with what you'd expect out of a girl from a circa-191X family of inbreeders.In short, this film was nothing more than James Cameron's cynical pulling of the strings attached to the heart of every 12-50 year old woman who really ought to know better. Once the cinema-screen impact of the sinking is gone, there is nothing to endear the film to anyone who either has a brain in their head or likes to be made seasick. Instead, what we have is yet another marketing exercise from the mainstream media that pretty much proves ninety percent of people in the world can be told what they want instead of given it. Cameron just hasn't done a good film since Aliens because his ego is way out of control. And boy, does Titanic prove that in a big way.",Null,2,4,30 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I outgrew this film and its source material when I was a fetus
","My sister, bless her heart, used to work in a bookstore, and brought the novel this turkey is based upon home one day. After everyone else in my family had read it, I decided to give it a go because I had little better to do at the time. I wound up throwing the book across the room in around thirty pages, feeling that not only had my intelligence been insulted, so too had the already-persecuted-enough faiths of Wicca and its pagan relatives.So when I was given the chance to see this film for free, as long as I delivered my considered opinion to the local distributor when it was all over, I knew I should have let someone else take the assignment. But I just couldn't let fate smack me in the face once without giving it a chance to even out the marks. I basically had a similar reaction to the film that I did to the book: I walked out on it in about thirty minutes. As for what I told the local distributor, it runs something along the lines of missing the book's feeble, so-obvious-it-will-make-you-shake-your-head-in-despair attempts at satire and not being all that well-acted to boot. It is nothing more than a 152-minute commercial for a bunch of merchandise that is basically useless and prone to falling apart, but it does have Harry's visage on it.Since this film has been released in Australia, there has been constant comparisons between it and the upcoming Lord Of The Rings adaptations. There is no comparison for the following reasons: LOTR treats its audiences with respect, LOTR treats the faiths, cultures, and peoples it takes a lot of its details from with respect, and LOTR is not aimed at the lowest possible common denominator. Now that I have that out of the way, I'll just sit back and bask in my superiority to HP fans until the local distributor gets around to releasing LOTR this boxing day. :P",1,4,11,24 December 2001
The Untouchables," A slight misfire
","The story of Al Capone, his legendary control over the underworld of Chicago in the 1930s, and the policemen who made it their life's mission to have him convicted in court, is one that has been told and retold countless times over. So when it is told again, the new version generally needs to have something to set it apart. The problem with The Untouchables is that it doesn't have a whole lot to set it apart from any mob story, leave alone one based on the life of Al Capone.In this effort, Capone is played with gutso by Robert De Niro, who seems to be every director's first choice for a mobster film. De Niro plays the legendary figure as a fat, arrogant bastard. Whether this is accurate or not, De Niro plays it so well that it really doesn't matter. It is so easy to believe in his Capone that in a way, it makes the film.The same cannot be said of Kevin Costner, who gets to play famed lawman Eliot Ness. In 1987, when Costner was a relatively unknown actor, it was a lot easier to believe in this portrayal. But as Costner's projects got grander and grander in scale, a certain kind of trend was noticed. In essence, the manner in which Costner portrayed Eliot Ness was more or less identical to how he has played in every film since. Even The Postman or 3000 Miles To Graceland have him displaying little, if any, variation from his standard stock character. Under these conditions, casting Sean Connery, a veteran of playing every character in such a manner that they cannot be distinguished, seems like an incredibly bad move, even if he raises the acting above the level of a TV drama.Spare a thought for Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith. Their roles are so underdeveloped that they often exist merely to provide an extra gun or some plot movement. Although it is kind of amusing when the accountant starts showing a good dose of the Rambo-syndrome, the next scene when Connery uses a corpse to gain information from one of the few survivors on the mob side shows a kind of energy that, as Ebert so eloquently put it, the rest of the film lacks.Credit where credit is due. The world of the 1930s is very effectively reproduced here. Even if you've only seen the so-called golden era in photos, it's hard to escape how convincingly it is recreated in each frame of the film. Unfortunately, it makes the general unconvincing nature of the rest of the film all the more difficult to understand. One can't help but ask if anyone's heart was in it.In all, I am giving The Untouchables a five out of ten. I would have given it a six, but Robert De Niro's set pieces also seem so cut off from the rest of the film that one can't help but wonder if they were put in as an afterthought.",5,0,4,31 July 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," A triumph of facades and pressure-marketing over substance
","I've been on holidays with my family up in Queensland for a while, and when I get bored enough, I just have to go and see films. It was two for $10 night at the local theatre, and since I had seen everything I actually wanted to see, my father insisted that we go and see what I like to call The Mushtrix Rehashed. We might as well have flushed that $10 down the nearest toilet, for a number of reasons.I tried to go in with an open mind. No, really, I did - what else can you do when you want to be entertained? I said to myself that I would respect this sequel if it managed to justify its own existence in terms of storytelling. Well, guess what? I didn't even accomplish that much. Talk about going in with low expectations and not even having them fulfilled.I think the most telling moment, however, was when the fight sequences only used slow motion for a handful of seconds and yet we still got bored with them. During the moment when Neo first fights Smith, I turned to my dad and asked him if I was supposed to do something with a control pad. A later comment that he made was that just about every sequence in the film went on past its welcome. Which reminds me, was the pathetic camera-work meant to hide the fact that the writers still haven't gotten past plaigirising Once Upon A Time In China?I think that summed up most of the film, in fact. Not only that, but how are you meant to give a stuff about characters and whether they win fights or not when the rules of victory are never defined? You could put these agents in blocks of concrete and drop them into the ocean, but they'd still say 'ha! I'll have this body now!'. It is childish and insulting to the intelligence. Not even Star Trek overuses Plot Crowbars such as Deus Ex Machina this much. Now that Star Trek: Nemesis has killed the Trek franchise, will we be remembering telephones in twenty years time as the ultimate Deus Ex Machina? Or Neo?Whatever you do, don't get me started on the sequences within Zion. I just hope that Plato is spinning in his grave hard enough to add a slight eccentricity to this planet's orbit. I'm also willing to bet messers Wachowski were also a little too receptive to certain scenes with Christopher Lee during The Two Towers. And I will say this only once - you know a film is in trouble when key action sequences remind one of The Fast And The Furious. Have these guys ever had an original idea?I also find it quite painful when people praise this cinematic abortion as a masterwork while pointing out The Phantom Menace's or Attack Of The Clods' wretched dialogue at every opportunity. The only writer who compares to Lucas or Whackoffski's obvious lack of knowledge about how human beings really speak or form linguistic traits is Shakespeare. I remember having an incredible urge to get out of my seat and scream 'speak naturally!' at half the cast. But then, what can you expect when the lead hero plays his roles all the same way - like a coffee table?On a slightly more positive note, at least they kept the masturbatory contemporary music out until the end credits. Unfortunately, the number they do choose is so utterly pathetic that it makes me shed a tear for the fact that a film that is supposed to somehow praise the beauty of individualistic thought only serves to remind me how much we've all lost an important aspect of our freedom. This boring load of over-hyped, overrated rubbish honestly couldn't have been more upsetting if the theatre was required to seatbelts in their chairs. Since the IMDb rating system does not allow a score of zero, I gave The Matrix Rehashed a two out of ten. It is not even bad enough to be entertaining. It is just plain tried.",2,1,2,21 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Easily the best thing that has come out all year...
","It would be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. In fact, it is a better film. I say that primarily because I am sick to death of Americans using World War II as a basis for films that generally amount to little more than propaganda. Of course, Enemy At The Gates comes off as being somewhat fantastic due to its attempt to balance entertainment with historical fact, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it all the more entertaining to watch.A lot of historians have it that the battle of Stalingrad was the most unpleasant one fought during the second World War, and this film's set design and cinematography capture that impeccably. When the Russians are battling the Nazis, you get the idea that if the Nazis didn't kill them, malnutrition, tetanus, scurvy, bubonic plague, or a million other things would. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes lend authenticity to their roles that makes it even easier to follow them on their personal journey through hell, and Ed Harris is scarily convincing as a high-ranking Nazi. The real surprise here, however, is Rachel Weisz as Sergeant Tania Chernova, and the very heart and soul of the film. When she describes the reasons why she decided to take up a gun and battle the Germans, it all makes so much sense that you just want to buy the poor girl a beer and give her a good warm embrace. Not that such things would erase the scars that her character bears, but one would feel obligated to try.Writer/Director Jean-Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. It's very tricky to get these two things in proper sync, but they more than manage here. They also don't rely on any hokey photographic effects to tell the story, simply letting you see everything as clearly as possible, letting your imagination do the rest. Anyone who's read anything credible about the inhuman suffering the Russian soldiers endured during this battle will have no trouble filling in the gaps that the narrative leaves about their living conditions. The blood and gore shown during the battles is also very conducive to the atmosphere. Rather than just expecting you to believe that a solider gets his stomach spread all over half a kilometer of pavement by enemy bullets, they show you so you can get a feel for how bloodthirsty both sides in the confrontation were. Even the sex scene doesn't look out of place here.To make a long story short, this is the first film I've seen in a long, long time that I haven't been able to come up with a list of criticisms for. It is simply excellent, and the 7.1 rating it is currently stuck with does not do it justice. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and it is miles above the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbour. Vassili Zaitsev would be very happy that his struggle has inspired such a commendable piece of art - it is exactly the sort of thing he and millions of others like him (on both sides of the planet) were fighting for.",10,237,366,28 July 2001

Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Underwhelming
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith had just about everything one could ask for. Two actors who, when cast correctly, could excel. If you dispute that, you obviously haven't seen Fight Club or Girl, Interrupted. A premise that, if executed properly, could translate into an awesome story. A budget that, if utilised properly, could fund a no-holds-barred, knuckle-down action sequence or four. You may have noticed by now that I am qualifying every one of those statements. The reason I did so is because the people responsible for this film did none of these things. The actors, while doing a credible job, get to capitalise on few, if any, of their strengths. Jolie does a great job of acting out the conflict she feels at her assignment, but Pitt is not even able to play to the sick sense of humour that he showed he had down to an art in Fight Club (which is somewhat amusingly referenced late in this film).The story is as deep as a puddle, which is the first strike against the film. Two mercenaries meet while on assignment in a South American country where the police have the power to detain anyone they feel looks suspicious. Two mercenaries get married. Two mercenaries live together for six years without any idea of what the other's real profession is. Fast forward six years, and both mercenaries are seeing a marriage counselor because they are starting to tire of their union. Then they both find themselves on the same assignment. Once they learn the truth behind one another's cover stories, all hell breaks loose, and both of their agencies decide they are a liability. Cue some Rambo-esquire scenes where both professionals hit their enemy with two or three out of four shots, while the enemy cannot hit the sidewalk with a can of paint. Admittedly, one of these sequences where four cars are progressively destroyed was a clever idea, but the lack of any depth to any of the characters leaves one checking their watch as the frames roll by.The second problem, which merely serves to compound the first, is that the director seems to have a major problem with letting the audience see what is happening during his action sequences. The camera weaves about in so many directions during the climactic battle that one cannot help but think the director was drunk. I've heard the defence used for this technique so many times that it is meant to place the viewer in the action. It does nothing of the kind. Fortunately, it only gave me headaches this time, but as one popular critic puts it, the first rule of any action scene should be that the audience gets to see the action. The second rule of any action scene should be that ***the audience gets to see the action***. How many times do we have to point this out before Hollywood gets the message and realised that replacing the current MPAA with one whose colons aren't able to produce diamonds is the answer, not producing films these morons consider 'safe' by shaking the hell out of the camera?Apart from the shaky-cam, which has caused me to bite chunks out of my tongue in some films, Mr. and Mrs. Smith also suffers from a distinct lack of structuring. It is almost as if Simon Kinberg decided we would automatically care about his married heroes, and decided they did not need any background. You know about as much about them when the film ends as you do when the opening credits roll. Compare this with Grosse Pointe Blank, where John Cusack's character starts out as your everyday man in a job he is bored with, reunites with an old girlfriend, starts comparing his past with a number of more domestic possible futures, and discovers he is wanted to hit a target that makes him have a crisis of conscience. I doubt that the people who put Mr. and Mrs. Smith together would even be able to spell the phrase 'crisis of conscience'. Neither of these assassins even indicate that they know what a crisis or a conscience is. When both actors do scenes in which they indicate they feel their marriage is boring and formulaic, their body language suggests that they believe this of the film. The audience certainly will about fifty-five minutes in.There are films that are so good they achieve immortality, both for themselves and the people who made them. There are some films that are so stupid they are brilliant, or so bad they are excellent. Mr. and Mrs. Smith fits into neither of these categories. It is not even good enough to pass for a mildly distracting action film. Nor is it good enough to pass for a saleable Mills & Boon. By failing to fall into any of these applicable categories, it falls into No Man's Land. See it if you can get in cheaply, but otherwise, it is not worth the effort.",5,2,3,22 June 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A mix of bad and good...
","I'll start with the bad first, because it will take a little longer and I like getting unpleasantries out of the way quickly. The most obvious problem with the film is the cast. Never have I seen so many miscastings in a single Hollywood production, and that is really saying a lot. For example, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves in any film set in Victorian England is a big, big mistake. The two look so out of place that it really destroys the whole illusion within one shot. Give their roles to people like Helena Bonham Carter and John Cusack, people who are actually capable of acting, and the results would have been quite a long way better. Then there's all the nonsense with Dracula's ability to appear as mist, a wolf, or a total of five different things during the film. This really made it difficult to understand what on Earth we are supposed to be afraid of. The use of religion in the film as a plot device was a minus, too. Just watch the behaviour of the 'good' Christian boys throughout the film and see if you'll still wonder why a lot of audiences root for the vampires in these films.The new introduction describing Prince Vlad's life was a nice touch in spite of it not being at all part of the novel, however. For once, it is nice to be shown the sort of atrocity the bible inspires on the big screen, even if it is still very inaccurately described. The rest of the film is faithful to Bram Stoker's original novel in a way that no other film has accomplished. Rather than presenting some hokey vision of the original legend revolving around bad actors in cloaks and tepid women who are only interesting as props, they presented the vampire legend as Bram Stoker saw it. The women in the film are powerful, interesting characters, the big vampire lord himself has a reason for the things he does, and the fear or fanatacism in the so-called 'heroes' is there to be seen in plain colour. Anthony Hopkins does a brilliant job of making his character seem like one of two evils, while Gary Oldman injects a depth into Prince Vlad that has never been achieved in cinema before. As he mopes about his castle, searching for the lost love of his life that was so cruelly taken from him (and let's not forget how cruelly the salt was rubbed into the wounds by those so-called good church boys), one begins to understand his pain and anger. Which is why the ending works so much better here than it does in the novel. Bram Stoker's novel simply has the men staking Dracula and cutting his head off... no cop outs like that in Francis' film. He uses this as an opportunity to fully resolve the painful conflicts that made Dracula what he is.Were I making this film again, I'd do everything Francis Ford Coppola had done, with some small adjustments. First of all, I would get better actors to play Jonathan and Mina, because actors like Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder seriously lack the depth to play anything other than stock American youth stereotypes. Even though Natalie Portman clearly doesn't look old enough to play Mina Harker, she'd wipe the floor with Winona Ryder simply because she is capable of getting into character. I am not sure if I would have cast Anthony Hopkins... if I did, I would give him strict instructions to cut out the overacting. And I would have changed the script a lot to deemphasise the religious overtone. It wasn't that strong in Bram Stoker's novel, and raising it this far in the film was disrespectful. People have already learned (often with the help of such cults) that real-life, everyday evil blows away what can be portrayed on the screen. Removing it altogether would have eliminated the lack of sympathy one feels for the characters. Other than that, I would have done everything pretty much the same. Maybe they should have let Kenneth Branagh direct this one too?In all, I'm giving Dracula six out of ten. While it is mostly faithful to the novel in a good way, the additional religious mumbo-jumbo that was inserted in the screenplay just bogs it down, and the casting agents should have known better. The overuse of special effects in portraying five different Draculas was also a bad idea. Still, I think people should focus more on what they did get right, and this is without a doubt the closest we've ever gotten to seeing the real Dracula on-screen.",Null,0,1,22 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas finally gets the finger out
","When the release date loomed, fans all over the world were looking forward with a perverse delight to seeing how Lucas could screw up the final prequel. The stilted, eat-a-dirty-boot dialogue of the previous episodes, combined with plots that tied themselves up in knots, gave Revenge Of The Sith so much to make up for. What it manages to do, aside from exactly that, is prove that Lucas had been capable of much better in 1999 and 2002. ROTS essentially stops and balances the fantasy special effects with the aim of the story, giving it a much more resonant edge. Most of the characters seem far more three-dimensional, and the demises that the Jedi meet have impact, something that nobody who had seen only the previous two Star Wars films would have ever expected. When I went to see the first session on the East Coast this evening, it was the first time in the entire prequel trilogy that I heard applause as the credits rolled.Okay, the film isn't all good. Some of the shots during the duel sequences really don't fit or are unclear. Some of the dialogue still seems a bit daft. When Anakin is expressing his fear of losing Padmé to Padmé, groans could be heard from the audience as the threat of more daft dialogue loomed. Thankfully, Lucas instead chose to concentrate on the corruption of Anakin as a character. The result is that Natalie Portman's role is reduced to somewhere between cameo and support, but she was never a highlight of the prequels, anyway. Hayden Christensen is far less whiny in this episode. It even manages to make one forget about the whining fit he had in the previous film. But the real surprise here is Ian McDiarmid, who manages to provide all the dramatic support for both Anakin's conversion to the dark side and the transition of the galaxy from Republic to Empire. I never thought I would say this, but this prequel actually featured good acting with actors who did not seem lost as to what they were meant to be reacting to.Some of this film is a bit badly-planned. How Darth Sidious disposes of Darth Tyranus and takes Darth Vader as an apprentice seems hasty. Given that Christopher Lee was about the only thing in the previous episode that worked, he deserved a little better than this. Sometimes the inter cutting of action on one planet to another works. Several times, however, it is as jarring as the constant location-hopping that took place in the previous two episodes. The story still suffers a little because the audience can get confused as to where they're meant to be. Fortunately, the actual story being told reduces this problem to a minor irritant.The dependency on having seen the original three films still remains, although this is the first time since 1977 that a Star Wars film can make sense on its own for more than half its running length. The secret lies in choosing to focus upon the Sith rather than the Jedi. As Ian McDiarmid twists the intentions and creedo of the Jedi around, we get to see things from another perspective that enables us to understand what the Force is and how it enables its users to do what they do, without having to ask fans of the original series. On the other hand, this prequel still relies on the earlier films to make audiences care why this youth suddenly becomes the symbol of fear in the galaxy. While the suit is being applied, and later as the suited Vader is throwing a fit or standing on the bridge with the Emperor, Lucas is clearly pandering to the same fans that he has recently derided for their criticisms of earlier prequels. That I am telling you this film is what The Phantom Menace and especially Attack Of The Clones (or Attack Of The Clods as I like to think of it) should have been, and am over the age limit Lucas has specified, should tell you something.Lucas' bragging about how this film earned a PG-13 rating at the MPAA is also pretty baseless. Attack Of The Clods also received the OFLC's equivalent rating of M. Both films are a pretty softcore M at that, and audiences above the age of five will have no trouble with this film. Assuming they understand what words like 'pregnant' or 'dying' mean. No, Lucas' claim that the children should be left home for this outing is purely a publicity stunt, and a fairly ill-conceived one at that. Not that parental guidance isn't recommended, but people who honestly believe that this film will leave their children with permanent psychological scars honestly need to get out more. It is worth noting that what violence is shown in this prequel is shown in a fairly theatrical manner. About the only time we get to see the consequences of the violence shown in this film is when Darth Vader is permanently burned into Anakin, so to speak. Otherwise, it is all strictly elliptical 'bang!' 'you got me!' fare here.If I had to give Revenge Of The Sith a rating, it would be nine out of ten. Yes, it is directed by a man who still doesn't realise that being told 'no' is one of the greatest favours you can receive, and the promised answers to a few questions still haven't come, but otherwise, this is the best film of 2005. I bet nobody ever thought an old cynic like me would say that about a George Lucas film. I certainly didn't. Essentially, this is everything that the previous two Star Wars films should have been, and more. If you haven't seen it yet, and need your faith in creative souls who have more money than sense rekindled, then take the time to get into your local theatre now. You'll be glad you did.",9,8,15,18 May 2005
Ray," A strange look into the life of a truly great man
","Ray Charles had been working in showbusiness so hard and so long before he seemed to retire in the late 1990s that few people, even today, have not heard of the man. His name is synonymous with many things, including a campaign to get people to have regular visits with the optometrist (a popular poster in optometrist offices began with the headline 'Ray Charles should not be blind'). Throughout his life, he projected the image of a man who should be loved, in spite of some very serious character flaws. Children of the era I grew up in knew him mainly as an eccentric musician who, in spite of being as blind as a bat, was more full of life than many people who were in full possession of all their senses. Ray as a film tries to uphold that image that many of us have of the man, but it also digs deeper to produce the story of a man who lived with many demons, and thus was not necessarily a saint. Some would call it blasphemy to show Ray Charles as a womanising drug addict, but in doing so, the film goes to its glory.The film covers the period from when Ray Charles began what would eventfully become an illustrious career as a musician to the time he kicked a heroin habit. A few details outside of this period are added in the form of flashbacks, usually to explain some of the more peculiar details of his character. For example, when we are told that Ray never used a cane or a guide dog, we get a flashback of his mother, played with an obvious enthusiasm by Sharon Warren, teaching him how to pay more attention to his surroundings, using the audio cues to guide him. The scenes with a young Ray, played by C.J. Sanders, slowly going blind from glaucoma, are almost enough to bring tears to the eyes. In playing the adult Ray, Jamie Foxx wore eye prosthetics that really left him blind during much of the principal photography. A small detail that might seem, but this kind of dedication to one's art is admirable, and it shows throughout the film.The film is a study in the two addictions that dominated Ray Charles' life. Early on in the film, the aforementioned mother makes him promise that he will not live like a cripple, as she more or less puts it. Physically, he keeps his promise, but it is the emotional side where he falls down, and this becomes obvious as his womanising ways add up to more sticky situations than most of us will have if we live five lifetimes. But it is the heroin addiction that really bookends the film, and it is no coincidence that the film mainly covers the years in which this addiction had a hold of him. Towards the end of the film, as the Ray on film is entering rehabilitation in order to avoid prison, or so the film has it, we get one of the best 'you broke your promise' scenes I've seen on film in years. From this point, we go to the scene with Georgia rescinding its ban against Ray Charles performing there, and the film succeeds in what most biopics of this nature fail at. Depicting a triumph over adversity without being sappy. Kerry Washington's line says it all: you cannot feel sorry for someone that you respect.I admit it, I am a sucker for stories that depict a human being overcoming adversity. What makes Ray so compelling is that the man in question was very real, and the adversity he overcame was so great. In this day, where governments are imposing more tax upon us than medieval Kings imposed upon serfs, it is scarcely imaginable that there will be others like him anytime soon. Indeed, some disabilities that seriously impair lives can remain undiagnosed for decades, leaving us with stark reminders that for all the social changes that have taken place since the time depicted here, we are still no further forward. Perhaps life is meant to be a struggle, and Ray Charles understood this better than any of us. For 150 minutes, Jamie Foxx does not just play Ray Charles. For all practical purposes, he is Ray Charles for that short span of time. In turn, the film highlights a good reason why governments are now trying to socially engineer us away from music. Music has the power to unite people, to turn the poorest among us into the richest (and I do not mean in monetary terms). Just as Ray Charles exemplified this fact in his lifetime, so too does Ray the film.The only flaw I found in the film was that the actors portraying Ray's supporting musicians were somewhat flat, and the film seemed to die in the last fifteen minutes before Ray's triumph over heroin addiction. For these reasons, I gave the film a nine out of ten. It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is a fitting tribute to a truly indomitable spirit. It deserves to be seen at least once.",9,2,3,24 July 2005
Lord of War," Cage's easy charm makes the film work
","Since being cast in one of his uncle's lesser-known works in the early 1980s, Nicolas Cage has appeared in a steady stream of titles ranging from the blockbuster to the way-out-there alternative piece. Much like Tom Cruise or Jack Nicholson, when Cage does appear in a film, you pretty much know from the beginning how he is going to play his character. A combination of smooth, quiet, easy-going charm mixed with intense, furious outbursts gives him nuances that are more in the realm of Nicholson than Cruise's bland, unidimensional self-worship. Which, I am not hesitant about saying, is exactly what the role of a successful arms dealer requires. Were this film being made thirty or forty years ago, Nicholson would be in the lead, and apart from the depictions of some very tragic violence, little else would change. As much as Lord Of War takes advantage of its modernity, it is also a piece as timeless story that will be just as relevant when wars are fought with energy-based projectiles as they are now when we're fighting with lead.The publicity materials claim the film is based on facts, and aside from one moment where the characters get a little too simplistic in their effort to put one over on the authorities, this really is the kind of stuff you could not make up if you tried. I must confess to being just slightly disappointed at the traditional structure, where our hero (if you want to call him that) begins with an idea, rides it to triumph, has a personal crisis, and then goes into a downfall before recovering somewhat. I would have liked to see the wife embrace the husband's business (it certainly pays well), or the villain remain unrepentant to the end because he has no reason to be otherwise. That, after all, is what generally happens in the lovely land of reality. Rather than emphasising the title character's personal conflict about his business to the point where it gets stale, the film explores the real-world effects.The support cast is in great shape, too. Bridget Moynahan scores major points for her understated performance as the model Yuri goes to absurd lengths to woo. Her slow conversion from an uninformed believer to a horrified and informed critic is handled amazingly well in her limited screen time. Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian only get a small handful of scenes as the parents of Yuri, but they get one moment in which to deliver the most poignant yet simple dialogue, and they deliver it brilliantly. Ian Holm also gets a brief but compelling turn as one of Yuri's more scrupulous rivals. After he exits stage left, one is left wishing that he had more time to influence the story. The real surprise here, however, is Jared Leto as Vitaly, Yuri's younger brother. Leto has already proved his salt in left-of-centre films such as Fight Club, or taut thrillers like Panic Room, but here he proves that he is a versatile actor capable of playing nearly anything. You can see in this film how Cage benefits from the presence of an actor who may rival and even exceed his own skill.One other criticism I have of the film is that it does not seem to quite understand the reality that drives the global arms market. Yes, it is terrible that African nations with no money for food (but plenty for guns and tanks, of course) send fourteen year olds to fight battles. And it is terrible that we have men from foreign lands ready to supply them with the weaponry so long as the price is right. But much like the cocaine market, our police services attack in exactly the wrong manner. Supply results from demand, not the other way around, and if the five largest arms suppliers in the world were to stop exporting tomorrow, the nations so ravaged by the supply would knuckle down and build their weapons locally. That is, after all, how the AK-47 featured so prominently in this film came to be one of the most popular assault rifles on the market. Nobody would supply the Russians for fear that the Russians would turn their product upon them, so the Russians began to build the guns themselves. Necessity being the mother of invention and all, so the attempt to moralise does sour the film just a little.But, like I said, Cage's everyman charm is more than enough to overcome this small flaw. He has good support from Andrew Niccol's direction (no shaky-cam here) and clever screenplay, as well as a haunting score from Antonio Pinto. The strings and acoustic guitar heard towards the end of the story and through the ending credits will remain in one's memory long after the film itself has finished. It is one of the few pieces of film scoring I would hold up as worthy of comparison to some of the bands in my music collection, in fact. Which makes it all the more amazing that no American studio would back this film, as it is truly a piece of modern art that will come to be called a classic ten to twenty years from now. Sadly, because Hollywood chose to treat it as a leper, it barely made any money, and thus less people in the system will be inclined to take this kind of risk. That is a tragedy right on the level of those shown in the film (well, not quite, but you get my meaning).Because of the deductions I mentioned above, I gave Lord Of War a nine out of ten. If you are a fan of Nicolas Cage, this is one of his best performances. Jared Leto fans will also find much to celebrate here. Those who prefer their cinema as non-mainstream as possible will also find something to like here. It has been overlooked, but Lord Of War may well be the most daring film of 2005.",9,1,2,17 June 2006
The Good Shepherd," A reign of confusion
","The Good Shepherd, coming so hot on the heels of a reinvention of James Bond, does much to stand out from the pack. Instead of making espionage seem more exciting or glamorous than it really is, it attempts to show the profession in its natural state. Unfortunately, it does this using a fictionalised version of a founding member of the CIA. This approach has its upsides and downsides, of course. Since the CIA's archives are full of disinformation, it is expecting far too much that an account of the organisation's history be completely factual. However, the narrative style creates an abundance of confusion. The first thirty minutes in particular can be summed up with a quote spoken by James Woods during Videodrome: 'So when does the plot start to unravel here?'. While I applaud the effort to make a film that does not assume its audience is borderline retarded, allowing ease of plot navigation does allow some of the deeper details to shine through. But this is a moot point, as much of the best experience the film offers is in reflecting on what one has just seen.One of the film's key problems is the decision to not use any makeup or other such special effects to age Matt Damon as he takes the journey of his character. With an actor who is capable of appearing to be in his fifties under the right lighting, this is not such a big deal. But Matt Damon is not such an actor. He looks like he should be on one of those high-school soap operas that were all the rage in the 1990s, not portraying a man who could order the death of anyone he pleases. Angelina Jolie, who is far more believable as a covert agent even in the 1940s, is instead relegated to a sideline role as the long-suffering wife of our central character. If it had only relied on the performances of these two main actors, The Good Shepherd would have sunk to an embarrassing low. Fortunately, the story instead focuses on ironies, making its point by showing the yawning gulf that widens every time Damon's character is forced to put his job before his family. This is indeed where The Good Shepherd derives all of its strength.The film adaptation of Fight Club was criticised by fans of the novel for changing the story structure into a linear pattern, but I think The Good Shepherd illustrates why this is actually a good thing. As The Good Shepherd leaps back and forth between the CIA of the 1960s and the events leading to its foundation, confusion reigns as to who is doing what and when at times. When the narrative does become focused enough for the viewer to understand what the story is about, the realisation takes over that a good forty minutes of the script could have been jettisoned without the slightest impact to the story's cohesion. Yes, these forty minutes attempt to make other points, but they do not add anything. Another problem is that, given that the central mystery of the film is who gave away one of the CIA's big secrets in the failed Bay Of Pigs invasion, the answer is foreshadowed in such a ham-fisted manner that the audience spends much of its time waiting for the central character to catch up with them.On the plus side, it is quite astounding that a film of such length about one of the world's nastiest government organisations contains so little actual violence. Instead, it focuses on the organisational and familial relationships of its pioneers, building all of the characters as human beings. This way, when the assassinations or suicides do come, they have about ten times the impact of the myriad of slayings that occur in such films as Goodfellas. Towards the end, when we are shown there is literally no one that Matt Damon's character will not kill for his country, it sends a shockwave of revulsion through the audience. But it is also the dialogues that hammer home the point of the film. When we see the offices of the CIA about to open as Damon eyes the unfinished furnishings, we are given one of the best in-film explanations of the story's inaccuracies and fabrications. Sure, the CIA is intended to have civilian oversight, one of its members jokes, but they must be mad if they think we are going to let them in on any of this.In the end, what makes The Good Shepherd work is that unlike a lot of films supposedly based on facts, De Niro apparently stands by every creative decision made in the process. Sure, the film is very loose with the facts as they are officially known, and the characters are amalgamated, but there is no apology for it. Indeed, as I said above, there is even a good justification given. A lesser director would have used the fact that the facts as the public are allowed to know them and the real facts are two different things to gin up the script and go down the James Bond route. Although there is one dialogue that was recently featured in similar context within a Bond film, its usage here confirms the greater authenticity of the new Bond compared to its predecessors. The 'get out of this business while you still have a soul left' speech is going to become a staple of spy films for a long time to come. And the end of The Good Shepherd particularly reinforces it with actions rather than words. Its just a pity that the rest of the film seems so jumbled and out of (narrative) focus.All told, I gave The Good Shepherd an eight out of ten. That De Niro worked for over a decade to get it made proves that there are passions worth fighting for. It is one of the most enjoyable films I have been confused by in years.",8,3,5,7 March 2007
Halloween," Slow pace, haunting atmosphere, well developed characters... I thought this was a horror film
","With the idea of home video still being over the horizon, films were expected to deliver quality results for a low overall cost. Halloween, in its original form, delivered a box-office performance totalling many multiples of its production budget. And unlike certain other pieces that claim to have delivered the same result, Halloween did not do this by cutting corners to the extent that it mostly looked like the home video of a drunk. In fact, Halloween looks so professional in spite of having been made for (reportedly) less than half a million dollars, it should come as no surprise that it grossed more than two hundred times its production budget.As in any John Carpenter film, the cinematography is the true star. Wide, rolling vistas give the location as much development as the characters or the story. According to the stories, the decision to use Panavision cost around half of the production budget. It was money well-spent, as while the 2.35:1 frame is often sparsely populated, it is used with great effect. Like all of Carpenter's films, Halloween becomes a different film entirely when it is chopped to fit the obsolete shape of analogue television.Another Carpenter trademark is to create musical themes that capture the memory and imagination all on their own. The main Halloween theme follows a strange sort of conga or bossa nova feel, following an odd sort of 5/4 timing. Like many themes from Carpenter films, it stays in the mind of the listener long after other aspects have been forgotten. Regardless of whether one views the film as a classic horror story or a cookie-cutter slasher, the score music is one of the great classics of its artform.This is the film that brought Jamie Lee Curtis into the public consciousness, and introduced Donald Pleasance to a lot of young cinema-goers who might otherwise have no idea who he is. Unlike the sequels, however, the support cast is fairly strong, too. While few of them appeared in anything substantive after the fact, they at least give the impression that they weren't recruited right out of their first year of drama school. Given that this screenplay is heavy on exposition, there is no way that the ultra-trendy cast of Halloween 8 could have possibly made this work.Like many a Carpenter film, Halloween ends in a manner that seems to wrap most of the story up quite neatly, but leaves enough open for the viewer to start speculating on the characters' future. This is an ending style that I wish more directors would use, as it gives the viewer's imagination something to do. We also get to listen to a monologue about fate that, mainly through its delivery, is surprisingly haunting. The care and effort that went into setting a mood really paid off here, in a total contrast to the sequels.I gave Halloween an eight out of ten. It is showing its age, but it works wonderfully in spite of that. It is a good example of how Hollywood used to have new ideas.",8,0,1,25 October 2004
Blow," Uneven, but entertaining, all the same
","Since not every film can be a great masterpiece, it only stands to reason that there are some which, as good as they are, will never be mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather. Blow happens to be one of those films. In today's market, where films are literally churned out with more attention paid to marketability than merit, it is no surprise that films of almost every subject are saturating the market. Even films about, or based upon, historical crime figures are a dime a dozen these days. The plus to this is that the ones that do come out have to do something special in order to be considered good.Blow's strengths lie in a couple of performances, and the scenes in which George Jung's ability to negotiate his way out of a fix (or into one) are displayed. Johnny Depp plays Jung with a consummate authenticity that, especially when sees the interviews with the real George Jung, literally leaps out of the screen. It's hard to believe this guy who I saw as a fresh-faced semi-nerd in A Nightmare On Elm Street is able to portray such a wide and varied range of characters. Ray Liotta gives him ample support as Fred Jung, showing a man hit hard by his own unsuccessful attempts to keep himself independent and free, therefore fully understanding of how far his son will go to see he doesn't fail in the same endeavour. The final scene with Liotta, where he is listening to the tape recording, is one of the most touching examples of men declaring they cannot regret their defiance seen on film.The scenes with Pablo Escobar are especially amusing. As we see how George was able to charm his way into any deal he set his mind to, one cannot help but admire the man. Merely standing before the most powerful drug lord in South America at that time would have taken more guts than most people are allotted. The Jungian method of keeping oneself calm while smuggling through customs, even if completely fictional, sums up this this calmness in the face of danger quite brilliantly.But, and it seems there always is a but with Hollywood product these days, some aspects of the film are terrible. Penélope Cruz is absolutely horrible as Mirtha Jung, and it is hard to believe that someone as cocky and bold as George would tolerate her presence. I've heard Salma Hayek (or horse-jaw as she is probably better-known) suggested for the part, but she is just as bad. Given how many actresses there are in Spain who would appreciate a break, and know a mode of speech other than screaming, one can't help but wish the director could have shown a bit of Jungian testicular fortitude and cast an unknown.Adding to the film's woes is the end of the story. Compared to the first two thirds, where we seem to be going along at the speed of one of Jung's sports cars, the whole thread about Jung's inability to live without contact with his daughter brings affairs to a screeching halt. That Christina Jung has never visited her father, at least according to the ending crawl, is a pretty sad fact. What's even worse is that after viewing this film, we never learn anything about Christina. We don't learn if the cocaine abuse on her mother's part during pregnancy had any ill effects, or whether she has led a life she would call satisfactory. She is little more than a prop. The fact that Jaime King, the actress who played her during the final wrap-up, is a recovering heroin addict only makes one wonder more. Especially among those of us who really have to live with permanent physical damage that may have been caused by parental drug abuse during in utero development (even if it was only nicotine in my mother's case).In all, I gave Blow an eight out of ten. If you want to know anything about George Jung and how cocaine got to be such a hot item in America, then this film does make some excellent points. With the poor economy in America where blue-collar workers are in borderline poverty while CEOs rip them off something blind, it really is a wonder we aren't seeing the rise of an army composed of George Jung wannabes.",8,71,87,18 November 2004
Shrek," Give it an A for effort
","The field of animation has come to be regarded as strictly for children, which makes it all the more surprising when a gem like Shrek tries to aim for something other than the lowest common denominator. Indeed, this is almost a return to the days when fairy tales had something of a moral, and often a good one. The problem, as so often happens in animation, is that the performance of the characters is often reduced to a singular note after a certain point. Thankfully, the note they do play is pleasant to the ear, so to speak, for the most part.Mike Meyers really ought to consider doing voice-over work full-time. His performance in front of the camera has reached a point where he seems only able to portray stereotypes, and even his stereotypes all seem alike after a while. Behind a microphone, on the other hand, his performance becomes a whole different story. Granted, he doesn't sound like anything more than Mike Meyers trying to sound Scottish, but he does it well enough that the voice fits the character. The rest is sold by the exquisite animation. A critique of Ralph Bakshi's attempt at The Lord Of The Rings stated that while simple, subtle gestures are harder to animate, they are much more effective. Shrek is a case in point.Eddie Murphy is ponderously annoying as Donkey, the sidekick. This is where one of the fundamental weaknesses in Shrek becomes clear. There is nothing Shrek does with Donkey that he cannot do without Donkey. Granted, the scene with Donkey and the dragon is funny, but aside from that moment, Donkey's schtick gets terribly annoying in a hurry.Cameron Diaz, like Meyers, proves that she is easier to take when she is behind a microphone rather than in front of a camera. The character of Fiona, and the story behind her, is one of Shrek's crowning touches. The reason why she fears to be seen during the evening is explored with more satisfaction in the sequel, but it says something about the usual fairy tale canon.In the end, however, Shrek is just too short. Ninety minutes is not enough time to explore characters with such potential. I realise that the film is primarily marketed at a child audience, but there are numerous other films aimed at such an audience where character development, rather than short attention spans, has been treated as a priority. Or perhaps it is just economical use of the screen time. Much of Shrek's screen time is devoted to in-jokes about fairy tales and such, when a bit of time explaining exactly *why* Farquaad is such a killjoy would have done wonders.Nonetheless, I gave Shrek a seven out of ten. It isn't the best animated feature I've ever seen, and there certainly are better fantasy stories out there. What Shrek has going for it is that it doesn't take itself more seriously than the material demands. And unlike many that make this claim, it can truly keep all members of a family entertained. Such is getting rare in this day and age where 'all ages' excludes anyone whose age can be measured with two digits.",7,1,3,29 December 2004
Blade Runner," More relevant now than it was in 1982
","Recently, the Aspies For Freedom website published a list of the ten characters in feature films whose mannerisms and stories most closely match those of real Aspies. Some of the choices were not so surprising (Edward Scissorhands, Fred Tate). Others were somewhat odd (RoboCop, Khan Noonien Singh). But the characters who shared the top place are all from this film. Not so coincidentally, they are all Replicants. In the midst of a propaganda war with normalist organisations such as Cure Autism Now that want you to believe being on the autistic spectrum automatically makes one of no worth to society, Blade Runner elegantly sums up what life is really like for those of us on the higher end of said spectrum. You know, those of us who build tomorrow's computers or paint tomorrow's masterpieces, just to name a few things. The thing that catapults Blade Runner into such brilliance that it should be preserved as an example of Western culture at its very greatest is that this relevance is completely accidental.The story is as simple as it is shocking. Although 2019 is fast approaching, and the floating car or human machine is still a fantasy, what is important to understand is that in a world of equal poverty and despair, mankind has created the new underclass. Terrified by the fact that these artificial humans are their equals in intelligence and their superiors in physical strength, humanity creates a new police force with the sole purpose of hunting this new underclass. Treated as if they are mere property, or pets that have gone bad, members of this new slave underclass come to Earth seeking the ability to extend their lives. As the plot summary on the Region 4 DVD says, their only crime is wanting to be human. Although the film only gives vague hints of this, these poor creatures are pretty much birthed and then thrown into a life of slavery without so much as a pause. If mankind can rise to the level of his betters, then he will do his damnedest to drag his betters down to his level.To be fair, Blade Runner does take its time to develop its story, and a lengthy attention span is required to get the most out of it. In contrast to many films made around the same time or in the subsequent years, it is designed to reward the intellect of its audience rather than their conformity. With a third and ostensibly final cut of the film on its way, there is already some minor debate over which of the two previous editions is the better one. For my money, the director's cut wins every time. The voiceovers of the theatrical release are obnoxious and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. The happy ending robs the film of its final-note impact. And without Deckard's dreams of unicorns or his developing romance with Rachael, much of the meaning of the story is lost. Like tears in the rain. This is a supreme irony, as the so-called director's cut of Blade Runner is one of the few 'special editions' that is shorter than the original release. Which goes to prove the old adage that the executives who sit in board rooms and make decisions all day just do not know how to properly put together films.Acting performances just do not get any better than this, either. Rutger Hauer is absolutely chilling, and yet charming, as Roy Batty, the self-appointed leader of the latest bunch of rebel Replicants to make it Earthside. After monumental performances in such Dutch-language classics as Turks Fruit or Soldaat Van Oranje, Hauer rises to his apex here, and proves that in any film, a protagonist is only as good as his antagonist. Harrison Ford plays it cool and understated for the most part, making sure the audience understands his character is totally unaware that his world is about to be rocked to its foundations. The surprise factor of the final moment is as much due to his performance as a clever script. Sean Young briefly demonstrates she could have been a serious actor as the most unusual kind of love interest, and the support cast is far from shabby here, either. Joe Turkel is especially creepy as Eldon Tyrell, the ringmaster of what seems to have turned into one painfully oppressive circus. The character truly thinks nothing of creating an entire life with only one purpose in mind, and Turkel sells the fact like ice cream in a heatwave.The dystopian vision of what is now a very near future also resonates in the present. As we spin through a grimy Los Angeles, we no longer have any idea who owns what, and corporate imagery is pervasive enough to feel like an eye in every corner. Product placement can be annoying in films where it is done blatantly or without any real purpose, but in Blade Runner, the placement of corporate logos gives the scenery both a reality and an artistry rarely seen elsewhere. I do not know how much TDK paid to have their logo displayed during Batty's rooftop battle with Deckard, but the imagery alone was worth every penny, and then some. In Blade Runner, TDK really does amazing things on one's system. But all this pales in comparison to the vision itself. Watching this film in Pan & Scan is akin to blinding yourself in one eye. It is like watching a waterfall through a keyhole when you could just push the door open and see a wide, rolling vista. Nobody has ever used the 2.35:1 frame as well as Sergio Leone, but Ridley Scott gave it a very good try when he shot Blade Runner.It is for these reasons, and many more, that I gave Blade Runner a ten out of ten. Whether it is the director's cut or the new 'final cut', this is modern science fiction as it should be.",10,1,2,3 July 2006
Ben-Hur," The most overrated piece of crap I've ever seen...
","...and believe me, I have seen a lot of them in my time as a DVD reviewer. Maybe it's just the fact that Ben-Hur won eleven Oscars, but to me, that just goes to show how weak the seperation of Church and State was in Hollywood during 1959. The one thing I had to say when Ben-Hur was finally over was that I watch films for entertainment - when I want a sermon, I'll turn on my television at about four in the morning and laugh my butt off at Kenneth Copeland et al. By staying up to that time, I will probably be in the same dazed, apathetic stupor that this film put me in, anyway.I also would have thought that a 2.55:1 film would have some interesting photography in it, but there is absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done better in other widescreen films such as Lawrence Of Arabia or even Mad Max. The shots are just simply uninteresting and uninvolving, with maybe the sole exception of the chariot race. The chariot race was the one point in the film where I wasn't checking the Time Remaining display on my DVD player at least once a second, but I have still seen this type of scene done much better in films that had similar practical limitations, such as Grease or Mad Max 2.I won't bore you any further with why this film bored me and almost had me wanting to destroy the DVD it was contained on. Suffice to say that I am glad films aren't make like this anymore. If the fundies in America who want to force all films to be made like this had their way, I'd probably shoot myself because I wouldn't have any other idea what to do with myself. I would rather die than be forced to watch this piece of Christian propaganda masquerading as a classic film ever again.",Null,7,18,22 September 2002
Casino Royale," Martin Campbell saves Bond (again)
","Things were looking bad for Bond in 2002 when the attempt was made to appear more 'now', by embracing the worst pop drivel. Intended as a celebration of the franchise lasting for twenty episodes, instead it drew scorn from long-term fans of the character and apathy from the very generation whatever audience it tried to pander to. So for the next four years, a lot of to and fro went on in public and behind the scenes over what kind of Bond film episode twenty-one would be. Fortunately, the forces of good have won out this time, with GoldenEye director Martin Campbell taking the reins and making his second entry in the five best films to feature Fleming's superspy. Adding to the rebirth quality of Casino Royale is that the powers behind the franchise have decided to go back to the very beginnings of Fleming's saga. In so doing, they discard a lot of the baggage (and hopefully the entirety of Roger Moore's tenure in the role) that the character was starting to groan under the strain of. This is the first Bond film in which an overwhelming majority of the elements are 'right'.The bad news first. Casino Royale is a lengthy film, and feels it. While time literally seems to fly during the action sequences, the necessary exposition to give them their oomph slows the film to a crawl. The sequence in which Bond breaks into M's home to look through her computer is probably the only dialogue-heavy sequence in the film that does not feel as dialogue-heavy as it is. This problem was also present in GoldenEye to a degree, with the momentum dying off rapidly whenever Bond took a break from killing things in order to explain what he is doing and why it is so important to the plot. Making matters a little worse in Casino Royale is that the film often jump-cuts ahead in time, and the final three scenes that wrap up the loose ends feel incredibly disjointed. This is the one fault of Casino Royale that gets in the way of its perfection, the editing. However, one cannot blame the editors for wanting to trim the dialogue sequences, either. If it were not for the action sequences, the vitriol that had been aimed at Craig by idiots with nothing better to do would have turned to hatred.Just as Casino Royale shares a weakness with GoldenEye, it also shares a great strength. The action sequences take Casino Royale to its glory. Daniel Craig looks the part of a soldier trained to kill on the quiet, and he gives a subtle, nuanced performance that screams 'take your words, eat them, and die' to those who heaped scorn on him before the final cut of the film was assembled. Not only will you walk out of this film thinking Craig is Bond, his ability to show Bond changing and developing as he learns more of his trade will briefly make you forget anyone else ever played Bond. Even the great Timothy Dalton, who was hampered by some of the worst theme songs ever chosen and one of the worst of the Bond women, is left in the dust by this performance. I am not going to insult your intelligence or the stuntmen by saying Craig looks good leaping from the scaffolds. I will, however, say he is incredibly convincing punching people in the face or throwing them down a flight of stairs.Since this is essentially a reboot of the franchise, we get to see all the elements that we were saturated in without explanation during the other twenty films. Although they are never mentioned, we get to see the early indications of the existence of SPECTRE. It is also nice to actually see the first of all those women Bond failed to save, or the first of the numerous men he has killed, as alluded to in Campbell's prior effort. It does clash a little with one's memories of the franchise, especially as the film updates the novel's setting to the present time and references contemporary world affairs. It is a bold move that could have backfired in a big way, and the Broccoli estate deserve acknowledgment for having the guts to see it through. The end result is that for the first time since 1989 or 1969, we get to see Ian Fleming's Bond rather than Albert Broccoli's Bond. And as I indicated before, making it all the sweeter is that no other film in the franchise has shown so much of Fleming's Bond.I just cannot stress what a stroke of luck Casino Royale turned out to be. According to reports, Quentin Tarantino wanted to make the film in 2004 with then-Bond Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan has a right to be angry with the Bond producers, as after the scripts that were quite apparently written by monkeys who had drunk turps for the last three films, the quality of this one must seem like salt in the wound. Tarantino, on the other hand, has been left with egg on his face, as the pseudo-philosophy of his overrated, substance-free posture-fests that he has become famous for will not compare favourably with the down to earth, back to basics approach that we got instead. Possibly for the first time in all of its forty-four years, the Bond franchise has shown the world what the market for action films needs, as opposed to what it needs to avoid. The only sour note, aside from the aforementioned problem with keeping the pace consistent, is that we must keep hoping this level of quality can be maintained for a while. After all, Brosnan's first Bond film was hailed as a new beginning, too.In all, I gave Casino Royale a nine out of ten. Other studios with franchises can learn from this, as it is what happens when you listen to the more intelligent segment of your core audience.",9,1,4,12 December 2006
The Deer Hunter," A mixed bag...
","John Cazale's last film is not the one he is remembered for, and perhaps it is best that way. Not that the film is necessarily bad, it's just very mixed. After viewing the film on DVD, the inordinate length of some scenes is enough to make one grateful for the PAL speedup. That the DVD released by Universal Home Video only has sixteen chapter stops, no subtitles, and a somewhat uneven audio mix, only serves to highlight the flaws in the film.Don't think that I am knocking this film simply because I have a short attention span. I have seen enough slow and languid films to know that sometimes, a slow story can be an intriguing story. But in order to make the viewer sit through a slow and languid piece, you have to compensate for the pace with character development and tension. Granted, there is tension in The Deer Hunter, but it is uneven, and insufficient to keep the viewer interested.As often happens in a film with an ensemble cast, the burden of keeping the story interesting falls upon its stars. This is one reason why The Deer Hunter would never be made in today's system. With some notable exceptions, the stars of today are just not compelling enough to hold interest. Robert De Niro demonstrates why he is one of the few stars to have won an Oscar for a role where most of his lines aren't in English. Even his bad films, the Rocky And Bullwinkle revival comes to mind, are a cut above some modern stars' best.John Savage, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale all demonstrate that they can act circles around most. While Cazale died long before his time, Savage and Walken have since appeared in numerous pieces where they make many other actors look as if they're not even trying. Here, their performances make their characters memorable long after one has forgotten about the story. Which is just as well, because some of the scenes are so distended, and not in a good way, that it truly boggles the mind to hear that there was ever a four-hour cut. The two-hour cut could have told the story with as much detail.I gave The Deer Hunter an eight out of ten. With a different cast, it would have been a four, but Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale all earn the film an extra point each. It's certainly worth seeing for the curiosity factor alone.",8,1,2,5 November 2004
Identity," It mostly works...
","Identity is a hard film to describe without giving the story away. In fact, every little second of screentime is important to the story, so talking about events is a difficult thing to do without giving away too much. I will try to discuss it in general point form, but if you haven't seen it already, consider yourself advised. Even describing the setup without ruining a surprise is a tough ask.The cast assembled at the hotel is exceptionally strong together, and they give the film all of its impact. John Cusack in particular arrests the viewer and gives them someone to get behind. Amanda Peet turns in a rare performance that I don't hate her in. Ray Liotta makes the plot twist of his character work like only a true professional can do. By the time the film reveals why he's constantly yelling and screaming at everyone who dares to disagree with him, he really manages to get under the viewer's skin.The real surprise in this cast, however, is Jake Busey, who does the Obnoxiously Ugly Contingent Of Hollywood proud. During his screentime, his mannerisms and delivery really sell him as a serial killer. If the viewer isn't afraid of the big unknown that the film sets up, they will definitely be afraid of Jake. The guy is big and authoriative enough to sell the character in spite of so little being known about him. But then, we know very little about any character here, even after they try to explain themselves.As various events conspire to bring the principal cast to a simple hotel that appears to be in the middle of nowhere, we slowly get a feeling something is not quite right here. Soon after everyone arrives, one of the guests is killed, and a keychain found not far from their corpse. The keychain corresponds to the number of the room she is situated in, and so the game begins. Most of the people in the hotel share a room with somebody, but the keychain links things together in a way that is subtle and obvious at the same time.Where the film lapses is the ending. Not only does it feel too abrupt, it has little, if any, lead-in or hint, making it feel as though it was thrown in for the sole purpose of closing the film. Sometimes this isn't so bad, but considering the standard set by the rest of the film, it is a big disappointment. Still, the film entertains for ninety minutes, and that's certainly more than a lot of recent films seem to feel we have a right to ask.",8,1,2,27 July 2004
X2: X-Men United," If only all sequels could be like this...
","Considering what happened with the Batman series, particularly after Tim Burton left, and considering what has happened in plenty other comic book adaptations such as Spider-Man or Daredevil, nobody would be blamed for having bet that an X-Men sequel would be a disaster. But X2: X-Men United, as it is billed here, is a sequel that can be mentioned in the same breath as Aliens or The Godfather Part II.Like the original, this new sequel has something to say about how our society deals with people who don't look the same, act the same, think the same, or feel the same as all the drones out there. The spirit of the comic books it is based on is very much alive in this film, and that's a big part of what makes it such compelling viewing. In today's society, people with a serious mental illness will be rooting for characters like Wolverine, or Magneto if they have a sadistic side, all the way. In tomorrow's society it could be people who undergo genetic engineering to rid themselves of cancer or other horrible diseases. Who knows? That's the truly sad part of these stories - they only seem to either stay relevant or get more relevant as time goes on.Ian McKellen is in fine, fine form as Magneto, the angry mutant whose justification for waging war on 'normal' society is all but handed to him on a platter in this episode. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos actually gets to do something other than sit there and look pretty this time, and Halle Berry proves once again that she cannot act her way out of a wet paper bag. But once again, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin steal the show, in spite of the latter having a significantly reduced role compared to the first film. Shawn Ashmore also squeezes his head in and manages to prove he is there for a reason, too.Unlike the original X-Men, in which the true bad guys are mostly undefined except for a rather nasty Senator, one will not be able to walk out of X2 without pathologically hating the bad guys here. Brian Cox plays the mad general so well that anyone with a truly compassionate bone in their body will want to leap into the picture and tear the head off the kind of man who could do THAT to his own son. And the film is all the stronger for it, because it brings the message that the normalists who would give us all gene tests when deciding who should live or die are the real bad guys, not the mutants who have been made bitter and angry by their behaviour. I know a whole family of utter creeps who would do well to be nailed into a chair and forced to watch this film with their eyes pried open, Ludivico-style.I won't say anything about the ending except for two small points. One is that it makes Ray Park's line in the first film ('Don't you people ever die?') seem all the funnier, except it really isn't the sort of point where one should laugh. I did, but that is just the kind of person I am. The other is that it proves anyone in this film can out-act Halle Berry, even another former Bond girl, in this case Famke Janssen. She gives the film an end-sequence of the kind that I've only seen in other films like Gladiator and Rollerball (the real Rollerball, I mean).To summarise, out of 125 minutes of near perfection, I have only three minor complaints. The editing of the final battle sequence, particularly when Patrick Stewart is in the new Cerebro, is a little too loose for my liking. Parts seem to have been repeated just to stretch out the running time. I also found Nightcrawler's constant prayer recitals annoying. If this was supposed to enforce the idea of Christian good guys, it doesn't work because we've seen before how their kind are little different from the William Stryker caste. Lastly, they really should have got someone other than Halle Berry to play Storm. I don't care who, just anyone. She is the biggest personality vortex I have ever seen on the big screen, and I kept expecting Anna Paquin to turn to her and say 'I *earned* my Oscar'.But at the end of the day, I wish all sequels could be as good as this effort. Ten out of ten from me. It did lose a point because of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but it gains it back (and then some) whenever Hugh Jackman or Anna Paquin say something. Those two should work together more often.",10,1,3,30 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," From masterpiece to hack job in two years...
","On December 26, 2001, I was excited beyond belief because a film arrived in Australian theatres that didn't pander to the lowest common denominator and insult my intelligence. That film was called The Fellowship Of The Ring, and its director gave me hope that somewhere out there, truly creative people could still be given the funding to make their art.Unfortunately, somewhere about halfway through the editing of The Two Towers, some jerk at New Line must have tapped Peter on the shoulder and said 'we've made back our money, we can trash the story all we want now'. In the furore that followed the editor's cut of this film, Jackson was quick to assure the fans who'd had their hopes so built up by Fellowship the previous year that of the three films, Return Of The King was the one he changed the least from the text. By the way, you might want to stop reading now if you don't wish to have details of the film revealed.Peter Jackson, I am calling you a liar and a fraud. I hope you've got a lot of footage saved up for the Extended Edition, because you will need to insert at least another hour for this mess to so much as look coherent. You are also a liar because you claimed that you cut Shelob's Lair out of The Two Towers and inserted it in Return Of The King because the battle of the Pelennor Fields and Frodo's encounter with Shelob occur at the same time. Your other claims aside, this brings up the question of why you then chose to magically teleport Frodo and Sam from the tower of Cirith Ungol to Mount Doom, having them hang around the outside of Mordor for hours, taking most of the running time just to get them to where they were at the end of The Two Towers, only to appear at the proverbial crack of doom in less time than it takes Aragorn to gain the allegiance of the King of the Dead.
Considering that you only observe your own storytelling rules when you want to, and use the Star Trek convention of telling us a plot detail rather than showing us, you really have no business directing an adaptation of an epic, classic novel. You certainly won't get any work directing adaptations of my work when it gets published. I also want to take the time to address cinematographer Andrew Lesnie. Take a good look at Fellowship's photography, then compare it to that of The Two Towers or The Return Of The King. Notice how much easier the battles in Fellowship are to watch because the camera doesn't shake like a crack-addled monkey?It seems that the writers have also forgotten the Istari mandate, in that they are only meant to muster forces through counselling, advice, and encouragement. Then again, given that they never make it clear that Saruman intends to rule in Sauron's place, I guess it is too much to ask that they not contradict the Istari mandate (and Gandalf's behaviour in the other two films) by having Gandalf bash Denethor over the head with his staff. Speaking of Saruman, the big Star Trek moment of the film comes when Gandalf makes the big 'he has no power anymore' speech. Okay, you're supposed to show us the reason why, not just tell us and expect us to take it as read.It is important to contrast this by pointing out what does work in the film. The prologue explaining how the One Ring entered Sméagol's life and turned him into Gollum worked wonderfully, but I can think of at least two places in The Two Towers where it would have fit better. The sequence in the Paths Of The Dead also represent a rare moment where the film is rocketing along at a Herculean pace, and isn't brought to a screaming halt by exposition. A major, major part of the problem with this film is that it has been hamstrung by the previous episode's inability to pace itself. At least they demonstrate in this one sequence that they can mix battle scenes with exposition and make it work.All in all, this final film makes me wonder why people are so surprised that Christopher Tolkien was so unwilling to give his approval for a museum of film props. Obviously, the man has had to go through a lot in order to preserve the integrity of his father's work, and he wants to hold out some hope that the mangling which occurred with the latter two parts of this trilogy will be forgotten by the time his grandchildren die. Unfortunately, with all the attention that was paid to the merchandising and marketing (even though the Games Workshop models are absolutely awesome), it seems the story got left behind. This is not The Return Of The King. It should have really been called Let's All Fight A Lot.",5,3,6,25 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A little originality goes a long way
","In 1984, there were several serial-killer flicks in which some unknown loser with a grudge murdered a long list of people who had other things in their lives to focus on. The Halloween franchise was up to a couple of episodes, and Friday The 13th was about to film what was purportedly its final chapter. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was in the midst of adding sequels, even. So what separates A Nightmare On Elm Street from an overcrowded market?In a nutshell, Wes Craven takes a clichéd story and adds a fantasy element that makes the whole thing more plausible than any of its sequels have ever achieved. How he achieves this is simple. Instead of making the story about his villain, he focuses on one of the potential victims and their struggle to deal with some extremely unusual events. Everyone over the age of eighteen probably has a high school friend who died in unusual, tragic, or even violent circumstances, and that is the hook Craven uses to put the viewer into the film. Human drama will always win out over special effects and simulated violence.Where it begins to undo itself is that Nancy is the only character with more than one dimension. The cop hates teenagers because they're teenagers, the mother is a drunk for reasons we're still guessing at, and the teens who struggle against the villain are distinguishable only by how much the cop hates them. The villain is the one character who gets anything resembling a back-story, and his total screen time is little more than a third of the total feature.The special effects budget on the film was minimal, so the makers had to be a little more creative with how they shocked the viewer. Trick shots or cheated shots feature very heavily in this episode. This is a very good thing, as they are far more convincing than the myriad of expensive special effects that have followed, particularly in later sequels. The latest crossover episode in particular is bad in this regard. All the gloss and shine of Hollywood virtually leaps out in latter episodes, but none of the dramatic tension that exists here is even suggested later in the series.Overall, this is a five out of ten effort, but don't let that fool you. This is a textbook example of how much of an improvement a different idea can bring. In a film school, this would make a great example of how an active mind is far more important than financing.",8,2,2,27 July 2004
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Enjoyable? Somewhat. Well-written? Not on your life.
","The 1980s were once thought to be the absolute nadir of Western culture, with America producing so much throwaway drivel that some of the best examples of art from there during this decade were made by outsiders. It is only because of the sheer vapidity of the 1990s and 2000s so far that we can look back upon the 1980s with any sense of longing or nostalgia, and the titular duo of this film give us a good understanding of why. The film begins with a great dialogue from George Carlin about this great and wonderful future that was inspired by two legendary musicians. Okay, so far, so good. It is a concept that, while not totally brilliant, can be made to work if exploited properly.The problem here is that the subjects of the film are so utterly vapid that they flatten their own story. They claim to be rebelling against a society that does us all wrong, and that part is true enough, but one fundamental law is that one should never kill a tyrant until one knows whether his successor is an improvement or not. Bill and Ted, as a model for society, definitely aren't. I have read some previous comments that note the fascistic undertone inherent in the film, and I can only agree. Anything that the heroes disagree with or don't like the appearance of is bogus, apparently. One can just sense the kilns being fired up for the autistic or phobic individuals in the San Diemas of the future.Another interesting point is the whitewashing of history that occurs in the process of retrieving the historical figures, all of whom present far more interesting characters than the titular heroes. Apparently, maidens from France of the Middle Ages look exactly like gunslingers of the New Mexico of colonial America, who in turn look exactly like modern Californians. Sure, the inclusion of Napoleon helped with the European element (not). After all, we all know that French military leaders are foul-tempered midgets with bad personal relationship skills. And it is probably best to say nothing at all about Genghis Khan, since he never gets to say anything at all during his performance. About the only opportunity with these characters that gets any exploration at all is Socrates, who provides an interesting insight into the idea of an ancient Greek philosopher being transported into modern times. Unfortunately, since Robert Heinlein had a lot of ideas that Socrates expressed thousands of years ago, such as people being made to make decisions of conscience before they vote in affairs that affect millions, I can honestly imagine Socrates would find Bill, Ted, and pretty much everyone at San Diemas High abhorrent.The film's strengths, which are few in number, include the aforementioned George Carlin. If Doctor Who had been an American show, but had the similar lengthy, sometimes controversial, history that the BBC gave it, it's a safe bet that Carlin would have at some point played the good Doctor. Carlin displays the cool that Bill, Ted, and every San Diemas citizen who gets the slightest screen time seems to want to have. Indeed, part of the fun of Bill And Ted is taking note of how much the so-called good guys act like the dickweeds that they are so fond of calling others. Dan Shor gives a very good performance as Billy The Kid in spite of physically being totally wrong for the part. Shor looks as if he is at least four inches too tall for the part, and is far too muscular. Not to mention that his front teeth are not prominent enough, but that gets back to the Orwellian rearranging of history recently talked about. In spite of these mismatches, Shor at least sells himself as someone you'd take seriously if you met him in the Wild West.Interestingly enough, the film sat on a shelf for two years before Orion bought the rights to it from the De Laurentiis Group and released it upon an unsuspecting world. They must have liked the teen market a lot, since a mere four years would pass before they retooled one of the biggest artistic triumphs they had ever financed for such a market, and as a happy result, went bankrupt. I understand how cutthroat the film business is, but you'd think that film studios would look back at history to see this correlation between disrespecting one's audience and a poor box-office return.One more positive of this film is that it doesn't give a lot of detail about the future that Carlin's character is trying to protect. This allows the audience to fill in some details for themselves, which in turn makes the vapidity of the folk we are told it is based on somewhat less objectionable. With people like Rufus in power, it is easier to believe the future is not dominated by complete morons like the present.Like the sequel, I gave Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure a five out of ten. If you're bored and have nothing better to do, it is an okay way to pass ninety minutes. But if you want something to watch that will do more than fill time, then there is nothing to see here.",5,3,5,21 March 2005
The Matrix," Tries so hard... misses the mark so badly...
","I actually enjoyed this film the first time I saw it, but then I saw it a second time after listening to all the comments about how brilliant this film must be and how we must all worship it. I've never walked out on a film before, and that even includes Battlefield Earth and Wing Commander, but I walked out in the middle of trying to watch this one again. I've never seen a film that people try so hard to make out to be so much more than it really is. The worst part is the obssessive cult that has formed up around the film, telling us how great and visionary the directors are and how we should all worship them and blah blah blah...Well gang, like the Region Coding Enhancement scheme, time and people's patience is going to catch up with this dreary film, and the results are going to leave the makers very red-faced. Just about every concept in this film is stolen, poorly executed, or both. I still laugh my guts out when Morpheus tries to tell us how human bodies produce so much energy when they consume at least that much in a day. Any nutritionist worth their salt could tell you that. The division of a digital future between evil robots and kind-hearted human beings was also done far better in Tron. And the sloppy use of the Christ Theme as a plot device doesn't even bear thinking about. When I first saw the film, I had never laughed so hard in my life. When I saw it on DVD, I'd never felt so insulted. Never have I seen a production crew with such over-inflated ideas about their achievements.The characters are just plain boring, too. Keanu Reeves has all the acting ability of a stuffed toy, and yet he is the most interesting thing in the film. That's a worrying sign. Morpheus was all poses and zero credibility, Agent Smith was just an insult, and Trinity had to be one of the least watchable romantic interests since Teri Hatcher's awful performance in Tomorrow Never Dies. And was this film trying hard for some kind of record in speaking ****? Well, guess what? Their efforts succeeded big-time. Every man and his dog seems to be going on about how much better this film was than the last episode of Star Wars, but it is really more on a level with Star Trek.Frankly, if this is the future of science fiction films, then I will happily stick with my copy of Plan 9 From Outer Space. At least Ed Wood had sincere intentions of a variety other than ripping off an army of suckers when he made that piece of ****! Zero stars. And don't blame anyone other than yourselves, Matrix fans, because this film is now the celluoid answer to MTV through your efforts.",2,3,10,4 November 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The original version was brilliant...
","I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.Of course, I also knew that the film wasn't perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas' budget just didn't quite go far enough, or where there just wasn't enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer's sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn't look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse 'When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!'. Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you'd have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will.",Null,14,20,31 March 2003
Fantastic Four," X-Men for four year olds
","Comic book adaptations suffer from one fundamental problem. The extent to which the makers take the story seriously can damn or save them. Sadly, Hollywood seems to believe that if they make every film for an imaginary all-ages audience, they will recoup their costs. Unfortunately, after all the flops like Batman & Robin or Daredevil, Hollywood is still failing to learn that audiences want original ideas, good ideas, or both. Making a film out of the Fantastic Four, on paper, could have been a great idea. Unfortunately, the film soon descends into an extended episode of the morning cartoon series that introduced and wrapped every crisis or conflict in five minutes or less. In a market that is not overly saturated with CGI-riddled adaptations of comic books, this might not be such a big problem. Unfortunately, films like Fantastic Four have to compete with the likes of X-Men 2. Bryan Singer brought something to the table that is so scarily real the audience can feel the pain of the characters. Tim Story brings nothing, and makes a film that is worth nothing.Not that we cannot give him marks for trying. There is an attempt to make Thing seem more human by giving him a fiancé who is unable to continue her relationship with him after she learns what has happened to him. The problem is that since nothing is made of their relationship before the incident, and no character development is offered, this plot tangent has exactly zero impact upon the viewer. In fact, apart from the television show I watched in fits and starts as a boy, I had little idea of who or what the Fantastic Four were, and I have about the same idea now. I cannot help but draw comparisons to X-Men, which gave me remarkable insight into Wolverine and Magento especially as characters. A big part of the reason I know less about the characters after watching the film than before is because the film gives me no incentive to know the characters. Susan Storm is probably the worst example. Jessica Alba tries valiantly to portray a character other than her Dark Angel persona, but is deeply hampered by the poor development of the script.To the film's credit, the special effects used to realise the situations and the solutions used by the characters are well-realised. Hollywood will never credit them with this, but the crew who worked on Hollow Man have forever changed the depiction of invisibility in film. So much so, in fact, that this film is able to offer scientific explanation and progressive defeats of this natural camouflage. I just wish they could have put as much effort into telling a story. Much of the film concerns itself with celebrity and the media's ability to make a bad situation worse. Dialogue is occasionally offered in which The Thing informs Sue that he would give anything to be invisible, for example, but the feelings of the Four regarding their powers and abilities are never given anything more than a superficial exploration. It is only just now that we are beginning to learn that superhuman abilities and their concordant subtractions are a little more real than we were led to believe in the 1980s. The problem that films like Fantastic Four are incapable of exploring is that our society is creating far more Doctor Dooms than Sue Storms.Another big problem for the Fantastic Four is that rather than working to go as far as it can within the notorious PG-13 limits, the film is as softcore as they come. Variety might be the spice of life, but Hollywood might as well be a McDonald's at this stage. About the only thing in this particular Big Mac that has any resonance in real life is when when the Four affirm that they do not wish to be 'cured' of their powers, as terrible as the challenges they introduce to their lives might be. That I was able to type that out before the film finished on its first viewing should tell you a lot about the capacity this film has for genuine surprises. As much as I love a good film about terrible things happening to good people, this is probably one of the worst that august genre has ever produced. Roger Ebert says it all in the quote: 'I wasn't watching Fantastic Four to study it, but to be entertained by it, but how could I be amazed by a movie that makes its own characters so indifferent about themselves?'. We just do not care about these people, and therefore we do not care about the film.Anyone who knows me well enough knows that when I rate a film a step above the worst possible, it means that the film is too bad to entertain in a good way, but it is too good to derive the kind of unintentional comedy that saves a lot of B-films from historical oblivion. Plan 9 From Outer Space is remembered fifty years after its release because it was made badly with a heart and soul. Its author genuinely believed in it. Fantastic Four is nothing more than a cynical cash cow, and it deserves to be forgotten in five years.",2,1,2,3 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," An example of how much better Star Wars can be when Lucas takes his hands off the reins...
","With Episode IV raking in so much money that George Lucas was really becoming a law unto himself in the world of film, there was almost nothing to stop him from doing exactly what he wanted with the next episode. Only the limitations of technology stood in the way of him making shots work exactly as he wanted, and they only took another couple of decades to be removed.In 1980, however, Lucas at least had enough humility to let someone else handle the elements he wasn't so good at, namely story and direction. The result is a Star Wars that feels much more natural and performance-oriented than any other, despite the fact that three have been made since. It can also be argued that Episode V is the one that was least in need of a Special Edition in 1997. The story flowed well with connections to the other two Episodes well-established (except in the case of the earliest link in the Jabba subplot having to be cut out of Episode IV). The acting was as good as the actors could deliver in the hands of a good director, and the effects had evolved just barely enough that the more glaring wrinkles in the original were no longer a problem.It's no surprise, therefore, that most of the changes in the Special Edition are very subtle. In fact, the moment when the Wampa tries to eat Luke is the only obvious place in which a change is made. The other changes mostly consist of placing artifical windows in the Cloud City set to give it a less claustrophobic feel, or things to that effect. Unfortunately, when Lucas does go too far in the restorations or alterations, it sticks out like a sore thumb. The moment when C-3PO says 'at least you're still in one piece' to R2-D2 is a classic example. This shot worked well in its original form because everything about it was connected properly to the rest of the footage. In the Special Edition, it looks more like they took a bad angle, added some very silly-looking artificial sky to it, and just wedged it in there. Not exactly what I would call a seamless change.Another problem with the Special Edition is that it doesn't respect the audience's intelligence a hell of a lot. Some very unconvincing footage of Darth Vader ordering his men to let the crew of his Star Destroyer know he is coming back to take charge was added when it was just far more expedient (not to mention mature in terms of storytelling) to have Vader appear on the capital ship and let the audience assume he just got there by whatever means he had at his disposal. Instead, Lucas assumes that his audience is either less than five years old or has an IQ that doesn't exceed room temperature. Another example of him somehow acquiring Barney syndrome between 1983 and 1997.The original cut of the film is worthy of a nine out of ten (a point being deducted for some very silly effects in places). Unfortunately, the new version is only an eight. It crosses the line between enhancing the film and what happens when a child keeps adding colours upon colours to a drawing. Lucas really needs to wind down and relax, or get that ego under control, before he inspires more directors to slightly ruin their films.",Null,0,0,31 March 2003
Sin City," How do you spell overrated?
","Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino are no doubt thanking their lucky stars that there is a new generation born every day that has no memory of what went on before their birth. I say this because I read comments to the effect that this is the most violent mainstream film ever or such rot. Calling Sin City violent is like calling an Archie comic strip erotic. Nonetheless, this would not be a problem if the film did not have such a hype train following it, telling all and sundry how cooooooooool it is. What Sin City is, well, I describe it as being forty-five million dollars worth of digital imagery in search of a plot or an enjoyable cast. For around two hours, one spends the entire time watching distracting scenery pass by as actors recite lines they clearly are uncomfortable with and act in nigh on total darkness. Half the time, actors cannot be made out because of how dim the images are. One could be forgiven for thinking that Mickey Rourke's makeup was a dog dropping face mask.If there is a saving grace to the film, it is Jessica Alba's portrayal of the nineteen year old Nancy. She gives the character a human edge that the entire rest of the film utterly lacks. She still has too much of a tendency to speak like a Californian stoner when it is inappropriate, but in the absence of a human quality in any other part of the film, I will take whatever I can get. Bruce Willis also manages to make a decent fist of his role, but the almost complete surrounding in green panels makes it difficult for him to react. Actors will tell you that the eyes are one of the most vital acting tools, but so too is the sheer ease of having something to react to. In their scenes together, Willis and Alba really give the impression of a pair who met when one of the inviduals was a mere eleven years old. Unlike the rest of the film, Willis and Alba manage to build an emotional investment in their scenes. One constantly hopes that things will work out for this mismatched pair, even though the rest of the film makes it clear that things working out is not an option.Unfortunately, it is the selling point of the film that becomes its undoing. Professed by some to be an overly violent film, Sin City only demonstrates how much more squeamish cinema and audiences have become since the late 1980s. Much like Death Race 2000, none of the ensuing violence in Sin City looks real. Making it worse is that characters are repeatedly shot, blown up, or jump through panes of glass without suffering any of the injuries one expects from these events. After watching the end of Ransom or a true ultra-violent piece like RoboCop, Sin City comes across more like a no-consequence piece like Narnia than any sort of brutality. The almost-monochrome photography helps matters little, forcing the eyes to strain whenever the luminance does not quite jibe. Scenes in which Elijah Wood's glasses shine into the camera are particularly annoying in this regard, becoming bright enough to cause headaches in the photo-hypersensitive. Are Hollywood directors really so out of story ideas that they have to make their films unique by excluding nonstandard individuals?Actually, the idea this film has that lots of fake blood and gore is any substitute for consequence when depicting violence is not so surprising. One of its helmsmen was involved with the second and third RoboCop films, if that tells you anything. Quentin Tarantino is a moron who thinks that individuals talking about how hardcore they are is any substitute for individuals showing the audience how hardcore they are. Robert Rodriguez gives it his best shot, but the man has not directed a decent film since Desperado. It seems the amount of cash one allocates to his films and his ability to make something out of it are inversely proportional to one another. Sure, he can do a lot of easy tricks and timesavers with his digital camera, but the story or sense of adventure seem to fall by the wayside. Add these three together, and you have a problem. There is an old saying that too many cooks spoil a broth, and three directors is certainly my idea of too many. One can almost tell who directed which segment by taking careful note of the clashing visions. While Frank Miller's vision of his own comic book won out for the most part, having an author adapt his own work is not always a good thing (Maximum Overdrive, anyone?).I gave Sin City a three out of ten. It is not bad enough to be good, but it is better than the mediocre garbage I normally give a two. Aside from its tedious subject matter and artificial dialogue, there are some legitimately effective shots in the film. Elijah Wood puts on a nothing-face like no other, convincing me the boy might have some talent after all. So I guess you can say that the film did in fact achieve something.",3,15,30,27 January 2006
Gangs of New York," A history of a history that few were aware existed
","The nineteenth century was an incongruous time for many peoples. The British empire was losing its worldwide coverage, and the Russian monarchy was but a century or less away from annihilation. Indeed, many films that are set in this era use it as a setting, but very few have depicted it in realistic terms. Gangs Of New York is the first film I have seen, and I have seen many of all varieties, than even makes the attempt. Whether or not they succeeded, I won't say, but they deserve credit for trying.The New York of the nineteenth century is shown as a decadent, corrupt place where roving gangs regular war with one another. It begins with one such battle, in which migrants fight with a group of men who are all whiter than I am, but claim to be natives. Oh well, if they were born there, I cannot argue with them too much, but it does feel strange when the actual natives of America are nowhere to be seen in this production. Still, this opening battle sequence does give a nice, authentic feel for the story.Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely shines as Bill The Butcher, a character you want to hate but just cannot because of the elegant human quality he brings to his performance. Although the film tries to show him as little as he is needed, this is his show. He keeps the audience's attention on the screen in spite of the charisma vortex in the rest of the cast. Speaking of a charisma vortex, one has to wonder exactly what they thought when they cast Leo DiCaprio in what is essentially a gangster film. I'm yet to be convinced that he really even grew that facial hair. Cameron Diaz is little better. She is thoroughly unconvincing as a nineteenth-century prostitute. Which should surprise nobody - she has a difficult time convincing anyone that she is a twenty-first century human being.Some elements of the story are quite hilarious to behold. Whenever I hear someone rabbiting on about how much better we had it in times when the church had greater control of our daily lives or the like, I often kindly request they take a look at things, fictional or no, that say otherwise. The fighting between the fire brigades in this film is one of those things. I'm sure these historical retro-rose-eyeglass wearers would gladly go back to such a time. Then again, when I see the police having to brace themselves against angry citizens breaking into their headquarters instead of the reverse, I guess maybe they have some point, however small.Acting aside, there are some unfortunate decisions made. Whomever was arranging the music should have told Scorcese (or vice versa) that U2 lost whatever credibility they had long ago. I swear, if I hear Bono Vox repeat that these are the hands that built America one more time, I am going to want to put his head further into his rectum. The editing is also a tad off-centre, with much of the final riot in New York seeming like a montage of clips rather than a coherent whole.Still, I gave Gangs Of New York a seven out of ten. It was one of the better films of 2002, and that it didn't win a singular Oscar out of the eleven or more that it was nominated for only further destroys the Academy's credibility. See it with a friend or loved one, and marvel at the work done to create the mood.",7,0,1,16 November 2004
Spectre," A tale of two films.
","When I walked out of my first viewing of Casino Royale, I declared to a person I had gone with the very simple truth of the matter. That is how Bond should have been from the get-go. No fantasy 'shag-me-baby' Austin ****facing, no romancing of the trade of being Her Majesty's Secret Killer. Just the brutal reality as conveyed through making Bond watch his girlfriend die and endure one of the most terrifying tortures a Human male can undergo. For the first time, Bond was as grounded in reality as his premise needed him to be. Other Bonds, namely Lazenby and Dalton, went towards it, but Casino Royale was the first Bond film to dive in with both hands out. The problem is that after one rushed, truly insipid sequel that introduced shaky-cam to the Bond universe, and was derided as it deserved, the producers panicked. Skyfall had most of the things that made Casino Royale great. A truly memorable villain who challenged Bond in truly important ways, a sense of consequence, and the knowledge that the hole in Bond's soul grows that little bit bigger every time we see him.Unfortunately, it also gave us what I will call 'resurrections' of everything that I came to despise about Bond. The new Q looked like he really ought to be terrified of Bond, the new M, at least in Skyfall, looked like the sort of person Bond would break over his knee on the way to the main villain, and people in the audience could see me wincing every time the new Moneypenny spoke. Which brings us to Spectre. I call it a tale of two films because once you watch past a certain point, it becomes evident that two scripts were meshed together in order to make this story, and the fit is not a good one. The first half of the film, accounting for a hundred minutes or so, is exactly what I had been hoping for since Casino Royale and mostly got in Skyfall. A slow boiler in which Bond is pushed to his psychological limits and shows us through his eyes that even when you do it for King and Country, killing people can have consequences that last the rest of your life. But there is a certain point in the film, after Bond gets off a train in a desert, where I encourage everyone to stop watching. Go out the door and imagine your own ending.Because when that point in the film arrives, complete with a clunky, ineffective attempt to recreate the awesome torture sequence that had every male in the audience weeping sympathetic tears, it all comes apart in a big hurry. It is still entertaining, do not get me wrong, but it is to Casino Royale as RoboCop 3 (or RoboCop in name only as it should have been titled) is to RoboCop. The Casino Royale sequence, as I said, made every individual with those bits in the audience grind their teeth in sympathy with Bond. The attempt to recall this sequence in Spectre, which brings to my mind the Get Smart joke 'I murdered my dentist', is limp-wristed and ineffective. It may as well have had Roger Moore in it. And it gets worse from there. From the equally tension-free escape onwards, you might as well paint an S on Bond's chest and be done with it. Or call him James Rambond. Take your pick. Rambond. James Rambond. Yes, Casino Royale had him surviving things that have you desperately holding onto your disbelief, trying to stop it from breaking its leash. But Spectre subjects you to around 30-50 minutes of them.To be fair, Moneypenny gets better things to do this time than make the audience ask her to shut the hell up. But she also gets some lines about Bond just getting started that make an intelligent viewer want to rip their seat out of the floor and throw it at her enormous mouth. And Rafe-M shows us he is able to be more than just Bond-nagger. But in the end, the second component of this uneasy blend demonstrates to us that true to the form they have been in for all but one of the prior 23 films, the Bond producers are cowards and will only try new things when their proverbials are to the wall. The Rambond half of the film is only comparable to Pierce Brosnan Bond at its best, and that is so far below the best of what Daniel Craig has offered thus far, there is just no comparison. The less we say about our main villain, the better.Daniel Craig apparently is a co-producer in this affair. And he has but one film left in his contract. So if I could tell him what I wish he would do in the next film, it is this. Make the rest of the Bond production team go back to what made Casino Royale, most of Skyfall, and the first chunk of Spectre so great. Make Bond an ordinary man who has to endure the absolute limits of what men can be pushed to. Make him suffer the consequences of his professional choices, and make the audience feel it with him. Because the more consequence-free Bond is (as demonstrated in Other Half Of Spectre), the less he works as entertainment. Spectre could have ascended to be the Fury Road of this franchise. Instead, it is just another above-average.",7,4,8,11 November 2015
Gladiator," A special film for one odd reason...
","Detractors claim this film is a hollow entry in the Roman gladiator genre for the most pedantic of reasons. Nothing could be further from the truth. This film is one of the greatest ever made because it has the power to move people, specifically myself. I don't mean just move me in the same way that Robocop or the Star Wars saga move me by making me see aspects of my past and how I would ideally change them. I mean that Gladiator moves me by making me look at the details of a life that was, and still is to some extent, slowly dragging me down and making me abandon life altogether, and motivating me to make a commitment in the way I deal with it.That commitment? Like Maximus, I realised that I am not ready for my life to be over until I have made something more of it. Maximus could not die until he had transcended the way in which Commodus had victimized him, and liberated Rome from Commodus' inferiority complex that masqueraded as a dictatorship. As I saw this unfold on the screen in front of me, I took the death of my fiancee and the abuse of my past and saw that the future was not set, and I could still make my life something worth living.This alone justifies Gladiator's place in the 250 best films of all time, in spite of its relatively miniscule flaws. Before I die, I want to shake Russell Crowe's hand. His performance as Maximus reduced me to a tearful wreck, and at the same time moved me to do something nothing else could move me to do: let go and move on. I will always owe Crowe and Scott a huge debt for this film, which means more to me than any film I have seen before (more than five thousand, so don't bother arguing with me about it) or probably will in the future.",10,0,0,5 August 2000
Cinderella Man," Flawed, but moving biopic
","Readers of some of my comments might guess that I am not terribly impressed with Ron Howard as a producer or director, and that one of his projects will go down in my memory as an insult. So it should tell you a lot about the quality of Cinderella Man that I found it an enjoyable and moving film. It is not without its faults, granted, but its strengths are great enough that this mostly does not matter. I thought that it could have been better if Howard had not resorted to bowdlerising his subject at the expense of an opponent, but as I said to a fellow viewer the night I saw it, it could have been much worse. Like many films that star Russell Crowe, Cinderella Man literally balances itself upon his shoulders, and it gets very comfortable there for once. Crowe has been carrying films on his individual strength since almost the beginning of his career, so it should come as no surprise that he handles this with expert poise. He may have a reputation for being difficult to work with, but he also produces results that are well worth it.The Great Depression was a time of many things, mostly variations on misery, and Cinderella Man does not let up for one minute in depicting this. The biggest challenge of a film about boxing is giving the central character a reason to box, and this film nails that from the get-go. In an interview before the climactic fight, we hear Braddock tell the press that he is doing the fight because he wants to be able to buy milk. There are few people in today's English-speaking world who know anything resembling such desperation. Most of them only know it because of how they were born a little different to those in power. Anyway, the second challenge of a boxing film is to make the audience feel as if they are part of the match. Howard apparently accomplished this partly by placing a camera in a protective case and having his actors punch that. In other places, he uses the viewpoint of the character, or just films the action from the appropriate angle. Granted, some of the camera-work was a bit on the nose, so to speak, but it was mostly effective. If nothing else, Ron Howard knows how to simulate a fight for a film.Renée Zellweger gives a surprisingly good performance as Mae, the wife of Jimmy. At one (possibly more) point of the film, she tells Crowe that when he is in the ring being hit, it feels to her like she is being hit. Most of the time, when you hear the long-suffering wife character say something like this, it is comical. That one can fully empathise with Zellweger as she says this in Cinderella Man is testament to how well-scripted and well-acted her scenes with Crowe are. Paul Giamatti also gets to shine as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. For much of the film, we see Gould as being simply a trainer and facilitator, looking down his nose at the thoroughly working-class Braddock. Then in one amazing scene, we learn just how intense the pinch of the Great Depression really was, and how much Gould really had invested in what he thought up until recently was a man past his prime. In a sense, the film works especially because of how powerful a performance these two put in.The weak spot in the film is the portrayal of Max Baer. Yes, Max was a mountain of muscle who loved to punch his opponents into submission. Yes, Max killed two men in the ring. Where Cinderella Man errs is that it portrays Max Baer as having bragged extensively about the incident, even to the point of insulting Braddock's wife. Baer's son claims that Baer senior was haunted by the death of his opponent in the ring, and often wept about it. There is some corroboration to this account, but even without it, one has to consider that killing opponents in the ring and bragging about it is bad for a boxer's business. Not to mention that it is difficult to believe a man born in 1937 would say this about his dad if there weren't a fair chunk of truth to it. The essential problem here is that Howard's film portrays Max Baer with no development and no second dimension. He is a caricature, and thus Jimmy Braddock's victory in the climactic scene is lessened by it. I won't go into all the films that have been made better by multidimensional villains, but I was quite disappointed by this lapse. It is shared by all Howard films, which cannot seem to function without the good guys being very good and the bad very bad.It is for that reason I gave Cinderella Man an eight out of ten. It is not nearly in the same league as Crowe's other riches-rags-riches combat performance, but it is worth a look. With the competition it was up against, in fact, I am surprised it failed to make more money.",8,5,5,5 October 2005
Evil Dead II," For what it is worth, it works...
","In a nutshell, Evil Dead 2 is what happens when you take the original Evil Dead, chop it into parts, put the parts in a bag, and shake. The film recaps the ending of the original by bringing Ash back to the mountain cabin with a new girlfriend, who is shortly chopped up with a chainsaw before the spirits of the dead come calling after Ash. As Ash struggles to fight off the dead, a new group of unlucky adventurers, one of which is related to the archaeologist on the tape, come calling. Little Miss Archaeologist just happens to be carrying a series of new pages from the book that detail more recitations, and a prophecy about a warrior destined to destroy the evil spirits.If you were just after a description of the plot, you can stop reading now, because that was pretty much it. At a mere eighty-five minutes, nobody is going to confuse Evil Dead 2 with the epic machinations of horror maestros such as Stephen King, who once described the original Evil Dead as one of the funniest and most original films he had ever seen. And therein lies one of the franchise's essential problems. Like the child raised in a violent environment who just wants to be loved, the Evil Dead sequels progressively attempt more and more to endear themselves to a teen or family audience. This is not so obvious in Evil Dead 2, thanks to a smattering of fairly mild gore, but the third effort just dumped all pretense and might as well have called itself Teenage Mutant Ninja Ash. Heaven help us fans of real horror if the fourth Evil Dead actually sees completion.Getting back to Evil Dead 2, what makes it work is a sense of cruelty carried over from the previous film. Hands are severed, heads are knocked off, corpses dance around, and the forest comes to life once more, though not as notoriously as previously was the case. In fact, a lot of what goes on in Evil Dead 2 reads like a cleaned-up version of what happened in The Evil Dead. Which makes the short running time all the more frustrating, giving the new story little, if any, chance to develop. Not that Sam Raimi has ever been big on story, or anything that requires more than a pair of brain cells.What rescues Evil Dead 2 from being just another inferior clone is some truly creative gore. While the setup, as previously described, is unoriginal, the execution is fairly spectacular. While the idea of eyeballs popping out of heads and flying into mouths might not seem particularly original, this is the film where such creative nuances of gore entered the public consciousness. There is nothing here to compare to the red shower that occurred at the end of the original Evil Dead, but some points are won for variation. Unfortunately, restricting Ash to only using a chainsaw reduces the scope for variation to some degree. I realise that the chainsaw is supposedly a Raimi trademark, but it does get a little boring when reused too many times.All in all, I gave Evil Dead 2 a seven out of ten. It is a competent retread of the original, but little more. This puts it well ahead of the third entry in the series, which basically dissolves into an LCD version of the original. In the end, the series should have ended here. The film certainly ended on the right note of irony.",7,1,3,5 March 2005
The Island," A valiant effort, but too shallow to be remembered
","Director Michael Bay has become somewhat synonymous with high-motion action dross that malnourishes the brain and keeps the eyes busy. One could look upon The Island as his attempt to add something that might appeal to those who look for a little intellectual stimulation with their voyeurism, and in some respects, it succeeds. To a large extent, the areas in which The Island excels can be traced back to its performers and screenplay. Ewan McGregor excels at portraying a babe in the woods, despite the obvious clash this brings in contrast with his previous roles, and the cynical, cash-driven alter ego is equally believable. Scarlett Johansson puts in a brave effort to provide a foil and backup for Ewan's determination to find out just what on Earth is going on, but in the rare moments where she is expected to play solo, she is overwhelmed by the underwriting of her character. Fortunately, she works amazingly well with McGregor, and I can see she has a great future in the industry. The question with The Island, therefore, becomes one of what went wrong.Part of the answer lies in the science aspects of the story. It has been mentioned by other critics, but it becomes obvious to anyone who has studied the deeper questions of cloning as a science that a lot of what is proposed in the film is impossible. Given that Ridley Scott anticipated this very well in Blade Runner, the deep question of how one produces a clone that is not subject to rapid ageing becomes a big disappointment in The Island as Bay utterly fails to address it. To the credit of the writers, director, and actors, they do sidestep the trap of having a clone move, speak, and behave in identical fashion to his source. Ewan McGregor's versatility as an actor is proved by his ability to act against himself, using noticeably different inflections and mannerisms. The moment when one McGregor asks the other about his Scottish accent is a marvellous piece of irony. It is safe to say that this film could not have been half of what it turned out to be without McGregor.Unfortunately, a lot of the problem with The Island comes from Michael Bay and his inability to identify his audience. Up to the moment where our stars escape from the facility, the film is a surreal, complex question about the nature of existence, with elements of horror thrown in for good measure. The moments when we get fragments of the truth revealed to us through the eyes of Lincoln Six Echo are the most legitimately effective in the entire film. No, the real problem starts when Linclon and Jordan leave the facility to begin their exploration of the so-called real world. Bay is unable to resist the temptation to punctuate the rest of the film with car chases, explosions, and shoot-outs. To be fair, one of them is effective. But when they are piled up on top of each other, they only serve to diminish both themselves and the film. Even though it only consists of Joanna Cassidy beating Harrison Ford up a bit before being shot as she runs through several sheets of plate glass, three minutes of Blade Runner has a good deal more emotional resonance than the entire last hour of The Island. Nonetheless, Bay deserves some credit for being willing to take on such an obviously different film.Sean Bean also proves himself to be the best of the actors who got themselves involved in the desecration of The Lord Of The Rings. His character barely has any depth, yet Sean is able to give said character definition and motivation. In a Peter Jackson film, this is something of a miracle. In a Michael Bay film, even this one, it is like proving that black is white. And therein lies the rub of The Island. Deep questions of mind-boggling importance are proposed by its plot. These questions are foremost on the collective mind (or lack thereof) of present-day society. They literally have the ability to shape the future of said society, determining whether it will ever reach the enlightenment proposed in cartoons like The Jetsons, or whether it will sink back into the relative Dark Ages shown in films like Pleasantville. In case you wonder what I am getting at with such comparisons that have more to do with the time The Island was made in, it is pretty simple. Questions like how we should treat the serious ailments that are burdening our society to the Nth degree and how ethical it is to keep people suffering deserve far deeper exploration than The Island dares to offer.It is mainly because of the clash between shallow resolution and intriguing setup that I gave The Island a six out of ten. If you are expecting an action film with some more cerebral elements, then you will have such expectations met. If you have believed the hype that Michael Bay has finally made something that does not fit the description of Popcorn Flick to the letter, you will be disappointed.",6,1,2,11 February 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The most fun I've ever had watching a (relatively) non-violent film...
","If nothing else, this film proves just how short-changed we've been by the music industry since about 1985 or so. When I was told the film relies on numerous American musical numbers from the 1930s, I was expecting to spend a lot of time squirming in my seat from sheer agony. Surprisingly, I almost felt compelled to sing along with whomever dubbed the vocals, a radical difference compared to the mood that the crappy synthetic drum-machine garbage of such films as The Corruptor and The Replacement Killers puts me in. If I could put the music of this film in the same boat as one that is set in modern times, it'd be Desperado. The reliance upon musical talent rather than trendiness to sell this component of the film works well in its overall favour.That is not to say the film's only plus is the music. The cinematography is beautiful, and it will teach you why television screens are being made wider with the advent of digital television. If anyone tries to tell the distributor they want a panned and scanned version of this film, I'm going to kick their butts into the middle of the 22nd century. Even when there is nothing going on outside of the central focus of the shot, the wide, sweeping plains of 1930s America keep one's eyes focused upon the entire picture, not just whomever happens to be speaking. This is why 16x9 Enhanced DVD is the ONLY way to view films.George Clooney is delightful in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, while John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson provide wonderful comic fodder in their roles. Chris Thomas King is delightful as Tommy Johnson, the guitarist who sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads. Their recording session was delightful to sit through, and it is a hilarious reflection on the times that they could cut a record while on the run, and then travel across the state, blissfully unaware that they have a number one record on their hands. Contrast this with modern pop 'stars' who can't get enough of themselves or their record company's attempts to make them out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. There is a moral to this part of the story: truly good music only needs word of mouth to make people want to listen to it.Oh, and the Sirens scene... now that was worth watching the entire film for, even if it was quite bizarre. In five minutes, we have a more pleasant image to look at than the entirety of Sirens, the meandering (not to mention ugly) film of Norman Lindsay's story that was filmed not far from where I live. I thoroughly recommend this film. It succeeded in entertaining me beyond my most generous expectations.",10,0,0,6 January 2001
The Godfather," The best cinematic adaptation of a novel... ever.
","Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather was a sweeping tale spanning two generations with a tale that, as director Francis Ford Coppola states, is more the tale of a king with three sons than of a mob war. This view of the novel is surprisingly accurate, and the movie is helped along by it. Granted, the family at the centre of the story is in the business of crime, but the story is more about the family than the crimes.The head of this family is Don Vito Corleone, played to perfection by Marlon Brando. His mannerisms, and the mannerisms of any other mob boss who has survived assination attempts and wars, are captured marvellously in Brando's performance. At no stage did I have any problem believing that I was watching a mob boss rather than an actor just playing his part. Then, of course, there's the three sons: Santino (James Caan), Frederico (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino). The first two of these young men are unsuitable to succeed their father as head of the family business. The youngest, and most unwilling, is ironically the most suitable. This touch makes me wonder if Mario Puzo read Plato a lot when he was writing The Godfather, for it was Plato who said that the unwilling make the best rulers. Filling out the family's ranks are Constanzia Corleone (Talia Shire), who is getting married on the day the film opens to Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), and Vito's adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). There isn't a single member of the cast, at least where these important roles are concerned, who doesn't play their part to a disbelief-suspending perfection.As I mentioned previously, the film is more about the family than their business activities. Indeed, the business side of the story really only exists for plot movement. While the film cannot capture every single detail from the novel, such as the intricacies of the business, it does an excellent job of filling out the details. I've yet to see another film where this much detail from the original novel has made its way into the screenplay. Critics accuse this film of being overlength, but this is a load of cobblers. Having sat through a television broadcast of this film that took up four hours once the commercials were accounted for, I can tell you that the film is absolutely riveting. Whether it is the story, the characters, or Nino Rota's amazing score music, this film has everything it takes to keep a viewer glued to the screen for its entire length. Even the slowest part of the film, Michael's pilgrimage in Sicily, is delightful to watch due to its cinematography and doomed romance between Michael and Apollonia.As a matter of fact, the only criticism I have of The Godfather and its first sequel is that the back story of Vito Corleone wasn't developed enough. There are numerous details, such as how Luca Brasi came to be in Vito's employ, which should have been shown in the film. The role of Mama Corleone was also somewhat underdeveloped, as her interaction with Kay Adams was a critically important element of the novel. I don't think she was ever known by any other name in the novel, either, but she was still a living, breathing character with concerns and feelings of her own. Something she was stripped of in the film. All of these elements could have used some screentime because they help the reader/viewer to understand Vito Corleone as a human being as well as as a mob boss.Aside from that one minor complaint, however, The Godfather is the best screen translation of a novel in the history of the art form. Francis Ford Coppola should be knighted for this movie, as he stands head and shoulders above anyone else who has attempted this feat (Stanley Kubrick's failure to get half the detail of The Short Timers, a 180-page novel where half the words are expletives, into Full Metal Jacket, anyone?).",Null,1,4,26 February 2001
