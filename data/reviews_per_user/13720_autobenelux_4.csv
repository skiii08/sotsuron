Walk the Line," a pathetic movie about an ignominious country and western singer.
","This film is synonymous of the type of modern film making that seems to eulogise facts and circumstances which are not only trivial but of no substance.We have the usual rags to riches type story peppered with some personality defects and from this we have to identify a character who appears to be a world wide representative of the good ol'country boy doin' good after a period in the wilderness. Maybe our American cousins have a greater affinity to this sort of thing but as a movie it was quite pathetic. The acting was reasonable but where a characterisation of a once living person is depicted an actor of merit should accomplish this without too much effort. Our friends in the movie business seemed to rate this movie quite highly this is not surprising in a mutual admiration set -up. I am beginning to question my own values where we are continually directed in way of MASTERPIECES which turn out to be so much turgid , uninspiring normality",2,4,12,23 April 2006
A Bridge Too Far," an excellent effort of a less than successful WW11 mission
","A wonderful film which describes in detail the incomprehensible blindness of the controllers of the War. The moving seen where the intelligence officer is sent to a Mental Hospital to cover up his discovery is all too true and exemplifies the attitude of some Senior War Office people who had the greatest illusions of their own ability regardless of the facts. The cast is mostly superb but particularly Anthony Hopkins,Sean Connery,Liv Ulman,Edward Fox,Micheal Caine. The scene is set in a genuine location ,no disaster as in Private Ryan ,where the Irish topography was so out of place with the actual setting andthe actual story so badly told. It is a film that portrays more than almost any other the superb discipline and blind faith of those who fought and in this case misguidedly. No doubt those who set up the operation where canonised and decorated and those killed forgotten. Richard Attenborough can feel a sense of achievement with this film which was much berated on initial release. Maybe time and real assessment can only be made when comparison is made with the rubbish known as art that now pervades our cinemas and airwaves. Edward Fox is the character in every way ,a wonderful portrayal of Horrecks .The Dutch scenes and sets are so actual it is a credit to all concerned no computerised matter in this but a genuine effort at resurrecting the scene of the events. All should see this film as a lesson in film making.",Null,1,2,17 April 2005
U-571," as a film quite reasonable , as fact total rubbish
","Is it not time Hollywood stopped playing with history and told it like it is or was.no one disputes their ability to produce mountains of movies that with the exception of a half a dozen or so each year end up in oblivion. Why are they unable to accept that there are people who want to see a representation of fact not some manufactured screenplay. To any one without Knowledge of WW11 this may seem sound entertainment but surely film should educate to some degree as well as give pleasure. American involvement in WW11 was the saving grace, at the end for democracy, but please leave what achievements made by others to them to portray or do it factually.",5,2,5,19 January 2004
The Da Vinci Code," What a waste of time
","This film with all its hype is the most disappointing production ever witnessed. The book was unworthy of reading and the film must rank along side.What is the story trying to say? A good caste was wasted in this hotch potch . are we to be treated as some unintelligent morons. Dan Brown must laugh all the way to bank as must the young man from HAPPY DAYS. He has made a good fist of his previous films but the story line here is so ridiculous and without real meaning the world public must lacking in intellect to regard this rubbish as of any consequence. Jean Reno a fine actor must be in need of some funds in know Tom Hanks is a pal of Ron but this takes friendship too far. Ron Howard had consider hid position before entering into any further fiascoes, he is advise to stick to sound propositions from now on or has he also gone for the big buck which is more and more the reason for most modern movies. Why not try to remake with modern magic, films such as Foreign Correspondent,The Third Man etc.This film is the best case of convoluted tosh ever seen. The rating in your site is beyond my comprehension how much were they paid?",4,3,7,13 November 2006
