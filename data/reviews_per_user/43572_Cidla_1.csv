The Blair Witch Project," A home movie's out takes
","This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.  It reminded me of a home movie buff who never learned to keep the camera still, and then decided to splice all his out takes together rather than throw them away.  There was no plot, only some people who got lost, and had absolutely no surprise ending. I could have seen Runaway Bride, but I didn't have sense enough to walk out of this piece of trash, since I had heard that there was a surprise ending. There wasn't any.  It was worse than Xtro.  I gave it a 1, but would have given it a -1 only I couldn't.",1,1,4,2 August 1999
