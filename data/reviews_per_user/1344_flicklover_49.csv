The Blair Witch Project," I have seen it 3 times!!! Still terrifying!!!!
","I have seen this movie 3 times and i still believe that it is excellent. I have read most of the reviews of the film here, and most are positive, but the some of the negative ones bother me. I truly believe that they are missing the point! I have to agree that the film has been hyped too much, but at least the movie is worthy.( remember GODZILLA?). I saw the movie before the hype so I can't be accussed of being influenced by the hype. The average American moviegoer is lazy, unwilling to be challenged by a film. People today want to be wowed by special effects they dont want to use their imagination. That is what Blair Witch does, it chllenges the viewer to use his/her imagination. I love a good hollywood blockbuster as much as anyone, but they have become so  commonplace that they are not as good as they used to be. The Blair Witch Project proves that at times, less is more. What the audience doesnt see is scarier than what they do see. I can give a perfect example: in Jaws the movie was more effective whaen youm couldnt see the shark, right? The same has been implemented here. I went to see The Haunting the other day, I hated it, good production values and thats it! No sense of real fear! After the movier ended i listened to people's reaction to it, most liked it! Im amzed, the movie had a stupid story, terrible acting, nothing memorable, but the people only talked about the effects! True some of the effects were good but cmon, The Haunting doesnt hold a candle to BW! People now seem to rate a movie solely on the SFX, that is sad.The point is The Blair Witch is an example of good planning and genuine desire to scare. The performances are incredibly real, especially Heather's. Her scene alone late in the film should earn her an Oscar nod! But Im sure that the snobs in the Academy won't recognize that it is a great performance considering the kind of film The Blair Witch is. Like any movie TBW may not be everyone's cup of tea, but some of the comments im reading are just ridiculous!YES! The website was a clever way to raise interest in the film! YES! THe marketing for the film is aggressive! But the movie lives up to the hype if you go with an open mind, if you expect to see a movie like Scream( which I do like by the way) you will be disappointed. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN A MOVIE, LEAVE YOUR HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER EXPECTATIONS BEHIND. The Blair Witch Project is a fresh departure from the normal moviegoing experience!",9,5,9,7 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," TERRIFYING!!!!
","I went into the theater with high expectations, I read many reviews of this movie and I was really expecting to be blown away by it. The reaction that I had was not of being blown away but a sense of fear that I had really not felt ever in a movie theater. The film is being described as one of the scariest ever made, and I have to agree! I dont think that it belongs to the traditional horror movie genre, the fear that the filmakers achieve here is not cinematic, it is real, as if we are experiencing what the characters are. I felt like I was living their dilema. I felt nervous from the moment they arrived in the woods. This is the type of movie you experience not watch. Im sure that people are going to analyze this film for years, I honestly believe that there is nothing to analyse, this movie taps into our basic fears. there is one scene in the film that literally is heart-wrenching. People will disect this movie, they will talk about technique and theorise about the filmakers intentions. I believe that their single intention was to scare the audience silly! With me at least, they have succeeded! I have the film's images and sounds floating around in my head. This is truly a unique film! DON'T SEE IT ALONE!!!",9,1,2,18 July 1999
Miracle," very entertaing!!!
","I was only ten years old when the US hockey team beat the might Soviet team. I do remember the pride that people took in the victory. The begining of the 80's was rough time in the US. This movie retells the story in a very efective non-heavy handed way. The focus of the movie is the coach, played by Kurt Russel. His performance carries the film, he brings energy to the film. The hochey aspect is handled in a great way, everybody know the outcome of the game but the movie builds to its victorious conclusion gracefully. Even though the movie recognizes the patriotic aspect of the story, it doesn't go overboard with it, which is nice, if the movie would have been made in the 80's the filmakers probably poured it on thick. It is the type of movie that puts a smile on your face as you walk out of the theater.Grade:B",9,0,0,10 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but doesn't hold up with others in the Star Wars universe!!!
","I saw PM when it came out, I liked it, and was less harsh than most fans and critics. The expectations for this film were unrealistically high, George Lucas was going to get it from all angles. After 6 years and many viewings I still believe that it is entertaining, but it doesn't hold up to the other Star Wars films. Visually it is as good if not better than the previous trilogy, the planet of Naboo is impressive. What really doesn't hold it up is that it doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie at times. Many people complain about Jar Jar Binks as the problem, that the film was made to cater to the kiddie crowd. In a way, I agree that Lucas consciously went for the younger ones here, which is fine, but the main character of Anakin fails to capture the audience as he should. The movie really belongs to Liam Neeson. as Qui Gon, he creates a character that we like and respect, much as we did with Alec Guiness as Obi Wan in the previous trilogy. The obvious problem is that the movie had to set up a lot of plot points in one movie, the whole political situation leading to the invasion of Naboo bogs the movie down a bit.Still, can it honestly be viewed as a bad movie? Not at all. I believe that if this movie would have not had the Star Wars title that it would have been much better received by all. Out of the 5 films that are already out, it is the weakest least memorable. But if given a chance, there is much to appreciate. For instance, it has what I consider to be the BEST light saber fight of all the films so far. It had Darth Maul, a very cool villain w\ho is painfully underused. Give the movie a break, though it is not as good as it should be, it is better than we are leads to believe.Grade: B-",7,0,2,3 May 2005
United 93," Heartbreaking, but necessary!!!!
","There has been much debate on whether or not there should be films about 9/11 so soon. I believe that it is important to have films that tell the stories about what happened on that day. We all have our memories of that day, we all remember how we felt. This film is a masterpiece, it captures the horror and confusion that was felt on that day without being manipulative or exploitative. The central event of course is the hijacking of United 93, but it isn't a typical made for TV style film in that it doesn't focus on characters. We don't get to know any of the passengers, the film is in the moment. It doesn't make any political statements, it is about the tragic day that will be part of out collective memories, it is right to have films like this. We need to be reminded of our past , no matter how horrible.Grade: A",10,0,5,4 May 2006
Friday Night Lights," More than just a football movie!!!
","Anyone who is a football fan will like this film for its football story. I found that it is about more than just the game of football. The film is set in Odessa, Texas where high school football is almost a religion, a small town that would otherwise not exist to the outside world if not for its varsity football team. The film stars Billy Bob Thornton, as the coach of the team, in a very subtle but effective performance, the focus is not on him, the film focuses on the players on the team, 3 in particular. The quarterback who is insecure about himself and is trying to be a leader, the star running back who seems to only think of himself until fate changes him, and the fullback that has a propensity for mistakes on the field, he has an abusive father that hates the way he plays. Without giving plot points which I hate to do, the film grew on me. It does have some of the typical sports movie stuff, the games the practices etc.. But most of it show how important the game of football is to them and to the town. Thew players trying to get out of Odessa thru football, playing their hearts out to get scholarships to college, but it is realistic in saying that most of the players wont make it out of the town. You don't have to be a sports fan to love this film. Grade: A-",10,0,1,21 October 2004
A Star Is Born," The best versi√≥n of this story.
","A Star Is Born had been made 3 times before this version directed by Bradley Cooper Cameron out. I went into the theater with cautious optimism on liking thus movie. Though I like the 1976 Barbara Streisand it is very much just a showcase for her singing. The movie seemed very much an ego trip for it's star.This updated version makes the focus of the story Jackson Maine played by Cooper. He is a talented but alcoholic, drug addicted country- rock star that falls in love with Ally, played by Lady Gaga. He sees her singing in a drag bar and is instantly smitten by her beauty and talent. This is all of course familiar but Bradley Cooper's performance is so good that you buy him in the role. He is on the way down in his stardom, and the drugs and alcohol are taking their toll in his life, but he comes off as a troubled but sensitive guy with alot of inner demons. Ally is played by Lady Gaga. When Jackson and Ally are together there is instant chemistry. Jackson is so impressed by her talent that he invites her ti sing at one of his concerts. The concerts scenes between Cooper and Lady Gaga are really good. Obviously, she being the performer she is looks very comfortable in those scenes. I have to say that I wasn't really into.her in the movie at first. I an not a huge fan of her music. But her performance is really good. Her performance though very good, is not completely up to par with Bradley Cooper but she holds her own. Like the other movies dealing with this story Ally becomes a huge star a little to quickly. But hey, it's a movie. She gets approached by a manager/record producer Rez that wants to work with her. She is very excited about the opportunity but Rez wants to completely change her image and music style. He wants to make her into a pop star. Jackson doesn't like thus but supports Ally. The film does take a shot at the cookie cutter, corporate pop music that is very much what Lady Gaga performs in real life. Jackson is at once happy for his love for her newfound success but is also a little jealous because he knows his star is fading. His addiction starts to dominate and he begins to be a negative influence in Ally's career. Jackson has a half brother named Bobby played by Sam Elliott that manages his career. Bobby is tired of Jacksons antics but stays with him because he takes care of his younger brother. There is alot of tension between Bobby and Jackson, especially regarding Jackson's idolatry of their seemingly bad father. The whole story is of course predictable, but the performances, the music, the supporting characters are so good that the movie is very involving. It all wouldn't work without the romantic chemistry between Cooper and Lady Gaga. It it really does. It is very much a Hollywood screen love story, but it works. What's impressive is Bradley Cooper's sure handed direction. He doesn't try to wow us with any fancy directorial flourishes. He focuses on the performances. Especially his. Alot of times, actors that also direct a movie have their performances suffer because they are involved more in the making of the movie. It doesn't happen here. Cooper's performance as Jackson is great. Tender, angry and heartbreaking.A terrific directorial debut.Grade: A-",9,0,0,10 May 2020
Oldboy," Man did that suck!!!!
","I have been catching up with Korean films since I viewed I SAW THE DEVIL a couple of months ago. That film blew me away. It was a very violent revenge story. The film was uncomfortable to watch but the story was compelling and emotional, not just violent. I had read a lot of great things about OLDBOY. I didn't know much about the plot, but assumed that it would be good from all the great things I read about it.After seeing this film I really don't get why it got such accolades. The basic outline of the story is that a man is put in an isolated room for 15 years in a cell that looks like a hotel room. He escapes the cell and begins a frantic search for truth and revenge. All of this sounds promising doesn't it? We it starts out very well. But as the film goes along it gets so convoluted and strange that it just lost me. The film stars Choi Min-sik as Oh Dae-su, the man that is imprisoned. When he gets out he is given a cell phone in which he gets a call from his captor. His captor refuses to tell him why he was imprisoned. What follows is a web of violent revenge and deception. His captor wants to make Oh Dae-su suffer. Again, the basic story could have been very involving but this film is done in such a slow meandering and overall weird way that I just didn't care for it. I won't give away much, but this film is so pretentious and self serious for it's own good. The violence in the film is very brutal, but without the emotional connection it just seems gratuitous. I've read reviews of this film hailing it as a masterpiece, I just dont get it? It is well filmed but so outrageous that it lost me. Not for the faint of heart. I won't see this again.",3,1,6,16 December 2018
Brokeback Mountain," A good film, but don't believe the hype!!!!
","This film is getting a lot of attention for obvious reasons, the film has been adopted by people with agendas that have nothing to do with the film itself. It is of course about 2 cowboys that fall in love and have a secret homosexual relationship over a 20 year period. I went into this film wanting to see if it was as good as all the reviews are saying. Needless to say it is a good film, Heath Ledger gives a great performance, Jake Gyllenhaal is good but doesn't match the intensity of Ledger. They meet on a job during a summer,where they are alone, and have a sudden strong attraction towards each other. The movie is not really concerned with the physical part of the relationship. Director Ang lee should be credited with not dwelling on the obvious sexual encounters of the men. The movie believe it or not has a very tradition Hollywood structure, 2 lovers meet, realize they can't be together, and decide to have a a secret love affair. The fact that it is between 2 men is the reason that the film is garnering such attention. If the film's love story was between a man and a woman, the film would not be as highly regarded as it is. It bothers me because I think that as a film it is done with such care for its story. I do feel that the film does not focus on the wives of these 2 men enough. The truth is these 2 men are lying to the 2 people that love them, the movie really doesn't deal satisfactorally with that. The film will not change anyone's mind about the subject of homosexuality, I believe it is a compelling story. What I don't agree with is that it is being touted as a masterpiece simply because of the fact that the lovers are 2 men. The move is good on it's own merits, but it is really not what it is being made out to be. To call this the greatest love story ever as I have read I think is disengenious, it is a compelling human story, but it bothers me that this movie is being treated as if it were a masterpiece for political reasons.",7,10,22,10 January 2006
Aquaman," Please let James Wan reboot Superman!!!!
","Aquaman has never been one of my favorite superheroes but I was looking forward to this film because I like James Wan as a director. DC has mostly failed miserably over the years trying to create a universe to compete with Marvel. They do have what I think is the best superhero trilogy in the Dark Knight films but since then they gave the keys to Zack Snyder to start their universe with Man of Steel. Even though I kind of liked it, I never really agreed with his take on Superman. My fears were confirmed when Batman vs Superman came out. That film was embarrassingly bad. Snyder had taken two of the greatest comic book heroes and stripped just about everything we love about them. The only good thing I can say about that film is that it is only slightly better than Batman and Robin directed by Joel Schumacher. But that film was just horrible in every way. Justice League was ok, but not near as good as the Avengers series. Then finally DC got it right with Wonder Woman. That film was great. It presented an origin story but it also made the main character something that Mr. Snyder didn't do. Wonder Woman was a HEROIN!!! She wasn't the brooding bores that Batman and Superman were in his films. The film was fun and rousing, as I think these type of films should be.Well DC has finally got has gotten it right again with Aquaman!!! I hadn't really thought much about Jason Momoa as Aquaman in Justice League, but here he makes the character his own. The setup is relatively quick with Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, an princess that had escaped Atlantis to avoid marrying a man she didn't love.
Temuera Morrison plays Thonas Curry, a lighthouse keeper that notices Atlanna on the shore and rescues her. They fall in love and have a baby named Arthur. Shortly after he is born, they are attacked by Atlantian soldiers and she goes back to Atlantis to protect Arthur and Thomas. Then the film moves forward to Aquaman rescuing a submarine from pirates in a great action scene. In that scene Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is introduced as David Kane, a villain that would later become Black Manta. Then the film goes to Atlantis where we see that Orm, played by Patrick Wilson. He is Arthur's half brother and wants to wage war with the surface world. Arthur is almost killed with his father in an attack with a tidal wave but is saved by Mera, played by Amber Heard. She is an Atlantean that has been chosen to marry Orm but tries to convince Arthur to come to Atlantis to claim his birthright as King. He refuses, he had been rejected by Atlantis as a half breed. Mera convinces Arthur to go with her to help prevent Orm's attack on the surface. Once in Atlantis, they meet Vulko played by Willem Dafoe. Vulco had trained Arther in his youth to fight at the request of Arthur's mother. He tells Arthur and Mera that they should find the Trident of Atlan, a weapon that had been wielded by the first king of Atlantis. If Arthur would get this magic artifact, he would he accepted as King of Atlantis. Suddenly they are ambushed and Arthur is captured, but Vulko and Mera escape. Once captured, Orm confronts Arthur and tells him thT their mother had been executed for the crime of having a half breed son. Arthur challenges Orn to a duel in front of all of Atlantis do determine the rightful king. Orn defeats Arthur, but Mera rescues him. They both travel to find the Trident of Atlan. They go to the Sahara Desert to find where the weapon was forged. There, they unlock a holographic message that leads them to Sicily. They find the coordinates to the location of the trident. Orm had given David Kane weapons to kill Arthur, he used that technology to built the Black Manta suit. When Arthur and Mera are in Sicily, Black Manta attacks them, almost killing Arthur before being thrown from a cliff to his apparent death. Mera helps Arthur heal and tells him to embrace his destiny as a hero as they go find the trident. They arrive to their destination but are attacked by some monsters called The Trench but are able to escape. They find a wormhole and are transported to a ocean at the center of the earth. There, they are unexpectedly reunited with Atlanna. She had been sacrificed to The Trench but was able to survive. Arthur goes to retrieve the trident, facing Karathen, the creature that guards the trident. Arthur is able to prove his worth and reclaims the trident. Arthur emerges with the traditional Aquaman suit. Along with Atlanna and Mera, he goes to confront Orm. Orm had already started the war that would eventually go to the surface. Once Orm's followers see that Arthur has the Trident if Atlan they embrace him as King. Arthur then confronts Orm and demands that he renounce the thrown. After they fight, Orm is deafeated. Orm then discovers Atlanna is alive and accepts his fate. Atlanna finally returns to the surface and reunites with Thomas as Arthur ascends to the throne in Atlantis.Aquaman succeeds at being an epic superhero story. James Wan and company have created a very entertaining and I evolving film. And as in the case of Wonder Woman made Aquaman what he should be, a hero to root for. Jason Mamoa plays Arthur with a lot of humor but also with heroic conviction. All of the cast is good, especially Amber Heard as Mera. She and Mamoa have good chemistry. The look of the film is predictably spectacular. The world of Atlantis is really great to look at. Even though it is obvious that the characters are not underwater the effects make it as believable as it could be. But the characters and story make the film enjoyable. I'm glad that DC has finally found the way to do justice to their heroic characters. I hope with the success of this film, Jane's Wan is given the chance to reboot Superman the right way. I really enjoyed Aquaman!",8,1,2,23 December 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," The summer blockbuster isn't what it used to be!!!
","I used to look forward to the summer blockbuster season. The movies that come out at this time are usually big, loud, and fun. Now they are just big and loud. I always go into a Roland Emmerich flick not expecting too much, he puts together a big spectacular show, but as far as a memorable story, he falls short. This film is being sold as a movie with an environmental message, global warming is basically going to plunge the world into a new ice age. I have nothing against a movie trying to inform, but it is when a movie insults my intelligence is when I tune out. Dennis Quaid stars as a scientist that warns that the earth is dangerously close to a global climate change, he does this at a summit where he chides the VP of the United States(who looks very much like Dick Cheney!), of course this guy does not want to hear about this, he's an evil Republican!!!LOL. As far as the FX, though I agree that they a competently done, are not as groundbreaking as one might think. At one point, Los Angeles is virtually destroyed by a bunch of tornadoes. The effects here are on a larger scale, do not look as convincing as the tornadoes in the movie Twister. The other aspect of the movie are as average and predictable as you could get, Dennis Quaid traverses the northeast to get to his son that is in New York where the city is frozen. His son is played by a very bland Jake Gyllenhaal. I've always regarded him as a low-rent Tobey MacGuire. Though the movie is never boring, it moves slowly, it's not as compelling as it should be. I'm not going to complain about all the scientific BS that is inaccurate because it would be a mute point. The incredible thing is that with a movie that has the 'message ' that it this one claims to have, its funny that you would have a scene of some astronauts in a space station looking down at the earth after the destruction and saying how clear the air looks, not a mention of the MILLIONS of people that perished,or even their own families!!!! What a half hearted , cheap attempt to pass this clunker off as a environmental statement!!! Grade:C-",4,0,1,2 June 2004
Spider-Man 3," The curse of the 3rd installment!!!!
","I have always thought that the 3red part of any movie trilogy come off as a near miss or a complete failure. There are many examples of this. Alien 3, Lethal Weapon 3, even Return of the Jedi is for me the weakest film in the 1st Star Wars trilogy. Spider-Man 3 is no exception. It is in no way a complete failure, but is the weakest of the Spider-Man films. It has been reported that it is the most expensive film of all time, and there lies the problem. I think that Sam Raimi and company had so much money and pressure to deliver a home run on this film that they packed the movie with way to much stuff. There are three villains this time, Sandman, Venom, and The Green Goblin. That is one too many, the movie lacks the focus of the first two. It's all over the place. There is the inner conflicts that Peter Parker deals with, his relationship with Mary Jane, it all was dealt with much better in the other 2 films. The disadvantage with here is that the audience is already so familiar with these characters that there isn't anything really new, so the conflicts between them are not as compelling.Yes, the FX are impressive, but they are nothing that we haven't seen before. The action is well done, but without the strong story it just doesn't involve me more because the CGI cost so much. Sam Raimi balanced all the elements of a big budget summer movie to near perfection in Spider-man 2, the FX and action were there, but the story is what made it a great movie. Here he was given as many toys as he wanted and it almost got completely away from him.It is entertaining, but I heard almost every person that was walking out the theater say that Spider-Man 2 was much better.Grade: B-",6,2,4,5 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Well, after the 4th viewing. I still like it!!!
","The day that i saw this film for the first time i came out of it feeling that i saw some great things and some bad things in it. Since the Disney Star Wars trilogy came out it has become almost a sport to hate them. Just like it was when the prequels came out. The vitriol against these films is I think so outrageous that I think some people just want to hate them. Now, the same people that despised George Lucas for Episodes 1-3 now suddenly like them in favor of these new episodes. I said in my previous reviews that I LOVE all of these films. I live the universe that George Lucas created. When the prequels came out I was disappointed a little just like most people were because they just felt different than the original trilogy. But I enjoyed them, and over the years I have grown to appreciate them. They are nearly as bad as some have said. They were different, but it was Star Wars.Then came the Disney purchase of Lucasfilm and they made The Force Awakens. There was a lot of hype obviously and it blew alot of people away. JJ Abrams had brought back the Star Wars that we loved so much. I was ecstatic. It was a very nostalgic film that gave the audience what it lacked in the prequels. But no, there was a very loud faction of Star Wars fans that said that it was too much like Star Wars Episode 4. That is precisely what I loved about it!!! It was a great mix of old and new. The new characters of Rey, Finn, and Poe were good. Especially Rey. But the presence of the the old characters made it better. But no, some people just didn't like it. Unbelievable.Then a couple of years later we got The Last Jedi directed by Rian Johnson. And he did what JJ Abrams didn't. He took some chances with his film. He made certain choices that were viewed as heresy by the alot of fanboys!!! It is hated by many. Again, I just dont get it? The Force Awakens was panned by many for being safe and nostalgic. Rian Johnson tried to take some real chances, and I have to admit I didnt like alot of them but it was great to see something different. I have grown to.like the film more with every viewing. Again, I get some of the objections to the choices that he made but the film is really good. I think some people hate just for the sake of hating.So now we get The Rise of Skywalker. And the hate seems even worse!!! Disney brought back JJ after Lasr Jedi underperformed. And he does more of what he did in Force Awakens, and it is good and bad. This film has the disadvantage of being the 3rd installment of a trilogy. It is overstuffed and at times a mess. But to me so much is done well that again I don't get the hatred? I will say that it does seems as though JJ and Rian were not on the same page in that this film changes or ignores alot of what was done in Last Jedi. So there is some disconnect in the trilogy.The film had alot against it, starting with the death of Carrie Fisher. She was supposed to be a much bigger focus in this film. She appears in the film, with very little dialogue because here scenes taken from Force Awakens and edited for this one. It is done as well as at could have been. Rey is presented again as she is training to be a Jedi but is haunted by not knowing who her parents were. Her interaction with Kylo Ren is here as in Last Jedi but they can actually inhabit there spaces. It is really good. Daisy Ridley is good as Rey again. She sells her duality very well. The relationship between Rey, Finn, and Poe is very good and played mostly for laughs. They have good chemistry. The non spoiler spoiler is that Emperor Palpatine is back. From the trailer it was shown that he was back so his being in this film was no surprise. Alot of people are also complaining about Palpatine being alive, thus reducing the role of Darth Vader/ Anakin Skywalker in the saga. I think he was brought back because JJ and Disney wanted to get fans excited. And as usual Ian Mcdormand is really good as the villian. Is it sort of lazy to not present a new threat? Maybe but this is Star Wars. There have been 3 planet destroying space stations in this universe! It's fiction!!!! The film is filled with callbacks and touching moments, some don't hit as much as intended but others do. There is one in particular that was just perfect. I teared up. Overall, after seeing this film 4 TIMES mey opinion is unchanged. It is not perfect, but it has enough Star Wars moments that resonate that satisfied me. To.me it is the weakest in the new trilogy. Force Awakens and Last Jedi I think were more focused. This one is all over the place at times. But again, the 3rd installment almost always is somewhat of a mess because it is s conclusion. Return of the Jedi is the weakest in the original trilogy suffers a little from that also. I feel.that a singular vision would have helped these new films and they did feel like Disney wanted to please such a wide audience that there was no real plan. Ypu can dislike the Star Wars prequels all you want but George Lucas at least had a clear vision. Even though the original trilogy is more beloved. I really love this universe, so I am happy with this new trilogy. Could they have been better? Yes. Are they horrible like so many say? No.Grade: B",8,5,18,4 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I am fed up with all of the hate!!!
","In 1977, I waited more than a month to see Star Wars. It was playing only in theater where I lived and it was sold out constantly for weeks. When I finally saw it was incredible. I had never been as excited after seeing a movie. The Star Wars saga will always have a place in my heart. I truly love it. I am not a Star Wars geek per se. I dont obsess over the most minuscule details such as names of obscure characters in the universe but no other films mesmerized me as much as the original trilogy. To this day there is NOTHING that I love more than being in a packed theater and seeing 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' and Star Wars blast into the screen with the music by John Williams. I get chills.I, like many people was disappointed when the prequels came out. The Phantom Menace just wasn't as good as I had hoped. But my love for the is universe never waned. I do agree with the criticism of how George Lucas had decided to focus too much on the political machinations of the senate and trade federation instead of focusing on what made us love Star Wars in the first place. But I never despised the prequels like others did. In fact, I think that Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is a very worthy Star Wars film. Better than even Return of the Jedi in many ways. But, yes I agree that it misses greatness because of some of the choices that Lucas made. And definitely Attack of the Clones is the worst entry in the series. But again, are they really thst horrible? Or are Star Wars fans just obsessed with hating them because it makes them cool? I don't think that you don't have to love them, but the irrational hatred for these films is ridiculous in my opinion.Then came the the new sequel trilogy. When The Force Awakens came out I was really excited but did not let myself get my expectations to high. It blew me away!!! It was the Star Wars film I was waiting for!!! It brought back the feeling of the original trilogy. And the new characters looked promising, especially Rey. But then came the haters. Complaining that is was too much like A New Hope blah blah blah. This from many of the same people that hated George Lucas for making the prequel trilogy so different!!! I agree that TFA takes no real chances, and was very heavy on nostalgia, but I loved it. Then Last Jedi came. I didnt love it as much as as TFA but it was great that Rian Johnson took chances and tried to take the series forward in new directions. Yes, I didnt like some of his choices but he tried something different and I admire that. But again came the utter hatred for this film. It is despised as much as any other Star Wars film. I don't get it? These people just can't be pleased. It's as if they just won't like anything no matter what is on the screen. In fact, every time I see The Last Jedi, I like it more, even with the things I don't like.Sorry for the rant. But reading some of the reviews of theses films in the last 4 years and the blatant hate for them is just pathetic. I finally saw Rise of Skywalker. And I admit i am feeling mixed. I love alot of it, but was disappointed by some of it. It will take a couple more viewings, which I will certainly do to really decide how much I like it. One thing I can say is that JJ Abrams and Disney attempted to appease the haters of Last Jedi. Certain things that Rian Johnson established are pretty much ignored or diminished. JJ Abrams is more interested in respecting Star Wars than taking chances
And that's good and bad. But this film is as good as it could be considering that there was no real vision of what the 3 films were going to be. That is a problem that I have to say. The original plan was to have 3 different directors for each film and that seemed like a good idea. After Last Jedi was so reviled. JJ Abrams was brought back because The Force Awakens was better received. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Abrams seems to LOVE Star Wars and it shows. I believe that is the case with Rian Johnson, but he wanted to take chances that Abrams didn't. I don't talk about spoilers but this film has some really great moments. The new characters have good chemistry. Rey, Poe, and Finn are fun to see. They will never be as beloved as Luke, Han, and Leia but I think they are memorable. The best thing of the first 2 films was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. He is terriific here again, his character arc in the 3 films is very satisfying. He is a great villain, yes, but his inner struggles are very engrossing. I wish George Lucas would have payyed more attention to this with a better actor as Anakin. His turn do the dark side needed an actor that had more presence, Hayden Christiansen just didn't have it. It didn't help that Lucas himself admits that he's not an actor's director. Adam Driver nails Kylo Ren.As in any 3rd part in a trilogy. Rise of Skywalker has alot to deal with because it is a conclusion. And it sometimes is unfocused. But ultimately is a good ending, if not great. I will say that the new sequel trilogy is at the same time better and worse that the prequels. The films are better acted even though yes the dialogue may still be kind of bad, but JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson did get better performances from their cast. The special effects are better and the film rely much less on CGI than Lucas did in the prequels. But they are worse in one sense, they are missing George Lucas. They are certainly Star Wars films with all of the good and the bad, but they lack the singular vision that George Lucas had. Love the prequels or not. Lucas had a vision that was pretty clear. The biggest mistake of the new films is that they didn't have a clear narrative vision. They are films made by good filmmakers that love Star Wars. But was not created by them. Also, Disney wanted this films to be all thing to all people.This is Star Wars, but not made by it's creator. This man created a universe that is so beloved, no other films in history have or will ever match the phenomenon. I love all 9 films. Yes on varying degrees and I do agree that the original trilogy is the one that will live on. But as a film lover there is no better feeling that I have had in these 42 years as a filmgoer than these films.Grade: B-",8,5,18,23 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is definitely back!
","For the last week I have been reading reviews of this movie by so called respectable critics, I read words like, dull, uninspired , predictable. So I went to see the film with a feeling that I might be dissapointed, all I can say is that it is better than I thought it would be! I have been a fan of Star Wars ever since I was a kid, like most Star Wars fans, I prefer the story of the first trilogy, I grew up with it so I have more of a nostalgic connection with it. This new film is on the level of the first films, definitely better than Episode I, which I liked, but this one tops it in every way! Episode I was more geared towards kids, it did not have the adventurous nature that the other Star Wars film had had. Critics that quibble over the dialogue and the story being cliched should take look at the other movies, Star Wars has NEVER been known for its incredible dialogue. Haydn Christensen does a good job as Anakin, he has a few very good key scenes, nothing worthy of Oscar consideration but, he gives the character the right tone. Ewen Mcgregor gets Obi-Wan right, in the last movie he looked like the role didn't suit him, this time he grows into the role well. Natalie Portman is good, and looks great as now Senator Amidala. Visually this film is easily the most ambitious movie of its kind, George Lucas and the sfx team have outdone themselves! OH and then there is Yoda, lets just say that he steals the film. The important thing is that the Star Wars feeling is back, EPI did not achieve the level of adventure and wonder that I think is crucial in the Star Wars films. Is it the best film in the series? NO, but it definitely is the best installment since Empire Strikes Back! So DON'T listen to skeptical critics, go and have a good time!",6,0,1,16 May 2002
Bohemian Rhapsody," Like Queen's music, rousing and heartfelt.
","I have to say that when I read about the problems involved in the making of this film I feared that it would be a mess. I was wrong. I am not the biggest Queen fan but as a Rock fan I recognize that they were a very unique sounding band, rarely formalaic. Also, Freddy Mercury is one of the best rock performers ever.The film is not unique in that it presents the start and rise of the band. What I loved was that it was about the MUSIC!!! The movie does focus o. Freddie and the already known parts of his life. His partying, homosexuality, drug use etc
I do feel that the decision was made that they wanted a PG-13 rating so the film doesn't go for graphic depictions of Freddie's antics. But I do think that the film presents him as a man that was very confident and at the same time yearning to be accepted. Especially by his father. It presents his loving relationship with Mary Austin in a very sweet way. Even though he was a homosexual, she was the love of his life. It also presents a very honest portrait of his last relationship with a man named Jim. Many critics are complaining that the film is to superficial, that doesn't go deeper into who Freddie Mercury was. I disagree. I think that the point is that his contribution to the world was his and Queen's music. So many movies like this focus on the drugs, sex and the downfall of bands and artists. A film that comes to mind is The Doors. That film was great but its approach was different. Very ethereal but also never really showed Jim Morrison as a real human being.Oliver Stone and Val Kilmer showed him as a horrible drunk egomaniac with that despised everyone. Even though I like that film, it is a real downer. This film as directed by Brian Singer is a rousing and entertaining look at a legendary band and performer. We all know that he tragically died of AIDS but the film ends with Queen's incredible performance at Live-Aid. It is one of if not the greatest recreation of a real music event that I have ever seen. Rami Malek's performance as Freddie deserves an Oscar nomination.Just like Queen's music never really got the respect of music critics, this film is not getting the reviews it deserves. Even if you are not a big Queen fan, this film is worth seeing because of the joy of music that it shows!",9,1,2,4 November 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The best fantasy film since the original Star Wars!
","I went into this film expecting to like it, the buzz was good and the story is weel known. Little did I think that I would be blown away so much that I have not left a theater as excited about a movie since I was a kid after I saw Star Wars. Most people are focusing on the special effects, which are remarkable, but I think that the film succeeds on all levels,most fantasy films these days are fx extravanganzas and are entertaining, but are not remembered soon after, they are just fun video games. Peter Jackson must have really loved this story, alot of care went into the producing of this story. Yes it is an adventure,full of action and thrills, but it takes itself seriously,Jackson has created a whole world, not just a bunch of action set pieces. Star Wars in 1977 felt that way, earnest and completely emerses the viewer into its world, no movie since has had done that as successfully until now, Bravo to Mr. Jackson and everyone involved in the making of Fellowship. Finally a movie that will make a huge amount of money, but will actually deserve it! Run, don't walk to see it!",10,0,0,2 January 2002
Man of Steel," Not horrible, but not my kind of Superman film.
","I was excited when it was announced that DC would reboot Suoerman. He has always been my favorite superhero. I still think that Superman: To me that is the best superhero film ever made. I liked that Christopher Nolan would be involved. He had done such a great job with the Dark Knight trilogy that I thought he could bring back the greatness of Superman. But also, he was only an Executive Producer. The fact that it was Zack Snyder that was chosen to direct worried me. He is not a bad director but the only film of his that I actually like us 300. I didn't like Watchmen at all and Sucker Punch was just as bad. I went in with nervous expectations.The film is a variation on Superman's origin story. In the beginning we see Jor-El sending his infant son Kal-El away from Krypton to save him from the planet's destruction. General Zod leads a rebellion but it is defeated and he is sentenced to the phantom zone. Kal-El lands in Smallville and he is found by the Kents and they raise him as their own. They name him Clark. He grows up an isolated young man that slowly discovers his powers. Jonathan finally reveals Clark's origins to him but urges him not to show his powers. At one point there is a tornado and Clark has a chance to save his father but Jonathan wavs him off and dies. Feeling guilty, Clarke leaves Smallville and travels around in several disguises. He occasionally uses his powers to save people in situations which he is close to, but is always unsure of his actions. He later gets a job at the Daily Planet. Lois Lane receives a tip to investigate a Kryptonian ship in the Canadian Arctic. Clark goes there in disguise and discovers the ship's central computer and is greeted by an AI version of Jor-El. He explains to his son that he was sent to earth to help its people. General Zod escapes the phantom zone and finds out the whereabouts of Kal-El. He broadcasts a transmission globally that Kal El's surrender or risk attack. At this point Clark has worn the suit given by Jor-El and tests his powers. Zod has his scientist create clones from Kal El's DNA that will destroy humanity. Zod has a weapon called the world engine that can convert earth into the new Krypton. Superman the confronts Zod and destroys the world engine. Zod and Superman fight in an endless action sequence that literally destroys most of Metropolis. Zod tells Superman that he will destroy the Earth just to spite him. Superman kills Zod. The film ends with Suoerman asking the government to let him work alone so as long he doesn't turn against humanity.That's it. Pretty good story right? It would be fine if the film would have been much less of a downer!!! The fact that Zack Snyder made this Superman such an unsure, brooding character is really unfortunate. I get that they were trying to make Clark's transformation into Superman more serious but presenting it as such a negative thing was offputting. There is no joy in the film, even the portrayal of Superman's actions are almost an afterthought. He is presented as a threat, not really heroic. Even the final battle with Zod when there is nothing but destruction and people in danger all around Superman is oblivious to it. I understand that the The Dark Knight films took Bruce Wayne's burden of being Batman in the same way, and that works for that character. He became Batman because he witnessed the murder of his parents, he has no special powers, he is a vigilante. This approach for Superman just doesn't work. Is the film horrible? No, it is somewhat involving, the cast is good, Henry Caville does what he can as Superman but he is mostly just brooding and depressed for the whole film. He doesn't embody Superman the way that Christopher Reeve did so beautifully. Not my kind of Superman film!",6,2,5,17 June 2013
Lilo & Stitch," Entertaining, but mostly weak Disney feature.
","I have never really disliked any Disney animated movie, even last year's Atlantis was OK, Even a weak Disney movie is worth watching. Lilo and Stitch is weak, it has moments of wit and is cute enough for the kids, but the characters aren't really memorable. It has a nice message of family and friendship, but Disney has done it better in the past. The truth is that, since Mulan, there hasn't been a really good traditional animated movie from the studio, Toy Story and Monsters Inc. are great but they are CG animation(and Pixar is the actual creative force behind those movies).Rest assured that Lilo and Stitch will entertain kids, and a times adults too. The previews of the film seemed to bring expectations that the movie would be something special, unfortunately it isn't!",6,1,1,23 June 2002
Armageddon," I can't help it!!! I really enjoy this movie!!!
","Armageddon was the most hated movie by film critics for years. It was the second movie in 1998 about a huge asteroid tumbling towards earth. The other movie was Deep Impact. Considered to be the 'serious' one of the two movies.There is not much story here. Harry Stamper, an expert oil driller is brought in by NASA to help them with a plan to destroy the asteroid before it hits earth. That's it. A cast of roughnecks as they are called go along with Harry into space to land on the asteroid to drill a hole big enough to get a nuclear bomb far enough to blow up the thing. Armageddon was directed by Michael Bay. And even though this was his 3rd directing gig it was the first of his movies that he showed the most of his directing and editing rapid fire style that he known for. Personally he has taken this to the limits especially in the Transformers movies. It is supposed to be adrenaline pumping action but at times it is so over the top that it is exhausting. Armageddon is like that. Big, loud and exhausting at times. But, it's fun. As much as I agree that this movie is as dumb as anything ever to hot the screen it is just fun. The cast includes Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson and Steve Buscemi. Among other less known actors. You would say that this movie comes under the 'so bad it's good' category. Maybe so.Grade: B",8,0,0,5 May 2020
Van Helsing," Where's the story?
","When every May comes, we all know that the Summer Blockbuster season starts. This year it begins with this latest action extravaganza. Unfortunately, this film embodies what the summer blockbuster has become. A soulless exercise in high budget frenziness. The movie looks great, the effects are mostly top of the line, but it lacks what I believe is essential to a good adventure movie, characters and a story that the audience cares about. This movie has some impressive action sequenses, but they are not as exhilerating as they should be. The pacing is breakneck, but the movie never stops to even give us 5 minutes to develop any semblance story or character. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, a monster killer, as we all know the arch nemesis of Dracula, in this movie we get wherwolves and Frankenstein's monster for good measure. The story is as cheesy as you get, Dracula wants to use Frankenstein to bring thousands of his offspring to life. Even a cheesy story can be involving;not this time. The action is well done, no expense has been spared to created it, but the movie has no heart.Crade: C",7,0,0,9 May 2004
Spider-Man," A decent beginning to the summer blockbuster season.
","I will start by saying that I have never been a Spiderman fan, I have always been partial to Superman and Batman. But I'm always open to a comic book hero brought to the big screen. Sam Raimi has made a movie that I feel will appeal to most people, it is fun, brisk, and never takes itself too seriously. Toby Maguire is good as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He brings the appropriate sensibility to his role, Willem Dafoe does what he can with what he is given as the Green Goblin, but it is too little, I wish they would have fleshed out his villainous  character. The special effects are good, but I believe that they are  intentionally cheesy. The action scenes are done well, but nothing that hasn't been seen before.If there is a problem is exactly that, the action is not particularly unique, the scenes are done well but there isn't really any memorable shots or things that the audience would be wowed by. I would say that the non action stuff in the movie is more entertaining. The first hour when Peter is discovering his powers is especially entertaining. So a slightly above average warm up to the summer season, a good warm up for Episode II.Grade: B-",7,0,0,6 May 2002
American History X," This film will make you think!!!!
","This is a film that uses imagery to make its statements, it is not a subtle view of racism in America. The focus of the film has to do with what effect hate can have on a family.Edward Norton's performance is as powerful a performance as I have ever seen. His character is not presented as a monster, but as an intelligent kid that is smart enough to know that what he preaches is wrong, but circumstances in his life fill him with anger and hate.The movie does want to hammer home its anti racism message, to some it may seem as manipulative, but the images are so well done that it is hard not to feel a reaction. The movie would have been well served if the other characters were as fleshed out as Norton's character Derek. Norton's brother is played by Edward Furlong, his performance is good, but he is really more important as the film's narrator. The skinheads in the film are by and large shown as mindless racist drones. But I think that it is the film's point that intelligent kids like Derek is what these organizations need for recruitment.The film is not subtle, it WANTS to get under our skin. Derek's eventual change of heart is dealt with too superficially though, it would have been good to focus on that a little more. Though the film is not perfect it is undeniably powerful, its best trait is that whether one likes it or not, it is a film that will cause discussion, some of the images will stay with you long after the film ends.",9,0,0,13 May 2001
Pearl Harbor," An embarrassing so called historical epic!!!!
","When I first saw the trailer Of Pearl Harbor last year and saw that the team of Bay/Brukheimerwere behind the film I was a little apprehensive, the trailer was great it showed what would hopefully be an old fashioned war epic, but a movie that would do justice to the historical event that it was depicting.these guys are better at making mindless but really entertaining action movies like Armageddon, and The Rock. Those movies could get by on being just entertainments, this movie had to be something more. My fears came true, Pearl Harbor is nothing more than a chance for Michael Bay to blow things up! The movie has no heart, the characters are so shallow that you feel nothing for them. True the attack on pearl harbor is impressive technically, but it has been directed and edited as an action sequence not a terrifying surprise attack. The tone of the sequence is all wrong. Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett are given nothing to do except look pretty for the camera. The love triangle between the characters is one of the blandest, most uninvolving love stories that I have ever seen. They say there lines as if they were reading them of cue cards. The screenplay is embarrassingly bad, even by summer movie standards. The movie wants to be very patriotic, Jon Voight as FDR does what he can to add honor to the film, but it rings hollow.This movie is a more than obvious attempt to repeat the Titanic formula. That film is far superior to this one. It was a grand Hollywood spectacle, but the screenplay at least created two characters that the audience could care about. Pearl Harbor didn't have to be Saving Private Ryan, but it makes no real attempt to be a historical account, forget accuracy, most films of this kind take dramatic license, but this film doesn't even try to offer any insight or perspective on what occurred. So the movie outright fails as a love story and historical drama. What is left if 35 minutes of well produced action. Too bad that the filmmakers paid so little attention to rest of their story. This movie will make a lot of money, but it will be remembered more for what it should have been, not what it is.Grade: D",4,1,1,29 May 2001
Avengers: Endgame," Just spectacular!
","After Infinity War came out it was going to be a tough task for Endgame to top it. In many ways of course Endgame is more satisfying because it brings this iteration of the MCU to a rousing, emotional conclusion.As much as I came out of the theater with a great big smile on my face and even some tears were shed. I can't help think that there could have been some things that could have been changed that would make the film better. The running time is certainly daunting. The first hour is very somber as it had to be bit it does take the film alot of time to get its footing. The 2 things that really bothered me were the handling of Hulk and Thor. I have never been a fan of Mark Ruffalo as David Banner/Hulk. Here he is turned into a hybrid of both characters, it didn't work for me. But even worse they turned Thor into a joke character. I really didn't like this. I get that Ragnarok reset the character on a more comedic path but they went overboard here. The performances are really good, especially Robert Downey Jr. He has been the center of the MCU and has carried it well. Chris Evan's is very good as Captain America. Everyone gets their moments. The film is less frenetic and more introspective than Infinity War. But the last hour is pure magic. They went all out and succeeded at least in the conclusion.The great thing is that the MCU for all of the bombast and high budget effects that the films feature they have very good character development and arcs. We care about what happens to them. It us no easy feat with such a wide variety of characters that they could pull it off so well.But they did.",10,2,5,28 April 2019
Moulin Rouge!," ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!
","I went into this movie with mixed expectations, of all movie genres, musicals are my least favorite. This movie blew me away! The mix of costumes and contemporary songs is great, it might have been a total disaster, but it works,the movie is funny, exciting and even touching.It really is the type of movie that one will either love or hate. Nicole Kidman is great as the sexy lead, ewen Mcgregor is great also. So far, it is to me the best film of the year!",10,0,1,6 June 2001
Men in Black II," Seems that it could only really work once!
","Men in Black was a quirky, funny and inventive summer blockbuster a few years ago. It had an offbeat script and very engaging leads, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones made the first film memorable. Will Smith has an easy charm, Tommy Lee Jones plays a great straight man. Well now on to Men In Black II, we have the same stars, the same director, almost every person involved in the first one, and the sequel can't even hold a candle to the first. Sequels are obviously commercially driven, most sequels are unnecessary money machines, but if they are done right they could be fun, audiences like to go back and see characters they like again. The problem with this movie is that even though it looks like the original, they forgot the element that made the first work, charm. The film has an aura of 'we did it only for the money' about it. Even Will Smith seems to be bored this time, his one liners only work a couple times, Jones is OK , his wry style is there but he has nothing to do except cash in his paycheck. Perhaps Men in Black is the type of off beat story that could only work once, the sequel really is a retread of the first movie but it doesn't feel fun or fresh.Grade: C-",5,0,0,10 July 2002
Paranormal Activity," An effective, unsettling experience!!!
","I was a a big fan of the Blair Witch when it came out in 1999. I do not consider myself an avid horror movie fan, but when I prefer a scary story over a lot of gore. That film worked because it created an inevitable sense of dread. Paranormal Activity takes the elements that worked in Blair Witch and improves on them. There is very little story, it basically involves a young couple named Katie and Micah that lives in San Diego that is experiencing creepy sounds in their home. Micah is filming in the house constantly in order to find evidence of the disturbances. Katie doesn't like it, but she goes along because she wants to find out what's going on. There really is no story here we just see this couple in there every day life, mostly at night when Micah sets up the video camera to film the whole night in the bedroom. The film is has a slow pace, the disturbances start to get worse as the film goes along. The movie isn't as much scary as it is unsettling. We have all been at home and heard a sound that creeped us out, the film does a great job at playing with sound and the visuals are simple but very effective. Door slams, banging sounds and some very simple but clever visual effects. The only setup there is to explain what is happening is that Katie experience similar disturbances as a child. Most of tension comes from the bedroom scenes. Micah sets up the camera in the bedroom on a stand and we see, at times with time lapse the couple sleeping, but the camera is positioned so that we could see the open door of the bedroom into the hallway. I don't like to give spoilers but the film does a terrific job scaring its audience. The movie does indicate that something is going on with a low frequency bass sound indicating that 'something is there' and also uses shadows to indicate a presence.The performances by the actors are good enough, we really don't get to know them and they are mostly having to react to what they see on camera the whole time, but they are believable as a couple. There are a couple characters such as a psychic that the couple brings in to help that provides a little comic relief. Needless to say if you buy in, you will have a good scare while seeing this film. I watched it in a half full theater and it is definitely the type of film that is better when watched with an audience.Is is a great film, no. I feel that it is a great exercise in manipulating our basic fears. I feel that it also show that less is more sometimes in horror films, you don';t have to show blood and guts do scare an audience.Grade: B",8,0,1,3 November 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Johnny Depp nearly sinks the film!!!!
","I am a fan of the original 1971 classic. I went into this film not expecting to like this version better, but I was open to be pleasantly surprised. When a classic move is being redone, as seems to be the norm these days, what one would expect is to be reminded of what made us like the 1st version. Tim Burton seemed to be the perfect director for this film, and in many ways he is. The film is visually inventive, but not jawdroppingly so, I would say that the look of the film is only bigger in scope than the original, not better. Obviously it takes cues from the original film, and yes, it seems to follow the book more, which is not necessarily a good thing.The biggest problem for me is Johnny Depp. At first it seems that he would be perfect to play Willy Wonka. He goes for total weirdness here, His Wonka is more annoying than anytrhing else. Depp is a great actor, but he makes Willy Wonka to robotic and unlikable. He is creepy at first but never dangerous. Just weird. Gene Wilder had made Wonka into a 3 dimensional character. He was funny, quirky, gentle, and at times creepy, but he made him more or less a likable character. This film wants us to sympathize with Wonka, but I found him to annoying to care. Depp created a caricature, not a character. The rest of the film is fine. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is good, the supporting cast is good too. There are some funny reworkings of the originals scenes, some work, some don't. If one sees this film without having seen the original, I think that it would probably be more enjoyable without the comparison. I'll stick with the Gene Wilder classic!

"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," AN EXERCISE IN BLEAKNESS
","I stumbled onto this film from a list of notable Italian films. I read what the film was about and the controversy it caused when it was released so I was curious to watch it. I finally found it online and saw it. I almost want to say that I made a mistake in seeing this film because it is the single most depressing and disturbing film I think I've ever seen.It takes place in WWII fascist Italy and deals with a group of senior members of government rounding up 18 young men and women to take them to a secluded palace with a plan to torture and sexually degrade them. The film is broken up into 4 segments, gradually becoming more disturbing. The men of power take great sexual pleasure from seeing their captives submit to their disgusting acts. I wont go into detail but this film has some of the most disturbing and sadistic scenes I have ever witnessed. There is a level of bleakness from what is shown that is deeply depressing. I felt angry throughout the film that the captives didn't rebel, there are a couple that try but are severely punished. There is only really one moment when a girl cries and pleads for G-d to save her from her suffering but the film does not show these people to have any other emotions other than terror. Of course, I am sure that it was Pier Paolo Pasolini's intention but the darkness of this film is almost overwhelming. Pasolini I feel wanted this film to be a mirror to humanity and our ability for cruelty. There is nothing in this film that could be construed as entertainment. I feel dirty for having viewed it. Again, that was probably the point. How many films do we watch that have sex and violence do we regard as entertainment? It's true, some films do glorify some of our darkest impulses. This film does none of that. It is very bleak and doesn't offer any hope. Is it a good film? I can't say yes. I am giving it a bad rating and won't recommend it because watching it was so unsettling. That is the reaction that Pasolini wanted. In that he succeeded. I will never see this film again, but I will never forget it.",1,6,13,27 November 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Unfairly panned third installment.
","When The Godfather Part 3 came out in 1990, all lovers of the two other films were anxious, waiting for another classic in what many regard as two of the greatest American films. Alas what came was a good film, but not in the same league as its predecessors. It has been rumored that Coppola did this project only because he was in financial problems. It does show that his passion for the project dwindled. The movie does not have the freshness and detail of the other 2. But that being said it is not the total loss that many people make it out to be. The story is basically similar to Godfather 1, set in 1979, Michael Corleone is in his 60's and is trying to realize his dream of legitimizing his family business,of course he is naive in thinking that he could wash away his past and his sins, this film presents Michael as a tired man, a man that is so guilt ridden that he could hardly smile, those who know that series will understand what I'm referring to. Al Pacino plays it close to perfect, he is a man beaten, weary of all his mistakes, his heart is broken. I feel that the time that was spent in between the making of the second one and this was too long, the film doesn't achieve greatness, it does give a fitting end to the Corleon saga. Give the film a chance, lower your expectations, and you will see that it is ultimately worthwhile.Grade: B",7,0,2,21 January 2002
Rosemary's Baby," Sorry, I just didn't get it!!!
","I had never watched Rosemary's Baby in in its entirety until yesterday. The times that I started watching it years ago I was so bored that didn't finish. It is so highly regarded as a great horror film that I gave it another chance. This time I watched the whole thing and still don't understand why it's such a classic? I just didn't feel any suspense,dread, horror at all!!! The most that I can say is that it is really weird. Mia Farrow plays the title character. She moves into a new apartment with her husband played by John Cassavetes. They meet the neighbors, which are a series of seemingly nice old people in the building. We then get a very weird scene of her being seemingly raped by a demon with her worshipful neighbors watching. She gets pregnant and begins to get very paranoid and feels that her baby is not of this world. Her husband tries to comfort her but something is off. Everything that happens leads up to Rosemary finding the neighbors worshiping satan and tell her to be a good mother to her child. All of the events leading up to this are presented in a slow, somewhat disturbing way, but I for one wasn't very involved. The film is just weird. I would regard this as a black comedy more than a horror film. It is not bad, the acting is good and it is certainly original, but I don't see why people regard it as such a classic.",5,3,6,22 November 2018
War of the Worlds," Spielberg shows why he is the master!!!!
","When I see a Steven Spielberg film I look to how much I will like the film , not if I will. An average Spielberg film is better than most directors good films. In the last couple of years though, there hasn't been a film from him that has really stayed with me since Saving Private Ryan. A.I. was under-appreciated, but Steven hasn't wowed us in a while. War of the Worlds is Steven at his best, he takes what is a B movie and makes it into memorable and at times scary story. The premise is as we all know is that the earth is attacked by aliens bent on destroying the human race. From HG Wells story, he takes the story and modernizes it. Tom Cruise does a good job as an average Joe that protects his kids from the horrors around them. The good thing is that Cruise is not suddenly made into Rambo, he is a pretty lousy father that comes to realize that his kids need him. I will say that the set up of the characters is alittle too fast, the film goes into thriller mode a little quickly. When it does though, it never lets up, Spielberg is a master at creating tension. The tension comes from the human aspect, the desperation of the people fleeing from a certain death there is panic and paranoia.There is no doubt thatr this film will be compared to Independence Day. I enjoyed that film, it was a big loud stupid blockbuster that was fun to watch. This film, even though it is a thriller, focuses on Tom Cruise trying to survive with his kids, the other film was more about the spectacular visuals. This film has them, Spielber creates some haunting images, but the most tension comes from the desperation that comes from the characters. Tim Robbins has a great cameo as a paranoid survivor.The one big complaint about the film is the ending, the film comes to an end very abruptly, the resolution feels rushed and tacked on. It is faithful to the HG Wells story, but the ending could have been more drawn out. The film is too good to have such a weak conclusion. Is this movie as good a Close Encounters? No, that film did have a more rounded script, it fleshed out the main character much more than it does here. This film is a thriller in every sense. Grade: B+",9,2,7,3 July 2005
Love Actually," I had a smile on my face for the entire 129 minutes!!!!
","I am a sucker for a good romantic comedy.There haven't been many lately. This film is a breath of fresh air. It is unashamed about it's subject; LOVE. Thats it!!! From the first monologue,The film argues that even in this crap world,love 'actually' does exist. This movie may be dismissed by cynics as being to sentimental or sugary, that is exactly the point, love is silly and painful, but ultimately worth being in. People who don't like to go to the movies and sometimes just smile, stay away!!! The cast is great, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, and most of the best known English stars are here, oh, even Rowan Atkinson manages to steal a couple of scenes. It's a montage of various love stories, all very entertaining, especially Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister of England. In a year that had some very bad film experiences for me, I'm glad that I was able to just sit back and smile for once!!! Those brits are really hopeless romantics at heart!!!Grade: A-",8,0,2,20 November 2003
Joker," Just....wow!!!!
","Just came back from seeing this film and feel that my high expectations were exceeded. Joker is a rarity I feel. It is a commercial film that is taken from a comic book character but actually has something to say. It is by far the best DC film since Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy but it feels less like a comic book film than a character study. And it is. And yes I have read that it has been said that it borrows heavily from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy and it does in that it presents the Arthur Fleck character as a loner, outsider, mostly shunned by people around him just like Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin. It is definitely a film that follows that slow burn into insanity and violence like those films but it's not a bad thing.By now everyone knows that this film stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur, and through the film we see his transformation into The Joker. It is an origin story. He plays Arthur as a thin, weak disturbed person who is treated badly by those around him. And he slowly grows to have truly disturbing thoughts and actions. The film is a comic book film in that it is about s character that comes from that medium but it is in no way a light film. Avengers Endgame this is not. And I revere that film but i think that it is great that they decided to not sugar coat this story and tried to go deeper and make it more about the psychology of the character as opposed to his criminal antics. That Todd Phillip's a comedy director took this on and did it with such success is stunning. I will avoid all.of thr controversy that has come from this film saying that it condones violence. It is violent and disturbing but in no way compares to other films that are much worse. I like that it went for an adult theme and is rated R. My kid will.not be seeing this anytime soon. Great film, great performance. Period.One last thing. I know that Phoenix's Joker is inevitably going to be pit against Heath Ledger's interpretation of the character. Some saying that this is better. I think that it is different, not better. Ledger was THE JOKER. Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck becoming THE JOKER. The performances stand on their own as great but I still favor Ledger just a bit more. But not by alot.",10,4,8,6 October 2019
Man on Fire," A very effective revenge story!!!
","Man On Fire is a film that i.have seen now many times. The truth is that the story is really just a run of the mill revenge story. What makes this film so good is the acting and the execution if the story. Denzel Washington has always elevated any film that he's in just by his presence. His performance in this film is one of his best. He takes the material to a much higher level.The basic story is that John Creasy, the character played by Denzel Washington is hired by a young wealthy couple in Mexico to protect their daughter Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. Creasy is an ex-Special Forces operative that is an alcoholic and hates his life. He us full of guilt at all of the things that he has done. He goes to Mexico to see an old friend named Rayburn played by Christopher Walken. Rayburn offers him the job to protect the daughter of Samuel Ramos played by Marc Anthony. He and his wife Lisa played by Radha Mitchell need to hire a bodyguard to fulfill the requirements of their kidnap and ransom insurance since they live in Mexico City where there are a lot of kidnappings. Once Creasy arrives, Pita wants to befriend him. He resists and tells her that he is not being paid to be her friend. One night, Creasy tries to kill himself with a gun but the cartridge fails to fire. Pita persists in getting Creasy to open up and gradually he does. He helps her with her swimming competition, and they talk while she does homework. Slowly, Creasy begins to care very much for Pita. He even tries to stop drinking. One day while waiting for Pita to finish her piano lesson he notices so.e cars pull up to where she is waiting for Creasy, they are there to kidnap the girl. A shootout ensues and after Creasy is able to kill a couple of the kidnappers he is shot and Pita is taken. Initially, in the hospital Creasy is a suspect in the kidnapping and is going to charge with the killing of two police officers that were part of the kidnapping. Fearing that Creasy would be killed by the police, an agent of the AFI named Manzano and Rayburn take Creasy out of the hospital to protect him. Meanwhile,the kidnapper called The Voice contacts Samuel Ramos about negotiating ransom for Pita. Samuel is assisted by his lawyer played by Mickey Rourke. After tget agree to a place for the money drop their is an ambush and the money is stolen. After the ambush apparently Pita is killed. When Rayburn tells Creasy about Pita being dead, Creasy decides to find and kill all of those involved in the kidnapping and death of the girl. Rayburn helps him obtain some weapons and Creasy begins to investigate. The film at that point becomes what really could have been just a standard revenge film. Creasy goes and finds the perpetrators and kills them one by one, finding out more about the scheme to kidnap Pira along the way. The difference here is that before the revenge aspect of the film starts the film takes its time in exploring Creasy, Denzel Washington is great at showing the pain that Creasy is in and his lack of will to go on. Dakota Fanning is terrific as Pita. She comes across as a good but precocious girl that seems lonely. The chemistry between Washington and Fanning is really good. The scenes between them come of as very real. They don't come off as cute, but have a real tenderness that works. We get to like and feel for Creasy and Pita, so when she is gone and Creasy goes out for revenge there is an emotional core there that makes what's going on more compelling. The film is directed by Tony Scott with a lot of visual flair which is usual for him but he plays good attention to the characters in the story. Needless to say Creasy gets the bad guys and the film ends in a more or less predictable manner but is done with such conviction that it works.",10,0,0,6 January 2019
Man on Fire," Brutal, but very well acted revenge drama!
","Denzel Washington has become the most commanding actor in Hollywood. He may be in a bad film, but always gives a 3 dimensional performance. This film is really nothing more than a revenge drama.Denzel plays a man that gets hired to protect an American girl in Mexico City. He is an alcoholic, he is troubled by his past, the film never reveals too much, but he is in pain. He develops a bond with the girl, and it would be easy for this to be present this in a cute way, the relationship develops slowly, the movie doesn't rush it. When Washington finally cares, it is believable. She is kidnapped, what ensues is essentially a revenge spree from Denzel. The movie is glossy, but brutal, the audience wants Washington's character to prevail, but it isn't the kind of action movie that one cheers at. Tony Scott uses his usual frenetic editing, it is effective, but is distracting at times. But Denzel end his cast keep the movie interesting. Christopher Walken has a great supporting role. The movie never goes for a heroic tone, but it is escapism, Death Wish comes to mind. The difference is Denzel Washington, he makes the movie riveting instead of mearly watchable.Grade: B",10,0,0,28 April 2004
Jaws," This movie is responsible for my love of cinema!!!
","I can't think of a movie that I 've seen more times than Jaws. It has every element that I love in a movie. Sure by todays fx standards it may seem dated to some, but it is a masterpiece of suspense and adventure. Steven Spielberg has been lauded for his other movies, he has made more serious movies of late, but I think this is one of his best movies. It is now known to most movie fans that the making of this movie was a nightmare. Steven Spielberg found a way to create a great film out of what in someone else's hands would have been a B popcorn film. True, at it's core it is a B movie, a great white shark terrorizes a New England Island town, three men go out to sea and battle the shark etc... What is great about this movie is its characters. Roy Scheider is great a Chief Brody, a Sheriff of the town who happens to be afraid of going into the ocean. He is not a hot shot know it all cop, he is an average Joe, doing his job to protect the town. Richard Dreyfuss is great as Hooper, a rich kid marine biologist who befriends Brody in his struggle to convince the town that they have a shark problem. And yes there is Quint, played by Robert Shaw, probably one of the most memorable movie characters ever. He is a salty sailor with a particular loathing of sharks. The movie takes its time to develop its premise, it doesn't rush to the battle with man and shark. The other great thing is that it is never pretentious, Spielberg could have filled the movie with metaphors of man against nature and the deep meaning of it, but he doesn't bother with it, it's an adventure film in the end. Most movie goers have seen this film, and I've seen a countless times, I always enjoy the movie. Jaws is credited by some to be the first bona fide summer blockbuster, it may have been , but it is better than most summer movies that come out these days. Summer movies nowadays are more concerned about CGI effects than storytelling, Jaws may have been made in 1975, but it holds up as one of the great adventures of all time. It lets us get to know and care about the characters before it thrusts them into the adventure, that makes the movie more entertaining. Great performances ,Great Director, Great script, Great Music, GREAT FILM!!!My love for movies began with this!!!Grade: A+",10,3,7,27 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The one we've all been waiting for!!!
","I was seven years old in 1977 when Star Wars first came out, it was the movie that is responsible for my love of cinema. I don't consider myself a Star Wars geek, but I really have always loved the Star Wars universe. For the last 6 years it has been uncool to love Star Wars. The hammering of Episodes I and II was I thought, unfair. I have to agree that they aren't as memorable as the first trilogy but the public in general put expectations on this new trilogy that were virtuously impossible to meet. Now comes Episode III, the one that logically would have to be the best one of the new series. And without a doubt it is!!! Every Star Wars fan had in our heads what this one should have been, and I have to say that except for a couple of quibbles, this film blew me away. It is easily the best film since Empire, George Lucas saved the best for last. He brought a closure to the story that is satisfying and sad. Sad because according to Lucas he won't do another film. He has announced that there might be a TV series, but I for one can't imagine liking a TV version of this story , it belongs on the big screen.It is pointless to describe the story, we all know that Anakin turns to the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader. The journey is what counts. The tone of this film a appropriately dark. Lucas treats this transformation as a tragedy, I truly thought that when I would see the Darth Vader suit again that I would love it, but the moment is treated as being profoundly sad, more as the death of Anakin, than the 'birth' of Darth Vader The whole first hour of the movie belongs to Ian Mcdormaand as Palpatine/Darth Sidious. He delivers the best performance of the movie, he makes his character into a pseudo Shakespearean villain, playing on Anakin's fears in order to turn him to the Dark Side. Hayden Christensen has been panned for being to whiny as Anakin, he doe a good job of displaying confusion and fear here, he is better here than in Episode II, but I do agree with the idea that he doesn't exude the menace that one would like to see for this role. He is good but not great. Ewan McGregor is great as Obi Wan, he gets more to do in this film. The only real problem for me was the scenes between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. They lacked chemistry and the dialog felt painfully strained. Lucas may be a genius storyteller but he can't write a good love story to save his life!!! It doesn't ruin the movie though. What finally comes into the film that was lacking in Episodes I and II is emotion. the final hour of this film is at the same time enthralling and sad. The moment that we see the Darth Vader suit and mask, Lucas treats it as a sad moment. I thought that at first sight of it that the audience would break out in applause, not a whimper. Anakin's dissent is truly disturbing, and even though his dialogue isn't the best, Lucas gives us a final hour that is truly disturbing and memorable. Visually, what can be said but WOW!!! It is truly rare these days to be impressed with what is on screen but Lucas and ILM outdid themselves this time. You can't look away from the screen because you may miss something. The opening action scene is the best battle scene of all six films. All in all, this is the film that I wanted to see, I feel that Lucas will vindicate himself against his doubters with this one. He has in the six films taken me on a wonderful journey. I am just sad that its over!!! Grade: A-",10,3,5,20 May 2005
Marriage Story," Heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time!!!
","There have been many films over the tears that have covered the end of a marriage and divorce. Kramer vs Kramer is probably the most famous one but this subject has been covered many times. A Marriage Story presents it in a very sober and matter a fact way. It is presented in a very real way. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Nicole and Charlie, a couple with a son that live in New York. Charlie is a theater writer and director. She is an actress that works with Charlie's theater company. When she was younger, Nicole was in a movie that gave her a little notoriety. She lived in LA but when she met Charlie she went to New York. They have decided to separate. They agree to go through a mediator to not involve lawyers but in the mediator's office he asks them to read the good things that they feel for each other out loud. Nicole refuses. She is going to take her son and go to LA to work on a TV pilot. Charlie is aware and agrees with the idea that she and his son would be back not fully realizing the marriage is over. Nicole is living with her mother in LA. Nicole goes to a lawyer in LA and is going to serve Charlie with divorce papers as soon as he comes to visit their son Henry. Nicole can't serve him the papers so she asks her sister Cassie to do it. This film is certainly a drama but their are many funny scenes. Charlie gets to Nicole's mother's house and comes in as if nothing is wrong. He gets along with Nicole's family very well, they love him too. He seems blindsided with the divorce papers. He thought that the move to LA would be temporary and Nicole would come back. Not the case. Charlie feels that they can work the divorce between them without lawyers. Things have changes. The film has alot to say about how people that still even love each other become enemies when they divorce. The most simple things become legal battles with each side's lawyers trying to make each of the former couple look like horrible people. While sucking them dry financially. Nicole's lawyer is Nora played very well by Laura Dern. She is very nice but a very good, brutally effective divorce lawyer. Charlie first hires a lawyer named Bert played by Alan Alda. He is an old style, lawyer, wanting to maje the divorce as painless as possible. He is not strong enough to tangle with Nora so Charlie hires Hay played by Ray Liotta, who us more of an aggressive lawyer for court. There is not much running time spent in the court room scenes bit it is clear that both Nora and Charlie are horrified at their lawyer's tactics at making each them look like horrible people. The maddening thing about this relationship is that it is obvious that these 2 people care very deeply about each other. The relationship is portrayed as being mostly respectful but of coursethere are many problems. As a viewer I asked myself many times why didn't this couple try to work it out? There is a scene that they try to gave a conversation without the lawyers but all of the legal fighting brings out the pent up anger in both of them and they have a horrible fight. Ultimately, things get worked out and both move on. The film doesn't necessarily sude with either of them which is good. The film to me explores the fine line there is between love and hatred in marriage. It's obvious that Nora and Charlie care about each other, but that is not the only thing that could keep them together. The film is hopeful in the way that it portrays to parents that both love their son ho through what must be a horrific process. Divorce.Grade: B+",8,1,2,23 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Just a touch below The Dark Knight
","Well it is here. The conclusion to the best super hero trilogy ever. Period. Even though I still think that the best single superhero film ever made is Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie, the subsequent sequels and even the reboot attempt by Bryan Singer failed. Spider-man 2 also should be in the conversation as one of the best, but Christopher Nolan's trilogy is the most consistent in quality of the Big 3 superhero franchises. TDKR was inevitably going to suffer the comparisons to its predecessor because that film is as perfect of film of its as there could be. The new film is more ambitious than its 2 predecessors as is usually the case with 3 acts in a trilogy.The film picks up 8 years after the events in TDK. I will not discuss any plot points, but all can say is that even though I don't think it is the masterpiece that TDK is, it is close. The biggest difference between the films is the villains. The villain in the new film is Bane, played by Tom Hardy. He is physically imposing but the fact that he has a mask doesn't help, you only see the actor's eyes. Also the fact that he speaks in an electronically assisted voice that at times is hard for the viewer to understand, takes away from his menace. With the villain lies the biggest difference between TDK and TDKR. The fact that Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was one for the ages, That performance was unforgettable, and any actor's performance in the new film would fall short. The performances by everyone else in this film are uniformly good. I think that Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman deserves a lot of credit for creating a 3 dimensional, complex, heroic character. No one has been better in the role. Michael Caine as Alfred is great again, and has some of the best scenes in the trilogy here. I would love for him to get an Oscar nod. Anne Hathaway is very good as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. She is funny and sexy and has great chemistry with Bale. Everyone in the cast is good, Christopher Nolan is very good at choosing his actors.The only other thing that I though about the film is that it did feel a little long. Both its predecessors were about 140 minutes, this film is 165 minutes and I think could have been cut a bit. The truth is that even though it isn't better that TDK, it is a terrific film. It is a grand, emotional ending to a a great Batman trilogy. I think that Christopher Nolan took the comic book film to a new level. He treated this story great intelligence and elegance.It is in no way a disappointment.Grade: A-",9,1,6,21 July 2012
Creed II," Better than almost all other Rocky sequels!!!!
","3 years ago when Creed was released I was hoping that it wouldn't ruin how Sylvester Stallone had presumably said goodbye to his beloved character in ROCKY BALBOA. Thankfully, I was proven wrong. Not only did it meet low expectations, it exceeded them with flying colors. It didn't reinvent the Rocky formula but it gave it much needed shot in the arm
Ryan Coogler created a film that could stand on it's own, but fit perfectly into the Rocky universe.Now comes Creed II. It is a tad less effective than Creed but it is better than most of the Rocky sequels. It again respects the formula but is grounded by a very good performances by the cast but especially Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed. Both Creed films belong to him, as they should. He is a terrific actor. Sylvester Stallone wrote this sequel but makes the great decision to keep the story about Adonis, but Rocky plays a important role.I hate giving spoilers but most people already k om that Creed II is about Adonis being challenged to fight the son of Ivan Drago, the man who killed Apollo in ROCKY IV. Dolph Lundgren is back as Ivan and gives I believe as good as a performance as he can as a bitter man that lost everything after losing to Rocky. He is training his son Viktor to be the champion he failed to be. All of this is fairly predictable but this time the script gives Ivan Drago some humanity that was not at all present in ROCKY IV. Obviously, Adonis takes the fight feeling that he has to. He has still not been able to construct a legacy that his father had left. He asks his girlfriend Bianca to marry him and shortly after the marry they find out that she is pregnant. The chemistry between Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson that was so good in the first film is again present here. The great thing about the first CREED was that the quiet, more character driven scenes made the film better. That is the case again even though this sequel is more formulaic. Sylvester Stallone proves again here that he is capable of bringing something to his Rocky character that had been lost in most of the previous sequels. He plays him with wisdom but also with regret.All of this of course comes with the obligatory fight and training sequences which are done very well again. They are not as showy as the other sequels but because we care about Adonis they are really effective. Like Ryan Coogler before him, director Stephen Caple Jr. puts a lot of emphasis on his characters as well as the fight sequences. If there is a misstep in Creed II is a cameo by Bridget Nielsen as Ludmilla, Ivan Drago's wife that had left him and their son due to his failure. She appears at a victory dinner for her son and comes to the final fight only to leave her son again. But, that is my only complaint. Creed II is certainly predictable lwhen it comes to the final fight, but ends on a poignant note with both Adonis and Rocky. This film is what it is, a very good sequel to a great film.",8,11,18,25 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I just don't get the hatred???
",I just rewatched Episode 7 and maintain my opinion that I really like it. I looked through the IMDb reviews of this film and cannot believe the hatred for this film. It seems that some people just hate for hatred sake. The biggest complaint that I see is that it is a rehash of Episode 4. I have to agree that it is very similar to it but after the absolute hatred that was unfairly bestowed on the prequel trilogy I knew that this would be a big budget fan film. Which it is. I am not bothered by that. George Lucas was criticized to the point of ridiculousness about how Episode 1 thru 3 weren't like the previous trilogy that there was no other way to.go. Does episode 7 break new ground? No. Does it harken back tl.the reason i.love Star Wars? Yes. That was enough for me.,9,11,41,27 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Gets better with every viewing!!!!
","This was the film that every Star Wars fan was wishing for!!! I know that some are criticizing this film for being nothing more than a remake of Episode 4. Though I can agree that there are similarities, it isn't a remake! It us part of a story arc, takes place 30 years after episode 6. So what if it hearkens back to episode 4? Weren't the prequels vastly criticized for NOT being like the original trilogy. What makes Star Wars so great is that it makes you feel a certain way, the prequels spent too much time with dialogue and plot that they became tedious. JJ Abrams is obviously a fan of the original trilogy. He takes what I loved about Star Wars and brings that feeling of adventure back. I couldn't stop smiling throughout. I love this film. Are there some things that missed? Yes, but mostly this is a Star Wars movie through and through. Is it pure nostalgia, absolutely. I've seen it 4 times and like it more every time.",9,3,42,16 January 2016

The Hangover Part III," Todd Phillips owes me a refund!!!!
","When I saw The Hangover in 2009, it was the funniest movie I had seen in years. I went to see it multiple times. It was crude, but very funny, but also there was an odd sweetness in seeing these 3 guys looking for their friend that made it more enjoyable. When the second one came out, I like most of the original's fans was disappointed. It was a carbon copy of the original but set in Thailand. It had its moments but overall it wasn't close to being as funny as the first one. One of the reasons that it wasn't as funny is that the movie felt more ugly, almost cruel. There were laughs but much fewer and far between.Then on to the 3rd one. Todd Phillips and company had learned from the lessons of the past film right? They would return to at least the tone of the first film and finish the 'trilogy' on a high note, right? Well the answer is a resounding NO! The Hangover 3 is so off putting and unfunny that I think it shouldn't be called a comedy. The Wolfpack find themselves again in a situation looking for Doug. They meet a drug dealer that is looking for Mr. Chau and tasks them to find him. it all sounds like it would be funny, but it isn't. First I think that the problem with the 2 sequels is that they weren't written by the same team as the original. Second, Ken Jeong as Chau is one of the most annoying character in a long time. In the first one, he stole every scene he was in, but he was not a focus. This film he becomes a main character. Ken Jeong is an actor that is fearless, and can be hilarious, but this character is cruel and unfunny, and is the biggest negative about this film. Bradley Cooper does nothing but react to the craziness, Ed Helms does what he can, and Zach Galifianakis has a few moments as Alan that remind us of why the first one was so good. I don't understand how anyone thought that this was funny. Todd Philips wrote this script and I think he has shown to be a one trick pony. He became a hot director because of the first film, but has done nothing good since, except cash in. There is one moment at the end of the movie that is outrageous and hilarious and definitely proves how unfunny the rest of the film was.This was in my mind by far the worst film of the summer and one of the worst sequels ever made.Grade: D- (not an F because of the final scene)",2,3,6,16 August 2013
The Thin Red Line," a critics dream: a boring, pretentious, artful mess of a movie
","Going in to this movie,  I promised myself that I would not compare it to Saving Private Ryan. Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made. But I found myself doing it throughout the whole movie. This movie is so incoherent that I lost interest the last hour. Yes it is well made, and some images are truly memorable but the movie has no focus. It is content in being so 'un-hollywood' that it loses the audience completely. I'm sure that Terrence Malick wanted to make a different type of war film, but the movie is too pretentious. the voice overs try to be so deep that they become a distraction. No characters are well drawn, the actors are just scenery really. I believe it was a mistake to have so many cameos by such known actors,they are also a distraction. I know that Private Ryan is more 'commercial' but it at least presents a story that involves the viewer. I know that this is the type of movie that critics love,because the public at large doesn't, they back a film because of its 'artfulness'. I also believe that Oscar voters were completely wrong to nominate this film, The Truman Show was left out, A Simple Plan was ignored, why they would shut these movies out and nominate this piece of pseudo-intellectual garbage is a total injustice!",6,0,0,8 March 1999

V for Vendetta," Finally!!! A decent film in the worst time of the year.
","From about January to the beginning of May every year, I dread going to the movie, Most of the films that come out at this time are bad. Whether they be action , drama , or comedy. A few times there are surprises, but most of the time the movies are average at best. Well V for Vendetta is the first film I've seen all year that I could say that I actually liked. The story is basically a mix of 1984 meets the crow, and has elements of all comic/graphic novel films that came before it. But it has good dialog and even manages to have something to say. It takes place in the near future and the UK has turned into a totalitarian society. A masked man goes around London blowing things up, and is branded a terrorist. Evfen though the story doesn't make this guy into an all out hero, I will say that in a post 9/11 world, blowing buildings up is a touchy subject. I wouldn't say that the makers of this film advocate this kind of protest, but the film make the case that governments use fear to control the population. Though many people have stated that this is a direct criticism of the current Bush/Blair world, I think that the film's ideas can be applied to any sort of governing body. Many would say that it is an irresponsible premise, that argument is also valid, but I think the movie doesn't go deep enough for it to be a problem. It is after all a work of pulp fiction.Needless to say, the film is never boring, it moves at a pretty fast pace. And even though there is plenty of action, the performances are good, and the story is involving. It is entertaining, and does have a couple of interesting things to say. And it is for me, the first decent film of 2006.Grade: B+",8,1,5,22 March 2006
