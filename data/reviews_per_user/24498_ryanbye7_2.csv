E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. a lasting impression!
","First let me say that this is a movie I saw as a child and loved it. Seeing it as an adult many times I still feel the same and to me that makes a film lasting and beautiful. This was a time when Steven Spielberg hit his stride as a filmmaker. Melissa Mathison's script is simple and wonderful. The story of a boy's first friend (happens to be an alien) doesn't change the fact that if you had a childhood friend as a boy this movie strikes you in the heart and tugs at it and never lets go. That's a good thing. The acting is perfect. Its too bad Henry Thomas didn't transition into an adult actor. At least Drew Barrymore did bless her heart. There are so many scenes that are etched in my memory forever especially the end when Elliot and E.T. say goodbye. I cry every time its one of those movies that evokes that part of you, that inner child. I hope if I have kids someday I can watch this movie with them and see their reactions like I did when I was a small boy watching it with my parents.",10,0,0,17 July 2011
American History X," The flagship of movies about racism!
","American History X is a film that reminds me that movies can be about something important. Whether its a lesson that we as humankind come away from by the end about treating everyone equally and with respect. In my estimation this film should have won multiple Oscars. I understand why it didn't though. This is a film that shocks you with brutal, and I mean brutal truth. Edward Norton did score an Oscar nomination(HE SHOULD HAVE WON) for playing a vicious Venice Beach skinhead through certain actions ends up in prison and then becomes reformed for his bad deeds. It is so rare that you see an actor completely disappear into a character. For a while you forget that you are watching a movie and just experiencing life on screen. Every nuance that Norton brings to the table is like watching a cascade of fireworks ripping across the sky. Its up there with DeNiro's performance in Raging Bull. (Yes folks he is that good). There are scenes of such intensity with violent words or physical beatings that many people will be unable to look at the screen. Obviously the curbing scene. American History X is a story about family, redemption and of course the legacy of hate. Hate blinds us from its ripple effects and the damage that it causes to so many people. The only other film that comes close to these social issues is Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. But I think American History X is a better film because there is an ending in this film that just shatters your heart. I first saw this film at 19 and I am 32 now. I keep having different experiences because of my own experiences with racism and hatred. This is a film that sets the bar so high I don't think a film like this from a major studio comes around this often. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie it will change your life, for the better!",10,0,1,20 January 2012
