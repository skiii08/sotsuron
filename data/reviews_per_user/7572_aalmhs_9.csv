Antz," Laughed once and I can't remember what that was for...
","Yes, the technology was mighty-mighty, the allusions came thick and fast... but I only laughed once and I don't even remember which joke that was at. I understood their jokes - I just didn't think they were funny. Plot too predictable and characters too formula. That's all I have to say.",5,4,7,12 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," moderate story, great execution
","I think it was in May ('99) that I SAW STAR WARS FOR THE FIRST TIME. It was just after my 18th birthday and a friend who was SHOCKED that I had never seen it (except 'about 15 mins of Return of the Jedi') lent me the first three tapes and I watched them straight. Mesmerising stuff. Totally captured me for 6 hours without so much as blood, guts or a nookie in the closet. Anyway, I wasn't fanatical about it when it came out so I didn't mind if I didn't see it for ages and ages after it had been released (so it would come off the 'no free list' and I could be a cheapskate and use one of my free movie tickets) but some friends invited me to the movies...All I have to say is - WOW. I think only George Lucas can turn such a moderate storyline into such a great execution of colour, light, fantasy and galactical scope. The only thing I didn't like was Jar Jar Binks because it took me too long to understand what the hell he was saying. Jake Lloyd was better than the criticism he received although he did rely on the other actors (ie the real ones like Liam, Ewan and Natalie) to take him through his role. Nevertheless, it was a fun ride and now I hope to hell the merchandising will get off this fun ride before I throw up.",8,5,7,7 July 1999
Shakespeare in Love," I didn't think it was outstanding, but there's a lot to be said about Shakespeare
","'Shakespeare in Love' didn't jump out and shout 'I'm a classic movie and you will worship me for years to come' but it DID quietly whisper a subtle elegance in execution. Witty, charming, bawdy, dramatic... words to describe even the bard's own work. Though some people found some of the allusions a little esoteric, I was laughing most of the way. Shakespeare's own themes were reflected in the one screenplay - love, drama, passion, mistaken identities and misplaced affection... along with some slapstick fun. The cast were wonderfully connective and the setting, accurate. It would be hard to imagine how 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter' would have taken off... but after all, aren't plays just all 'words, words, words'?",8,0,0,12 February 1999
Catch-22," doesn't touch Heller
","I read the book, saw the film - the film doesn't touch Heller. It has the main events happening and the recurring theme of Snowden's death haunting Yossarian but... it doesn't come close to the intricacies of the novel.Buck Henry has tried his best to make the film as funny as the book but instead of the satire of Heller, humour it transformed into something more outright, I guess so that people who wouldn't 'get' it in the book can laugh at the film. However, I began to think of things as tragic when in the novel they were funny (like McWatt flying into a mountain). Where's the dead man i Yossarian's tent? I even laughed in advance remembering the incidents in the book. So, I must say that this is a very poor adaptation of Catch 22, it loses the essence, the satire that was Heller's purpose for writing it.",5,3,6,29 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Not Shakespeare but it had its moments
","There's a 'shrew' and she's tamed. Actually, she's not all that tamed so I don't see how it's based, albeit loosely, on 'Taming of the Shrew'. Well, Taming of the Shrew tended to be a lot patriarchal anyway so it was welcome to see Bianca punch out Joey and Kat paving her own way as herself.I don't think I've seen a teen flick since 'Clueless' so this was out of the league of movies I usually see (it was in a movie marathon, ok?). My verdict - you could generally see what was going to happen but the difference with this movie was that it was hard to guess how it would happen. It had its amusing moments, its 'heroes' and 'villains' and the obligatory prom and love and all that teeny stuff you get enough of on TV. Not bad, probably better than what some others would have done with 'Shakespeare'.",7,0,0,3 July 1999
Notting Hill," too slow for a comedy
","Much too slow for a comedy. The camera lingered on faces for far too long and if they'd only cut that technique out, the film would've been 20mins shorter. Thing is, I think they played on the actors rather than the characters. Hugh Grant with his bewildered blue eyes and Julia Roberts with her smile etc etc (and Rhys 'Spike' with his utter lack of hygiene). Anyway, there was too much of the staring thing and not enough acceleration although I guess they had to hide the fact that it was really just 'together apart together apart together' the whole time. It had its moments though, especially Thacker's family and some of the cultural input was interesting. A slow film - don't pay for it at the cinema, hire the video or something.",7,0,0,7 July 1999
American Pie," I remember this one time, at band camp...
","At the time at which I write, American Pie has not yet hit the Australian box office. I, along with a few lucky punters taking part in a promotion, was pleased to discover that the Mystery Movie at our local cinema was this film (thank god it wasn't Big Daddy or Deep Blue). Anyway, I remember this one time, at band camp...What can I say? The whole thing is almost a conglomeration of cliches but I've studied films in cultural studies that twist familiar things to make them interesting and original - like American Pie. I think all the 'bad' guys (Stifler and Sherman) get what's coming to them, as does Jim though he's actually pleased. Everything works out rather nicely and surprisingly - I mean, how many people thought things were going to be resolved about halfway when Finch seemed to have everything under control, Jim has the Czech girl over his house, Oz had 'won' the girl and Vicky had finally decided to do it with Kev? But the film ploughed on and these situations started to change and I was like, so how are Jim and Finch supposed to get laid now? But with very clever twists it all gets resolved. Love this resolving that's running rife in movies these days!Well, I must say it was an enjoyable film, utterly hilarious at parts (the apple pie is just one bit). You gotta love quotes like 'Scotch in the cupboard on the right... aged 18 years - just the way I like it.' (Stifler's mother) and little things like Jim's 'strip' which almost saved him from humiliation (the deftly aimed shirt). I'll shut up now. Go and see it or you won't know what anyone's talking about.I remember this one time, at band camp...",8,0,0,5 September 1999
Moulin Rouge!," I was scared that it might all be hype
","... and the best thing was that it WAS all hype, because that's what Baz Luhrman set out to achieve. Remember Strictly Ballroom? Romeo + Juliet? Well, then it should be no surprise that Moulin Rouge turned out the way it did and if you didn't like the way it was directed and edited, you should have known better from Luhrman's previous films.The best thing about Moulin Rouge was the hilarious highs and the heart-wrenching lows and all that brilliant colour in between. People with their thumbs up have pretty much said what I wanted to say but I just wanted to chip in with a bit of 'Moulin Rouge delivered everything it promised considering the cast and the director' to those who can't help but spoil all the fun.",9,0,1,20 June 2001
Mr. Holland's Opus," The right formula...
","Covering 30 yrs of a person's life was always going to be hard, but this film manages it without interrupting the flow. Mr Holland, faced with everything to hold him back from completing his opus, more than impacts on his music appreciation class - from those who said they couldn't, to those who had to break free and try their hand at the city lights. I liked the subtle time changes with the cars and the aging characters. The Cole sub-plot was a little bit misplaced (although I can't see how else they could have done it) and overall the story was predictable, but it was an inspiring movie all the same.",6,4,7,9 November 1998
