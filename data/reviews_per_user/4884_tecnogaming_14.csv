The Avengers," Spectacular!, this what a blockbuster should be!
","Will star this short review by saying I hate superheroes movies, I hated Captain America movie, I dislike Thor movie, which was, for me, average, so you can pretty much imagine my negative vibe about seeing this one, but after SO much good reviews and super-high score I said, what the hell, if I did saw Iron Man and was mildly interesting this one should be too.How could I be so wrong about this, the director Joss Whedon show me what prejudice towards a movie is and sure I am that I felt slap in the face like Hult teaching me how to tennis..The movie is AWESOME, there is no other point or way to express it, every character in this movie excels, from Thor to Captain America to the assassins and Stark, each and everyone excels with very good narrative, incredible action scenes involving each and everyone of them and glorious scenes one after the other.Even humor works incredible well through the whole movie, there is no denying this, the director, the staff, the actors they show a deep connection to this project, they all have great chemistry and this shows in a movie that is BRILLIANT each step of the way.Stark/Iron Man is one the the most shown on screen and I totally loved it, they all have their proper time on screen, in fact, I can hardly understand how a movie of this magnitude with SO much going on and so much things that could failed didn't.It's no wonder Hollywood is thrilled by it's success. I really hope this new gem of a movie is not used to try and imitate the formula without the magic this one has because, make no mistake, behind all this special effects, shiny images, action scenes and interactions what stand about the most on this movie is the chemistry between all the heroes, even the villain, there is no denying.From a guy who hate superheroes movies I give this movie a perfect 10, this is no joke this movie is THE BEST blockbuster of this year, totally recommended, even for the wife who hates explosions and the kids will love it!PD: please watch the whole ending, even after the credits, that last 2 minutes are PRICELES!",9,6,13,19 August 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Magic and clever investigation replaced with fights and CGI
","I truly hate Hollywood when they totally destroy an original idea/concept or old great character and then they proceed to 'rambo- modify' it to fit the actual time.Sherlock Homes, the first one was a complete and utter useless movie and the second part seems to do pretty much the same.The great charisma of Robert Downey Jr does not save the movie from it's obvious flaws.. and they all converge into just one point. Character.Actual Hollywood seems to think that Sherlock Holmes is boring, so, they mutated his character into some kind of SWAT-Rambo-Hard-to-Kill-Know-all- Kung-Fu-Styles person. This completely annihilate the concept of the Sherlock doing detective work, the mind over matter, intelligence over physical attributes... I could go on and on..Game of Shadows gets deeper into this game, alternating action scenes with calm scenes with abundance of useless dialog pretending to be intelligent but, in the end, only confuses their audience.The movie has too much action for a 'Sherlock Holmes' or, any detective movie that could be called like that.This all could be forgotten if we somehow had some interesting characters, a compelling storyline or some kind of magic in the film itself, but, none of this are present.Instead, we get a flat movie that displays as a succession of one scene after the other with no connection whatsoever between them, really great actors with stupid lines and no compelling reason to do what they do.I totally lost hope for a nice Sherlock Holmes movie and suggest anyone looking for a intelligent and challenging movie to look elsewhere, this is just popcorn junk delivered to young audiences that have absolutely no idea who Sherlock Holmes actually was.Oh, and the Matrix-Like scenes about Sherlock taking down enemies, it probably was a good scene if it was in 'Terminator XX', but done in a movie about a charismatic detective with a talent for thinking, it feels SO wrong..Not worth the title, probably if they changed it to anything else would be a passable popcorn movie, but exploiting such a wonderful character as this, is insulting.Sad times indeed for cinema.",4,1,2,1 September 2012
The Equalizer," Dread...
","Denzel Washington, a nice job, a kind man and a predicament when he sees how some gang leader hit a nice prostitute, some nice dialog and a good start.That's about the kindest thing I could say about the movie, after the first 15 minutes the whole premise went downhill.This has to be the worst action movie in a long time, there is absolutely no tension whatsoever when you see a seemingly indestructible guy because Hollywood says so that is able to take down and destroy pretty much everyone in his path.This is pure Hollywood American propaganda where the Latinos are weak, the Americans are super powerful and Russians are just gangs and psychopaths.Total and absolute waste of time with excessive violence and really uncalled for.Denzel, I like your inspirational talks but you gotta stop doing this unnecessary violent movies.Not recommended for anyone.",4,5,8,23 December 2014
The Book Thief," Beautiful cinematic masterpiece
","I will start this review by saying i've felt incredible touched by this movie, it really got into me, make me feel all the range of human emotions and I felt so much grateful for that!!.Now, let me tell you why.The book thief describes with incredible passion the story of our little girl, the book thief from her early days going to a foster parent home after leaving her mother and loosing his brother, going through her life with her new family in the worst possible moment in humanity, the second world war.Now, here is the wonderful thing about this movie, it has so much heart into it that you will definitely cry in some point of the movie.The actors not only did an splendid job, they act so naturally that you simply forget they are acting, something not so easy to do these days, on top of that, their chemistry is so good on screen that you will feel them as your own family, living the good and the bad things with them and make them part of you.This movie shows in perfect depiction how the human being can be so cruel and so pure at the same time and contrary to some other movies related to that period in time, this one is incredible heart touching.The inner light this characters carry though the story is simply something beautiful to watch and it will make you honor and enjoy your life more.There is so much good things about this movie, from the incredible profound soundtrack made by John Williams to the perfect acting of Sophie Nélisse as our book thief little girl to the incredible well developed foster parents, acting as opposites, the grumpy old 'Mama' played by no less than Emily Watson and the good and lovely 'papa' played so well by Geoffrey Rush. Finally adding a perfect screenplay, enjoyable dialog, incredible visuals and the perfect angel of dead voice over by Roger Allam who really does an outstanding job !Seeing this movie is really a relief, when you think cinema is stuck in the CGI/FX dumb era, then every now and then a director step in and makes cinematic delights like this one, showing what cinema is really all about.Please, go see it, but do so with an open heart, this movie does require commitment and is not for someone that goes to the cinema to just be 'entertained'.Perfect 9 out of 10, this is simply a masterpiece.",9,1,3,30 March 2014
Horrible Bosses," Horrible bosses, disgusting script, lame jokes...
","I felt compelled to write a review for this piece of garbage of a movie, I know i'm just one guy but at least my vote will count on lowering this trash 1 millimeter down from this incredible high score.Horrible bosses is a movie so disgusting in it's dialog and implications that, the only way someone will like it is if: 1- He/she has been lobotomized or so self absorbed by media that the brain stopped working correctly.2- He/she is a pervert, a social deviant or some kind of anger guy who hates everyone in his job.The jokes are so lame, so harsh, so evil in places and so plain disgusting that they really hurt my stomach watching.Of course I had to stop the movie after 30 minutes, there is no way I could tolerate anymore.If you like watching disgusting people in horrible situations thinking horrible solutions to their problems while they chat about sex like they were wiping their crap with their own hands (because that's how harsh the dialog is) then this movie is for you.If you on the contrary want to watch an actual comedy, avoid this horrible piece of trash at all costs.This is the typical movie for the brainless masses and what really disturb me the most, is the amount of good reviews it got, really?!, society must be in a very new low, someone even recommended this movie on a date !, I am sure that if I saw this movie on my first date, I will still be single, this is a horrible movie for a date!, a horrible movie for watching with friends, completely inappropriate movie to watch near any kids, I would not allow even a teenage boy to watch it, let's be honest. This is not a recommended movie, period.I really hope comedy is not going to degenerate any more or else I will be forced to not watch the genre anymore.0 out of 10 and a shame and a waste of good actors.",1,8,17,29 January 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," My mind was blown away !
","I was NEVER a fan of comic books or movies about super heroes, they are just way to fantastical for my taste but i gotta admit I did like Avengers a lot.When i saw this movie was up i told my kids.Hey buddies you wanna see some super-hero super action movie with shoots and fire and explosions?Yeahh !Well, you can see what my idea about this movie was... Super simplistic script with a lot of special FX and lot of action.. Wow how WRONG i was!The movie is FREAKING amazing !. The script, the acting and above all, the pace of the movie really was fantastic, they managed to include a political conflict mixed up with conspiracy in a way i really wasn't expecting in a movie about a super hero.Hell this movie is even better than Avengers for the script alone.When you get glue to the chair watching a movie, anticipating what is going to happen and getting nervous about the outcome you can see you're in front of something very good.The directing is top notch, the actors all do their part with ease and the script, well, freaking congrats to marvel for taking the movie that far..I don't know ANYTHING about the marvel universe or any of this super heroes aside from enjoying a couple of episodes of Agents of SHIELD (The series) and Avengers, now i'm super enthusiastic about the coming movies of Phase 2 and i wasn't even interested before.Way to go marvel !, that's how GOOD this movie is!.",8,1,3,5 August 2014
10 Things I Hate About You," Masterpiece of Comedies, period.
","I've seen that people compare this movie to Easy A and that was my primary reason to see it, I miss it when it was out, a long time ago, but I was a fan of Easy A.Until I saw this movie.I don't know if something really messed up in today's comedies, or Hollywood just degraded to raunchy comedy but this movie was SO freaking good i was ROFL all the way from start to finish.There are too many lines that should be awarded in the script.The difference with today comedies and this one is that they don't need to show you disgusting stuff or do bad jokes, they use clever humor, yes, sex oriented but totally different.Maybe i'm old and I don't understand humor these days but this movie was fresh, hilarious, it was genuinely a comedic masterpiece and you shouldn't miss it for anything in the world.The actors seem playful through the whole movie, they really seem to be enjoying doing it and that was a big plus. The father of the girls was one of the best characters in a comedy, there are stereotypes but they have soul and they all have their particular personality, it's really fun.Even when I liked Easy A, this movie is clearly superior.It would be one of my top 10 movies along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off from now on.",8,0,0,13 August 2014
Oblivion," This is what sci-fi should be all about!!
","OK, THIS is what sci-fi is, not The Colony or 2012.In Oblivion everything is not what it seems to be and the movie starts with a beautiful concept that it is able to get it through and through.From the very start you know something is off in the task Jack is assigned to do but I will not tell any spoilers since, knowing them will ruin the majority of the good script and incredible solid experience.The acting is top notch, the sound is by far one of the best i've seen this year, music is incredible inspired and directing is, well, how to put it, one of the best i've seen this year.I was almost beginning to lost all hope on the sci-fi front for a good movie when Oblivion makes its appearance now we have a major contender for the movie of the year alone with Elysium.This is what sci-fi SHOULD be all about, not about special effects (although there are and they are top notch) but characters we care about, a script that is solid, lines well said, moments that have meaning and are not clichéd and above all, a plot well developed. Oblivion will not try to impress you with action sequences, effects are natural, incredible well crafted and more importantly, they are there for the purpose of telling the story, not to show off, also, the movie's action parts are there too, for the plot, they don't feel to be put to give you a wow moment, but to put you into the character's shoes, the world of Oblivion is incredible alive!Oblivion will bore the easy movie goer that wants action but will turn upside down the sci-fi lover, this movie has it all, it is slow at the beginning but not because it's boring, it's because it takes it's characters very seriously, the plot is extremely interesting and full of enigmas, rises a lot of questions and opens up the can or worms to a lot of interesting ideas with the plot after the movie ends, Oblivion takes advantage of it's actors, have deep atmosphere that will expand in your mind after you watched it, and above all, it is inspired.Oblivion does not think it's viewers are dumb, it does not need to explain everything and so, does not need to deliver stupid obvious lines through it's actors, you have to figure things out for yourself and this is a wonderful comeback for the genre.The ending is actually so good, without giving you all the answers but actually creating new ones that feels like sci-fi can be a respected genre once again.Oblivion is miles ahead of any other movie of this genre from this year, you MUST go see it you will not regret it, and don't let anyone spoil the movie for you, make your own conclusions and enjoy it.It's the first movie I truly enjoyed this year and deserves a solid 8 out of 10.",9,2,5,24 July 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Incredible FX and action that cannot match the spirit of the first one.
","I am so sorry to disagree with so many people, It seems I wasn't expecting the same as everybody else here.Kung Fu panda made me cry, there you have it, it was a story filled with profound teachings about life, Kung-Fu and full of meaning. The master turtle and Shi-Fu really made the whole movie shine and the good and sad moments were truly remarkable, that movie was a dead serious hit for me, it surely wasn't done just for kids, so I was so eager to see this one.Sadly, Kung-Fu panda 2 returns to the formulaic premise of Hollywood these days, our hero doesn't need more training so the lessons are replace with a very bad villain who doesn't know how to fight and then recurs to weapons (not my kind of villain). The tone of the movie is darker than the original, sadly, the mood, the way the movie is made and the way characters develop is it not. It's like they tried so hard to made it more serious than the first one, but the excessive action and special effects really contrived the movie to a merely two or three scenes of peaceful nature. There are so few quiet moments that it really feels like 'producers and execs' told the writers, ' more fun, more action, more dark' and this is what we got.I really don't know why people loved it, I hated it, not because it's a bad movie, because the first one was so deep, and this one so dull. Comparing this one to the first one is like comparing star wars episode 5 with episode 1, one is deep, the other is dull.My kids liked it, the increased action will have a positive feedback for people that don't have inner peace (clearly the majority of the market this movie goes for), but, for people that search some deep meaning to the things that happened on screen, they will better be served with Kung Fu Panda.Kung-Fu panda 2 excels at action but lacks heart, not giving us master Shi-Fu through the movie was a big mistake and the lack of a master like the turtle in the first one was a serious error me thinks.Tai-Lung was a glorious villain, the peacock no, it wasn't scary, it wasn't evil, it was just a resentful guy trying to be bad, also, what's up with dumbing down our dragon warrior?, after the first one this guy was a real master that defeated a truly difficult villain, in this one it behaves like a moron the whole movie up until the end?, it just doesn't fit and it was done purely for jokes and fun and it was forced.So sad that it turned out to be like this.My score 5/10",5,1,3,13 May 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Solid comeback for a saga I considered dead after MI-3
","After watching MI-3 I considered Mission Impossible pretty much dead. The lengths that they go there was, too much for me, flat scrips, too much action, too much music, it was not Mission Impossible anymore, it was pure Hollywood crap.Not anymore.Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol revives the saga in an incredible way, for starters they abandoned the full orchestra with dramatic sounds in exchange for a more 'classic' feel, very Mission Impossible (original) like, I simply loved the soundtrack.Second thing they got rid of is the excessive amount of special effects and unbelievable scenes were Ethan never misses and missions go as planned, in Ghost Protocol everything goes wrong all the time and they have to improvise, this is a very nice touch to the series and one that allows the characters to prevail because of their will to succeed more than the amount of gadgets they carry with them.Ghost Protocol follows the story of a nuclear warhead ready to go kaboom and the usual agents trying to stop it, only that this time, they don't have the luxury of all the gadgets, weapons and stuff since they are pretty much dead as an organization, will not speak more about this since I don't want to spoil the movie for you.Suffice it to say that the movie is A LOT more centered around the characters and their shortcomings rather than special effects and impossible scenes, well, there are a couple of hard to believe scenes but comparing this movie to the defunct MI-3 is like comparing a jet with a bird. Ghost Protocol is very viewer friendly, not boring at all, very good locations selected for the movie and more character development than any other movie in the series.A very nice touch indeed is the added humor in which some scenes occur, it is evident that the director wanted to relieve tension, MI-3 was full of very hard-to-swallow moments and the theme of the movie was so dramatic that it was almost painful to watch, Ghost protocol is nice and fresh, partly due to the way humor is implemented in the movie, you will experience a mix of modern cinema with the good old fashioned one, a really nice touch that suits the theme perfectly.This is a wonderful first step to resurrect the saga, I am sure more will come, keep up this level and we will be very happy!Totally recommended.",8,1,3,31 March 2012
Elysium," A colossal mess
","Elysium is one of those movies that starts great and ends in disaster.If you want a short review here it is:Starts almost at 9/10, struggles to be in the 6/10 in the middle and ends in an awful 4/10.Elysium tries very hard for us to like the characters, hate the villain and mostly, it do it's job in the first act, since we see how the people on earth suffer compared to Elysium.Our main character displays a very good and humble predisposition to work and do the right thing for this 'world'... This all go downhill from the moment he suffers the accident and decides to go Rambo.The problem with Elysium is that the characters are not likable at all past the first act, you begin to hate them and the director seems to confuse it's stuff since you begin to wonder what the heck they are trying to do all the time.The villain is so bad that it becomes basically a jerk by the end. Jodie Foster is just a wasted talent on this movie and the rest of the cast, they feel like they don't know what to do or what are their intentions at all.By the time the movie reaches it's climax it's a complete mess, it tries so hard to be an action flick and it fails, tries hard to give a compelling argument that it fails and in the end, it's just a mess.If you like random movies with random characters, lots of violence for no reason and nice CGI, this one is for you.If, on the contrary, like me, you like a nice thinking sci-fi movie with a good plot, this one is definitely not for you.It's sad because it's started well, but it just don't know how to handle the world or it's characters at all and this is clearly the director's fault. It should had stayed with district 9 but this is what happens with someone talented starts to work for Hollywood.",4,1,2,2 December 2013
The Woman in Black," Pretty good with nice twists
","I am somewhat disappointed lately with the horror / paranormal / mystery genre since the vast majority of the movies are not scary or doesn't do justice to the topic, this one was different.The movie premise starts OK, it's not flashy at the beginning, it builds up quite slow but a nice pace because it develops its characters and at the same time, the mood and atmosphere of the place.One of the best things about this movie is it's atmosphere, very nice and well done, Daniel Radcliffe excels in his role and I was surprised since, to be honest, I didn't liked him in Harry Potter movies.The movie spend quite a lot of time with Radcliffe character struggling with the troubled woman in black and when it does, the movie works, there are very few parts where we see more characters on screen but the best parts are when Radcliffe is alone with the spirits.Although there are predictable parts and some things could be done more polished, there are a few scary parts that are truly legendary (I will not say anymore).It's not a masterpiece, but is not bad, not even by a long mile. In the end, it's quite a good movie that dare to show a different picture at the ending, I really don't understand the complains about the ending, I did quite like it.Go see it, you won't be disappointed, it's a fine movie about ghosts.6 out of 10.",6,0,1,24 April 2012
Godzilla," This movie redefines the concept of 'BAD'
","When I started watching this (that is after the first 20 minutes), a ray of hope invaded my spirit... that is until 20 minutes into the movie.Anything that happened after that period is utter garbage and I can't state enough reasons without making this a bible instead of a review, so I will state a few points.1- Sound: Really BAD equalization and i mean BAD, like from someone who doesn't know anything about audio. The bass and LFE is so OVER THE PLACE that you can't recognize an explosion from a character walking from a monster screaming... it's all LOUD LOUD LOUD, it's so LOUD that you either cover your ears or throw up. Hint to audio mixer guy: if you put a loud bass to everything you saturate the spectrum, you will loose the shock value and just irritate the viewer.2- Script: I really don't know why in this world a director will put such good actors to such lame roles, they don't have anything meaningful to say, they just go on about a 'plan to destroy the monsters' and they go on an on forever.. without ANY character development.3- Directing: Important parts relegated as non-important, totally unimportant parts taking the front seat in filming. Hint to director: Godzilla fights ARE the main attraction for watching this movie, if you give us 10 seconds of fight and you then put Godzilla onto the background and blurry it out to show 20 minutes of an imbecile trying to device a plan on how to stop Godzilla you should be bound be hated by the viewers. We wanted to SEE GODZILLA not half the movie wasted on stupid military tactics that amounts to ZERO in the movie.4-Common Sense: Anything that common sense dictates is not present in this movie, the amount of situations in which the characters are trying to resolve it in the worst possible way, and I mean a way which you will scream at the screen 'are you THAT STUPID?' are excessive. Nothing fits, it's like the director gone straight from the education center to his first movie, he don't have the slightest clue on how to properly do a movie.5- Shock Value: When the best scare in the whole movie is a group of pigeons impacting a BUS window (I am NOT joking) you know something gone terrible wrong in the process..Conclusion: When you're watching the movie with your little kids and your 6 years old girl says out loud 'What is this crap??! I wanna see Godzilla!' you know you're watching a piece crap. (Specially when they loved the previous one).The previous Godzilla was bad, but if you measure this to the older one you need to completely redesign a set of values in which this movie will be bad and the previous one awesome and this is plain disgusting because this Godzilla looks amazing, but somehow, the director didn't saw appropriate to gives us more of this one and less of the military.This is the WORST monster movie you will ever see in your life. Big Ass Spiders! is a lot more fun than this and that was a B-Movie filmed as a B-Movie and the actors were laughing through the movie!.",2,18,34,26 August 2014
13 Hours," I always hated the guy and his movies and I liked this one, very much
","I personally never liked any of his movies, with the exception of Armageddon. Yes it was super cliché but I liked the subject matter and some of the sequences, the rest? not so much, Pearl Harbor? don't get me started.I always considered Michael Bay as a solid money grabber, soul-less human being with zero ability to direct.I watched this movie expecting the worst and I was shockingly impressed. It was well directed with almost perfect fighting sequences, maybe a little on the long side but solid nevertheless.Long gone is the typical American Flag sequence and patriotism so characteristic of his movies, this was replaced with realistic fighting sequences, shameful attitude from north America to this soldiers and the consequences of war without turning the movie into glorification of conflict.Having him on such a low esteem from the start, the sole fact that I was impressed by the movie should speak volumes about his accomplishment.",6,3,6,11 August 2016
