Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Bill Vol. 2 was Outstanding
","Enjoyed Bill Vol. 1, however, this film went back to the same characters and gave more of a history into the Bride and how she learned all the secret powers of becoming a super killer in order to get revenge from all the people who harmed her. Uma Thurman gave an outstanding performance when she is being taught by a very old wise teacher of defense and some very important deadly parts of the body which can destroy a person even if they are almost sitting on top of you, face to face or nose to nose. Uma Thurman did a great job of sword swinging and got herself out of almost impossible situations, like being buried alive and many other horrible situations. David Carradine,(Bill) had a larger role in this film and showed his great acting abilities, just like his father John Carradine, 'Dracula '40 and 'House of Frankenstein) This is a film you can watch from the beginning to the end and enjoy every minute of great entertainment by all the actors.",10,2,4,19 September 2006
Vertigo," Kim Novak was Radiant
","Have not seen this film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed the great acting by Kim Novak, (Madeline Elster/Jude Barton). I also enjoyed the great film locations in San Francisco, California where I lived for a few years and recognized all the places that took place in this film. Alfred Hickcock did an outstanding job of directing this film and in most of his films, he loves beautiful blonde's and he sure pick a great actress in this film. Detective, Scottie Ferguson is asked by a long time good friend to keep an eye on his wife because she has started acting very peculiar. Scottie has just retired from the police force because of a problem he encountered chasing a fugitive on a high building and he developed vertigo. Scottie follows Madeline Elster all over San Francisco and even saving her from jumping into San Francisco Bay. These two people begin to fall in love with each other and that is when the plot gets very interesting. This is a great film you can watch over and over again over the years. Enjoy.",10,2,3,17 March 2008
Scarface," Great Directing & Acting
","Al Pacino, (Tony Montana) showed all his great talents through out this entire picture which was directed by a very famous director. The story takes place during the time when President, Jimmy Carter allowed many people from Cuba to come into the United States; and some of these people were hardened criminals, who had other interests rather than making an honest way of making a living. Tony Montana started out washing dishes, however, his interest went to making a fast buck and being a sort of politician at the same time. Michelle Pfeiffer,(Elvira Hancock) catches the eye of Tony Montana and he sets one of his goals on going to bed with her and owning her body and soul. These is so much action and wonderful acting, it is almost too hard to explain. If you never seen this film, this is one of Al Pacino's great acting films.",10,0,1,17 October 2006
The Ring," Don't Answer the Telephone or Cell Phone !
","This was certainly a very strange and mysterious film with creepy old houses and very depressing rain that never seemed to stop. There was a VCR tape that was shown and it had all kinds of symptoms to a mental disorder in someone's brain or at least it seemed that was the intent. There was a very strange part of the film where a horse breaks loose on a Ferry Boat going across a large body of water and forgets he is not on a race track, like the BIG A and decides to cause all kinds of problems to the cars and people on this unlucky ride. If you watch Television it just might be your last view of the BOOB TUBE in that particular Barn or Old Shack of a House. Hope you enjoy the ending of the film, it will knock your socks OFF !",8,0,1,3 April 2006
Minority Report," Prevent Crime Before It Happens !
","Enjoyed this film which takes place around 2045 and a new Police Department has developed a system which is able to track down a killer before he or she is able to commit the crime. Tom Cruise,(Chief John Anderton), leads his attack team of detectives to follow up on various TV screens which indicate just where this event will happen and the person about to commit the crime. Max Von Sydow,(Pre-Crime Director, Lamar Burgess) is the head of operations and wants this Pre-Crime Department to continue without any mistakes. John Anderton and Lamar Burgess have gotten along very well over the years and then a problem seems to occur and the story takes a very different twist of events. Lots of action and even mechanical Spiders appear and track down people who are identified by their EYEBALLS.",8,1,2,11 April 2006
Se7en," Gwyneth Paltrow Did Not Like The BIG CITY!
","Morgan Freeman(Detective Lt., William Somerset),'Levity','03 was outstanding in this film and has always given a great performance in any picture that he has appeared in.  Somerset was about to retire from the force and much to his surprise he had a new partner, Brad Pitt,(Detective David Mills),'Full Frontal','02, the two of them finally got along and became great partners trying to solve horrible murders concerning the seven(7) deadly Sins!  Gwyneth Paltrow,(Tracy Mills),'Sylvia','03, was married to David and was about to have a baby and did not like the big city living and the horrible apartment they had over a subway system that shook their entire building.  She confides in Bill Somerset about having a baby and her family situation, as she has no family nearby, the acting in this scene was fantastic between Tracy & Bill.  Anytime I see this film, I simply hate the ending and the torture David Mills goes through in making a very serious decision.  Great film with great actors. The final outcome is left up to YOU !",10,0,0,11 January 2004
The Big Lebowski," Never Stopped Laughing
","Missed seeing this very entertaining film with Jeff Bridges, (Jeffrey Lebowski, The Dude) and John Goodman, (Walter Sobchak) who are great pals and bowl using every curse word ever used and even more! Jeffrey Lebowski is a very lazy guy and loves to drink White Russians and manages to get himself involved with a kidnapping of a young girl, named Bunny, (Tara Reid) who is married to a very rich older man. A woman named Maude Lebowski, (Julianne Moore) wants to have a baby and she decides to make love to Jeffrey who is not his wife and never intends to marry a man, rather way out in left field scene. Steve Busemi, (Jeffrey Lebowski) gives a great supporting role. This is a great comedy filled with all kinds of surprises and plenty of shocking words thrown back and forth with each of the actors.",10,1,4,31 December 2007
Unbreakable," Great Acting by Bruce Willis!
","Greatly enjoyed the acting performed by Bruce Willis,(David Dunn),'The Whole Ten Yards,''04, David Dunn was a man who escaped death and was trying to find out WHY! and what his purpose in life should be.  Samuel L. Jackson,(Elijah Price),'South Africa','04, tried to find David Dunn in order to direct his life and his destiny.  It is very easy to find this film boring if you do not understand the deep Spiritual meaning the director of the film is trying to portray.  Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson both had difficult roles to perform and did an outstanding job.  The director of this film has also produced another great picture for the Summer called, 'The Village','04 with William Hurt in the starring role.   If you love Bruce Willis and his acting, this is the film for YOU!",10,0,2,27 July 2004
Underworld," Kate Beckinsole was Hot
","Enjoyed this horror film because it had two famous horror creatures fighting against each other and trying to out smart each other with weapons and wits. The Vampire Colony is being threatened by the Lycan gang of Werewolves and the Vampire's are being led by the red hot looking Kat Beckinsole (Selene) who is really a rebel among her group and breaks all the rules of her blood sucking family. Selene even gets interested in a werewolf and decides not to bite his neck but does a good job of french kissing him to death. There is plenty of bullets flying all around and Selene manages to upset quite a few big brothers and werewolves and puts a ring right through their very noses. Enjoyable film and very entertaining if you like this kind of picture, which is must better than the old Vampire Films.",7,2,5,13 February 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Beat All Errold Flynn Films
","This film starts off nice and calm with a young pretty gal looking out over the ocean from the bow of an English Vessel with all its sails blowing in the wind. This young girl is Keira Knightly, (Elizabeth Swann) who notices someone is floating on a raft in the waters below and summons help to rescue him; Elizabeth then proceeds to steel a metal object from around his neck and never says a word about this incident for many years in the future. The rescued young boy was Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) who has a secret past relating to his father and his associations with men on the seas who had Cross Bones and a Skelton as their flag. There is plenty of sword crashing steel and creatures resembling Draculas along with things you can not even imagine. Errold Flynn would never be able to complete with Johnny Depp, but Errold was good way back in the 1930's and 40's.",10,0,7,1 January 2007
The Girl Next Door," Lots of Fun Film
","This was a great entertaining film with plenty of action and lots of laughs. Emile Hirsch, 'Lords of Dogtown', plays the role of a very bright high school student and even President of his class, however, he was still not popular with most of the guys and gals of his senior class. Elisha Cuthbert, 'House of Wax', moves next door to Emile and gives him a free show of her body from her bedroom window and then proceeds to visit his home and asks for help getting to know the town and its hot spots. Elish did not tell Emile that she was a former porno star and poor Emile was still a virgin and very shy trying to put the make on sexy Elisha. Elisha Cuthbert has really grown up since her performance in '24' TV Series and is a beautiful young up and coming gal.",7,2,3,30 December 2006
Spider-Man 2," Great Spider-Man Film
","Tobey Maguire,(Spider-Man/Peter Parker), gave an outstanding performance as a very weak and helpless type of guy who tried to fly like a bird and fell on his face all the time, so to speak. As the picture progresses you wonder just how Spider Man will eventually put an end to his octopus friend and his evil deeds. There are many exciting scenes and especially when Spider Man is trying to save a run-away elevated train from going off its track and winding up in a river. Kirsten Dunst, (Mary Jane Watson) is about to get married to someone other than Peter Parker and something takes hold of her and sends her in another direction. This was a great entertaining film and very well viewing over and over again.",10,17,26,8 January 2007
The Fifth Element," Nice Change of Role For Bruce
","Enjoyed this picture from beginning to end and believe that some time in the future we will be traveling around in Taxi cabs just like the one Bruce Willis (Karben Dallas) did in this film. All the appliances were created for speed and everything was in a big hurry like New York. Bruce Willis is a retired Army Officer who is drafted again by very powerful Military Officials, in a way it is a good thing, since he just lost his job. Milla Jovovich, (Leeloo) is a very, very slim and trim gal and was quite sexy in this film, considering she was called the perfect human being that was going to change the world. There is plenty of action and romantic scenes between Karben & Leeloo and a very entertaining film.",10,1,2,5 February 2006
Blade," Wesley & Kristofferson Had a Ball
","Enjoyed this blood sucking and nipping at the neck film, the plot had many different twists and turns and if you are looking for lots of blood and gore, this is the film to view. Wesley Snipes,(Blade), did a great job of chopping and cutting up any blood sucker that came across his path. Kris Kristofferson,(Abraham Whistler), gave an outstanding supporting role and assisted Blade through the many problems he had to face to avoid from being over powered by the VAMPS. There is also some very hot looking females to add lots of sex and action to this story, which is not your usual run of the mill vampire flick. If this is your type of blood and gore film, you will enjoy this one to the very END!",7,0,2,27 February 2006
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," This Film Fooled ME
","Really had my doubts if I was going to enjoy viewing this film and it was not too long that I found myself glued to the screen. The games that Kate Hudson,(Kate Anderson) played with this guy in order to simply win his heart and at the same time, do everything she could to make him completely hate her and leave. However, the guy wanted basically to do the same thing, however, I don't know how he could have kept his patience with all the things that Kate Anderson did to him. Kate even gave his Private Member a name and had him go get a soda during a Nets game and missed out on all the action plays. This is a great comedy and all the actors gave great supporting roles. Enjoy.",10,2,6,15 November 2005
Constantine," Fight Between Good & Evil
","Great acting by Keanu Reeves, (John Constantine) and Rachel Weisz,(Angela Dodson) who both struggle against all forces of evil and good. John Constantine has great powers and has put many souls into hell and in his struggles against angels and devils he encounters a policewoman who is seeking the deep dark secrets of the supernatural and how her twin sister was killed, who she never believed would have taken her own life. This film is filled with demons who try to give birth to other humans and you even see angels who are really not angles but real devilish creatures which roam around looking for souls that they can occupy. There are people cutting their wrists and a young woman jumping off a tall building to her death and this film goes on and on even with quotes from the Bible and the Book of Corinthians. This is really a Halloween special film only for the end of October. Enjoy.",7,0,6,29 October 2007
The Others," Nicole Kidman Gave a Great Performance
","Thought that this film was going to go down the garden path like most thriller films. However, I was greatly surprised and enjoyed an entirely different experience. Nicole Kidman,(Grace Stewart),'Birth','04, showed her great acting talents and charming beauty. Grace opened doors and locked them constantly and never let any sunlight into this huge dwelling of a home where she lived with her two children. They used candle and oil lamps for lighting and the children seemed to drive their mother crazy. Grace was waiting for her husband to come home from WW II since the war was over in 1945. There is some very brief romance, but the film does keep you on the edge of your seats and the ending will keep you in Suspense.",9,2,4,28 January 2006
Troy," Entertaining Film
","Viewed older versions of stories dealing with the Greeks and the Trojan Nation and of course, the Trojan Horse. There were different versions with Archilles and how his wounded heel brought his life to a crashing end and in this picture it is quickly done without you even noticing it.This film gave a completely different outlook on the picture with great scenes of battles and how balls of fire went crashing to the Greek encampment near the sea along with a great cast of actors. Thought that Archilles, (Brad Pitt) and Helen of Troy, (Diane Kruger) both gave outstanding performances. Whenever Hollywood makes a film about History, you can always count on the facts to be distorted and completely cut out of a film: I would not be too critical of a picture like this because it is not a documentary film which gives accurate details. I found this film to be great compared to the older films depicting the story of Troy.",7,1,5,3 December 2007
Dead Poets Society," Great Robin Williams Film
","Did not think that I would enjoy this film because I am not a big fan of Robin Williams who plays the role as John Keating, an English Professor who loves poetry and teaches this subject quite different than anyone else. Professor Keating gets down to basic facts about poetry and turns this subject into a very enjoyable experience which relates to how you can live in this world and have a great experience in doing whatever you really want to do and it also draws out young men's mental feelings about themselves and other people. This story also dwells with a young man named Todd Anderson, (Ethan Hawke) who is a very shy student and also had an older brother who attended this same college and was valedictorian, which are hard shoes to step into. Todd's room-mate is Neil Perry, ( Robert Sean Leonard) who has a very overbearing father and wants him to go to medical school and does not want him to waste his time on any social activities at the college. This story becomes very interesting with some of the students falling madly in love with pretty gals which makes this film a great all around treat to watch and enjoy.",8,3,4,28 January 2008
Insomnia," The Truth is the Only Way to Solve a Problem
","Whenever Al Pacino appears in a film you can just bet the film is going to be a complete knock out punch for the viewers. In this picture, Al Pacino (Detective Will Dormer,),'Any Given Sunday','99, plays a very successful cop who has a very keen sense in a crime situation and can almost smell the criminal. When Det. Dormer questions a suspect he looks right through them and his questions turn them into pure Butter. Hilary Swank,(Det. Ellie Burr),'The Core','03, simply had the hots for Will Dormer and adored his great history of solving crimes over the many years. Robin Williams, (Walter Finch),'One Hour Photo','02, gave an outstanding supporting role, who played a real weird character who wanted to work out a deal with Will Dormer to solve his problems and Will's. The moral to this story is that the Truth is the only path to follow in any situation in LIFE.",10,1,2,23 August 2005
X-Men," Sissorshands, Magnetic Forces, & Plenty of Action!
","Great film to sit back and enjoy, especially the great acting of Hugh Jackman,(Logan/Woverine),'Van Helsing','04, who did not care to pick up a hitchhiker gal who had more power than an Electric Company. Patrick Stewart,(Professor Charles Xavier),'King of Texas','02, headed a private school for very very special talented young men and women; with powers that would knock your socks off standing up. Famke Janssen,(Jean Grey),'Eulogy','04 was a very sexy powerhouse of joy and played a very great supporting role. The film locations were really great in New York Harbor, Liberty Island and nice backgrounds scenes of the Manhattan Skyline. This film will entertain you through out the entire film.",10,0,0,6 October 2005
A Bridge Too Far," Outstanding WW II FILM
","Never viewed this film until recently and was very surprised at how well produced and directed this film portrayed. There is a cast of all time greats, some just starting out in their careers, such as: James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkings and Robert Redford and many many more. This film clearly showed what it was like fighting the Germans and how at times each side had compassion for the others in treating and caring for their wounded, nothing like the fight with the JAPS. (As they were called during WW II ). However, 'Private Ryan' topped this film, but is a great second outstanding World War II Film I have ever seen. Great acting and down to earth realism.",8,6,11,1 April 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Excellent / Entertaining Film
","Enjoyed reading this story by Washington Irving and even visited the area in New York where Washington Irving is buried and the story was created. Johnny Depp,(Ichabod Crane),'Charlie & The Chocolate Factory','05, played the role of the constable investigating the various crimes happening in Sleepy Hollow and brings along all his up-to-date CSI equipment, that looked like it came from a scrap metal dump. Ichabod comes face to face with his murder, who seems to disappear as soon as he appears. Christina Ricci,(Katrina),'Cursed','05, takes a liking to Ichabod and tries to help him only for her own self interests. Christopher Lee,(Burgomaster),'Charlie & the Chocolate Factory','05 gives a great supporting role with his sinister facial expressions. This film has everything, Comedy, Fantasy, Horror and some romance. Enjoy",8,1,2,9 August 2006
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Great Classic 1969 Film
","Viewed this film years ago, and seeing it again was better than the first time I viewed it. It very well could be that the top stars in this film were younger and both at the height of their careers. Paul Newman,(Butch Cassidy),'Where the Money Is' 2000, gave an outstanding performance in being dramatic, comical and deadly. His sidekick, Robert Redford,(The Sundance Kid),'The Last Castle','01, had a great time protecting Butch Cassidey in a cross fire of bullets and even convincing him to jump off a high cliff into roaring rapids far below. Katherine Ross,(Etta Place),'Don't Let Go','02, looked very pretty and had a hard time trying to settle down the true love in her life. Great film for all generations to view and enjoy two great Actors.",8,0,1,10 March 2006
Blade II," Bathing in Blood
","Enjoyed Blade 2 more than the first version, there seemed to be plenty of action between vampires trying to make peace among each other in order to get the real Blood Suckers. Wesley Snipes, (Blade) was kept busy almost every minute through out the film and had more tricks and special devices in order to bring plenty of light into the eyes of the blood suckers. Blade even takes a nice bath in a deep pool of thick blood which made me stay away from tomato juice for my entire life. Kris Kristofferson, (Abraham Whistler) acted at first like a very old man who just came out of a coma and then he started to use his brain power and helped Blade accomplish some of his tasks. There was very little time for any real sex in the film, I guess that all came into play after the Mission was completely accomplished.",7,0,2,10 July 2006
The Doors," Excellent Film
","If anyone did not know anything about Jim Morrison and his rise to fame as a great Rock 'N' Roll performer, Director Oliver Stone gave one fantastic biography in this film. Jim Morrison was played by Val Kilmer who gave a very outstanding performance who put his heart and soul into this role along with Meg Ryan, (Pamela Courson) who is a faithful young girl who fell in love with Jim after he walked into her bedroom and broke up her marriage. Pamela stayed with Jim through out his entire career from 1960 until his death in the 70's. There is nothing left for your imagination, plenty of female nudity, sex, drugs and indecent exposure by Jim Morrison on the stage of one of his rock band concerts which caused great commotion and put Jim Morrison into a court of law with jail sentences. Great film about a performer who had a great message but lost his way by using drugs and booze.",7,1,1,8 October 2007
Battleship Potemkin," Great Russian Masterpiece
","Enjoyed viewing this Russian film concerning a Battleship Potemkin and the many problems that happened to the entire crew members who were fed meat that was infested by maggots and most of the crew were taken aboard the Battleship by forcing them to enlist in the Navy. These men were mistreated with plenty of cruelty involving whipping and beating by the senior officers. The Russian people heard about the horror that caused many men to die on this ship and the complete population decided to storm the officers of the Battleship in order to gain justice for the crimes caused on this ship. This is a great film which is hard to explain unless you actual view this great masterpiece which was created in 1925. If you like great films from the past, don't miss this picture.",10,1,2,29 March 2008
Taxi Driver," Great Story/ Great Acting
","Robert DeNiro, (Travis Beckle) plays the role of a Viet-Nam veteran who is trying to find himself in the wild city of New York and drives a Taxi for a living. Travis witnesses all kinds of crimes against society and how a young girl named Jodie Foster, (Iris Steensma), is being used as a hooker and exploited by some very low life creatures. Travis becomes very committed to Iris and tries to straighten her life out. Travis decides he is going to do away with a certain politician and senator who is running for President. Cybill Shepherd, (Betsy) plays a great supporting role along with Peter Boyle, (Wizard). Robert DeNiro is so very young looking, I had to look twice in order to recognize him; there is lots of action, drama and some humor. Enjoy.",10,10,16,30 December 2006
Glory," Outstanding Film
","This is definitely a film which had slipped past my attention and it was a big treat to watch this film which told a story that history did not reveal to the American Public. The Civil War was a fight between the North & South and I am happy that America has progressed beyond those days. Denzel Washington,(Pvt. Trip)' Inside Man', gave an outstanding performance as a young man who had no family and decided to join the forces against the South. Matthew Broderick,(Col.Robert Gould Shaw),'The Stepford Wives', came from a rich family in Boston, Mass., and was appointed the position as Colonel to lead the first African American Army into battle. Col. Robert Shaw was faced with a difficult position, however, he was a good and fair man and managed to turned his men into trained soldiers. Morgan Freeeman, (Sgt. Major John Rawlings) gave a great supporting role along with Andre Braugher,(Cpl. Thomas Searles),'Hack' TV Series. This is a well produced and directed film and clearly shows how the early African Americans played their role in American History. A Must See Film.",10,1,3,20 February 2007
Bridget Jones's Diary," Take Me Just As I AM
","Renee Zellweger,(Bridget Jones), played an unmarried young gal who was in her 30's and pestered by everyone, including her mom, who was always trying to fix her up with a blind date with real creeps. Bridget manages to go through different changes in her life, as well as, an assortment of wearing apparel, which is very sexy, even a bunny outfit with a very cute Tail. Bridget meets up with Hugh Grant,(Daniel Cleaver), who works in the same office and begins to take notice of Bridget and they both get romantically involved. When ever Bridget decides to make a speech or introduce some one, she instantly brings plenty of laughter and lots of people pointing fingers at her. Renee Zellweger gave an outstanding performance along with Hugh Grant in a great supporting role.",8,0,0,15 May 2006
Fargo," Fantastic Film
","Never enjoyed a more down to earth film with all the actors playing their roles to perfection. The entire film takes place in Minnesota, and having visited that state and driven through their snow storms, this is mostly what you are going to see as a good background. Frances McDormand,(Marge Gunderson),'City by the Sea','02, plays a pregnant Police Chief from a small town where a triple murder takes place by some very bad dudes who kidnap a woman. Marge portrays a very local down to earth person, not too smart by appearance, but smart as a tact about her police business. There is lots of blood and gore and the way the murders are committed will put chills down your spine. Excellent film to watch and enjoy from beginning to end.",10,0,0,4 February 2006
The Italian Job," Lots of Action
","Enjoyed this wild adventure from Italy, Philadelphia, Hollywood with plenty of car chases, comedy, drama and a small amount of romance. Charlize Theron, (Stella Bridger) was the good looking gal throughout the entire picture wearing a French Twist as her hairdo and being a fantastic safe cracker. Stella took a liking to Charlie Croker, (Mark Wahlberg) put kept him at a distance because she had a great deal of revenge against a certain man who harmed her family. John Bridger, (Donald Sutherland) played the father to Stella, however, she was a very young girl at the time and he had other endeavors to keep him busy. This is a very entertaining film with a OH-6 Observation Helicopter from the Viet-Nam era chasing down Hollywood Blvd after a car and causing major traffic jams. If you like action this is a great film, but rather drawn out and the ending disappointed me, I guess the producer ran out of ideas.",7,0,1,21 November 2008
Cast Away," GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE OCEAN!
","Recently viewed this film and was amazed at the great photography and how beautiful the Island was, Monuriki, Fiji; the beautiful waves and terrifying heights in which the waves towered over poor Tom Hanks (Chuck Nolan),'Catch Me If You Can','02, who played an outstanding role as a man stranded on a lonely island except for a ball with a face painted on it with his own blood!  This film started out in a nowhere place and kept your interest to the very end with travels to Russia and remote areas unknown. Helen Hunt(Kelly Frears),'What Women Want',2000, played a very brief role but important and her acting with Chuck Nolan was very dramatic and drew lots of tears.  Kelly gave Chuck her grandfather's watch from his days working for the Southern Pacific Railroad with her picture and it appeared quite often in the film. In other words, 'Pictures Speak Louder Than WORDS'!!  Tom Hanks is definitely a SUPER STAR and this film is worth the time to VIEW!",8,1,2,25 February 2004
The Village," Was A Complete Surprise
","This film kept my interest from beginning to the very end and I must say it was a big surprise how this film made an about face and went into other directions. The story starts out which looks like an Amish community in Illinois or Pennsylvania, with lots of farm land and the people dressing way back in the dark ages of time. These people were instructed to never enter the woods that surrounded their village and there were very strict rules about doing practically everything. The Village was controlled by a group of men, namely, William Hurt who had a great ability to lead the people into doing just what he wanted, like puppets on a string. Problems seem to face the village and then the dark secrets of the past come into light and a young girl has to face the bitter truth. This is an entertaining film and good for Halloween night.",7,1,3,31 October 2006
He Got Game," Denzel Washington Gave A Great Performance!
","Enjoyed the great acting of Denzel Washington(Jake Shuttlesworth),'The Bone Collector','99, who played a very complicated character role as a murderer who killed his wife who he really LOVED! A father to his daughter and a son he adored and trained hard to become a great Basketball Super Star like Michael Jordan.  Denzel made it look easy, but try to act out the great role he portrayed.   The film locations were great in Coney Island,(Brooklyn), NY and the Cabrini-Green in Chicago, Illinois.  Ray Allen(Jesus),'Harvard Man',01 was a great supporting actor and his talent should be seen more often.  Jake tried to help Milla Jovovich(Dakota Burns),'Dummy',02 who was a prostitute and warmed to the friendship that Jake offered to her with no strings attached!   This is a very deep and meaningful film which has great moralistic lessons to offer the audience.",10,4,10,7 February 2004
American Psycho," Great Thriller
","This film had me captured from the very beginning to the end with great acting by Christian Bale, (Patrick Bateman). Patrick is a man who is a Wall Street magnet who loves to put all kinds of creams and lotions all over his body, tans himself and is as fit as a fiddle. Except his brain gets very confused and he simply loves to kill all kinds of people. Patrick loves to pal around with his buddies and goes to very expensive clubs in New York and has plenty of woman who are crazy about him, especially Evelyn Williams, (Reese Witherspoon) who is seriously in love with Patrick. Patrick decides to eliminate one of his buddies, Paul Allen by chopping him up with a heavy ax and simply drags his body out of the lobby with the blood staining he floor. This mad man rapes and performs horrible things to people even animals and also has an apartment filled with dead bodies. However, Detective Donald Kimball, (Willem Dafoe) starts visiting Patrick quite frequently and starts to get on Patrick's nerves. The is only the beginning of the film, wait till you see how it ends.",8,2,5,28 August 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Entertaining Film
","This story deals with a very attractive young woman named FX, (Kristanna Loken) who appears in the nude and steals a young woman's car and also her clothing and starts a campaign to find a young man named John Connor, (Nick Stahl) who is about 20 years of age. FX wants to kill John and follows him to an animal hospital where John is hiding. This animal hospital is owned by Kate Brewster, (Claire Danes) who gets deeply involved with John and FX is out to kill the both of them. The Terminator, (Arnold Schwarzenegger) appears on the scene naked and visits a bar where it is ladies night and there are male strippers and since the Terminator is naked he fits in perfectly until he finds some male to get his clothes and starts out to save John and Caire from FX. There was plenty of funny scenes in this film and I had plenty of laughs.",7,1,3,20 February 2008
The Patriot," Great Film about the English, Minutemen & The French!
","My friends told me how incorrect some of the historical facts were in the picture and 'Knit Picked', the entire picture. This film is worth watching any time of the year. However, around the celebration of the 4th of July each year, it is the film to VIEW!  Mel Gibson, (Benjamin Martin), 'The Singing Detective','03 put his heart and soul into this role from the very beginning to the end of the picture.  This film made you hate a certain English officer who murdered and butchered innocent women, children and was even despised by his own commanding General.  There was lots of great battle scenes which showed  all the methods that were used during that period of time in history.

Van Helsing," Great Horror Film
","Famous monster hunter, Van Helsing,(Hugh Jackman) is called to monster territory in Transylvania which involves him with the forces of darkness and death. There is plenty of sparks with special effects and even Frankenstein appears along with the Wolf man and plenty of Draculas killing their prey. Richard Roxburgh, (Count Vladishaus Dracula) gives an outstanding performance as the main blood sucker along with Shuler Hensley, (Frankenstein Monster). Kate Beckinsale, (Anna Velerious) adds some female attraction along with a great cast of blood sucking monsters. This is a horror films which will keep you glued to your seats. Enjoy.",7,0,1,7 December 2007
American History X," Outstanding Film
","This film deals with many problems that have occurred in American History concerning bigotry of all races and how people have dealt with this problem in their own homes and how prison life also separates many races and causes all kinds of problems in those institutions. Edward Norton,(Derek Vinyard) played the role as a skin head Neo-Nazi who took the law into his own hands and killed two African American men who attempted to steal his truck. Edward Furlong,(Danny Vinyard) was a younger brother who loved his brother and followed in his footsteps of hatred. Elliott Gould, (Murray) was a teacher at one of the high schools in this small town and was courting Beverly D'Angelo), Doris Vinyard when Derek got into a fight with him because he was Jewish and showed great hatred towards all Jews, which broke up his mother's relationship with Murray. This film shows clearly how hatred creates problems that this country does not need or any country and it all starts in the home, where bigotry has the early stages of breeding in men and women's hearts and souls. Very Sad Story.",10,0,3,18 October 2007
The Usual Suspects," GREAT FILM TO VIEW!
","Enjoyed viewing this very unusual film, if you love New York and the way some New Yorker's operate in the underworld, you must try to keep up with this story line and the great photography and fine film direction.   If your mind gets a bit carried away, just sit back and enjoy the great acting of Gabriel Byrne(Dean Keaton)'Ghost Ship''02 who stole the entire picture along with Stephen Baldwin(Michael McManus) 'Firefight' '03 and Benicio DeToro(Fred Fenster) '21 Grams''03. I never thought the film would have such a great ENDING!  Find out for yourself!",10,3,6,22 September 2003
Resident Evil," This Film is like 'Night of the Living Dead' !
","The title of the film sounded very interesting and then I got rather tired of seeing a gal running around in a red slip and boots. The girl in the red slip finally was given a man's coat to cover herself up and still she continued to wear this outfit which started to get torn and in threads. Out of the blue, all these so called human beings appear like in the 'Night of the Living Dead', eating everyone in sight and leaving nothing on the bone. It did not take me very long to become completely disinterested and finished viewing the film with great disappointment. Everyone seemed to run around in circles and there was nothing outstanding about this film from beginning to end. Very cheap made film and that red slip and boots really got to ME !",7,0,1,18 December 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Lots of Flashbacks
","All the actors in this film gave an outstanding performance and especially Ashton Kutcher,(Evan Treborn) who had plenty of childhood experiences which enabled him to transport himself like a time machine going to all sorts of places. Evan in one scene is transported into a prison and has the horrible experience of being thrown in with hardened criminals and manages to read some of his childhood school books and escapes from being raped. This is a very haunting film with plenty of tragic events and I must say it made me depressed and upset, mainly because of the great acting and film direction. There are also romantic scenes which quickly jump ahead in time to seeing his girlfriend turned into a prostitute when they were separated. This is a rather sad film, but interesting.",8,0,0,28 October 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Entertaining Film
","A group of archaeologists and scientists head off to the Antaritic Ocean and discover an old whaling station under neither layers of ice and snow and they find a mysterious shape that looks like a pyramid directly under the whaling station. The archaeologists also find a tunnel that goes straight down to the pyramid location. Alexa Woods, (Sanaa Lathan) plays the role as a expert in expeditions in the Antaritic area and is also a safety guide. Everyone on the expedition feel like they are the first humans who discover a huge pyramid until they encounter strange creatures and start getting trapped in sliding walls of stone pillars and some of their crew start to disappear. There is plenty of action and good entertainment. However, this film was a big disappointment and simply burned itself out at the end.",6,2,4,24 August 2007
Tigerland," Joel Schumacher Produced A Great Film As Usual!!
","Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed 'Phone Booth','02, and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT!!  Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),'Intermission','03, gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),'Blue Crush','02, gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),'All The Real Girls','03, showed his true acting skills in the role that he played.   There was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires.  One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Enjoyable and entertaining film to view.",10,2,4,3 April 2004
The Transporter," Transporter Broke the Rules
","Glad I decided to watch this film on TV as I really wanted an action filled film with a great plot and I soon found out this film had everything from Soup to Nuts. Jason Statham,(Frank Martin),'Cellular','04, was a no mess around guy, who did all his work by the book, in other words, Step 1., Step 2., & Step 3. No names mentioned and a prompt delivery of the merchandise and never open up the cargo to be delivered. Frank Martin had a fancy life style and lived in a fabulous home and had great talents in driving a car where no one else would dream of driving. However, Frank made a bad mistake and happened to opened up a bag of hot enjoyment and trouble. In this film there is plenty of action, even romantic and sexy scenes and bloody fights and very fancy steps of self-defense. QI Shu (Lai),'Mei Ren Cao','03, gave a great supporting role to Frank Martin and managed to get him just where she wanted him, flat on his back. If you want to see a really great entertaining film, this flick will never bore you to death.",10,0,3,22 September 2005
28 Days Later...," Lots of Blood on Their Lips !
","Wow, this sure was a very very bloody film, which starts out very calm and quiet, with a guy in a hospital bed and then he finds himself wandering all over London, England. This poor guy winds up meeting another human being, a female who gives him guidance and romance. However, I forgot to mention that there also was a scene in the beginning which dealt with monkeys in a laboratory who seemed to have very bad tempers. All I can say about this picture without making it a SPOILER for everyone is this: It is the most horrifying, blood thirsty film I have seen in a very long time; there are even French Kissing with blood all over the lips and face. This is just a warning!",8,1,3,16 March 2006
Hellboy," Fantastic Film
","Had my doubts if I was going to enjoy this film and once I started viewing this film, my eyes were glued to the TV Screen. Ron Perlman,(Hellboy)'5ive Girls','06 gave an outstanding performance growing up as a small red hell-boy with one large lobster type hand, horns and a nice long tail. Hellboy is protected by some evil forces that want to conquer the entire world, however, Hellboy changes his thinking and starts to have emotions which lead him to become very attracted to this one gal. There are very wild creatures that never seem to stop multiply and Hellboy even gets involved with an egg hunt along with a marine creature that maneuver's under the water. Great entertaining film, don't miss seeing it.",7,1,3,15 August 2006
The Game," Douglas was Outstanding
","Enjoyed watching Michael Douglas,(Nicholas Van Orton), play the role of a very rich man who had everything in the world and a huge mansion that reached to the sky as well as the windows. Nicholas had not seen his brother, Sean Penn, (Conrad Van Orton) for quite a few years and all of a sudden he appears at the front door and goes to dinner with Nicholas and gives him a very very special Birthday Card & Gift; which is not willingly accepted by Nick and it takes him quite a while before he accepts. This gift is something I would not want to receive, however, there are some rewarding experiences which draw people loser together than they had been before. Deborah Kara Unger appears in this film and gave a great supporting role, however, there is no love making in this picture for her. Michael Douglas put his heart and soul into this role and gave an Outstanding performance. Enjoy",8,1,2,17 September 2006
K-19: The Widowmaker," Ford & Neeson Acted Fantastic
","Before I viewed this film, I knew it was going to be a long epic about a Russian Sub and their efforts to secretly create a mission that had many problems among the crew and the officers in charge. Liam Neeson, (Mikhail Poilenin),'Kinsey','04, was the Commanding Officer and went strictly by the book on every decision that had to be made. Mikhail made sure that there was daily drills carry out on the sub and pushed the sub to the very limits and even had a full crew picture taken after some of their great accomplishments. Harrison Ford,(Alexei Vostrikov),'The Devil's Own','97 gave a great supporting role and was loved by the entire crew, which did create many problems for him to make correct decisions in the secret mission. If you love true stories about submarine life and the ways that Russia conducts themselves through out the past and present, this is the film for you.",10,5,8,10 February 2005
The Longest Day," Classic from 1962
","We all have seen a recent picture of 'Saving Private Ryan' and other films depicting the War at Normandy. However, this film is a classic because of all the great actors who appeared in this film and put their hearts and souls into the different roles, Army Privates right up to the Generals's. This film even in black and white is a great film Classic which is worth viewing every once in a while. I remember seeing this film years ago and I think about all those men and women who gave their lives for this country in order to destroy the evils of Adolph Hitler and his wicked country who allowed this man to have such power and control. 'Saving Pivate Ryan' was a great film and broke out hearts but this film is truly a great film classic.",8,2,4,29 September 2007
Meet Joe Black," A Re-make of An Old Movie
","Greatly enjoyed this version of the story and of course the great beauty of Claire Forlani,(Susan Parrish),'The Limit','03. Susan Parrish is the daughter of a very famous business man, Anthony Hopkins,(William Parrish), and is his favorite daughter, who he is very protective of and does not approve of her present boyfriend. Susan meets Brad Pitt,(Joe Black) in a coffee shop and all at once they both seem to be very much attracted to each other, almost like Love At First Sight. It is not long after this encounter with each other that they become face to face in Bill Parrish's large home and are having dinner together, however, Joe Black seems to be a different person. This film deals with Life & Death situations which we all will face some time or other. Entertaining film and very SAD !",7,2,3,7 February 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Morgan Freeman was Outstanding
","If Morgan Freeman, ( Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris) did not appear in this film it would have failed on its face, because he gave the best supporting performance I have ever seen him create. Hilary Swank, (Maggie Fitgerald) put her heart and soul into this role as a prize fighter who climbs to unbelievable heights in the world of women boxing with the great help of both Eddie Dupris and Clint Eastwood,(Frankie Dunn). Frankie Dunn constantly has gone to his church and asked the priest many questions concerning the Catholic Faith and even runs into trouble with the Priest trying to understand his frame of thinking. Frnkie Dunn asks the priest a question that will change the entire mood of the film and put it into a very controversial film concerning Life or Death. Nice film.",10,6,10,21 May 2007
8 Mile," Great Film with Great Realism
","Found this film very entertaining which had a great message to tell about the people who love rap music and the great talent it takes to perform with great style. Eminem, (Jimmy B-Rabbit-Smith Jr.) was well liked by many of his friends in Detroit, Michigan, who worked in an auto parts factory in plastic molding and at the same time was a very good young rapper. Rabbit had many white and black friends as well as an ex gal friend who told him she was pregnant and another Alex, (Brittany Murphy). Rabbit appeared at a rapper contest and when he got up on stage, he froze and was unable to utter a word, which made things bad for him and many people began to talk in bad ways about his being a very poor rapper with words and music. Kim Basinger, (Stephanie Smith) plays the role of Rabbit's mother who lives in a trailer and shows the fact that she has a bad life with her present boyfriend and never seems to have any money. Poor Rabbit has to put up with her boyfriend and at the same time care for his young sister who loves Rabbit very much. Enjoyed the great performance by Mekhi Phifer, (David 'Future' Porter) who gave Rabbit all the support he needed to get a head of this music business. Great film, enjoy.",7,1,3,26 August 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Uma Thurman was Great
","Always enjoy a film that is written and directed by Quentin Tarentino, and if you live in El Paso, Texas or have friends living there, you will instantly become interested in a poor bride who appears to be killed along with the entire wedding party and even a poor old organist/piano player from way back when. The film starts off with plenty of flashbacks, scenes from the past and then the future and it seems that everyone is after a mysterious character named Bill played by David Carradine. Bill is not seen very much in this Vol. 1 picture, but he sure hates people and just can't seem to find love, it very well could be the fact that he never found his true love or did find her and she was not feeling the same way about him. Well directed film and a very interesting film which is full of action with plenty of sword action when you least expect it. Enjoy",10,1,6,19 September 2006
Jerry Maguire," Very Enjoyable Film
","Tom Cruise,(Jerry Maguire), 'Collateral','04, played a sports agent and promoter and was at the top of his career when things started to fall out from under his feet. However, Renee Zellweger,(Dorothy Boyd), 'Cold Mountain', '03, becomes very attracted to Jerry and stands by her man in more ways than one. When Dorothy & Jerry get their lips together there is an instant chemical that sets off a very passionate heat. Cuba Gooding,(Rod Tidwell),'Dirty','05 plays a football player who has seen better days and has plenty of injuries to proof it, but he loves 'His Man', Jerry and sticks with him to the bitter end. The entire cast did a fantastic job and made this a very enjoyable film to enjoy.",5,1,4,19 December 2005
Quiz Show," A 1950's Scandal
","Hats off to director Robert Redford who produced this film about a true story which occurred in the 1950's and involved a game show where questions where answered and to one person the answers where given. Game shows were a great thing to early Television and over fifty million people watch this show and saw Herbie Stempel, (John Turturo) and Ralph Fiennes, (Charles Van Doren) compete in a quiz contest and this went on for quite a long time and when it ended Charles Van Doren was the winner. There was an investigation into this show because rumors were starting to circulate and Van Doren was even going to tell his father, Mark Van Doren, (Paul Scofield) that he was fed the answers to questions but he just was not able to tell the complete truth. Of course there is a big investigation and the public eventually finds out the complete truth. Great acting by Ralph Fiennes and Paul Scofield. Entertaining film.",8,1,1,4 February 2008
The Mummy Returns," Great Entertaining Film
","This is a film full of action, romance, and horrible situations you can only experience in nightmares or your greatest fears. There are bits of comedy with a small boy who manages to get himself deeply involved with a Scorpion bracelet and fits in quite well with this thriller of a story. Brendon Fraser, (Rich) sort of plays second fiddle to Rachel Weisz ,(Evelyn) who seems to handle the Scorpion King with no problems. If you hate looking at scorpions, you will definitely have your share and some might be larger than you plan to deal with in this film. Excellent production but rather too long and drawn out at times, but worth viewing.",7,0,2,26 December 2005
There's Something About Mary," Lots of Good Laughs
","This film was very entertaining, starting out with Ben Stiller,(Ted Stroehmann), 'Meet The Fockers','04, protecting a retarded child from being picked on and then speaking to a high school girl about going to the prom. Then, all of a sudden the most beautiful girl in high school winds up asking Ted if he would like to go to the prom. The beautiful girl being, Cameron Diaz, (Mary Jensen), 'Gangs of New York','02. Matt Dillon,(Pat Healy),'Wild Thing','98, is assigned to look into the private life of Mary Jensen after she is gone for over thirteen (13) years and living in Florida as a doctor. There is lots of great comedy and romantic scenes and nice shots of Cameron Diaz in her bra and panties, showing her very Slim and Trim body through an open window to her bedroom. Great entertaining film and great acting by the entire cast. Enjoy",7,0,2,13 February 2006
Saw," Strange Film
","If you like blood and gore and the most unexpected things displayed on the big screen, this is the film for you. The story starts off with a surgeon and a photographer who are placed in a horrible dirty bathroom with urinals along with filthy toilets and these guys are chained to steel posts and are given instructions by their captive. This person is a deranged, sadistic serial killer who plays all sorts of games with his victims and forces them into a real struggle to survive from their captivity. The victims of this madman have to fight to win their lives back, or die in trying. This is a crazy film which really makes no sense at all and you could avoid viewing viewing this film.",8,2,5,18 November 2007
The Last Samurai," Outstanding Film Production
","Found this film held my interest from beginning to the very end despite plenty of complaints by the Reviews of the local newspapers and media. Tom Cruise,(Nathan Algren),'War of the Worlds','05 played the role of a Civil War Captain who is enlisted by the Japanese Government to train their men in order to build up their army and Nathan gets mixed up with the Samurai who would love to chop his head off after he kills one of their great Warrior's. Koyuki,(Toka),'Spy Sorge','03 was the wife of this warrior and Nathan Algren becomes very close to her and her children and sparks do fly between them. Toka is very beautiful and gave a great supporting role. This film gives you a picture of Civil War fighting only in Japan and the Japanese Army fights the Samurai with old out-dated equipment vs. cannon's. Very entertaining film and worth your time to view.",8,1,3,19 June 2006
From Hell," Different Jack the Ripper Film
","This is definitely a great horror film which gives in great detail the actual facts of what Jack the Ripper did to his victims back in the Year 1888 which terrified all of London. This story of Jack the Ripper is different in many ways because it involves an Inspector Frederick Abberline, (Johnny Depp) who is in charge of the investigation of the Ripper and centers his attention to four London prostitutes who are being eliminated by the cruel knife of the Ripper. Mary Kelley, (Heather Graham) is one of these prostitutes and the Inspector Abberline begins to fall in love with her and does everything he can to protect her. You will never be able to figure out who the Ripper is until almost the very end of this film and the ending could never be any better. If you like horror films and missed this one, it is a must see with plenty of blood and gore.",7,0,1,4 December 2007
National Treasure," Wall Street & Trinity Church
","This film goes back in history to the Declaration of Independence and a treasure hunter named Ben Gates, (Nicolas Cage) who decides to steal the Declaration of Independence which has a key to secret treasure which can be revealed on the back of the Declaration and leads to all kinds of clues. Ben Gates manages to get himself involved with Abigail Chase, (Diane Kruger) who works in a building in Washington, D.C. which houses the Declaration of Independence and is able to take complete control of the Declaration and finds the invisible map on the map of this document which indicates it has dealings with free masons or the Knights Templar and an eye over a pyramid clearly shows that the masons have a hidden treasures which leads to Broadway and Wall Street in New York City.",7,0,2,17 November 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Lawrence Tierney Gave a Great Performance!
","This film is truly a great classic film and all the actors gave a realistic and down to earth performance. However, this was really a great come back film for Lawrence Tierney, who had to fight a very powerful chemical dependency which prevented him from becoming a greater film actor than he was given credit for.  In my estimation, this was Tierney's Hollywood Oscar for his role playing 'Joe Cabot'.  He will always be remembered as a great ' John Dillinger' 1945!",10,1,3,13 October 2003
The Great Raid," Horrors of the Japs During WW II
","This word today about the JAPS sounds very cruel and offensive to the Japanese people, but during the War Years during WW II in the Pacific this word was used in most American Newspapers and spoken about during this horrible war with a nation that killed and raped many people in Nanking, China. In this film many of U.S. Service Men are trapped in a Japanese Concentration Camp who inflicted horrible tortures and slaughter hundreds of American Soldiers and women who are treated worse than animals. America makes every effort to find these lost prisoners of war and is horrified how the Japanese soldiers treated our people and make a great effort to free all these prisoners. However, it took many men and women lives in order to accomplish this mission. This is a great picture which still remembers all the men and women who gave their lives to fight back at the mistreatment of American soldiers. GREAT FILM.",7,6,8,29 September 2007
Pretty Woman," Julia & Gere Burned Up the Screen
","Never got a chance to see this film from beginning to end and I must say, Julia Roberts,(Vivian Ward),'Closer','04 played the role of a hooker and put her complete heart and soul into this role. Julia was comical, dramatic and very sexy to say the very least. Richard Gere,(Edward Lewis),'Shall We Dance','64, decides to pick up Vivian Ward on Hollywood Blvd., and takes her to the best Hotel in town and the both of them get very much involved with each other. The big scene is when he finally kisses her on the lips and the steamy heat blows up on the screen. Ralph Bellamy,(James Morse),'Rosemary's Baby','68, played a business man in this picture and made this his final film, going to the big screen in the Sky. Ralph Bellamy was a veteran actor from the early 20's, 30's & 40's. If you missed this film, make sure to see it the next time it is on TV. The music is fantastic and you will remember these songs like they were yesterday.",10,6,13,23 October 2005
Hoosiers," Danville, Illinois Classic Star
","Over the years I missed this film starring Gene Hackman,(Coach, Norman Dale),'Heartbreakers','01, a true story about a small high school in Indiana who struggle with many ups and downs and are considered one of the worst teams in the Hoosier State. Coach Norman seeks the help of an old pro at Basketball, who is a burned out drunk who goes on and off the wagon and needs to dry out most of the time. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if this team will ever amount to anything. However, the town people are big supportive fans and do get tired and discussed with their coach and have a local meeting in a town church. There are lots of scenes showing plenty of corn fields and even some romance is squeezed in between games. Gene Hackman was born in Danville, Illinois, near the Indiana border where all you can see for miles is corn fields not far from Champaign, Illinois where the University of Illinois is located. Gene fit in perfectly with this film and it was great entertainment.",8,0,0,13 May 2006
The Untouchables," ROBERT DE NIRO NOT CONVINCING AS CAPONE!!
","Love Robert De Niro' Analyze That''02, in almost every film that he every made, however, as a big time crook like Al Capone, he fell short of portraying him on screen.  He over acted and made you think Al Capone was a spoiled BRAT! (He was more than that!)  Kevin Costner(Eliot Ness) 'Dragonfly' '02, stole the entire picture along with Sean Connery (Jim Malone)'Playing By Heart' '98 as a Chicago cop who turned Treasury Agent and gave Eliot Ness all the support he could in order to  capture BIG AL!   This was a great entertaining film with lots of action, but Al Capone was made to look like a pussy cat!",10,0,5,31 August 2003
Mystic River," Great Picture/ Great Ending
","Clint Eastwood sure turned out a great picture with outstanding acting by the entire cast. However, Sean Penn,(Jimmy Markum) put his heart and soul deep into his character and over powered the entire picture from beginning to the very end. Kevin Bacon,(Sean Devine), played a very calm and wise detective who grew up in the Boston city area and knew most of the people, especially a young boy who was taken for an unfortunate ride in a car. Laurence Fishburne, (Sgt. Whitey Powers) was a partner with Sean Devine and they both had some real problems to solve involving a young girl and plenty of suspects. Simply loved the way this picture ended, and I applaud Clint Eastwood for great dramatic art work on the silver screen.",6,2,4,26 October 2006
A Beautiful Mind," OUTSTANDING ACTING & PHOTOGRAPHY!
","This was a great film concerning a talented young man who developed a mental condition which greatly interfered with his career and many gifts that he would have been normally able to give to the entire world and the world of mathematics.  Russell Crowe(John Nash),'Proof of Life',2000, put his heart and soul into this role and made you wonder just how his life would eventually end.   Jennifer Connelly(Alicia Larde Nash),'Hulk','03, was very beautiful and gave a wonderful supporting role. This John Nash story will keep you glued to the screen and it is a great master piece of acting for Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly.  The photography and flash backs to the 1940's was done to great perfection! Don't miss this film!!",10,2,6,27 May 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Knockout of a Picture
","Always enjoyed viewing Angelina Jolie, (Jane Smith) who is very beautiful and sexy and also Brad Pitt, (John Smith) and his great acting skills in many pictures. This picture surprised me with plenty of action between a husband and wife who are involved with undercover operations and are in one way or other are hit man and woman. There is also romance combined with plenty of explosions going off and plenty of fights going on between husband and wife. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie gave outstanding performances together and captured my interest from the very beginning to the very end of the film. Angelina put her heart and soul into this role and you can see how she kept up with everything Brad could throw at her. Great film, enjoy.",6,5,11,18 January 2009
Man on Fire," Great Film with a Great Cast of Actors
","As soon as I find out that Denzel Washington is going to be in a film, I know that I will be glued to the TV Screen. Denzel Washington, (Creasy), 'Out of Town', plays the role of a burned out crime stopper who likes to drink. Creasy finally locates employment from a friend, Christopher Walken,(Rayburn),'Domino' who suggests he become a bodyguard for Dakota Fanning,(Pita) who is a young girl from a wealthy family and her mother Radha Mitchell,(Lisa) seeks this protection because of some kidnapping in the area. This film takes you from El Paso, Texas all through out Mexico and Mexico City along with plenty of shady characters and blood thirsty crooks. Dakota Fanning gives an outstanding performance and will someday become a great super star. Very enjoyable film.",8,2,4,18 December 2006
Scream 2," Great Entertaining Film!
","Scream #1 was fantastic, however, Scream #2 was able to keep my eyes glued to the screen and was able to have me guessing just how all these killings were being accomplished.  David Arquette ( 'Dewey' Riley), 'Never Die Alone,''04 put all his great acting talents into this film along with Courteney Cox,(Gale Weathers),'November''04 who portrayed a TV newscaster trying to get the big story about all these horrible murders.  If you love a real scary film with plenty of BLOOD, this is the film for YOU! ENJOY, especially on Halloween. Some of the gals were very attractive and you just hated to see them get stabbed to DEATH!  If it were not for the great acting of David Arquette and Courteney Cox, this film would be a real downer.",10,0,1,9 June 2004
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Subway Car on the Platform
","Greatly enjoyed this film which had the New York City Police going uptown and downtown and lots of action even in Wall Street, the financial section. There was a famous department store on Fifth Ave which had plenty of damage and also a very wild ride through Central Park with Jackson and Willis. Bruce Willis, (John McClane), 'Hostage','05 played a sort of washed up detective who loved his booze and had many hangovers through out the entire picture. Samuel L. Jackson, (Zeus Carver), 'The Man','05 gave an outstanding performance as a store owner in Harlem who managed to get roped into a big mess along with John McClane. Of course, I cannot forget that Jeremy Irons, (Simon Gruber), 'Casanova','05, enjoyed playing a child's game named: 'SIMON SAYS' and believe me this was not a game for kids in this film. Sit back and enjoy a great film and great actors all doing a fantastic job.",7,0,0,5 April 2006
Ray," Outstanding Film
","Always enjoyed the great talents of Ray Charles during the 60's and especially his other great hits during his career. However, I never realized all the horrible hardships he faced being blind and how strong an influence his mother played in giving him the strength to get through his life and stand up tall and proud. This is truly a great picture which has many flashbacks and shows in detail every aspect of Ray Charles life, including his love of women and heroin addiction which he utilized most of his life. However, despite his faults he gave America great music and outstanding songs we will long remember. Jamie Foxx,(Ray Charles) gave one of the best performance I have seen in a very long time. A film you will want to view over and over again.",8,1,2,25 February 2007
Blow," Great True Story
","Johnny Depp, (George Jung),'The Libertine','04 played an eager young guy who wanted to out do his father in many ways in life, especially making more money and satisfying his wife. When George Jung was growing up, his father and mother always fought about not enough money and his mom seemed to always dominate his poor dad. Penelope Cruz,'Sahara','05, played the wife of George and was a complete knock out with her good looks and great acting skills. George Jung hit the top of his chosen career with rooms filled with millions of dollars and lots of white powder to blow up the nostrils. If you like pictures dealing with drugs and the outcome of enjoying this junk, this is the picture for you. Johnny Depp, gave an outstanding performance and put his heart and soul into this role.",8,0,1,13 March 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant Acting
","This film is shown almost on a daily basis on TV and I never had the chance to finally see the ending of this picture. Jodie Foster,(Clarice Starling),'Sommersby','93, was an FBI Agent who had great insight into a killer's mind and also had some very dark secrets about Lambs which seemed to drive her crazy. Clarice had a difficult assignment from the FBI to look into the brain of Anthony Hopkins,(Dr. Hannibal Lecter),'The Human Stain','03, who was a mental patient and had some very valuable information the FBI needed in order to capture a horrible killer. The acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were outstanding in making this a 'Thrill-A- Diller' of a film story.",10,3,5,20 April 2005
Any Given Sunday," Geat Al Pacino Picture
","If you like football and Al Pacino,(Tony D'Amato) who was the coach and had great influence over his men and always seemed to fight like cats and dogs with Cameron Diaz, (Christina Pagniacei). Christina had very little faith in Tony's coaching and being the owner of the team was out to stop every decision Tony made for his team players and their various team positions. There is a final game which brings a great deal of tension for everyone and this is fantastic, it keeps the audience spellbound with who is going to make the final touchdown. All the actors did an outstanding job and made this film a great success for football fans and Al Pacino.",7,0,1,19 February 2007
Blade Runner," Looking Forward to Year 2019
","Being a big fan of Harrison Ford, I just can't imagine missing the re-runs on TV of this film. Harrison Ford,(Rick Deckard),'Sabrina','95, plays a retired cop. Rick is called back into action to catch some very bad Robots and a pretty sex one that has plenty of muscle in all the right places and really puts Rick Deckard on his butt. Daryl Hannah, (Pris),'The Job','03 tries to convince Rick that she is not programed and can actually cry and also be very sexy and romantic along with having a MOM years ago. WOW! I was amazed at the production and direction of this film in the 1980's and found it to be a classic film a head of it's times. Great film and good acting was performed by all the supporting cast. I really hope things will be a lot better in the Year 2019 than this film tried to portray.",10,0,1,7 August 2005
Ben-Hur," Ben-Hur'59 vs. The Passion of Jesus Christ '04
","Have not viewed 'Ben Hur' since it first came out in 1959, and was thrilled by the great acting of Charlton Heston,(Judah Ben-Hur),'Any Given Sunday','99. Heston, portrayed a Jewish man beaten down by the Roman's and even his best friend turned against him and he was a slave on a ship, rowing himself to death.  This film was a Hollywood production, but it showed the great Passion of Jesus Christ in different ways that all the family could enjoy, both YOUNG and OLD, were able to view this picture without any:- SHOCK FACTORS!  You could actually see Jesus carrying his CROSS and also hanging on the CROSS which was graphic enough for me!  Sam Jaffe,(Simonides),'Ben Casey','61 tv series, gave an outstanding supporting role to this picture along with Stephen Boyd(Messala),'Kill','72, who passed away early in life and Martha Scott(Miriam),'Sayonara','57.   Future pictures like this one should be created with more details given to the Life Of Jesus and his great healing powers and the great influence He had while he was living briefly on this earth!",10,1,3,27 February 2004

Before Sunrise," EXTREMELY DEEP & WONDERFUL LOVE STORY !
","It was by accident that I was scanning the TV channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other.   Ethan Hawke (Jesse) 'Tape' '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) 'ER' 94 TV Series (Nicole).  This gal and guy, will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years.  Jesse and Celine have great conversation, and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them.  I am looking forward to the SEQUEL to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film, you will feel the same way.",10,114,151,16 October 2003
Identity," Made Me Think About the Bates Motel !
","John Cusack,(Ed), 'Max','02, played a very mysterious part as Cop, Medic,driver, and all around handy man who tried his best to keep everything under control in a way out Motel. All sorts of people seemed to wind up at this motel and for some reason, their numbered motel keys wound up all over the place. The film starts out with a bunch of head shrinks asking questions of a certain person and you do get glimpse of what he looks like, but the face will soon vanish from your memory. Amanda Peet,(Paris),'A Lot of Love','05, gives a great supporting role and puts on a very hot performance through out the entire picture. Clea DuVall,(Ginny),'The Grudge','04, was very cute in this picture, being a newlywed and telling her husband she was pregnant in their wonderful Motel Suite. Clea DuVall sounded and looked like Jorga Fox, of CSI Vegas, when she was very young. Ginny played a rather short role, but added a great deal to this CRAZY story. This film is like a Merry-go-ground and never seems to stop, but it is very entertaining. Enjoy.",8,7,13,27 October 2005
X2: X-Men United," This X 2 Out Shined the Original
","The entire production was first class and all the actors did outstanding acting. The effects of seeing a dam on the verge of possible destruction in the high snow covered mountains with a helicopter hovering over head, kept me spellbound. When I viewed the original X 2 film, I was very impressed and found to my great delight than more funds were put into this production and the cast of credits is endless. The outfits on the gals was super and very very sexy, skin type outfits, with very skinny bodies as the weapons fired away and also killing a very brave gal who stood her ground to the bitter END! Forgot to mention the devilish looking creatures who had tails like a devil did a nice job on the so called good guys.",9,1,4,12 January 2006
The Producers," Great 1968 Classic Comedy
","Mel Brooks produced a great comedy with plenty of laughs about two guys named Max Bialystock, (Zero Mostel) and Leo Bloom, (Gene Wilder) who both decided to produce a Broadway Play and try to turn it into an instant flop in order to make themselves rich. Max played a con game with older women in order to swindle them of their money by having them invest in his Broadway Plays. The name of the play they produce is called 'Springtime for Hitler & Germany and they are both sure the public will never view and accept this film which glorifies Adolph Hitler. There is a very sexy dancing gal named Ulla, (Lee Meredith) who gives a great supporting role which put a spark in the eyes of Max and Leo. Estelle Winwood, ('Hold Me Touch Me') gave a great supporting role as one of the old ladies that furnished her funds to finance the Broadway Play, Estelle was a veteran comedy actress during the 1930's and 40's. If you want to laugh throughout the entire film, this is the film for you.",10,2,4,4 July 2008
Hart's War," A Film Something Like 'STALAG 17'!
","Enjoyed the great acting of Bruce Willis,(Col.William A. McNamara),'Tears of the Sun','03, who did his very best to carry this entire picture on his back. McNamara was the senior officer in a German POW camp during WW II and was determined not to waste his time just sitting around in the prison camp and was able to utilize the officers and enlisted men to carry out a very important plan to destroy a Nazi installation. It is almost impossible to even believe that the Nazi's during WW II, would ever have agreed to having a court trial for murder. If you liked 'STALAG 17' with William Holden, this film is quite similar and gives you some idea what POW's went through during the BIG WAR. Believe me, it was nothing like this picture portrayed it, AT ALL! It Was a Living HELL!!!",10,9,18,18 October 2004
The Great Escape," Great Steve McQueen Film
","This film deals with POW's who are sent to a new German prison camp with very tight security mainly because most of these POW's were all professional escape artists who have dug tunnels from many other German camps or simply escaped by climbing over fences and many other ways of escape. Steve MacQueen, (Capt. Hilts,) was also called 'The Cooler King' because he always wound up in solitary confinement which was called the Cooler. James Garner, (Flight Lt. Hendley) was called the 'Scounger' because he could obtain all kinds of necessary items in order to make escapes, like forged identification and many other items. Charles Bronson, (Flight Lt. Donny Velinski) was called the 'Tunnel King' because he was great for making all kinds of tunnels. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat and the entire picture is not spent in the prison camp. There is great photography throughout Bavaria, Germany and Munich, Bavaria and great scenes with Steve MacQueen riding his bike and James Garner flying a German Training plane. Don't miss this film, it is great.",10,1,3,23 February 2008
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," VAMPIRE PICTURE TOPS ALL VAMP PICS !
","Viewed many vampire pictures throughout the years, and this Vampire picture portrayed the evil, lust, horror, murder and lots of blood drinking and passonate bitting with very beautiful women.  Tom Cruise (Lestat de Lioncourt) ' Minority Report''02 and Brad Pitt (Louis de Pointe du Lac), 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind''02 both showed their great acting skills and could almost make you sick to your stomach with all the gory details.  If you really want to see a fantastic VAMPIRE FILM, which will make Lugosi look meek and mild, watch this film for Halloween!",10,2,5,7 October 2003
Saboteur," Grreat Hitchcock Classic
","Enjoyed this great Alfred Hitchcock film starring Robert Cummings, (Barry Kane) and Priscilla Lane, (Pat Martin) along with Otto Kruger, (Charles Tobin) This story is about Barry Kane who works in a aircraft factory during the war and encounters a serious fire that breaks out in his plant and he hands a fire-extinguisher to his friend in order to try and stop the fire and it becomes a raging fire ball of flames. The man is killed and Barry is investigated by the police. Barry realizes he is going to be held responsible for this crime and decides to take off on some serious leads he has as to who the real saboteur is. He runs into a man who is blind and has a daughter named Pat Martin, (Priscilla Lane) who wants to turn him over to the police. This story becomes very involved as Barry tries to find out who is really responsible for this horrible crime.",7,1,2,22 March 2008
Windtalkers," Great WW I I Film in the Pacific
","There have been many pictures produced and directed during the World War II years in black and white dealing with Japan and Germany; however, this film clearly showed the hand to hand combat soldiers fighting the Japanese. The United States Marines lost many men fighting to capture the Japanese Islands in the Pacific. This is a great film which portrays how the Native American Indian played a strong role as Radiomen who were able to speak a different language that the Japanese were unable to understand. Nicolas Cage,(Sergeant Joe Enders) gave a outstanding performance as a Veteran Marine who was badly injured in other war missions and decided to go back and finish the job he started out to accomplish. Great War Film and lots of action through out the entire film.",7,0,3,22 May 2006
Braveheart," Gibson made a Masterpiece
","Greatly enjoyed this story and the great photography throughout Scotland and its beautiful landscape of green pastures as far as your eye can see. However, their was plenty of blood shed on the battlefields and a very realistic view of how battles where fought many years ago in England and Scotland. Mel Gibson portrayed a great William Wallace who was deeply in love with a woman he knew immediately was going to be his soul mate and the King of England had other plans for this relationship as England had complete control over Scotland and had the idea that every newly married Scotish bride was to be shared with an Englishman and integrated their blood relations in order to break down the struggle of Scotland wanting to be free from England. There film is full of wonderful surprises and their is a strong romantic theme running behind all the blood and gore.",10,3,8,25 June 2007
The Breakfast Club," Judd Nelson & Molly Ringwald Made this A Classic Film !
","Happened to be in the neighborhood of Glenbrook H.S. in Illinois where the high school filming location was being completed and it sort of made me want to see this film over and over again.  We all know that such events in high school are quite mild and not very realistic compared to the high school killings throughout the country.   Judd Nelson (John Bender) 'The Cabin By the Lake' 2000' gave an outstanding performance which launched his great acting career, I was always amazed by his great style of acting, he can do almost anything he is given to perform.   Molly Ringwald (Claire Standish) 'Cut' 2000, gave a great supporting role, with all kinds of sexual abuse being directed to her by John Bender, even looking up her skirt and making demeaning slander to her character for being a Virgin.   This is truly a classic film by today's standards and should never be put under a microscope and picked apart. Just sit back, lighten UP and enjoy an old time High School tale about a bunch of BRATS!",10,1,2,27 September 2003
Gladiator," Plenty of Action & Excitement
","The ' Gladiator' did not sound like a film that I would enjoy, however, this film was full of action scenes and great photography. Russell Crowe(Maximus),'Proof of Life',2000, played an excellent role as the General of the Roman Army and the battle scenes and weapons used in those early A.D. ages was extremely well done. Maximus was well loved by the Roman soldiers as well as Ceasar. Connie Nielsen,(Lucilla),'Basic','03, was the daughter of Ceasar and was a former lover of Maximus. There are a great deal of twists and turns in this story concerning Maximus and he eventually has the great task of fighting among Gladiators. There are great tones hinting about possible incest between a sister and her brother and very little romance. However, this film will take you way back in History and show in great detail war tactics from the past.",10,1,5,12 March 2005
Contact," Long Drawn Out Film
","Always enjoy Jodie Foster's acting and in this film she plays a scientist, (Eleanor Arroway) who loves all the stars in the sky and planets and is hopeful of finding aliens who live on other planets. Eleanor since she was a little girl was interested in the sky and her father, Ted Arroway, (David Morse),'Taxi TV Series' encouraged his daughter and gave her everything possible to increase her knowledge. Eleanor lost her mother in child birth and then her father dies when she is only nine years of age. Eleanor studies and advances her knowledge where she gains great support from the United States Government. This story is very long and at times becomes rather boring, however, there is great entertainment with great graphics and by the way, Eleanor does reach her goal, but being an atheist causes her to have many problems.",8,0,2,25 February 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A FILM WITH COMEDY, DRAMA, ROMANCE AND A RELIGIOUS MESSAGE!
","For some reason I missed this film in 1989, but attended a function recently, where Clergy recommended this film for all to see and learn some great lesson's of faith shown in this film.   Harrison Ford,(Prof. Henry Indiana Jones, Jr.,'What Lies Beneath'02 performs one of his greatest roles just like an Errol Flynn, shooting three people with one bullet. Indiana Jones also falls in love with a sexy Nazi gal, Allison Doody,(Dr. Elsa Schneider), 'View to a Kill''85 and has a very torrid kissing scene that leads to much more!  Sean Connery, (Prof. Henry Jones, Sr.)'Entrapment''99 also seems to have shared the same bed with Dr. Elsa Schneider, who really was after a diary.   All these people in the movie were seeking the religious cup that Jesus used at the Last Supper.  Indiana Jones Jr., learned that he had to have a heart that was humble and full of Faith and Kindness in his spiritual soul in order to find the actual Chalice.  This is a great BELIEVABLE FILM, because of the deep serious message it has to offer all viewers of the 21 Century!   Look for the deep message this film has for you!  Professor Henry Jones, Sr., was asked what he learned about the Chalice used by Jesus and he said,' ILLUMINATION' ! This is probably what the clergy was taking about and the great message this film has for everyone, in COMEDY, DRAMA AND A DEEP MORALE LESSON to take away from this fantastic film.",10,0,4,30 August 2003
Cinderella Man," The Big Fight Era
","Heard my grandfather talk about Jim Braddock and what a real down to earth man he was living in New Jersey and this film is truly a great tribute to a down on his luck prize fighter who had a second chance and even fought with the great Joe Lewis. Jim Braddock was played by Russell Crowe and he did one of the best performance I have ever seen, along with the great acting performed by Renee Zellweger as his wife Mae Braddock. There were many great boxers during those years, Willie Peppe, Jack Dempsey, John L. Sullivan, Joe Lewis and the list goes on, but Jim Braddock was truly a great person in real life and a true Champion of the Boxing Profession. Fantastic film to ENJOY",10,1,3,9 February 2007
Jurassic Park," Enjoyed this Film
","Viewed this film years ago and forgot everything about the film and I enjoyed viewing this film the second time around. The film starts out with Dr. Alan Grant, (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler, (Laura Dern) who are all excited because they have found the remains of a large dinosaur skeleton. A Dr. Ian Malcolm, (Richard Attenborough) meets up with this couple and suggests they visit his theme park which has great surprises for these people who are so interested in the study of dinosaur's. As soon as Dr. Alan and Dr. Ellie realize that this theme park has actual living dinosaur's, they are both delighted and learn that he is cloning them for his theme park and how Dr. Ian intends to display all these creatures for the general public and other scientists who want to enjoy his great accomplishments. However, things get a bit out of control and that is when this film becomes a complete horror you will never forget. Enjoy.",8,2,4,7 January 2008
Beetlejuice," Excellent Comedy
","Enjoyed this film and the great acting by Alec Baldwin, (Adam) and Geena Davis, (Barbara) who are a married young couple who move into a home they are very happy with and they are both deeply in love with each other and are kissing each other all the time. One day they have to go into town and buy groceries and on their return trip they try to avoid a little dog in the road and the car runs through the side of a red covered bridge and at this point the picture makes a different change. After a little while Adam and Barbara realize they have died and someone else is moving into their home and they are not very happy about this event and decided to become ghosts to scare the family away. Michael Keaton, (Beattlejucie) gives a great supporting role along with veteran actress Sylvia SIdney, (June), Robert Goulet, (Maxie Dean) and Dick Cavett, (Bernard) Great entertaining film from beginning to end.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," John Goodman & Charles Durning Stole the SHOW!!!
","This Chain Gang Classic film, brought back memories from the past.  I remember traveling in the South and seeing these men in chains along the side of the road and thought what a horrible punishment in the hot steamy sun and the great physical pain the men had to endure. George Clooney(Ulysses Everett McGill) along with John Turturro(Pete) gave excellent drama and comedy with their great acting skills.  However, John Goodman(Big Dan Teague) with a one-eyed patch and a suppose to be 'Bible Salesman' gave some good punches to Ulysses over a picnic lunch.   Charles Durning (Gov. Pappy) shook his big round bottom along with Ulysses to all the Western Tunes and even cut a Top Hit Country Western Song.   This is a must see Classic film which will keep you guessing through-out the entire film.",10,1,1,18 August 2003
