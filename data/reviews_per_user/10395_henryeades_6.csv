The Avengers," A Fantastic Fun Film
",My other favourite superhero film(s) are those of the Dark Knight Trilogy and as they are so dark it's nice to watch a film which is more light hearted. Although verging on corny the humour was good and the story gripping although fairly standard. The character relationships are great and Mark Ruffalo is particularly good as the Hulk. All the acting is pretty secure and the effects good. All the actors suit their roles and bring together a successful film on a group of heroes (sounds easier than it is). The score is great and the only problem being that the story isn't as innovative as it could be but that's not to worry as your still In for thrilling watch!,8,1,4,14 April 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Entertaining but no Lord of the Rings
","I went into the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey knowing full well what Peter Jackson and his team had to live up to. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the Lord of the Rings because in my opinion the book isn't as good but the film impressed me none the less.The acting was tremendous and as so many have said: Martin Freeman was born to play Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen delivered once again but the real star of the show had to be Andy Serkis. The scene with Gollum was funny, effective and a great insight into the character.Although some of the first scenes with Radagast the Brown were unnecessary it was good to see the rise of the 'necromancer' at Dol Guldor.My only complaints are: Why is white orc needed? He did feature in the appendixes like Radagast but not in such an important role, in the film he merely serves to have an evil villain before the introduction of Smaug.Nonetheless this is a great film and anyone who enjoyed Lord of the Rings should see it therefore earning a well deserved 8/10",6,2,5,14 April 2013
The Dark Knight," Perfect Batman Film
","Perfect is a word I never use when talking about films but this breaks the rule. Here are my top reasons for giving this a solid 10/10.1.) Acting. All the acting in the film is great, Aaron Eckharts troubled Harvey Dent really allows us to see how easy it is to fall into evil. Christian Bale not only gives us a good Batman but a good Bruce Wayne as well, Michael Caine is forever excellent as Alfred and Gary Oldman does really well portraying the tough Jim Gordon. However Heath Ledger is the star of the show as the Joker. He gives us an insane, disturbing character who seems very real and very, very evil. His performance is in my mind the best portrayal of character in film EVER! 2.) Story. The story is full of exciting twists and links to the comic books. There are no plot holes and the story rockets from action scene to action scene however the bits in between are still interesting and develop the characters really well.3.) Effects/Props. The effects on this film are great from the chase through Gotham to the machines and make up. The new Bat Suit is better than the already good one in Batman Begins and the final battle scene is very very well done.So overall this film although being almost 3 hours is engrossing the the last minute. Everything from the dialogue to the prosthetics to score seems to hit the target.",10,2,5,14 April 2013
Avatar," Pretty average once you get over the CGI
",I must admit... the first time I saw this at the cinema I was blown away. But when I watched it on DVD I realised how unspectacular the film really is beyond the surface. Sure the CGI is great but the story is poor. Here are my main reasons for giving a 5/10.1.) Poor plot. Yes I know! It was copied but bypassing it as an interpretation it is still poor. Compared to Camerons previous works such as Aliens and the first 2 Terminators which have great story lines this is dreadful.2.) Acting. The acting is fairly average and not worthy of breaking the box office records. Apart from Stephen Lang as Colenal Quaritch that is.3.) General mistakes. How do the primitive Na'vi speak perfect English in excellent accents when they don't negotiate? How do those mountains fly? How do an army of small dragons beat gunships? I'll leave you to think of those and although this movie isn't complete rubbish it isn't as special as it's made out to be!,4,2,4,14 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A very good ending to an outstanding trilogy
",I went to see this with the knowledge that it could not surpass the Dark Knight but it did a good job and trying to. Again as throughout the trilogy the acting was great as was the story and directing. Tom Hardy created an excellent Bane and Anne Hathaways Catwoman. There were only 2 problems with this film:1.) Not enough Batman or Gordon. Although there was plenty of Bruce Wayne I would have liked to have seen a bit more of Batman at work as a detective as he did in the Dark Knight. Gordon spent a lot of time in the hospital when again it would have been good to explore his character a bit more after the death of Harvey Dent.2.) Miranda Tate really being Talia was too much of a surprise there should have been a bit more of hinting to it earlier on in the film before and Batman was defeated by Bane.Other than those 2 picky things the film really finished the trilogy well.,8,3,5,14 April 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Satisfactory but didn't live up to its potential
","I went into Deathly Hallows Part 2 excited the book (mainly the second half) was fantastic and Part 1 had been fairly loyal to the novel.The film started off well with the escape from Gringotts being well shot and written. However things began to spiral from then (30 minutes). Harry's return to Hogsmeade was OK although there was no mention about the wailing being a caterwhauling charm.I recognise that although the scene when Harry confronts Snape in the great hall is pretty epic I was sad that the Ravenclaw common room scene had been cut and McGonagall's duel with Snape was too quick.Then came the battle, this was what disappointed me. It was all too much Harry and skipped a lot of it especially Fred's death scene, Neville with all the plants and the inclusion of Kreacher and the centaurs.The scene with Dumbledore at Kings Cross was great but it was a shame Dumbeledore's back story was ignored throughout the final 2 films as in my opinion it's one of the more important parts of the story.The final duel with Voldemort was exciting and epic but I was really disappointed by the lack of the final battle in the hall where all the different characters take down various death eaters. It would have also been cool to have seen Kingsley, Slughorn and McGonagall duel with Voldemort. This would have added more screen time for characters other than Harry, Ron and Hermione who dominated the film a bit too much. I don't know if the final confrontation wasn't included to stop the good characters 'killing' the Death Eaters as Bellatrix's and Voldemorts 'confetti' deaths showed that.The epilogue was well shot although it's a shame Teddy Lupin was not mentioned properly. The CGI throughout the film was good especially on the Dragon and Ralph Fiennes' acting as Voldemort was great.This gets a solid 7/10 due to good acting and effects but unfortunately the story lets it down.",6,0,1,14 April 2013
