The New World," beauty in the boring
","Watching this film is like walking through an art gallery with faint poetry playing in the background. I enjoyed it, it was beautiful, I stopped and pondered the beauty of it, and I wanted to leave before the two hour tour ended, but felt as if by doing so, I was somehow insulting the art. It is a captivating, beautiful experience that you wish you could bring home to put on your wall so that you could look at it briefly whenever you liked, but it is not an entertaining film. The plot is secondary to the cinematography, as well as a very familiar tale that nearly everyone already knows. If I had never seen the end, I would have been satisfied, if had never seen the beginning, I would have been satisfied. In fact, I wish that I had only seen half of it.",10,2,5,17 April 2007
