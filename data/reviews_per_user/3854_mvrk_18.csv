First Man," What sort of idiotic ending was that???
","Ok, so no spoilers here, as we all know Neil Armstrong goes to the moon and then comes back.People are complaining that the acting was very robotic and the viewer can't get any attachment with the characters on screen blah blah. I really won't go there. Also basically Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy had one facial expression throughout the movie.But the ending was so bad that it proves all the critics to be true. If you don't want to know the abrupt end scene when Neil Armstrong comes back to Earth don't read any further..........so Neil Armstrong comes back to Earth, and then just stares at his wife with and she stares right back at him, both with the same expressionless faces, and then The End. I mean what the heck?",4,2,4,19 October 2018
The Irishman," A last hurrah before the end.
","This doesn't give you the rush after you've seen Casino or Goodfellas for the first time. It is made in that style, with narrations etc. while not bad, this is more like a farewell movie to Hollywood by Scorsese, Pacino, De Niro, and Pesci. It's kinda like Scorsese saying to the audiences this is my last gangster film, goodbye. Scorsese always wanted to work with Pacino and he finally got his time.If you compare the acting between Pacino and De Niro, it's not like comparing their acting in Heat, where people still argue till this day who gave the better performance. In this film De Niro acts as the underlining/hitman to Pacino's Hoffa. So by default, since Pacino is the boss, he gives a more powerful performance. De Niro is his underling so his performance is more timid. But I think this movie will get the following Oscar Noms:Best Movie
Best Director
Best Actor: Both Pacino and De Niro
Best Supporting Actor: Pesci
Best original or adapted screenplayNow as far as the movie goes, I'm glad I didn't waste $25 to go see it in some art house theater in Dallas. I thought I was missing a major motion picture event. And it turns out that I didn't. Realistically, it's just an ok movie. However the competition this year is very flat so it might win all the Oscars mentioned above.The only bad thing that I'll say about this movie, is that Robert De Niro's deep fake was horrible. It's a CGI mess and shouldn't have been done. Hair, makeup, and the prosthetics department could've made a better young De Niro. Facial prosthetics are good enough these days to make an actor look young. Thankfully the deep fake version of young De Niro was only in the first one hour, so the next two and a half hours it was back to a normal looking De Niro. Pacino used deep fake for one scene. It was the scene in which Hoffa talks to Frank for the first time over the phone, and you can clearly see that Pacino's upper lip does not move at all, and it looks weird. I mean the deep fake/CGI was 'Mars needs Moms' level bad. I don't think Pesci used deep fake technology at all and it worked out for him positively. I hope this movie is a warning to other directors never to use deep fake technology to make actors look young.So as a necessity watch this Scorsese movie, but watch Casino and Goodfellas right after you finish this movie.",7,2,5,28 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Why do I want to see Loki again???
",I never understood why they made Loki the main villain in the first Avengers film. He wasn't scary and didn't even die in the end. To date he's been the villain in around 4 Marvel movies and all the time the heroes think Loki will be on their side and guess what? He ends up tricking them and somehow gets away. I mean there aren't any variations to his character to provide something different. It's just the same character villain again and again. Tom Huddleston is a boring actor. I hate his soft spoken voice. He thinks he's doing Shakespeare. And why are they making a Thor movie look like a Custodians of the Cosmos (i.e. Guardians of the Galaxy) movie? The Thor movies had a Viking vibe to them which I liked. Also severe under usage of Heimdall. I'm not running to the theaters for this one.,1,29,58,2 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," They just made a movie and slapped the Star Wars logo onto it.
","Seriously, this is just fan appeasement. I hate also how they've come up with this title : 'The Skywalker Saga.' Disney dumb dumb dumb.It seems like every new director will bring their version and interpretation of Star Wars to every next film.",4,8,14,20 December 2019
Bird Box," Omigosh. So bad! Like M. Night Shayamalan's The Happening. Watch with blindfolds on!
",I mean something happens to people who look at the sky that causes them to kill themselves. That's it. That's the plot. So Sandra Bullock makes a journey with two kids to a place which she heard is safe. Nothing else. There is no reason given why things are happening or a sense of an ending. It seems like a Damien Lindeloff movie.And don't believe Stephen King. For some reason studios like asking Stephen King if their movie is scary and he always says yes. I don't know what's wrong with the guy.And it looks like all the good reviews are written by Netflix employees. I hear they tell their employees to write good reviews online.,1,172,340,22 December 2018
Dunkirk," Nolan just trying to beat Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Unsuccessful.
","This movie is just a bunch of vignettes joined loosely together by the fact that they all involve the Dunkirk evacuation. Just a bunch of small stories intertwined together and no real ending except that all the soldiers were evacuated somehow and the Nazi Empire remained an empire for the next five years!?!? I mean why make a Dunkirk fiasco movie in the first place? At least in Saving Private Ryan they show the allies winning in the end. Dunkirk is just the stupid invasion of Dunkirk in which the British didn't have any plan whatsoever on how to win the war. So they send the troops to the beach and then realize 'hey we got no plan on what to do next and darn all our troops are about to be killed!' So they mount a form of evacuation in which the British civilians use their boats to help in the evacuation. Awww.....so sweet. Don't be fooled. Nolan is just wanting to be a greater director than Spielberg by making his own WWII movie. And it fails. I mean why choose the Dunkirk evacuation as a source material in the first place especially when there are so many other interesting battles and facts about WWII? Dunkirk just shows the British stupidity in WWII and exposes the fact that Nolan is a hack. Nolanites, now burst with anger!",1,31,72,20 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Why is Disney putting out so many spoilers???
","I'm going to see this movie ina couple of hours. And while no one has spoiled this movie for me yet, I don't know why they are airing so many spoilers in TV spots? First the trailer shows Tony stuck in space, and now the TV spot shows Tony with the other Avengers in those white stormtrooper like suits. It tells us Tony survived Space. Also they put out the trailer for the next Spider-Man movie so we know he comes back (as expected).So knowing all this I'm gonna go watch this in IMAX 3D, and I'll add my review to this post once seen.",5,1,3,1 May 2019
Gone with the Wind," Oh the wrath white people had to indure during the civil war!
","Of all the people, white people had it worst during our civil war. They lost their homes, plantations, and worst of all, their relationships. The war put a heavy burden on those who were looked no for a mate. Then we are made to feel sorry for Scarlet O'Hara for feeling hungry as if no slave had ever gone to bed hungry before. And the Yankee is portrayed as this cruel lootin' and rapin' hooligan.This is all what the movie portrays.",5,5,13,5 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Why do we all have to suffer because of Quentin Tarantino's foot fetish??
","We get it QT, you like raised up feet and looking at the underside of feet. We know you you like women's feet pressing on the windshield of a car. Why do we all have to suffer for your fetish? Since it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, we all will go see it. However if I had known this was about the Manson Family I probably never would have gone as there's already too many shows about them and frankly I can't understand America's obsession with them. It's like Britain's obsession with Henry VIII and Ann Boleyn. If I knew this was QT revisionist history about the Manson Family then I most likely would never have gone. Way to trick the audience QT. And the trailer stating 'The ninth film from Quentin Tarantino'......I mean how pretentious is that?",1,21,32,24 August 2019
The Lion King," Adults: This is not a nostalgia movie for you.
","This new Lion King movie is made for kids, just like how the 1994 cartoon movie was made for us when we were kids. People are complaining that it has too much of the original and nothing really new. Well duh... I believe most, probably all kids have not seen the original, so for them it will be a thrill ride. And this movie is gonna make a lot of bucks because it's a family movie. Parents are gonna bring their kids cause they want them to have the same exciting moments they had when they were kids. So to the adult movie critics: this movie is not meant for you. This movie might seem boring to you.This is not nostalgia for the adults.",2,57,95,15 July 2019

1917," The CGI is soo bad.
","I don't care if the story is good. If a bomb blasts right beside you and you don't even shake/move, you do not deserve a decent rating or an Oscar nom.Besides, this seems sorta like a remake of Idi, Smotri.",2,29,87,30 December 2019

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Our every year ritualistic going-to-the-theater-to-watch-a Marvel-movie finally begins.
","I feel like a drone. Every year Marvel comes out with its new set of movies and every year like drones we all go out to see them. And for this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we have been given a command: 'This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!' Marvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing. Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars (ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing, so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie and then decide.And so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of 'No/Luke....I am your father.' It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words 'enjoyable' or 'exciting.' I'll just say, 'Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.'Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. So see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you. If ya got nothing better to do then what else should ya do??I'd just like to rename this movie: Guardians of Ga'ahoole: The Owls of the Galxay.",1,162,320,26 April 2017
Joker," Extremely good movie ruined by Batman having to battle a geriatric Joker.
","I know you'll hate on me for saying this, but this Joker is better than Heath Ledger's Joker. This doesn't mean that Heath Ledgers Joker was bad. Unless there is a better performance this year Joaquin Phoenix should get the Oscar for this.But what went wrong here is that there was no protagonist vs. antagonist. Yes the 'world' was shown to be the antagonist, and for a certain while it worked. But this movie needed a Batman. And I mean THIS movie, not any other Joker movie, but THIS movie specifically needed a Batman. Because then the ending does not seem satisfying enough. But still it was a good movie. It was pretty brave to show Thomas Wayne and Pennyworth as jerks. And what was up with their age? Why were Thomas Wayne and Pennyworth and Martha Wayne so old?So in the end I'l say, this 2 hr movie had at least 1/2 hr worth if needles scenes and exposition. The build up was good. I'm kinda conflicted. 1 and 1/2 hrs should've been given to the Jokers creation back story and 1 hr should've been Batman. Or maybe not. I also feel that adding Batman to this movie would've caused it to flop cause we still haven't gotten over the horrible Snyder version of Batman. So I'll give this movie both 10/10 and 1/10.",1,21,69,10 October 2019
Parasite," If this wasn't named 'Parasite' I'd be running to the theater to watch this.
","The problem is that the Koreans and Japanese and other people from that side of the world make so many disturbing movies that I just don't watch them. Now the name of this movie is 'Parasite' and that doesn't fill me with confidence. But I've been assured that this is not a disturbing movie so I'll go give it a chance. But the one thing I have to say, only in America can a foreign language film win best picture in the greatest award ceremony of the year.",9,14,24,10 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," What is wrong with you people? More sad than satirical!
","Everyone is saying this is good satire and praises and praises but did we see the same movie? It's funny and satirical for the first half, then when the mom gets killed all jokes and satire don't seem funny anymore. I mean there are good jokes and satire after the mom dies but they fall flat and you don't feel like laughing anymore. The kid for friggin sake was grabbing on to his moms feet when she was hanged and cried and cried. Ho ho ha ha very funny! What is wrong with all of you? It didn't become dark but it became more serious.Besides, most of the jokes are already in the trailers. Now the movie on itself is unique and good. Nothing like it has been done before, just maybe Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds where he makes Hitler into a doofus. But I just don't like the false advertising this movie is doing. The trailers and tv spots are showing this as a whacky funny laugh out loud comedy. For most part of the film it isn't for the reasons stated above. I also wouldn't call it a dark comedy, because it isn't.I was hoping that this would be a satire on the Hitler Youth as this movie was promoted, with bungling cute kids who mess things up and don't know right from left.But one thing I'd like to say: Scarlett Johansson will hands down most probably 100% win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. I say this because it's her best performance since Lost in Translation, and I'm thankful she's out of those awful Marvel movies. The studio will push for supporting actress because it's easier to win even though she is the lead actress.",7,2,7,9 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This movie is so bad.
","I just saw this movie again before Last Jedi and it is so bad. All the arguments over the past two years on why this is such a bad movie are still true, like Rey being a Mary Sue, Mark Hamill just staring weirdly, etc. Now I don't feel like going and seeing Last Jedi and I believe Star Wars has ended for me. I don't care about the next movie, the new characters being introduced, or anything else going on in the Star Wars universe. It's just over for me. Daisy Ridley even said she's leaving after the third film. That's cause she knows a sinking ship when she sees one and she doesn't want to be involved with all the controversies and stupidities attached with this new trilogy. Rey will just defeat the First Order in the next two movies and that's it. Way to go, Jar Jar Abrams, with a fully predictable plot. And to reiterate why I hate Force Awakens: Rey knows how to understand the beeping of a droid while R2 always needed a translator for him, she knows the Wookiee language, knows how to fly a ship, knows how to wield a lightsaber without any Dagobah training, and is the only one who grew up on Jakku to have a British accent. Even Boyega got rid of his British accent for this film.",Null,3,6,18 December 2017
