The Lobster," the love automatism
","brought by the British independent cinema, the Lobster is an amazing surrealistic and symbolic movie that explores a world where the human being is trapped in rules he created.Like some similar plots, like 1984, this movie give us a malaise feeling, that something like that could happening with all of us. The malaise is also consequence of our reflection about our relations, sometimes so 'grey' and empty. What's the better thing to do? To be desperate to get someone, or just be alone and let the things happen? With a great cast, great and powerful hots, this in a not easy movie to watch. But it's one of the great movies of the year!",9,4,10,4 January 2016
Youth," the insecurity of getting old
","the new movie of Sorrentino is a beautiful ode to the process of getting old, where every shot breaths magic with the incredible cinematography. two veterans like Caine and Keitel push the movie to another level of quality, and my favorite actor of the moment, Paul Dano, shows how good he is. This is a movie about feelings, about reflection, about the past and memories. Therefore, if the Great Beauty is a masterpiece of allegories but, sometimes, assumes a very Fellinian look, this movie gives space to the contemplation and absorvation of the audience, and puts this movie, for me, in another level. Just wonderful...",10,1,3,13 January 2016
