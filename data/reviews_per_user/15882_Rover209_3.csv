Mission: Impossible III," Hackneyed
","Shows we seen before. This might not have been the worst film I've ever seen, but it was a horrible waste of time, unless you are a fan of Tom Cruise (which I'm not). Poor storyline with too many elements stolen from other movies, primarly 'True Lies'. Wife doesn't know husband is a spy, check. Aerial attack on a causeway bridge, check. Flying into the side of a building and interrupting a janitor vacuuming, check. At least they varied where the ideas were stolen by getting the base-jumping from the top of a building from 'Entrapment' and others.Cardboard performance by an otherwise talented Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Non-existent character development across the board. And too much bad acting by Tom Cruise in almost every scene.Thumbs down from me.",2,5,11,28 September 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," I'll feel better then.
","Perhaps the day after tomorrow, I'll get the bad taste out of my mouth from watching The Day After Tomorrow. I kept trying to remind myself that it was just a film and was working for that 'suspension of disbelief' that I enjoy when watching a good movie. But I wasn't watching a good movie and I never could get over the leftist-liberal-eco-whacko agendo so poorly written into the script. Was it a script or some political etchings from the latest Barbra Streisand Save the Gay Whales demonstration? Acting was mediocre and direction seemed irrelevant (if I saw one more shot of 'lets film the poor victim as the [insert amazing disaster here] approaches and destroys them' one more time I was going to scream). Cinematic clich√©s ripped from other films (let's stare up at the Statue of Liberty a la Planet of the Apes) or let's sacrifice ourself for the good of the team (The Poseidon Adventure).It was, however, visually entertaining. Any chance I get to see L.A. or New York City wiped out requires my attendance. If we had dispensed with the script and the left-leaning agenda, it would have be just as enjoyable to see the special effects in a 'Look Ma at what I can do with CGI!' vein.Like a salmonella-laced gourmet meal, The Day After Tomorrow was pleasant to look at, but might a couple of days to get the taste out of my system.",Null,0,0,31 May 2004
The Illusionist," 'The Illusionist' is a good story told well
","Its refreshing to go to the movies and see a film with a good story that is told well. 'The Illusionist' does not disappoint in providing an intriguing historical romp through Austria at the turn of the 19th century. Edward Norton sets the stage as the mysterious and intense title character, Eisenheim. His rival is none other than the Crown Prince of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Rufus Sewell's portrayal of Prince Leopold is delightfully dark & complex with simmering rage. Paul Giamatti gives the perfect balance as the Chief Inspector of the Vienna Police who must seek the truth of the mysteries that unfold. An interesting story with multiple levels and twists keeps the audience interest. Art direction and cinematography give a pleasant and nostalgic view of what once was, while special effects display what might be. Romance, history, intrigue, mystery and a bit of action provide something for everyone.",9,0,0,7 October 2006
