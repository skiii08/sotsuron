First Man," What a ride!
","Loved this movie. From the nail-biting opening test flight sequence to the triumphant denouement, I was enthralled. While I imagine some artistic license was taken with a few of the Apollo mission's back room details, the movie provided an absorbing insight into why it was so important (spoiler alert - to get one up on the Russians); and how the focus and commitment of the astronauts affected their families. The film was long but felt short. The photography was breathtaking. The flight sequences tense and believable. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy were amazing together. 
Go see this and get a different slant on an event that changed the world.",10,1,3,17 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Daring .....but boring
","If you are someone who likes watching fireworks shows this special-effects saturated epic might be your cup of tea. But I had to constantly resist the urge to check my phone messages. 
I have to say the ending was unexpected and Marvel deserves plaudits for switching things around. The rest, unfortunately, was a pretty standard superhero movie.",3,75,277,25 April 2018
Green Book," A movie to savour
","This is one of those movies that no-one wants to leave when the credits roll round. Based on a true story it plots the unfolding of an unlikely friendship between diamond in the rough Bronx-born Italian Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali). Shirley is a concert pianist who needs a driver and some protective muscle as he tours the prejudiced South during the early 60's. Shirley is too cultured to fit in with his own race but too black to fit in with the white one. His internal conflict, Tony's external one as a coloured man's minder, and the friendship that develops make for riveting cinema. There is drama, hilarity, education and pathos in this wonderful movie. A masterpiece.",9,1,2,4 February 2019
