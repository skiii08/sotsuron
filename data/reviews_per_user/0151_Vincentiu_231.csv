The King's Speech," A good story. And more.
","Without definition. That is my conclusion. A film with moral drops and historical spices , with a great cast but in final, only a labyrinth. Warm and seductive but not just a tea cup. Elegant and simple but lovely for deep causes. A delicate show but very strange. A king and his teacher. Shadows of crisis.And a lot of victories. For me, it is a fine embroidery. Old figures and few natural seams. Nothing complicated. But every gesture mathematical precise.The surprise is Colin Firth. Geoffrey Rush is the same - chameleon and slippery. Bonham Carter is secondary piece for a huge cake. But Firth is really impressive in this tall for ordinary people who discovers not a game with kings and dragons but a basic crisis and a small answer to daily fear. For that motive, it is not a film for Oscar or a moralistic speech.It is a voice who must be more than a drop of wind.",Null,0,0,30 September 2011

Alexander," A fake lesson
","Beautiful, grandiose, glamorous. But fake. The same ways of ambitions and love. Same tyrant and same ambition. The lights and powerful colors are important, the truth is only a small detail. I don't know is a competition with the 'Gladiator' or with 'Troy'. The essential is very simply: it is not a Oliver Stone movie. The show is a combination Fellini - Ken Russell. 'Alexander' is a history lesson with a senile teacher who wait save his illness with slices of imagination. Colin Firth is only a sophisticated puppet with great ambition. A golden scare-crow. The homoerotic relations are very different in old Greece of modern vision. And Alexander was a god, a real god, not a boy with bizarres impulses. May be 'Alexander' a disillusion? Is it a 'J.F.K.' on the antiquity's scene? No! It is only the last move of a important director's career.",5,0,0,26 December 2006
The Others," Before the death, inside the illusion
","What is the death? What is the fear who make this sleep a huge problem? This movie do not presents a way to understand the future life or the secret of another world. This film talk about the knowledge and the innocence. About an inside solitude and the words of this empty space. Grace Steward is the perfect mother and a perfect wife. But his perfection is his fundamental sin. The fear and the waiting, the love and the sacrifice spirit. Like the Old Lady she believes in the reality and must protect his personal world of the dangerous contacts. The house is a grave, but his silence is the honest price for live. The rooms are cells but this is only way to save the essential. The sick of children is a wall for a good protection. Bertha Mills and his companions are not only the enemy, guides or strangers. They are the end of waiting. The killers of the Grace's reality. The death is yours master piece. And the verdict- a word of children's lesson.",10,25,32,24 December 2006

Troy," Peter O'Toole and the lost of gods
","It is not Homer. It is not the ambiguous shadow of old Greek masterpiece. But it is a movie with Peter O'Toole in a fine role. And it is important.I saw 'Troy' with any kind illusion. A film with a important budget have the respect of truth as small detail. And a film with an pure American Achilles is for heart, not for memory. But can save a single good actor this tremendous project? Peter O'Toole is a splendid Priam thanks to classical theater art. He have measure of character, a character like land who must be explored. For he, the role is not escape or a new art's stand. In his acting the important light is gives by tradition, by a interesting career, by role- second skin.Like many super productions, 'Troy' is impressive but it has not soul. It is a wood horse, a slice of glory, a epic construction in a glass box. The facts are shards of a lost pot. The images are strong and fakes. Achilleus is only a brutal macho, Paris- a dumb boy, Hector- a pink victim of duty.But the essence of sadness is the absence of gods. In this case, the film relates a anonymous war, in Irak,Lichtenstein or Camelot. Troy is only a ordinary prey and the revenge is same like in a tavern. So, can a actor saves a movie, alone?",7,0,6,30 December 2006

Brokeback Mountain," A mirror
","It is a bizarre film.In first part is common, occasionally boring. Same recipes, magnificent images and old story between two cowboys. Nothing new, nothing important.In the second part-a different story. Symbols, gestures of love, fear and desire,ambiguity of feelings and chimeric expectations, truth and vital lies, memories and strong sin, slices of time and hypocritical existences, words and far worlds and shadow of a mountain.It is not a gay movie or pledge for tolerance. It is not a tale about the brave heroes and their silence. It is not a lesson of life or a touching moment of a Sunday evening. It is a mirror.The lost, the hope, the desire, the responsibility like cage are realities for every existence. In every life exists a seed of a great and secret guilt and a nostalgic favor.The image of farm is only the ordinary Arcadia. The perfect refuge and the place of reason of existence. And this guilt is more and more bigger, with every hour and every year.'Brokeback Mountain' is a magnificent film. Not for the art of director or casting but for the science to transforms the silence in only dialog. To create a small and anonymous catharsis in the conscience of audience and to make questions.It is a tale about the price of sacrifice. About illusions and about the image of the other. Only victory is touch of a blue shirt.After his end, I considered this film a splendid piece of Extreme Orient cinema.

Schindler's List," Image of a story teller's soul
","A very difficult film. Any definition is venturesome, any praise is strange or shallow. At final, it is not a movie or adaptation of an existence but a subtle form of catharsis. This movie is source of a special experience. And the causes are numerous:1) It is an artistic masterpiece. Light, images, acting, script and silence, nuances of tragedy and delicate suggestions are pieces of a fascinating approach. So, it is result of a deep and powerful sentiment and Spielberg is the gorgeous sculptor of its.2} The story is old and aching. The Shoah is not a Jewish or German problem or result of propaganda. The good and the evil are elements, in that crime, not of ethics or faith, education or fear, mercy or public image but seal of atrocious ambiguity. And this vagueness is fundamental part of our world. In fact,it is essence of its conscience. So, the irrational brutality of Goeth is only clichÃ©. The bad Nazi, cruel, sarcastic and bizarre is rotten puppet of a death period. After 'The Night of the Generals' this character type is absurd.3} Fundamental value of film is the subtle art of suggest a reality out of any description's form. Images are poor shadow of a crime without limit or reason. And this suggestion is represented by Neeson's acting; the metamorphose of an ordinary business man in a hero part of his mission.4} The interpretation of Sir Ben Kingsley is touching. His character is heard of a miracle and the tension, fear, expectation and force of gestures, the short words and the look transforms Itzhak Stern in conscience of fight for some people for who to survive is fragile dream.5} The option for monochrome image is essence of its perfect beauty. The mixture between ashes and human ash, between lead, tension and free cruelty of irrational monstrosity , plans of escape and lies gives form of a wold's fragile definition .6} It is a great masterpiece for the sensitivity of looking. The film is a remember and a decent homage for a special hero and for his strange war. But not story is important.
