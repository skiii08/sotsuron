The Longest Yard," Laugh out Loud
",I thought the movie Was really funny but it lacked what the original had...I don't know what it was but the original was just a lot better but on terms of Comedy which Chris Rock and Adam Sandler provide If it were just that funny I'd give it a 10! Now what I really thought was interesting is the way the movie started with Adam Sandler being drunk and sent to Prison I thought it was hilarious how he wrecked the car I was the only one that really found it funny and when I found out why is because there was a commerical for it that everyone else seen I guess I don't watch enough TV to know but the way it was set up and the way the guy said he liked him just made me laugh hysterically....,8,1,3,2 July 2005
