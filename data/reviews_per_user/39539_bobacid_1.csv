The Avengers," Epic
","this is an amazing movie, the effects were great, and although i only went to the 2d showing, id recommend this film to anyone.the best part of this movie for me was the mighty Thor. the worst part has to be the really crappy (super)heroes, black widow and the guy with the bow, yeah he was so interesting that i don't even know who it was. too much emphasis on those 2 as characters and not enough hulk.captain America was amazing but it totally casts a shadow over any fantastic 4 collaboration being believable in the future. i enjoyed the singular captain America movie after a second watch but this movie was mind blowing.Dr. banner (my secret is I'm always angry) amazing.",10,5,11,3 June 2012
