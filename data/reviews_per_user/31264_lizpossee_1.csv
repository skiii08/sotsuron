Requiem for a Dream," A Remarkable Film
","When my friend told me to watch Requiem for a Dream, I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be another 'Don't do drugs kids!' movie, with bland characters and a lackluster plot line. I couldn't have been more wrong. Requiem for a dream offers believable characters that you grow to love. Each actor does a spectacular job at facing the REAL side of addiction, not the glamorized version shown in most movies. With no weak-link in the cast, each character shows their personal struggle, whether it be with addiction, or loneliness in a honest way. One of my favorite aspects of this film is the music. I've never felt so emotionally engaged in a movie, and Clint Mansell had a lot to do with that. The sounds don't compete with the images on the screen, but enhance it and make it real. Lux Aeterna being the theme song of the movie is perhaps one of the best songs I've ever heard. It brings you through every emotion with not a single word. Another aspect of the film I adore is the incredible cinematography. The fact that you never once see a character actually doing drugs in this movie, yet you know exactly what is going on, is absolutely mind-boggling. The beautiful, yet frightening images on the screen make you feel what the characters are feeling, down to each character's individual pain and agony. At the end of the film, when Harry is lying on the hospital bed, it's hard not to feel every level of his pain, whether it be physical, or emotional.Requiem for a Dream truly is one of the best films of our day, and offers a true glimpse into the world of addiction. I would recommend this film to anyone.",10,1,2,9 December 2008
