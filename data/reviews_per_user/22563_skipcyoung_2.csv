Changeling," CHANGELING puts Eastwood in the same ballpark as Ron Howard.
","Eastwood doesn't know the meaning of the word 'subtle'. He always makes sure the dimmest person in the audience is never in doubt of which characters are 100% good and which ones are 100% evil. Every single employee at the psych hospital acts like they're villains in a Superman comic book. With the exception of Jolie, the film was filled with MOVIE characters, not real people.The irony is that this is a true story, yet I never believed a minute of Eastwood's film. He had a fascinating story to work with, and I'm glad to know the story, but as a film it was little better than a made-for-TV movie. He seems to be afraid of challenging his audience, so he ends up insulting our intelligence. At the end he spoon-feeds us even our emotional response, making it clear that we're supposed to feel good about the outcome, even though, when you think about it, it's really not a happy ending.",4,10,17,18 February 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Why?! What were they thinking?
","It's as if the two movies were written by different people.  I don't have a problem with taking liberties with the book, but these insertions and changes of character make no sense at all.  And why trade great dialogue for mediocre?  Were the writers that conceited that they couldn't resist putting more of their own work into this movie?  The problems with TT have only to do with the writing.  It really makes no sense.  FOTR was near perfect; what a disappointment TT is.",8,0,0,18 December 2002
