Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than the critics are saying, worse than I was hoping for
","Episode IV - it is not... I am a huge Star Wars fan - unlike most current viewers, I've seen them all at the theater when originally released - and was hoping for a lot more, especially after all the hype. The special effects of the movie are incredible, but the storyline was very weak. You never feel close to any of the main characters and there isn't the humor that the original trilogy had. Of course, as everyone is saying, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying, child-pandering character George Lucas has ever created... its as if he's trying to entertain toddlers who are fans of Barney or Teletubbies... I just hope episodes II & III return to the original strength of the trilogy.",5,0,1,6 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," B-O-R-I-N-G ! ! ! ! !
","I've seen porno with better plots than this c**p. Having been a big fan of 2001, and A Clockwork Orange, I was expecting a hell of a lot more from Kubrick than this garbage. The only reason why anyone would suffer through this would be to see Nicole Kidman's pies... and its not even worth THAT! And could the soundtrack drag this sinking (stinking) ship down any more? I've heard funeral dirges that keep you awake better than this.",1,2,5,17 October 2000
Vanilla Sky," Worst Piece of Crap of 2001
","SPOILERS ALERT!! Man, this movie sucks. I thought Eyes Wide Shut was bad, but this one takes first place, hands down. The movie was billed as a kind of stalker movie... but first of all, they never really created a stalker scenario with Cameron Diaz. The first thing you know, she's driving her car off a bridge into a wall. Throughout the movie, you can never tell what is reality or what is a dream... completely confusing. And I usually like movies that make you think (like Memento, a much better 2001 movie) Then, two thirds of the way through the movie it suddenly becomes this bizarre sci-fi non-thriller. I had no idea going into this movie that it was going to be that kind of film. And what a cop-out... it's like they didn't know how to tie it up, so EVERYTHING IS A DREAM. That's such a crappy way to try to end a movie that has no end.In the words of Comic Book Man from the Simpsons: 'Worst Episode Ever!'",1,0,4,10 June 2002
