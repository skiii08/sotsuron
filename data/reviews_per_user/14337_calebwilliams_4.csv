50 First Dates," objectionable racist trash
","This movie stinks to high heaven.  The script is so unfunny that no-one over the age of 7 would find it amusing.  The acting is so bad that even Along Came Polly looks good beside it.  The direction is sloppy.  Overall, every scene is utterly predictable.More seriously, this movie is ideologically offensive.  For a start, it's deeply racist. According to this film, native Hawaiians are dirty, lazy, stupid, and socially unsophisticated.  Additionally, the movie never misses the chance to make a homophobic wisecrack, even throwing in an androgenous zoo worker to create even more opportunities for seriously cheap jokes. To make matters worse s(he) is given Viking hair - evidently in the director's opinion, people from Northern Europe haven't got beyond the Viking era yet.Leaving aside the fact that you will be so bored that you'll want to shoot yourself 30 minutes in, I don't believe any responsible parent would want their kid to see this film.  It's the kind of objectionable trash only a family wedded to the Ku Klux Klan would enjoy. That it can get a 6.8 reading on IMDB is a serious indictment of public taste.",1,11,32,12 April 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," So much better than Columbus
","*Some (very limited) spoilers*I would seriously question the aesthetic judgment of anyone who didn't immediately see that Cuaron's Harry Potter 3 is in a different league altogether from Columbus's weak and humorless efforts to realize books one and two. It's not just that the overall look and feel of film three is so much more convincing; even in the small details, the superiority of Cuaron as a director is obvious. For example, where Columbus tries to gain a sense of the end of term at Hogwarts by inserting some ploddingly conventional 'Christmassy scenes' (accompanied by some sickeningly jingly music from John Williams), Cuaron treats us to a much more subtle shot - Harry's snowy owl, Hedwig, flies across a beautifully composed wide-angle shot, and as the camera follows her, the landscape behind her gradually passes from gloomy late autumnal green/grey mountains to wintry snow. The effect is altogether more mysterious. Furthermore, Cuaron's grasp of cinematic language is so much more complex and assured than the rather basic vision of Columbus. From the very beginning of the film, we have references to the passage of time, a crucial theme of book 3: the large pendulum of an enormous clock swings menacingly in a school corridor, we see Harry's face through the face of a clock way before the final time-turning episode, while models of planetary movements set the action in a more cosmic frame. Equally, the issue of identity so central to the plot of Azkaban, is foregrounded by Cuaron's use of reflection - what better way to signal the fact that Harry is beginning to grapple with the mystery of his past and the absence of his parents? Thus, the doublings of the final sequence, where Harry has to avoid his other self while he rescues his godfather, are foreshadowed by shots of Harry's face reflected in the darkened window of a train and in the rippling water of the lake. Cuaron also brings a much more vivid sense of humour to these movies than Columbus. The jokes in the first movies are often painfully laboured - one can't help feeling that Steve Kloves continues to miss the distinctive and colourful humour of Rowling's prose, in particularly her wonderful delineation of character. Cuaron is able to relieve this by inserting some visual humour - when Hagrid produces the hyppogriff, Harry finds himself 'volunteering' only because the rest of the class have backed off in horror!That's not to say that the movie is perfect. Some of the CGI shots are wonderful (the hyppogriff looks amazing), but the werewolf is distinctly dodgy, and there aren't enough scary shots of the Dementors. I can't help feeling that Cuaron was hampered here by the need to get a PG certificate for a film which would perhaps ideally have been a 12A. Also, the script misses out incredibly important material - such as the connection between Harry's father and the marauder's map. This will only make the near-impossible task which faces Mike Newell more difficult - reducing book 4 to a two and a half hour movie is a gargantuan task in itself, without having to fill in gaps which book 3 should have covered!There are some tantalising clues here to the (yet unwritten) final books. A speech by Lupin on a bridge stresses the kindness of Harry's mother in precedence to the rule-breaking of his father. Will Harry's obsession with his Dad in the earlier books yield to a better understanding of his mother's history and sacrifice in the later novels? Such a twist would surely appeal to an author who began to write as a struggling single mother...",7,0,1,1 June 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," absurdly overrated
","This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.    The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience 'It's all about TIME and PRESSURE...' just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.  While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art.",3,12,28,31 August 2004
Gladiator," a terrible waste of two and a half hours of your life
","Gladiator is an epic movie - it is the most breathtakingly awful fiasco of a film made for many years.Watch the battle scenes besides other popular movies, like Lord of the Rings, and the direction looks terrible.  Watch them alongside Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and it soon becomes apparent that if you deposited two cameras in a cage full of monkeys, they would make a better artistic job of filmaking than Ridley Scott.  The actors are uniformly awful, the CGI effects are overused and unconvincing, the script is turgid and the political message of the whole thing is deeply confused.  While the historical inaccuracy of the notion that the Romans had a deep affective investment in domestic ideology is amusing for two minutes, the sheer hackneyed conventionality of it soon becomes direly boring.  Most offensive of all, however, is its political charlatanism.  Gladiator pretends to be advocating radical republican democracy (think Rousseau), but in fact uses classical republicanism as a screen to peddle the same modern right wing liberal message as every other forgettable American B-movie.
The only way the acclaim it has received can be explained is by recourse to the near illiteracy and general ignorance of its 'fans'.Basically, if you know anything about art, you will hate this film.  If you understand 'cool' you will detest it.  If you are an uneducated male, who is slightly insecure about his masculinity, or a brainless Crowe worshipper stuck in a teenage lifestyle with nothing better to spend your time on than dusting your collection of his posters, you will probably adore it.",1,2,14,24 October 2003
