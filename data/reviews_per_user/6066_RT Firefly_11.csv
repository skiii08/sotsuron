Catch Me If You Can," Shpielberg redeems himself
","I have been known to criticize the post-Raiders of the Lost Arc Spielberg for his obviousness and lack of attention to good story telling, but in Catch Me If You Can I must admit he finally hits a home run after his last twenty or so at bats... hey, he could play for the Mets... Shindlers List, of course, excluded. This is a fun film to watch. Very stylish opening credits that reminded me of The Pink Panther. The acting, costuming, art design, music, pacing, is all very fun. In fact, so much of the film is fun, you wonder if it could have possibly been directed by the same guy that made Jurassic Park. I doff my hat to him. He kept it simple. Let's hope this is a trend.",Null,1,3,15 September 2003
Billy Elliot," Up With People meets a Michael Jackson fantasy
","If my summary conjured up positive emotions for you, then you will love this film. DO NOT READ FURTHER.If, however, you just threw up in your mouth, then you may agree with me: Billy Elliot is a vacuous white elephant dripping with sap. I must say I disagree with all the negative reviews here on the IMDb. They all seem to zero in on the typical redneck 'What the f*** would I want to watch ballet for?' I love the ballet. I also thought the acting in Billy Elliot was pretty good, especially the boy. What amazes me, especially from the Brits, is that more people didn't find this film horribly forced, and obvious. It felt to me like one of those Hallmark greeting cards with the vaselined lens and little girls dressing up in Mama's clothes. Everything was too perfect. Too on the head. And good Lord enthroned in eternal majesty in heaven above, if I have to be told one more time that it's okay to be a homosexual I will EAT my own head off. All right, I get it, he's not a poofter, not that there's anything wrong with that. I GET IT! MOVE ALONG!The main thing I did not like about Billy Elliot was the on the head hammering of it's themes. I wanted to like it, but that one flaw was enough to ruin it for me. If you loved Private Ryan, then I guess you will never understand why I didn't like this film. However, if you understand why 'The Perfect Storm' left me no choice but go on a shooting spree at the local MacDonalds, then perhaps you can relate to my sentiments. Does that make me a bad person? I love feel good films such as The Dish,Gigot, The Secret of Roan Inish, etc... Heck, my favorite film of all time is It's A Wonderful Life. But Billy Elliot had that all too familiar aroma of a media spin doctor telling me what I should and shouldn't believe. I also felt much of his dancing, excellent though he was, to be impossibly contrived. It's one thing to want to dance, it's another thing to 'gotta dance' but it's altogether and impossibly an inexplicable thing when, like in a deleted scene from 'Flashdance' a person must simply explode with dancing, start climbing walls, tap dancing down the street and skipping to my Lou all over the damn village. What's with the thrashing and wailing of the boy? I mean, how much angst can an eleven year old have? Which reminds me, didn't it seem in the least bit odd that this young boy was spouting off clairvoyant soliloquies like a 70 year old grandfather giving sage advice? I expect that sort of lapse in reality from American sitcoms, but, call me naive, I expect more from British cinema. And finally a huge mistake to put in foul language to make this an 'R' rated film (in the States). It seemed deliberate on the part of the director to 'toughen up' the feel. Like it's such a bad thing for the movie to be what it really is, a nice story about a kid that is different. Seeing as how the biggest target audience for this film would be families and youngsters, and considering the cursing does nothing to help the story, it could all be removed without compromising the film in the least, I'll wager it could have made an extra 100 million at the box office without the cussing. That's just plain stupid.",Null,0,1,3 January 2002
Snatch," Extreme violence ruins great film making.
","After viewing the trailer to the film Snatch I was anxious to see it. I loved the stylized directing, clever art design and tasteful choice of modern music. I had suspicions, however, that it was going to go the typical modern route of bloodthirsty violence, and of course, it did. What a pity, this film could have been great, and in almost all regards it is. Take out approximately ten minutes of murdering and change a few minutes of dialogue and you would have an enduring film that would appeal to anyone. Having been the victim of violence (that and having a shred of decency) I do not find it entertaining. I was sickened by the grotesque and shameless cruelty Snatch portrays as if it were the accidental bumping into someone on the train. That is the most disturbing element in Snatch, like in other films of it's genre, (i.e.) Pulp Fiction, Casino, Millers Crossing, the happy go lucky attitude the characters take toward it's violence, as if it were a normal carefree event. Good Lord. If I make a film about rape, aren't I obligated to make a statement against such behavior? Otherwise, I condone it by default. Is this really the direction we want society to go? Don't people who enjoy watching brutal violence understand that it is at least desensitizing the people who watch it and at most encouraging such behavior? How about snuff films and human sacrifice while we're at it? Also, are the fans of this genre so shallow that they cannot separate the violence from the uniqueness the film offers? Being a fan of ska music, I know there are many neo-racist bands out there I would enjoy but I refuse to support their message. Just because Snatch has high production value, can't we agree that this type of entertainment must not be tolerated? If not, well, prepare yourself for an uglier neighborhood you helped to create. A begrudging 5 out of 10 in protest.",Null,0,0,6 February 2001
The Grapes of Wrath," A valiant effort, ruined by socialist exaggerations.
","I hesitate to write a bad review of The Grapes of Wrath because I know that to many people who view it apolitically, it is simply a very well made drama. To such people my criticism may seem merely like muckraking. If, however, you are observing the misinformation that the premise of this film is built upon, then I believe it legitimately fails. I understand the poetic license that artists take to make a good story, and I am willing to grant that license. However, I feel that, when tallied, this film's erroneous statements go far beyond the pale of poetry and cross into the realm of propaganda and silliness. It's the difference between 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic' vs. Charlie Daniels 'In America'. The former inspires me, the latter is a joke.Another aspect of the movie that bothered me was its disconcerting take on morals. It begins, fittingly, with someone being mocked for obeying a rule. Henry Fonda, a murderer just out on parole, berates a truck driver for obeying a rule that prohibits him from giving rides. What if Fonda had hijacked him, would the truck driver be a prude or an idiot? In the next scene, God gets the ax. Fonda comes across a disillusioned vagabond, the family's ex-parson. He brags that his sermons were emotional hype and confesses that he liked to sleep with the women that got caught up in 'the spirit' at his meetings. Now, he says, he has lost hope. He does not state this as a fault, so much as it is confusing to him why 'the spirit' has left him. Strangely, this later state of the preacher is looked upon by Fonda as being clairvoyant. Everything that happens in The Grapes of Wrath happens within the context of morality being a relative thing, certainly one devoid of divine appointment. Everything from lying to murder is excusable if done by the right people or for the right reasons. A few examples: <ul><li>Upon seeing Fonda out of prison, most of his family is hoping he broke out. His parole comes as a disappointment.</li></ul><ul><li>The murder he was sentenced to seems irrelevant.</li></ul><ul><li>The sharecroppers are willing to kill the owners of the land to stop them from evicting them (they don't because it 'won't do no good' not because it would be morally reprehensible).</li></ul><ul><li>(slight spoiler) Fonda murders another man for murdering his friend, and Fonda's mother not only excuses the murder without knowing what her son's motive was, but offers to cover it up by hiding her son.</li></ul>I, personally, have a hard time rooting for such protagonists. I also found Fonda's character to be too abusive and insolent many times.Overall, I find the authors socialist overtones clichÃ© and cockeyed:Its opinion of authority is comical. All cops are evil thugs, all employed towns people are absentee cowards, all successful businessmen are thoughtless criminals, and essentially everybody in the film that has employment are only out for themselves and their first impulse is always to be rude and uncaring.The film's opinion of how people treated each other in the '30's is askew. No doubt, some people where cold and heartless, that is a given at any time, but where are the good people? There is not a single group or individual (with any means, that is) helping any of these people, esp. children? Where are the soup kitchens, churches, etc..? The premise of the script is built upon this nonsense. Quick research into the Great Depression will reveal a contrary reality. People where mostly very kind and helpful to each other. It's how we survived as a country. Many other countries turned to anarchy.Its opinion of progress is very cockeyed. The tractors are pictured as giant evil job gobblers. In reality, modernization made it so poor people could get better paying jobs and live a much higher quality of life.Its opinion of what role religion plays in American life is cockeyed.Its opinion of land ownership is cockeyed. If I rent land, and the owner wants to take it back, that is part of my contractural agreement. Oddly, it appears the farm owners were actually doing them a favor by getting rid of them. If they were not successful, their grandparents should have thrown in the towel decades before. But I am expected to sympathize with this.Its opinion of how the government helps people is not only cockeyed, it's backwards. If anyone is guilty of screwing people and taking away their rights, it's government. Reality is so much different that this issue becomes a farce. In one scene, the only thing missing from the government run workers camp were angles playing harps. You may argue that Roosevelt's WPA helped people, but many scholars argue that it actually prolonged the depression.The entire premise of the 'Okie migration' is not factual as presented here, Google the topic to find out. For example; the migration of the Midwest was transpiring since the teens. The bulk of it occurred in the 40's, not the thirties, as employment became abundant in California due to WWII. There are a plethora of other non-truths in this script. So much so that the movie was protested by many people in California. Steinbeck grossly misrepresents the facts.I could go on much longer, but I am limited to 1000 words. All of this is not to say The Grapes of Wrath does not have good and valid points about how we should help people and think of them before profits. I just think they are lost in an ocean of deception and lies. As a movie making effort: 9.5 out of 10. As a whole: 3 out of 10.",Null,8,22,20 October 2005
Seabiscuit," The pinnacle of Hollywood tomfoolery
","I remember a Three Stooges short where whenever Curley would see cheese, he would freak out and the only way to calm him down was to rub a tassel under his chin. Never mind the fact that I enjoyed that more than Seabiscuit, I was struck that in much the same way it seems writer/director/producer/Clinton speech writer Gary Ross thinks he can keep his audience from revolting by using slick cinematography and Irish penny whistles in the movie Seabiscuit. This movie is cheese, but it's tricky little tassels did not fool me or calm me down. I use the term 'movie' loosely, as one would in regards to a two hour political commercial. 'Their candidate wants to kill your pets with a giant knife! Our candidate wants to give everybody a hug and free money.' I was eager to see this film going in; I thought the trailer looked fantastic, I enjoy sentimental feel good films, if done well, the cast was great, wonderful story etc... But halfway through Seabiscuit, mind you, not knowing who made the film, I leaned over to the person with me and said, 'was this directed by Bill Clinton?' When I got home I looked it up. I was close, one of his speech writers. That Seabiscuit is not panned across the board is a tragic sign at how effective the media has become at lulling people, especially it's own, into a false sense of superiority. I mean that. Many a demagogue has taken advantage of such weaknesses.This is NOT a good movie. It is hardly even a movie. It is a set of images and messages, most unrelated and pointless, meant to stimulate your feel good senses like a political speech. The true story of Seabiscuit is one of the most inspiring movie ideas in decades. It is almost a guaranteed hit. Almost. Leave it to Spielberg's buddies (producers) Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall to drop the ball. Can you say 'Congo'? I know this sounds snobby, and I hate snobs, but this film can only be enjoyed by the very simple. I'm not talking about Capra-corn like simple, my favorite film is It's a Wonderful Life, I'm talking about Rambo III like simple. Independence Day simple. Propaganda simple. I present the following to make my case:Exhibit A: The screenplay: it stunk. Ross wrote it. In lieu of possible elements like, oh, say  character development? he uses a narrator. On a side note, Ross foolishly employs David McCullough from Ken Burns epic civil war series. This made the film feel like it couldn't make up its mind whether it was a documentary or a feature film. (Back to the horrible writing) Using a narrator was nothing more than a diversion to cover up the fact that Ross couldn't convert the information in the best selling book to dialog. Every time the narrator spoke it took you out of the movie and made you think of the documentary. It did not fit with this format. Here's a thought, Gary, have the characters or action explain the story.. Imagine if a similar film, say Rocky, had a narrator.Exhibit B: Pacing: most of the scenes, especially in the beginning, were choppy and too fast. As mentioned, the narration also ruins the pace. Is this the editors fault? I don't know, but it drove me crazy. Not that good pacing will fix a story that isn't making sense.Exhibit C: Directing: many of the characters show confusing emotions for unexplained reasons, except, perhaps, to manipulate gullible audience members. At any rate, much of the emotions make no sense. A good example of this is the 'poetry at the dinner table' scene. It is downright laughable. Red's mother told his father Red needed to earn a horse, not just be given one. So the father makes young Red earn his horse by reciting a poem from memory, which he cannot do. The father finishes the poem for Red and suddenly everyone at the table is cheering and Red gets his horse. What? Did I miss something here? If you don't think about it, however, it doesn't matter.Exhibit D: Story line: It had too many, a problem that seems to plague modern film making. Pick a storyline and stick with it. It's like the clowns that make Dumbo jump from the elephants, 'If 40 feet was funny, 80 feet will be twice as funny!' So far as I can tell there were no less than five story lines in Seabiscuit.Exhibit E: Cinematography: Stunning, like in one of those fancy orange juice commercials. In fact, too good. Too perfect, too contrived, too Pepperidge Farms (fancy commercial in the US). It was obvious it was there for me to admire, not to communicate the story. Exhibit F:Soundtrack: I found the soundtrack to be inappropriate to the action. From the beginning it felt like I was watching the ending of the movie. Obvious, sappy, manipulative and annoying. I expected a slow-motion pan of an Indian crying while trash is thrown from cars.Closing arguments: This film's failure can be summed up by it's 'chock-full-o' style imagery. There were too many pointless close ups of cool looking props. I felt like I was watching a gay rodeo. Certain shots seemed to be included for no other reason than that they looked cool. Never mind the fact that it creates a red herring for the viewer. But apparently, if peoples positive comments on the IMDb can be trusted, making sense is not high on anyone's priority list. I therefore ask the jury to find the defendant, Gary Ross, guilty of crappy film making and that Seabiscuit be given the maximum punishment of a 1 (awful) rating.",Null,10,24,13 August 2003
There's Something About Mary," Funny, in spite of the gross out 8 year old comedy bits.
","This would have been a great film if it had tried harder at being grown up, and would have cut all of the sophomoric 'gross out' scenes. The Farrelly's always amaze me that they can pull off stupid comedy and generally give there movies a heart also, something that is missing from most comedies in the past 30 years. But it is a schizophrenic simpatico. It appears as if they are highly gifted comedic writers that are demon possessed, the latter causing them to delve into ridiculous situations that I did not laugh at even when I was 8. In scenes like the infamous 'hair gel' bit, they drop the flow of the script to assemble what appears to be a studio contrived 'set piece', scientifically developed to garner praise from teenage boys. Though this may work, I believe if they applied all their energy to improving the good thing they already have going, their movies would be taken more seriously and they would have a much more lasting (and lucrative) shelf life, not to mention broadening their market. I just don't get the way a lot of people think now days. Could someone please tell me why the Farrelly's thought giving Chris Elliot (a hilarious comedian no one has figured out how to use yet) whiteheads, blisters and itching hives would play as funny? What is wrong with you morons? And yet, the bulk of the film is very good.I edited a version of this off the TV and removed about 5 minutes of stupidity and it didn't hurt the film at all. In fact, I think it is better. I give this film a 7 out of 10. It could have been a 9 or 10 if they just tried harder.",Null,0,2,9 January 2005
Rocky," An outrage! This film should be on the IMDB top 250
","What in the name of all that is honorable and decent still left in the world is going on?  Rocky is not in the IMDB's top 250?  Can anyone who voted below a 9 for this film please tell me with a straight face that you would rather see movies like #24 Toy Story II,  #31 Fight Club or #61 A Clockwork Orange?  Can you honestly tell me you think #130 A Christmas Story, #135 Die Hard or #150 The Truman Show was better than ROCKY?  Impossible!  It's a conspiracy I tell you.  It just doesn't make any sense! This film is in my top 10 for crying out loud! Not that there is particularly anything wrong with the other films mentioned , though I do feel none of them belong on the top 250 (as films like Keaton's classic Steam Boat Bill Jr. and the very moving Fiddler on the Roof' are nowhere to be seen)  Ahhhh! I've never used so many exclamation points in all my life!!!  Rocky is a truly great film, superbly written, wonderfuly cast and acted, it has a great ending and some of the best character development I have ever  seen.  Who doesn't feel as though they have met Rocky, Paulie, Adrian, Apollo Creed and Micky.   The pacing is perfect, the fight scenes totally believable and best of all it has an enduring message of the triumph of the human will against impossible odds. This movie is so good I have heard many people remark that their lives were changed because of it.  It motivated me at 15 to do something with my life and it inspires me to this day.   Can that be said about #192 (Disney's) Beauty and the Beast, #198 Clerks, #201 The Player, #206 Erin Brockovich,  # 211 A Fish Called Wanda, #236 A Bugs Life or  #246 Groundhog Day?  Am I crazy?

It's a Wonderful Life," The best movie ever made, everything movie making should be.
","This is the standard for movie making. If you are on your deathbed and had to watch a movie, this is the movie you would want to watch. No other film has ever had such a perfect blend of all the elements that make movies great. From acting to wardrobe, from directing to script. Drama, comedy, charm, this movie has it all. The pacing is superb and you root for George Bailey from beginning to end. But best of all, it has one of the most basic and beautiful morals of any film ever made: No man's life is unimportant. It's a Wonderful Life, said by director Frank Capra to be his best work, plays to all ages and stands the test of time even with repeated viewings. This in spite of its campy 'Capra-corn' moments. A stunning dramatic performance by Jimmy Stewart, considered by many to be his best, and that is saying a lot. The scene in the bar where Stewart reaches the end of his rope and cries out in utter desperation, 'Dear Father in heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear meÂ… show me the way' is gut wrenchingly vivid to anyone who has ever faced trials and tribulation. Stellar supporting performances, too, including the incomparable Lionel Barrymore as Henry Potter and H.B. Warner as Mr. Gower. This is in the top 10 of most every respectable 'best movies' list ever made. Watching this film will change your life, it is that good.",Null,0,3,5 February 2000
There Will Be Blood," If your conscience has been seared into a fried clove of crispy black garlic... Have we got a film for you!
","So you want to go see a movie. You check the IMDb and see this film is getting an 8.9 rating (#16 on the top 250). It stars Daniel Day Lewis, he's a great actor. The TV ads look smart, and what's that 'milkshake' line about anyway? Off you go. Three and a half hours later you return home and go on the IMDb and vote it a 10 out of 10. Why? Because you are a secret mind-controlled drone of the company that made this film and you always do what you are told. That is the only plausible explanation I can come up with for the extraordinarily high ratings There Will Be Blood is receiving. That or your moral compass only points south.This film is nothing more than a magnificently crafted pile of poop and frankly, I find its undeserving numbers highly suspect. There are plenty of examples where most every critic gets it 'wrong' on a popular film, so no need to re-trod that ground (watch The Aristocrats if you don't believe me, I dare you). But a quick perusal of the IMDb comments index for this film seems to tell a different story than a movie voted higher than #18 Raiders of the Lost Ark or #36 Apocalypse Now. Searching in chronological order, about half the comments say they hate this film. Another quarter didn't think it was as good as everyone said, and only about a quarter praise the film. With that track record, this film should score somewhere in the 5 to 7 range. We should all hope that the studios have figured out a way to pump up IMDb scores. Otherwise, we live in a world where pointless violence and hypocrisy are celebrated as the ideal.No doubt, this film has its merits. Daniel Day Lewis gives an award winning performance. I love it when an actor takes chances and I think it works here, many disagree. The film making is top notch, all the acting too. Most everything from cinematography to wardrobe is as good as it gets. Were this film to have a point, it all would have worked together for a powerful addition to the American film atheneum. As it is, it does nothing more than underscore tired stereotypes and leave its audience wondering why so much effort would be put into such depraved proclamations. Perhaps worse, it glorifies the most evil of human intentions.Can we agree that more is required for a great film then just good film-making? Otherwise, Gigli deserved better treatment. Here, Daniel Day Lewis plays an oil man in the morally corrupt laissez-faire American big business culture (seen it) fighting with a morally corrupt Christian minister (seen it) in a society full of have-nots (seen it) controlled by gilded evil white men (that's new) and everything, eventually, adds up to nothing but gruesome, vivid murders and pointless hatred. Roll credits.I found the portrayal of the young minister to be particularly vapid. Pastor of 'The Church of the Third Revelation'  please. Even the church name is painfully hack. Look, I can handle stock stereotypes, but can anyone in the film industry portray a Christian leader as anything more than a sad, money grubbing miscreant? And how many times are we going to need to see this before it gets tired? Not that any other religion or group could have taken its place. I wonder what the reaction to this film would have been had the Snidely Whiplash minister been portrayed as a Rabbi, and all the Jews in his congregation nothing more than gullible or emotionally weak? Never mind the cartoonish unfairness of it all, don't you think it makes for uninteresting character development? Whatever.All the 'smart' people will go away from this film figuring out that the world is a hopeless dog eat dog jungle. The rest of us will go home and do all the work that holds society together and hope for some other film to take our minds off things like this. 1 out of 10 for a pointless and grotesque story.",Null,5,9,13 February 2008
The Green Mile," Partonizing and overwrought, but still a must see.
","There are several things that bothered me about this film and I will get into that in a second, but first I must say The Green Mile has some of the best acting you will ever see in a movie. Tom Hanks has a special ability to make nothing seem like something. I often wonder if even HE knows what he's doing. You don't really notice it while he's doing it, but after the film find yourself feeling like you know the guy. Unlike being shocked by the sheer magnetism of a Marlin Brando, or the energy of Robert DeNiro, Hanks wins you over by appearing NOT to act. It's like you're watching a video of yourself going through what he is doing. Like you have lived it. Another special treat is gentle giant Michael Clarke Duncan playing the healer John Coffey. Such tenderness and control while holding back a flood of emotion, all without slipping into bathos is a rare thing indeed. Duncan should have won an academy award. A mesmerizing performance. Michael Jeter also turns in a fine performance as the Cajun convict Eduard Delacroix. Bonnie Hunt was doing such a good job I didn't even recognize her at first. The rest of the cast is all well chosen. Excellent performances all around.My criticisms of the film are brief. I only mention them because were it not for these simple faults, I feel The Green Mile has a shot at the 'greatest film of all time' title, and yes, I know that's saying a lot.1) The movie was too long. There comes a time when you need to pick a storyline from the book and then throw the book out. Everything this film said and did could have easily been done in 2 hours and it would have had more impact. It also would have left the audience wanting more, like Apocalypse Now, vs. A.N. Redux.2) I found the foul language and adult situations to be distracting from the topic and genre. A more traditional approach here would have made for a more timeless and accessible work. The language was too 'on the head' (see point 4) 3) I didn't like the special effect of how John Coffey heals. It was too... Steven Kingish? A more subtle approach would have been more thought provoking, which leads me to my last point...4) The movie frequently tries too hard. It has 17 endings, like with Shawshank, it has endless underscoring of its messages and points, it rambles, it over-explains, it hits the nail on the head -- twice, just in case you missed the first one. It would take pages to explain this point in detail, so suffice to say, if you agree, you know what I am talking about, and if you disagree, you will love this film all the more.I know this is sacrilege to filmmakers and impossible, but I would love to see a highly edited version of this film. Take out the healing effects. Cut the modern day beginning and ending off. Remove the language (it's a cruel world, okay okay, I get it), cut massive amounts of build up and redundancies. Let us just watch those incredible performances tell this beautiful story and most of all, let us think. We are not all that stupid, Frankly.",Null,0,1,11 May 2006
Stalag 17," A huge disappointment
","How Billy Wilder was able to miss on such a monumental scale is beyond me, but he sure does with Stalag 17. This movie is not a train wreck, but it is a huge disappointment and certainly belongs nowhere on anyone's top anything list. The story is compelling enough. There is a rat in the POW barracks and nobody knows who it is. But any hope this movie has of making it is dashed by cartoon like performances, cliché characters, preposterous situations and eye rolling stupidity throughout. Do not believe the hype. This is not a good film. Some Like It Hot is a good film, The Apartment is a great film, many Wilder films are fantastic, but this... this is not just a strike, it's one of those misses where the batter falls down.William Holden won the best actor Oscar for his performance as Sefton in this film, and he deserves it, but don't let that fool you. Aside from Holden, Stalag 17 feels more like 'Springtime For Hitler'.",Null,5,11,12 September 2007
