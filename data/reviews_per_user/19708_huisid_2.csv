Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," offensive but even more hilarious
","No doubt many people will find this movie offensive, however I believe that most folks will find that this film's comedy value outshines those issues. My own take was about % 20 offensive and % 80 hilarious. I was most impressed by the wild, hi-stakes hi-jinks Borat engages in, seemingly without warning or pre-planning. In general I oppose humor at the expense of specific groups, however I feel that most of this movie's humor drew upon American culture. I found many of the depictions of American culture familiar but some were a bit surprising. It's not surprising that the folks at the rodeo supports America's 'War of Terror'. Those Frat boys in the movie will probably never get married.",8,2,9,7 November 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Digital projection and 3-D are here to stay
","I was The Nightmare Before Christmas DLP this weekend at our local theater and was very impressed. This film has always been a movie favorite since it was released in 1993 however my favorite part of the film has been the Danny Elfaman soundtrack. This new release was an impressive display of digital projection and 3-D rendering technology. Mad props to the folks at Pixar. I can totally see all movies being digital 3-D within 10 years. Home theater systems are getting so large nowadays there's little technology incentive to go to the cinema otherwise. I also believe that this would save production costs by avoiding printing digital footage on film. I think its unknown at this time whether the digital format will make modern films more susceptible to piracy. On a good note, the digital sound system at the theater was awesome!",8,0,1,7 November 2006
