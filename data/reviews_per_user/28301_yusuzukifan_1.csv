The Expendables 2," Best action movie in years! Minor Spoiler Alert
","I enjoyed the first Expendables, it had a few flaws, but the jokes and amazing roster of action stars made it worth seeing. The second Expendables was at least twice as good! The jokes were better, the roster was bigger, more fight scenes, better fight scenes, an insane body count. It may not have been as cut throat as Rambo 4, but with the all comedy and references they put into this film, its a must see, and should be a long standing favorite among action fans/martial arts fans. The moment that made this movie for me, was a scene in which Chuck Norris made his first appearance...CHUCK NORRIS MADE A CHUCK NORRIS JOKE! I won't say which one, but its one of the classic Norris jokes. If I have one complaint, Jet Li had a smaller role, but his time was well spent in the movie, with several great lines and one killer fight scene! 10/10, best movie of the year for me, followed by Dark Knight and Avengers,Safe, looking forward to Taken 2.",10,3,14,17 August 2012
