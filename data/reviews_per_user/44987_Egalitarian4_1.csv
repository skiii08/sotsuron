Alien 3," Not that bad
","I watched Aliens 3 a day after watching Aliens and a truly awful 'original Sci Fi Channel' production. Aliens 3 is not a great movie but it's not an abomination, a bomb, or any other word one could use to describe a one-star movie.The plotting was trite and the script unremarkable, but I've seen much worse. You can tell the effects are not as well-done as the previous installment. Sequels are generally not as good as the original so why expect much? Approach it as a medium-budget, dry sci-fi/bloody horror flick without a whole lot of soul.At least the cast has a number of actors one often sees on Masterpiece Theater. Try browsing IMDb while you watch this one and amuse yourself with the 'where have I seen that guy before' game.",5,1,63,4 January 2009
