10 Cloverfield Lane," not bad
","I thought it would be a more alien holocaust. Rather than its kinda survival. some things are uncleared why. how & why that happened! not so good, not so bad. actress mary was great in her acting",7,0,0,23 June 2018

Ready Player One," another good movie of 2018
","Another great creation of steven spielberg. great movie, wonderful CGI. STORY LINE is not the best, but pretty good. Not that much violence. comedy film, kids will love it. i'm impressed with its visual effeect.",7,0,1,21 June 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best Combat action!!!
",One of the best hand to hand combat action movie. The way cap & winter soldier fought with bear hand was really impressive. Sending nick fury off to grid was really cool. Bucky did great as a winter soldier. Black widow & sam did great. Its a complete action entertainment movie. Storyline was great. :),9,0,0,23 June 2018
Armageddon," Best space movie!

A Quiet Place," dont dare to make sounds!!!!!!
","Best thrilling movie of 2018. absolutely brilliant. Our life is full of making sounds. You cant even type without making sounds. But guess, in a world, you cant make a single bit sounds, cause, if you do it, death gonna come to get you.. :D Thats all. watch it. worthy of time :) ( while you will watch this movie, you gonna hold your breath for sometimes, will forget to take a breath. cause it can make a SOUNDDDD!!)",8,2,5,21 June 2018
Black Panther," Not best but Good
","This movie is good, chadwick did his best in this movie. action was great , CGI is awesome. Mainly highly appreciation from this movie is, showing the african's culture,their passion, their way of life. Also we got some best character from it like SURI. 
But to me, storyline is bit disappointing. A villain came to wakanda, claimed his throne & also got it by trail combat. Its kinda like, cap america can also be a King if he can beat panther. ( & i think, cap can beat panther) with storyline, the movie great. i enjoyed it :)",7,0,2,21 June 2018

",This movie is too much complicated. Thats all from me :),6,0,1,21 June 2018
Me Before You," Nothing to say!
","This is a a movie, mixture of happiness, joy & end with sadness.
i didnt expect its ending this way. Bit sad, but a complete enjoyable romantic movie :)",8,2,3,21 June 2018
