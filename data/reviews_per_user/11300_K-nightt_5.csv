Black Swan," Fighting the double
","The pervasive theme in this film is the struggle one has with their own shadow... It becomes clear that Nina is trying to embody the puritanical mode of being, yet disavowing her dark side.. but the latter provides an overwhelming resistance as time passes, showing itself in sublimated manners, as it tries to free itself. Clawing away at her skin consistently is an indication of this destructive force trying desperately to find liberation. Now, the dance she engages in with this figure takes on interesting contours. The child being seen as the symptom of its parents casts a stronger light on the mother figure, who cries as she paints, who castrated herself in order to obey some greater calling in life, who smacks the daughter who tries to defuse herself from the imposing phallic mother (phallic yet castrated, creating a weird amalgam). If fusion is the tendency, is the norm, can one imposing object be replaced with another? Nina grapples with the notion of fusion or destruction of her double, a self-confident sexualized version of herself; the scene where Nina engages in sexual acts with 'Lily' represents the sought-for incestuous bond with her own split off part it could be looked at as her reintegrating herself with her mother, but in a much more psychically-accepting manner, since true incest would be intolerable. The hallucinatory and delusional undertones color the film in a manner which may preclude any definitive interpretations. In a mind-boggling final act, the white swan is enticed by her own darkness, murders the split-off double, allowing fusion of her pure and her destructive/sexual parts when this occurs, it is clear which part predominates, the black swan astounding the spectators with her seductive guise. Reality becomes unbearable, it is made clear Nina, in trying to destroy her primitive projection, was in truth attacking self in fantasy and reality, and she ran back to her psychic haven, which she was familiar with thus the white swan reemerges the autistic self does not regard the outside world, she is pervaded by persecutory internal objects, and she must devise an illusory beautiful self and commit the ultimate sacrifice in order to die the 'perfect' death fantasy is consummated, she rids herself in all ways of the lethal forces inside her, but to do so is to die once again as a fused being, in denial of her shadow.",9,1,4,12 December 2010
Hotel Rwanda," Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle...
","Films like this remind me why life is just one big ball of tragedy. It is very difficult to live life happily unless all these horrible facts of reality are summarily swept under the proverbial rug in our minds. Don Cheadle does a reasonably OK job in his role as the messianic hero, although his face is usually stamped with helpless despair most of the time, a lot of time the fact that he is acting oozes through the lens a little too intensely. The film tap-dances around the horrific violence going on in the periphery, there is minimal on-screen violence shown. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop and there be an actual depiction of the massacre going on. But, in the end, it was an attempt to shed some light on the Western world's indifference to the suffering of a split-off continent that is kept in captivity by the superpowers, kind of reminds me of the film 'Martyrs', except in geographic terms, and applied to about 1 billion people in 54 countries. Now, the ridiculous thing about this movie, in my opinion, is how the main actor does this 'heroic' thing for all the refugees, and yet ends up leaving his country and moving to Belgium, where it's all white and safe; again, the racial and economic split is created, but people swallow it easier since the actor is black, but the egregious disregard for human life is eternally stamped on the final message of this film... after all, who cares if 700,000 people lost their lives in this atrocious genocide, as long as the charismatic wealthy hero who knew all the right white guys comes out unscathed?",6,1,1,26 July 2010
Closer," A fended-off desire for intimacy
","In this film, the overarching story is one of futile sexuality, a sexuality that is used in a counter-intuitively destructive manner. Consummation is procured not with the intention of creating life, but of harming another person. And, as much as animalistic allusions are referred to and this seemingly incessant drive to reach a state of primitive ecstasy is echoed time and again, whenever sexual acts are described, they are done so in a dehumanized, emotionless manner, as if to say that they can only exist as an abstraction. This is reinforced by the fact that the acts are never actually shown, only talked about. Julia Roberts portrays perhaps the most tragic character of all, as she becomes the 'sad stranger' in an ever-changing partner merry-go-round, yet, as Larry put it, she does not want to be happy, and has to compromise in order to avoid being swallowed by uncertainty. As she kisses Dan at the beginning of the film, her camera goes off, and she immediately stops she makes sad strangers look beautiful in photographs, and when her picture is taken, she runs the risk of looking beautiful, a threat which proves too big. Equally living in a psychogenic vortex is Dan himself, who pines for his mother every night and tries to sublimate this by engaging in intercourse with unknown women, he cannot risk becoming dependent on someone who may ultimately leave him (as parents almost inexorably do). He desires Anna 'because she doesn't need' him. When he's on the computer talking to Larry, he personifies his conflict well. He cannot have the desired object, thus he must become the object, and control her fate he pretends to have an orgasm as Anna, yet says it was not good, closing in the fantasy that he is the only man who can provide Anna with a pleasurable sexual experience, he controls her orgasmic thrill, as it was. The movie's title tantalizingly denotes how at so many different points in the film one character is longing for a holding, comforting 'other', yet this other is never in the same place. Scene after scene we observe one person crying and begging for some sign of mirroring affection, but crying is reproached by the detached party, in a sick fourth-dimensional mockery of human relations, yet one that is very accurate in showing that when one succumbs to the desire of the other (showing vulnerability, devotion, commitment), desire is killed. They are all spheres in themselves who are too afraid to touch because they may fuse, so an intellectualized verbal experience of intimacy is all they can hope for.",8,1,2,24 May 2011
City of God," Why people love this movie
","I may be wrong (I'm not), but I imagine that most of IMDb's audience is composed of prepubescent, middle- to upper-middle class mamas-boys who hide behind the incognito status in an ill-conceived attempt to seem tough. And that's fine, and yes I have a point. People like you need this movie to be based on the truth, you're so warped in your overprotected, sterile life in a ridiculously puritan culture that this kind of intangible reality is all you have left to keep you from offing your fellow virgin colleagues at school. What else is a major factor in this unconditional love for having other people live a life of misery and violence? Ignorance (deep...). The stupider the person, the more one-dimensional their outlook is on foreign culture. They think Africa, their minds rush off to a malnourished Somali child with a hood over his head in a refugee camp... nothing else matters to them, that's Africa and that's final. Now, think Brazil... samba, Pele, Rio, poverty, violence, drugs... and all that noise. That's all this country is... nobody can walk the streets without being ransacked by a half-dozen monkey boys who will take your money, rape you and thrash you to within an inch of your life. All women are prostitutes, all people do all day is watch reruns of Pele's soccer matches and dance to Carnival music. Now, I've lived in Brazil for some 18 years, 2 of them in São Paulo, I've been to Rio, and I currently reside in one of the wealthier cities in the country (wealth in Brazil?? he must mean he owns a lot of soccer-playing prostitutes). I've never been mugged (what?? you just said you went to Rio!!). This city is overrun by BMW's, high-powered executives, and a ridiculously high standard of living, you rarely see a beggar walking the streets... by the way, I live in Brazil. Now, if you're as retarded as I imagine you are, you're there with a pathetic smirk on your acne-ridden face going 'well la-di-da for you'. I want you to mock me, because by doing so you're confessing to being a moron. Now, about the movie. I loved it... it's great micro-nonfiction that summarizes in a very stylized manner an issue going on in the ostracized portions of society, the portions that some people need to live in pain in order to feel better about themselves (yes, you..). Now, what's the problem with it? It echoes the stereotype the American society embraces as supreme regarding life outside their fortress, and the fact that the director is Brazilian furthers this stupidity. I'm not going to waste my time lecturing potential viewers, everyone has their head cemented miles up their own a*s, inertia is a major lifestyle, self-indulgence is the most pragmatic of dogmas that you people perpetrate on yourselves, your opinion is an absolute truth, no matter how much of it is based on creative coloring-in of the proverbial blanks (in most cases, a blank sheet). Not to worry, as long as you stay tucked within your make-believe world, nothing will harm you... be safe, the world never was any bigger than you wanted it to be; blame your parents for that, they activated the self-destruct button in your brain long before you were born.",9,1,6,7 June 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," That's 2 for 2, Pasolini
","So, the first film I attempted to watch was The Decameron, a rather entertaining book by Boccaccio; I made through about half before giving up. This time, despite tenacious attempts to get through the whole thing, history repeated itself, I stopped after around an hour. Not that it was overly disturbing for my naïve little eyes to behold... it was truly a stupid movie with absolutely unconvincing performances. The premise is a bunch of teenagers whisked away to a distant location (away from the eyes of the law) by some fascist authority figures who have an obsession with butts. Thus, they have anal intercourse whenever the mood strikes, they eat excrement, and tell moronic stories about gluteal prowess as aphrodisiacs. Now, I'm trying to imagine a scenario in real life where this could actually happen. Nothing comes up. Pasolini has a unique talent for finding ugly actors for his movies, ugly actors with no talent, mind you (some of the girls were cute). Anyway, that's 2 strikes for this director in my book, I won't be looking for a third. I'd tell him to keep it up, but he's already dead.",2,3,11,23 January 2010
