Mission: Impossible III," By far and away the best of the MI movies to date...
","By far and away the best of the MI movies to date, the first having the gall to make the character Jim Phelps from the original TV series into the villain (what were they thinking, and what quicker way to alienate an established fan base?) and the second abandoning the old MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE team formula completely, making it a one-man show and just cashing in on Cruise and the title.Here the formula is re-established. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now the IMF team leader, having been coaxed back into the field from the training of potential new IMF agents. A team is assembled, with photos and bios a little more hi-tech from the 60s presentation perhaps, and each rightly having their own distinct personality and expertise. Not only that, they are given three (appropriately) Impossible Missions to perform, namely rescuing a fellow agent (and one of Hunt's students) from captivity in Berlin; kidnapping the world's no. 1 villain and arms-dealer (Hoffman) from inside the supposedly impregnable, security-wise, Vatican City itself, and also, as a bonus, leaving the world, and more importantly his buyers, to believe he's dead, then a daring raid atop the nighttime skyscrapers of Shanghai to steal the mysterious and much sought after weapon 'The Rabbit's Foot', the nature of which is never disclosed, and therefore which, like NORTH BY NORTHWEST and many other Hitchcock movies, becomes the 'MacGuffin' of the movie. Hoffman's character sums this up best with the line 'What I'm selling and who I'm selling it to are the least of your problems'. Added to all this is the fact that that Hunt is now romantically involved and his spouse consequently becomes the target of Hoffman's villain's revenge, and also adds a much needed humanity to Cruise's character.The wit and wiles of TV's IMF squad are admittedly replaced here by ridiculous yet riveting stunts, but when these are beautifully realised and executed under the direction of veteran 2nd Unit director and stuntman/co-ordinator Vic (Bond) Armstrong, you can't go far wrong, especially with a budget that Eon would cry for.British actor Simon Pegg (SHAUN OF THE DEAD - see my review in the archives) makes a welcome appearance as a 'Q' like computer boffin at IMF HQ, and eventual reluctant inside man to rogue agent Hunt. As I know of Simon's love of cult 60s TV this must have been a dream of a job. He's also appeared in the new BBC DR. WHO series and narrates their accompanying 'Behind the Scenes' documentaries. Good man Simon.Recent multi-award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman's (CAPOTE) villain is wonderfully underplayed and just plain arrogant and mean. He's great in this, and I couldn't help but feel there was a little, perhaps deliberate, touch of the Bond/Le Schiffre frisson (in the notorious wicker chair sequence in the original CASINO ROYALE novel) in the attention grabbing teaser which may foreshadow that forthcoming movie. The final and inevitable punch-up between him and Cruise is particularly, and necessarily, brutal and satisfying. The rest of the cast also pull off some top notch performances, considering the material.On top of all that there's more of Lalo Schifrin's glorious original MISSION music, notably the militaristic 'THE PLOT', which underscores the team's preliminary preparations, as it should. Okay, the identity of the inevitable double-agent/sneak within the IMF organisation is a bit telegraphed, but that's okay. At least it gives you the satisfaction of thinking you've sorted one of the plot points out ahead of everyone else.Considering that the spy TV series of the 60s were spawned by the Bond movies, this one has surpassed its progenitor. This is Ludlum meets Fleming, i.e.: Bourne meets Bond, and both of those franchises are going to have to go some to beat this.This one also puts the floundering Cruise firmly, and literally, back in the picture.",8,6,10,8 February 2008
Deja Vu," If you can work out the resolution, then congratulations...
","Have I seen this before? Sorry, an obvious blundersome and unworthy introduction, probably brought about by my recent viewing of another of Val Kilmer's movies, TOP SECRET, where he meets a French Resistance operative named Déjà Vu who introduces himself with the line ''Ave we not met before monsieur?'.As part of their investigation, Doug Carlin, Agent Andrew Pryzwarra and Jack McCready, investigators of a post Katrina New Orleans ferry terrorist attack in which over 500 persons are killed, are viewing on screen the events of four and a half days previously. Initially, Denzel's character thinks he's watching simple enhanced satellite and CCTV footage, but then realises there's more to it than that. He then at one point flashes a penlight at a supposedly four day old image of a girl on the screen and she reacts to it. It turns out that this is a system which, through the bending of the oft-taken-advantage-of space-time continuum, enables them to actually watch, live, the events of four days previously and that the observers can also interact with the observed. So, the premise goes on, if we can watch the said events, can we influence those events? Denzel's character's motivation is the simple fact that he has already seen this girl's body in the morgue, and now he may have a chance of saving her life. And she's cute. First they send a document back, then, inevitably, they send Denzel himself back.There's an interesting chase sequence where, with the aid of some hi-tech jiggery-pokery head-set jobby (a goggle-rig they call it), Washington chases a four day old image of the suspect's vehicle, with the current-day world in one eye, and four days previous in the other. It is admittedly imaginative.As with all films of this type though, there is the problem of the paradox. If the motivation for changing things in the past is removed, then those events will not be interfered with and will therefore occur. It's not a spoiler, but if you have to go back in time to save someone's life and succeed, then there is no reason to go back in time, so you don't, and therefore they will die, so you have to go back in time etc etc. It's a no-win scenario. Also there is the problem that if, as the technos tell us in the movie, that nothing can be sent back, why have they got a chamber constructed, that will hold something the size of a man, in order to do just that? However, as I've said, it is imaginatively done and will keep you hooked from start to finish, and Washington gives a great and easy looking performance, which is a skill in itself.And if you can work out the resolution, then congratulations.",7,0,1,8 February 2008
Casablanca," More than the sum of its parts...
","CASABLANCA of course needs no introduction, being hailed by many as one of the finest movies ever made, albeit accidentally. I have to say it's been many years since I watched it and I'd forgotten just how good it is. The dialogue is slick, witty and economical and has rightly, with allegedly a little rephrasing from Bogart, spawned some of the most quoted lines in movie history. I lost count of the number of frivolously double-edged and charmingly barbed lines delivered by Rains' Capt. Renault, to whom everyone is a target at the beginning of the movie, almost as if he were unsure of exactly whose side he was on, which is most likely the case as the script was constantly being re-doctored and changed during filming. Even Bergman, who was already preoccupied with the prospect of her next film, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, had to ask which guy she was meant to be in love with. With the typical ambiguity evident in the rest of the production, she was told to 'play it down the middle'. In fact none of the actors had any more idea of how the whole thing was going to end than the audience did on first viewing.Everything that makes CASABLANCA a great film seems to have been by happy accident. Originally cast in the three lead roles were Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan. Doesn't bear thinking about does it? Thankfully they were unavailable. The now classic 'As Time Goes By' was an established hit that was specified in the original play, but score composer Max Steiner (KING KONG, GONE WITH THE WIND) tried hard to have it replaced by one of his own compositions. Bergman however had by this time had her hair cropped for FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, which made it impossible to reshoot the necessary scenes (at least that's what they told Steiner). As it is, as the NFT said in 1974, 'the sum of all its many marvelous parts far exceeds the whole'.",10,1,2,7 February 2008
Training Day," Edge of the seat entertainment...
","Denzel Washington plays Detective Alonzo Harris, a hardnosed, street savvy narcotics cop given charge of rookie cop Jake (Hawke). As Jake's 'Training Day' progresses he learns that his Police Academy rules don't apply in Alonzo's world, and with increasing concern, not to mention personal jeopardy, finds that Alonzo, some of his fellow detectives and even higher officials in the LAPD, have distinct rules of their own.Not an original premise, but here the delivery is bang on. Washington plays on his past comfortable screen personas, initially coming across as the experienced, tough, no-nonsense, but well meaning, detective. We of course, like Hawke's character Jake, a rookie eager to please, are initially taken in by this, but it is not long before doubts about Alonzo's true nature and agenda start to kick in.There are many disturbing things about this film, not least of which is the fact that no-one has come forward to say that it ain't really like that on the streets of LA  in fact they endorsed its accuracy by giving Washington an Oscar for his portrayal.However, Washington's performance is electric and worthy of its Academy Award. Alonzo is charismatic, persuasive, powerful, dangerous and downright scary. Ethan Hawke compliments this with a portrayal that runs the gamut from initial naivety and respect, through wary tolerance, to disbelief, terror and finally rage, in a performance necessarily powerful enough to counter Washington. The two are equally compelling to watch and provide edge of the seat entertainment in a gripping, raw and violent tale of lies, betrayal, corruption and abuse of power (sorry to use the old maxims there, but here they actually apply).Highly recommended.",8,1,2,8 February 2008
Underworld," Target audiences and horror fans will love it...
","This movie has had some bad press, so, as you can imagine, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying it and actually wondering what was going to happen next.Underworld, as a little too lengthy a prologue tells us, is set in a world where humans unknowingly share the planet with two other warring species  the Vampires and the Lycans (Werewolves). The war has lasted for centuries and the Vampires are winning  or so they think. The Lycans have got a few little genetically modified tricks up their furry sleeves and some moles in the Vampire camp (now it's not often you can string that kind of a sentence), and when a romance starts to develop between a Vampire and a prospective Lycan, all the old wounds are opened - and eagerly chewed at. Sorry.The plot is reasonably, but not too, complicated and has a few nice twists. The imagery is suitably dark and Crow-like (Brandon, not Russell) and being mostly filmed in Budapest the architecture is decidedly Anton Furst/Gotham City Gothic.The action too is derivative of many other films: there's plenty of John Woo double-fisted gunfire; Lots of Matrix leaping around in long coats and tight leather; American Werewolf transformation scenes (sometimes a little jerky), and a fair share of Blade-style bloodletting.And this is why I think it got the negative reviews it did. It is shamelessly derivative. Fortunately though the story and some good performances make up for this, and it's hard to see how else they could have told such a story without these style graphics, and after all, if something is proved to work well, then use it, and I think audiences have now come to expect it.Also enjoyable to watch is the usually light comedy actor Bill Nighy (Love Actually) who obviously felt it was time to (literally) get his teeth into something a bit meatier, as he revels in the role of the Vampire Lord Viktor.Target audiences and horror fans will love it, though there will be uproar when they see Vampires casting reflections in mirrors. But Kate does look good in that leather. Move over Trinity",7,1,2,8 February 2008
Shaun of the Dead," I really can't recommend this highly enough to both horror and Brit-com fans...
","What's that? A British comedy you say? Hugh Grant is it? No? Well, at least Richard Curtis will have written it so it should be o.k. What? He's not involved either? Surely you jest! No I do not. Thank God there are some courageous people out there or this would never have been given the green light, which would have been a tragedy because it's one of the most original, refreshing and downright funny British films for years.No-hoper Shaun (Pegg) is stuck in a rut. His life is on hold, much to the frustration of his girlfriend Liz (Ashfield). The situation is not helped by the ever-present Ed (Frost), Shaun's best friend, but who sadly is a lazy, computer game playing slob with the tendency to drag the devoted Shaun down with him. Shaun's life revolves around (apart from Ed that is) his local pub, the Winchester, but Liz wants him to motivate himself, to be more adventurous and more ambitious. She fails however and finally gives him the elbow. Shaun is gutted. He drowns his sorrows with Ed and in doing so misses out on the overnight takeover of the planet by undead zombies ('don't use the 'Z' word!'). The next morning, in his hung over state, he routinely walks down to his local shop but is totally oblivious to the carnage and the aforesaid walking dead all about him, only finally noticing when two turn up in his garden. After trying to dispatch them by throwing various kitchen appliances and long-playing records (selected  not the good stuff), Shaun finally discovers that a good whack about the head with a cricket bat does the job. After this rude awakening from their booze induced slumber, Shaun and Ed decide to rescue girlfriend Liz, Shaun's dotty mother and a stepfather he's never gotten along with and take them somewhere they know is safe and secure  the Winchester of course. Easier said than done The origins of the title are obvious and, billed as 'A Romantic Comedy - with Zombies' or a 'Rom-Zom-Com', this is exactly what it says on the can. The Zombies are suitably Romero-ish and deadly serious; the action is as graphic as it gets with guts being ripped out and limbs ripped off (but still handy for beating zombies over the head with) and, although there's plenty of humour along the way to keep the mood light, there is genuine anxiety when these touchingly drawn dysfunctional characters are in jeopardy, which stops it short of being an EVIL DEAD 2, which was funny but plain silly.The entire cast is excellent, particularly Pegg (who also co-wrote the script) and Frost, who virtually reprise their roles from the comedy series SPACED, which also starred Jessica Stevenson and Peter Serafinowicz who have smaller roles in this also. The rest of the cast consists of other luminaries from recent Brit-com series BLACK BOOKS and the award winning THE OFFICE, plus the terrific Penelope Wilton (CALENDAR GIRLS) and Bill Nighy (LOVE ACTUALLY, UNDERWORLD) as Shaun's mum and stepfather.The special features are extensive, in fact more than I think I've seen on any other DVD, and include, as well as all the usual stuff, the full length spoof TV spots and news bulletins that we only see snippets of in the movie, a video diary of two extras who played a couple of zombies, four different audio commentaries and lots more.I'm still chuckling at single lines from the movie ('I don't really think it's in me to shoot my flat-mate, my mother AND my girlfriend all on the same day') and I really can't recommend this highly enough to both horror and Brit-com fans.",8,0,3,8 February 2008
Hostel," As if Americans didn't have enough reasons for not travelling to Europe
","***May Contain Spoilers*** I'm not sure who really benefits from these movies that are 'sponsored' by a big name, by which I'm talking about the 'Quentin Tarantino Presents' part of the title. He did it with HERO and THE PROTECTOR also, and Spielberg has also done it in the past with Landis and Dante movies. They have nothing to do with the production of the movie, so I assume it's just a promotional thing, for both the movie and the sponsor. But if it gives a minor, good movie a bigger profile then fine. As long as it's a good movie.This is, speaking broadly, an amalgam of American WEREWOLF IN London and SAW. Two young male American backpackers are travelling around Europe, Amsterdam in fact, and are given the opportunity to stay at a particular hostel where, well let's say, fun and women are abundant. There is of course a catch.The movie then, after a slow start I must say, moves into the realms of what am I talking about? 'The realms of'? It degenerates rapidly and graphically into butchery. The guys are lured by gorgeous gals into basically what is a slaughter/torture house where sick people with lots of money can live out their macabre fantasies on the bodies of terrified individuals, making use of bolt cutters, chainsaws, blow torches and, well, you name it. There's dismemberment, screams, tendon cutting and gore galore which I'm sure is more than satisfying for those who like this kind of thing.I did squirm a little at some of the 'renditions', but in retrospect, it wasn't the visual depiction that shocked me, more the idea of it which unsettled me, and for which I give due respect. It's nice to know that the power of suggestion is still being employed in this age where anything that can be imagined can be visually presented. That little thing that creeps in behind your mind and lurks there and keeps you unsettled for days afterward is far more powerful and memorable, and is what keeps you thinking and talking about it.So, like I said, apart from the slow start, I can recommend this, but with the warning that it will claw at the back of brain for a while after viewing.You certainly won't look at an electric drill the same way again",Null,0,1,8 February 2008
The Illusionist," Like the movies themselves, all smoke and mirrors...
","Movies are like buses. You wait for ages and then two come along at once. Take, for example, DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon (cobbled together these two would have made a decent movie, which separately, neither of them did), or ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES and Bergin's ROBIN HOOD. Strangely, or perhaps magically, it's the same with movies about late 19th century magicians. In September/October 2006, within ten days of each other, we had THE ILLUSIONIST and THE PRESTIGE, both tales of rivalry, revenge and the quest to discover the secrets behind the magic.Childhood sweethearts Eisenheim and Sophie, peasant's son and aristocrat respectively, are forbidden to meet because of the class difference between them. Eisenhiem travels the world and returns to Vienna a world renowned stage magician. Sophie by this time is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold. Leopold is fascinated by Eisenheim's 'tricks' and orders a private performance so that he might demonstrate his cleverness to his peers by exposing Eisenheim. The magician however turns the tables during this 'demonstration', and, having been made a fool of in front of his colleagues, and especially Sophie, Leopold enlists Inspector Uhl to discover the secrets behind Eisenheim's magic and/or shut him down. Tragedy eventually and inevitably strikes and Eisenheim turns his skills toward the thwarting of Leopold's political plans and his complete downfall.The film is beautifully shot and the period is captured superbly. There were a few slow passages but the ensemble cast work well together, particularly Sewell and Giamatti. Norton does have moments of looking spaced out rather than enigmatic, but the ending was totally satisfying and, to me at any rate, completely unanticipated, which makes a pleasant change.A superior film in my view to THE PRESTIGE, which veered into Mary Shelley/science fiction territory, whereas the magic in THE ILLUSIONIST is simply that  illusion. Like the movies themselves, all smoke and mirrors.Recommended.",7,10,16,8 February 2008
Casino Royale," Such a shame...
","Simply giving a guy a big gun, an Aston Martin and Dame Judy Dench as his boss doesn't make him James Bond.There are things Bond, and Bond movies, must have and do to be Bond, and this guy, and this movie, just hasn't got any of them.Sure he's ruthless, dispassionate and tough as a paid killer should be, but so was Jason Bourne. It can be no coincidence that Robert Ludlum called his amnesiac trained assassin Jason Bourne  JB right? It even sounds like Sean Connery's pronunciation of 'James Bond'. Has the Bond franchise been bullied into hardening up the character to compete with the Bournes, Ethan Hunts and XXXs of the cinematic world? I can see the need to compete, but not to the extent of compromising the character. Don't they realise that all the others are just wannabe Bonds? They're trying to reach his level, so why make it easy by dropping down to theirs? The producers would have us believe that this is a new Bond. 'Forget the past' they say. But how can we? I've often said that Bond should go back to its roots and be started all over again afresh, it needed to and this was their golden opportunity, but they've done it half-heartedly and made a hash of it.It's already established in the Bond timeline that Bond is the veteran agent (no matter who played him), that he's been married (Lazenby wed in OHMSS, but the relationship was also referred to in OCTOPUSSY and LICENCE TO KILL, Moore and Dalton movies respectively), and that Judy Dench's 'M' is the newcomer. Now we are to believe that she is the veteran 'M' and Bond is the newly promoted agent. If this is supposedly a new Bond, why is she even there? She links the character with the previous movies. Having a completely new 'M' also would have helped enormously, Dame Judy's presence just screws it up.As to Bond himself, Daniel Craig, no matter how gifted an actor, is NOT Bond. The character is clearly defined and described in the books, and Craig just does not fit in any respect. The obvious starter is the fact that Bond as described is definitely not blonde. He certainly doesn't look like an ex-boxer. So, is this 'Ian Fleming's James Bond' as claimed in the credits, or is it now 'Micheal G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli's James Bond'? Also this is supposed to be a younger Bond at the beginning of his 00 career. Can any of you really tell me that Craig looks appreciably younger than Brosnan? Yes, Bond is a hired killer, and as I said earlier, ruthless, dispassionate, cruel even, but he's also handsome (sorry Daniel), suave, sophisticated, well educated, well heeled, has good tailors and knows his food and his drinks. He has to in order to mix in the circles in which he may find himself. Bond would never respond to the question 'Shaken or stirred sir?' with 'Do I look like I give a ****'. Bond was often shaken, but never stirred. James Bond was also an accomplished bullshitter. If you've ever read 'The Book of Bond  Every Man his own 007', supposedly written by 'M's Chief of Staff, and Bond's friend, Bill Tanner, but actually written by Kingsley Amis, you will find examples from the books to illustrate that if Bond doesn't know something he deftly makes up something, based on his experience, intelligence and education I hasten to add, totally feasible and believable in order to maintain his aura of total infallibility. Still bullshit all the same, but never, EVER would he allow himself to appear to be a simple thug (unless it suited his purposes of course). This is what makes him James Bond and the character that all other movie spies have aspired to since the franchise began. Think of all the characters, movies and TV series Bond has inspired: The Man from UNCLE, The Avengers, Mission Impossible and yes, even Jason Bourne, in fact any spy character created since 1962's DR. NO you can guarantee the creator has had James Bond at the back of his mind. If they can't BE James Bond, they counter James Bond with characters like Harry Palmer, David Callan or Alec Leamas, or they spoof James Bond with Derek Flint, Matt Helm and Austin Powers (though how you can spoof something that was a spoof in the first place). Bond also doesn't live in this world, and trying to make him a part of the real world just doesn't work. Bond lives in an exotic world, a world some of us wish we could be a part of, but our only link is through the screen. I don't go to see a Bond movie expecting reality, human frailty, serious drama  I want to see James Bond! It's been famously said that Bond is the man most men want to be and the man most women want to be with. There's a magic, a surrealism to Bond, and this movie just hasn't got it. It's a good movie (which is why it gets a 7), but it's not a Bond movie.Craig's character, and I mean that quite pointedly, states at the end of the movie that 'The name's Bond. James Bond'. Well, sorry, but no it isn't. It could be anybody. Maybe it was just put in to remind us what, and who, we were watching, either way it's killed my future interest in the franchise.Such a shame.",7,5,7,8 February 2008
