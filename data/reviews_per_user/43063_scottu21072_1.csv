United 93," United 93 Was A Sad & Very Heroic Tale
","After watching the movie United 93, I almost wanted to cry in my seat at the theater. The audience was completely silent and somber when the movie had finished and the lights went up in the theater. Nobody talked. Nobody said a single word. People just slowly got out of their seat and left the theater with sad faces or tears in their eyes. United 93 reminds us all of what happened on September 11, 2001. It reminds us of who are as Americans and where we were when the 9/11 tragedy struck the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. United 93 also made me realize that the President of the United States is one of the luckiest men in the world. For all we known, the terrorists aboard United 93 might have been using the 737-222 aircraft to try and crash into the White House in Washington, D.C., but we will never know for sure. What we do know for a fact is that United 93 was heading for Washington, D.C. and that the brave passengers aboard the aircraft prevented the terrorists from reaching their intended target. What makes the President of the United States so lucky is that common, ordinary American people on United 93 sacrificed their lives to save the lives of those living in Washington, D.C., including the President of the United States (although the president wasn't in Washington, D.C. at the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks). How many times has a President of the United States been lucky at avoiding assassination attempts against his life? How many times have ordinary American people, or American soldiers, or Secret Service agents sacrificed their lives to save the President of the United States? Although I was a little hesitant about seeing United 93 at the theater, I am glad that I did watch the movie. It made me realize how important it is to remember the people in our own personal lives (friends, family and relatives) who mean the most to us and how we should call them on the phone more often and say how much we love them in our hearts. After watching United 93 at the theater, I called my mother at home and told her how much I loved her and how important she is to me in my life. That is how great of an impact that United 93 made on my life after watching the movie. I wanted to cry and it made me think about the passengers of United 93, my country, my mother and the President of the United States.I would encourage people (especially young teenagers) to go watch United 93 in their local movie theaters. It is an excellent movie and it seems to be very accurate in its details. It will remind you to never forget about those who sacrificed their lives on United 93. And by watching the movie, you will feel as though you are paying your respects to the honor and the memory of those who gave their lives in the cause of American freedom and liberty on United 93.",10,2,6,30 April 2006
