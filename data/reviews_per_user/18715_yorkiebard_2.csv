Source Code," HP Source Code
","The HP in the title is 'high power' as I have to admit that this is one hell of a ride. The Groundhog day, Quantum leap scenario sounds on paper as though it could be a worldwide bore but the excellence of Jake Gyllenhall's acting puts you on a knife-edge of sweat inducing panic and the story telling is so fine that I applaud all involved in pulling off what I dare to say is several feet higher in excellence than 'Inception,' another mind-bender. There I've said it and not been hit by lightning, 'Source Code' is brilliant and a very satisfying train ride that I would quite happily pay again to see. Telling the story in this review is inadequate, go and see it, again and again and again and... sorry, caught in a time loop somewhere in Chicago!",8,0,2,9 April 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The EPIC to serve us all
","The heart that carries this movie is much more than the extension to the RINGS saga it may seem. The depth of landscape is on such a grand scale that it dwarfs (no pun intended) any other epic. The sfx skills have taken leaps and bounds to convince that the actors have genuinely taken reduction pills? A gripping story line pretty much blows away the doubters that just one book couldn't carry it. Martin Freeman gives a great performance of an innocent caught up in something beyond his little world. Even the opening sequence of the dragon attack was way beyond any other start to a movie. This wasn't just a bunch of guys beset with Fantasy problems, it was a quest beyond all quests. One of the few films I could happily have immediately watched again. A great accomplishment, well done Peter.",10,3,8,5 January 2013
