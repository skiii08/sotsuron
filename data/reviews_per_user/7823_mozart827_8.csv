Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just one or two comments
","I don't think I need to go into all things that I liked and disliked about the film, merely because pretty much everyone else has mentioned them a zillion times before. However, I would like to voice my opinion on one aspect of this film: the special effects.Unlike most reviews, I found the effects a bit over-rated. To me, CGI is becoming much too common in movies these days. The effect of this is that movies tend to become sanitized and exhibit a 'sameness' and less of a sense of realism. One reason why I like the original trilogy much more is that the ships and aliens feel more real to me. The computer generated aliens of TMP are just too outrageous for my tastes and lack a sense of biological realism. With a couple of exceptions, spacecraft and other vehicles in most movies these days seem too shiny, too nice, and look like they've been computer generated. Models still look better to me. So, all-in-all, the SFX were very good, simply over used and over-rated.",8,0,0,13 December 2000
Snatch," Good film
","Weird, funny, and enjoyable, this was much better than LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS. The characters were a riot and the acting good to excellent from all of the cast.I recommend this film.",8,0,0,29 January 2001
Moulin Rouge!," A wonderful trip!
","Moulin Rouge was Gilbert & Sullivan meet MTV meets Terry Gilliam. I found this movie to be much funnier than I expected and visually stunning. I would like to respond to two previous reviews: Marya-3: I am 30 and would not consider myself to be 'very young'. (I remember when MTV actually played music and not the garbage it does today.) And so I think that the music used in the film was from my generation. Furthermore, to Burkemt29, so what if the gun took a trajectory that was not likely or that the the music wasn't correct for the period? It wasn't supposed to be an accurate portrayal of the Parisian Bohemian underground, IMHO, it was a surreal trip, a musical that was visually 'Spectacular Spectacular' and a treat in the vast morass of cinematic nonsense that has been saturating our movie houses.I think that movie-goers need to adjust their thinking to accommodate the type of picture that one is seeing. Allow yourself a little suspension of disbelief and don't try to nit-pick every detail that seems slightly out of place. If you want complete accuracy in a story, rent a documentary or read a book.",10,0,1,11 June 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," I LOVE THIS FILM!!!
","This is by far my all-time-favorite movie. Even today, the effects are stunning (much better than most CGI stuff today), the story mind-boggling, the music wonderful. A film like this could probably not have been made today with so little dialogue and such extended, beautiful scenes of space-travel. It's an essentially perfect film.",10,1,3,2 November 2000
Enemy at the Gates," Very good with a few flaws
","Overall I thought this was a very good film with excellent performances all around (I really like Ed Harris, one of the most underrated actors, IMHO). My two main complaints are the totally gratuitous sex scene and the wolf hunt at the start of the film (I'm not too happy about people killing wolves).",8,0,1,13 April 2001
Shrek," Funniest movie all year!
",The funniest movie since THE FULL MONTY!I've not laughed so hard in ages! The script was great and all of the spoofs and parodies wonderful. I LOVED the dragon! Great stuff!,10,1,1,18 June 2001
Casino," AWFUL!!!!
","I absolutely hated this film. It was a complete waste of time, money, and celluloid. The only reason I endured the interminable hours spent on screen by the unpleasant, boring, borish, and nasty characters and the very bad story was I was keeping my friend out of his house so his wife could set up a surprise birthday party. (Actually, there was one redeming quality to it-- the look at the inner workings of a casino was interesting, but the Discovery Channel version was better, without the incessant profanity.)",1,10,41,29 November 2000
Cube," Very good overall
","I found this film to very intriguing and would agree with most of the previous comments. ***SPOILERS: I would especially agree with the comments that the ending was rather weak and unsatisfying. The 'bloodbath' was unnecessary and served little point to me. END SPOILERS**** I would, however, disagree that it should be remade with a larger budget. The minimalist feel in both the sets and little-known actors I think very much adds to the film and directs your attention to the characters and their development. The watcher would be distracted by flashy effects and big-name actors.",7,0,1,23 April 2001
