The Legend of Bagger Vance," Who would ever guess that a movie about golf could be so exciting?
","Who did know? I sure as heck didn't.  Usually when you look down the list of past golf movies, you see movies such as, 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Tin Cup.' Even though both movies were enjoyable, they weren't great and could not really make golf that exciting.  'The Legend of Bagger Vance' captures all the excitement that golf can have.  Sadly, Hollywood does not make many movies like this anymore, where you don't have to have explosions and head cuttings to make a movie good and exciting.  All of the performances in the movie were magnificient.  Especially from Will Smith, where when you go down his list of movies you see 'Independence Day', 'Bad Boys', and 'MIB.'  For me, this was his breakthrough performance, stunning my eyes in awe as a man who can only fire a gun all of a sudden giving a brilliant performance as a man who helps and guides another man through his problems in life.  In this case, it is golf but this movie can be applied to life, in which Will Smith's only reward was to see the other man better off.  If you want to see a movie to make you not be able to think and comprehend anything above lights moving in front of your eyes, see 'The Fifth Element.'  If you want to see what Hollywood has lost and should have back, and what makes you think and makes movie watching an experience, then watch 'The Legend of Bagger Vance.'  And remember that a good movie isn't what makes you sit and enjoy, but what makes you think and experience.",Null,0,1,1 May 2001
Schindler's List," A movie of perfection in every way
","The most powerful and most well done movie in history, Schindler's List was immediately called a masterpiece.  Number 9 on AFI's Top 100 List, Schindler's List is Steven Spielberg's greatest work and John Williams greatest music. Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oskar Schindler, Ben Kingsley's performance as Itshak Stern, and Ralph Fiennes as the villain Amon Goeth you are put in the middle of the most accurate and true portrayal of the holocaust.",10,9,13,10 August 1999
The Elephant Man," A masterpiece about the triumph of a man against society
","This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is the story of John Merrick who was severely deformed.  His deformity is a deformity of appearance and stature but not of the heart and soul.  This movie should remind everyone who watches it about the prejudice and ignorance of society.  Personally, I thought John Merrick (John Hurt) was more beautiful than any of the people who laughed at him and made fun of him.I knew this movie was going to be great from the beginning when Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins) first sees him in the shadows.  It shows a close-up of Anthony Hopkins' face and shows a tear form.  This may also have been a foreshadowing to how much I would be crying throughout the entire movie. Superbly made in every possible way, The Elephant Man will stay in my memory for many years to come.  I will remember this every time I remember injustice and cowardice of men to face what they don't understand and what is truly beautiful.",10,1,4,30 January 2001
