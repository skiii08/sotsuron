First Man," Disappointing - Expected more ....
","Good biography of Neil Armstrong - First man on the moon 
But must admit was expecting a lot more - Probably spoiled by 'Apollo 13' so expected a comparison but not to be.
Thought the 2 main characters were quite flat but the Moon trip was good.
OK film but expected a lot more.",6,32,56,11 October 2018
Us," Disappointing Sequel - No real storyline
","Was looking forward to this film following on from some good reviews.
Was disappointed - Storyline was predictable and not very gripping.
Good acting by the lead actors but went nowhere - Sorry to say not a great experience.",5,3,7,23 March 2019
Aquaman," Solid Escapism Film
","Great fun film - With Good lead actors - Great underwater scenes and action packed
Looks prime for a sequel ?",7,2,3,26 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Good - But with all the hype expected better ....
",Following all the hype about this film went along with great expectations - Film had good characters and storyline but failed to live up to my expectations - Great film for the children but not a 10/10 film,7,1,2,26 April 2019
Joker," Outstanding Film
","This film slowly gets you gripped - Joaquin Phoenix must be a dead cert for an Oscar !
Was not sure what to expect but slowly the film absorbs you and mesmerising you with the performances.
Quite gruesome at times - Great performance by Robert De Niro.
But it's Joaquin Phoenix who is simply outstanding - The dance scene to the music of Gary Gltter is just pure magic.
Left the cinema physically drained not felt like this after a film for a long time.
Best picture for Oscar in my opinion
Simply breathtaking !",8,2,3,19 October 2019
Green Book," Great Road trip movie with outstanding performances by the 2 lead actors
",Went into this film not knowing anything about the storyline - Brilliant performances by the 2 leads - Strong storyline about a road trip to Deep South USA and the racial tensions at the time - Great film which develops along the trip - Worth a view,8,4,8,8 January 2019
