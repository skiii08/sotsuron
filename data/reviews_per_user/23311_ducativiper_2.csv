Iron Man 3," The worst movie I have seen in recent memory
","I have never written a review for a movie on IMDb but the ridiculousness of this movie has compelled me to finally do it. If you have liked the other Marvel movies thus far, then do not see this one! Basically everything you love about Iron Man isn't in this movie. It is a movie about Tony Stark rather than Iron Man. In the past, his suits have held up against Tank artillery, fighter jet machine gun artillery, and Thor's hammer, but in this movie it falls apart over and over again. In the end Tony is saved by a glowing Gwenyth Paltrow... shoot me, I really wish I hadn't seen this garbage. I loved Shane Black's work on LW, but I hope he never does another superhero movie.",1,2,6,8 October 2013
Watchmen," Total garbage - spoiler!!
","F@#% everyone who likes this movie--- enjoy your blue c0c|< shots and garbage plot that doesn't hold a candle to any other superhero movie ever made (even The Thing or the Toxic Avenger left me feeling more satisfied). I wish i could get the time and money which I have WASTED on this travesty to American cinema. Movies like this are shoved down our throats with tons of advertising on myspace, TV, and early movie previews because they know its trash... Did The Dark Knight have previews all over the place 3-4 months before it came out? Ask yourself why? What was the point of this movie? Please also tell me why so many people are praising it with everything he/she has? Actually, wait I don't care.",10,2,14,9 March 2009
