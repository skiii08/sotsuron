The Avengers," A movie made by geek community for geeks
","Anyone gave 5 to 10 stars for this absurdity who is past 18th birthday , not a comic book publisher Marvel Fanboy and does have a girlfriend please raise your hand.No one ? Thought so. The movie is atrocious. There is a plot a plus compared Transformers movies but it is so simplistic and full of tropes , deux-ex-machinas ( I lost count how many times Loki's magic staff was used to explain everything and advance story from brain washing to destroy portal opening device ) , stereotypes , predictability and cheap juvenile PG-13 jokes it becomes a parody. I wonder that was the intention. Self mocking with movie concept , characters , genre etc. Because there is no way this movie goes unpredictable or might surprise you. Ending credits might have said 'From producers of Scary Movie' or 'Meet the Spartans' Final CGI explosion filled fight scene (another parallel to Transformers movies ) against alien invaders where no one was harmed due to rating was so messy with headache inducing 3D scenery you either had to get out of theater for fresh air or close your eyes and ears ( I did former ) The result is box office inflated animation due to marketing hype. Except CGI special effects overuse it has little cinematic quality. Actors try to make something out of their characters but child like character material gives them little chance on that.Comic book fan boys. Please stop comparing your live action stuff with Oscar winning material. You display your ignorance and make yourselves ridiculous. Cinema does not revolve around you. I am glad that you got your live action clip but for the rest %99 of us living on this planet who do not know know or familiar with resource material The Avengers was badly edited , predictable (and sometimes cringe worthy) movie. And I am using 'movie' term very lightly here.",2,18,39,30 January 2013
