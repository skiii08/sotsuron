The Blair Witch Project," The success obtained by this film is what scares me most
","Every time I watch a bad movie, my first thought is 'they could have fed the hungry with all the money they spent making this piece of ...'. It's not the case of 'The Blair Witch...', and  Thanks God for that. This film is the proof that it doesn't take millions of dollars to do a bad movie. Don't get me wrong: for being a film made with very little, and by students, it's not so awful, but what really annoys me, is that they tricked me again in buying another piece of crap wrapped in silk and gold: Good publicity can make you buy almost anything.",1,1,3,5 December 1999
