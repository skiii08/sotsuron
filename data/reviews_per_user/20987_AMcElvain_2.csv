United 93," Brilliant, gripping, inspiring, heartbreaking. Do NOT miss this!
","This film was presented as a real-time story of the events of 9/11/2001, and it was one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen. No big stars, but definitely some familiar faces. Stars might have distracted from this particular story. The terrorists were presented as realistic young men on a mission, driven by their beliefs, trying desperately to keep their courage up. The passengers were realistic people, normal people in an extraordinary situation. This was a very honest view of all the surprised and confused people who were in control, their struggles to communicate, their difficulty getting control over a completely surprising situation. Most notable was the score. Without realizing it, I was on the edge of my seat through the entire picture, even in the very beginning when the mundane activities of loading a plan with passengers, taking off, etc. were recounted in detail. I knew what was about to happen to these people, but it was the score that kept me whipped into a frenzy of dread. I especially admired that no one was made a madman; no one a buffoon; no one a superhero. People were praying, both the hijackers and the passengers alike. People were making phone calls. I felt like I was one of those passengers. What would my message have been to the people at home? Please muster the courage to see this film. It will change you forever.",10,1,4,29 April 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Brilliant, engaging, dramatic snapshot of Edward R. Murrow in late 50's
","I wasn't aware of the role Edward R. Murrow had played in the evolution of radio and television news and editorial work, and the powerful impact his courageous work had on balancing the nation's sanity in the McCarthy era. Chillingly, I also see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The political and economic forces that compete to drive the programming on the TV broadcasts are still at it, and even more powerful than they were back then. The politics of fear and repression (if you're agin me, you must be a traitor) are still being used today to silence and intimidate those who are not in power. And yet, what a hopeful light is shone: a small group of broadcasters put their careers on the line and stood up in favor of the constitutional guarantees of free speech and due process of law. We CAN do this today, and because of the courageous work of Murrow, Friendly and their team in the 50's, we can speak out with little fear of recrimination. I love that we have the right to live passionately in this country. With all our troubles, we still have the freedom to debate and discuss. Thank God for Edward R. Murrow and his team. I would recommend this film as required viewing for all aspiring journalists, broadcasters, law students and political scientists. Gorgeous David Strathairn did an amazing job, as usual. I have admired him for years for his work in films as varied as Dolores Claiborne, The Firm, Memphis Belle and A League of Their Own. He adopted the body language and speaking style of Murrow most convincingly. George Clooney directed this masterpiece, as well as portraying Fred Friendly as an amiable and effective producer. One of the most brilliant aspects of the structure of this picture was the interplay of jazz standards performed by the brilliant Dianne Reeves, who brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Presented in their time period, the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely new meaning to me. Snippets of social commentary sung to the sounds of clinking whiskey glasses, through plumes of ubiquitous cigarette smoke. I do appreciate our 'No Smoking' workplaces of today, I can tell you that! GREAT job. Everyone must see this film right now.",10,1,2,9 November 2005
