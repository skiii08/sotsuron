The Double Life of Véronique," Hard to describe, much harder to shake off.
","'The Double Life of Veronique' very much lies in that grey area of cinema where nothing quite makes sense, but everything does seem to all connect together on some strange, indecipherable level. A famous example of this is 'Mullholland Drive' - nobody has ever really been able to give a straight forward solution as to what the film is about, but it's still a very affecting piece of work, and the main comparison I had in my head while watching this film.This is a completely different movie, though, and what it achieves is much more impressive in my eyes. The plot couldn't be a whole load simpler; two women, identical in looks, age, and name, lead parallel lives - one in France, one in Poland. One day, one of our heroines catches a glimpse of the other by chance, seemingly setting in motion a chain of events I won't describe, lest I spoil it for everyone. Needless to say, it's an outlandish plot, but Kielowski wisely doesn't question this.Instead of focusing on its plot, it instead focuses on nailing down the eerie atmosphere that permeates nearly every scene - a strategy that absolutely pays off. Very few films out of the horror genre manage to capture such an atmosphere and it's staggeringly impressive, thanks in no small part Iréne Jacob - an actress who by now is slightly forgotten, but has given performances that would be career-best for many Hollywood stars. This is definitely one of them, capturing a wide-eyed innocence and strength that few actresses ever manage.A lot of thought is given to what this film means. It's a fair question, but as I mulled it over in my head afterwards, I realized it's not really the point. The film itself is the one searching for the meaning, and while it has no answers, its questions are much more engaging. My interpretation is that Kielowski is asking whether or not we aren't actually as alone as we like to think we are sometimes - that there are forces, far beyond our comprehension, pulling strings and making things happen. Almost everything that happens in this film appears distorted or magnified somewhere else in its running time - repeated, endlessly, forming patterns. It's not going to suit every taste, but it's a fascinating look at a take on life that most wouldn't have thought of.",Null,1,2,12 July 2015
The Babadook," Future classic.
","If ever there's a film that's destined to be thoroughly misunderstood, it's The Babadook. All the trailers have it pegged to be an outright horror movie, filled with jumpscares and gore. Thankfully nothing could be further from the truth. Though it is a horror, this debut feature from Jennifer Kent relies on undercurrents of sadness and looming violence, an eerie atmosphere, and in my opinion, the scariest movie villain since little Regan chilled our blood in The Exorcist.Back to it being misunderstood, though. It's already being criticized for all the things that make it great, simply because the trailers have misled people. This is also a thoughtful film that borders on being a flat-out drama examining a borderline-abusive mother-son relationship in the wake of extreme grief; albeit with a seemingly haunted kids book in tow. Brilliant as it is, the typical weekend horror movie audience aren't going to appreciate that, and so it has already received tons of backlash. So I warn you now; if you want jumpscares, gore, people being dragged across rooms etc. go see Annabelle or rent out Hostel, because this film will probably not be to your taste.To those of you who aren't after those kinds of films (those of you with attention spans), this is an amazing, haunting film. As one reviewer pointed it, it plays out a bit like an extremely dark Tim Burton film, with it's slightly Gothic style and grim colour palate. As a horror, it's actually very effective. As I mentioned above, the titular character is extremely sinister and creepy, and is sure to join the ranks of legendary horror villains. He's used sparingly though, and the film manages to create many scary moments without him too; the kids book causing all the trouble is chilling to the bone, and Essie Davis is bone-rattling as a dangerously unhinged character (for that matter... I smell Oscar buzz for her role here).As a drama, it's emotional and raw without ever running into camp (which could have happened very, very easily with this material). I won't ruin any of it (and I urge you to avoid reviews that do), but it makes for fascinating viewing that calls to mind both Pan's Labyrinth and The Exorcist, with a dash of the less fantastical We Need to Talk About Kevin, which this film actually beats, in my book.This is definitely one of the best films of 2014, and a film that's destined for classic status, misunderstood or not.",10,12,26,23 November 2014
Ant-Man," Terrific fun.
","With exception to The Avengers and the Spiderman movies with Toby Maguire, I'm really not into superhero or comic book movies. It's not that they're bad, but they just don't fulfill what I like going to the movies for - I'd much rather a drama, or a psychological thriller. So, it was with weariness that I approached Ant-Man.My weariness was misplaced. Ant-Man, with the new Mad Max and Spy, will probably be my favourite film of Summer 2015's blockbuster movies. Why? Quite simply, this movie it too big-hearted and jovial to dislike. The story is typical superhero fare, but it revels in the silliness of it all. Its premise is similarly nuts, but instead of trying to take it all seriously it uses this to its advantage, creating some of the most visually inventive sequences I've seen in a long time at the movies. Part of what makes it such a refreshing ride is Paul Rudd - the perfect choice to play the titular character. He has a charm and charisma that suits the personality of the character, but still tackles the more dramatic moments sensitively and maturely. His comic timing is also pitch perfect - snappy one-liners that might have seemed cheesy coming from anyone else seem perfectly at home here. Michael Douglas is also on top form, looking like he's having great fun playing a much lighter version of similar characters he's played down through the years.Most of the praise can probably be attributed to the screenplay, though. Wisely, not too much time is spent giving these characters any deep and meaningful back-stories (they give us just enough to care about the characters) and instead they focus on the snappy humour and some pretty dazzling set-pieces. The best moments come when they combine these two elements - there's a sequence towards the end that manages to be both extremely funny, and visually spectacular (it involves a train, and that's all I'll say). My only small critique of the movie is that several characters are relegated to the sidelines when there were opportunities for them to do more - I'd love to have seen the brilliant Judy Greer given more to do, or more dialogue given to Michael Peña. Maybe next time.It's hard to judge Ant-Man against the likes of The Avengers, because in almost every way it's a different movie - looser, less serious, and more scaled down (the pun not intended - the action here is far less frantic or high-stakes). What it does amount to though is the best action-comedy of 2015 so far, and if that isn't a ringing recommendation I don't know what is.",8,1,7,18 July 2015
Saw," Silly, uninteresting, and badly made.
","I viewed Saw this evening after months of putting it off after buying it. I had bought it originally because so many of my friends had recommended it, saying it was amazing, or on a par with The Silence of The Lambs or Seven. On viewing I can now confirm that not only does it fail to be on a par with those films, it fails to be on a par with even the most incompetent of Lifetime Movies, or even low budget straight-to-DVD crapfests, which is a pity because at times it's underlying story and ideas are genuinely engaging.I'll start with the good points though, because there are plenty of them. The bathroom scenes are done in a very well shot and claustrophobic manner which adds a lot to the films atmosphere. Furthermore Danny Glover and Monica Potter both turn in very good performances. Two scenes in particular stand out, as well; Shawnee Smith's scene is shiveringly intense and gleefully nasty, and makes for exciting and vomit-inducing viewing. Secondly, the famous climactic scene is so delirious and well made that it almost redeems the rest of the films and makes it worth the price alone (I won't spoil it). However, I can't even begin to count the myriad of problems I had with this film so I won't list them all, however my biggest problem is by far the editing. Who's idea was it to show things sped up with rock music playing in the background in the films intense moments? What a way to kill the suspense. Almostall the big horror/bloody scenes lose any potential excitement and intensity due to this silly choice, and not only that, they give the film a cheap and silly feel, almost like a bad music video.On top of that, the acting from Cary Elwes is dreadful and he is woefully miscast. Throughout the film he seems to have two modes; unbelievably calm, thus ruining the realism, and over-the-top-upset, which generates laughs and ruins the drama. The big reveal, however inventively done, is still so pointless it begs the question of why they even bothered to put it in. Again I won't ruin it, but it just made me go 'meh'.Overall, as much potential as it had, it's a wet blanket of a film, lacking the thrills to make it a thriller, and the horror to make it a horror. Go rent out Se7en, and save your money.",3,4,6,26 January 2014
The Purge," Interesting concept, but very dull.
","The Purge is probably one of the most average films I've seen in my life in just about every facet. It's a hard film to down, because it does what it does fairly well, but it's even harder to find something good to say about it. It's the cinematic equivalent of McDonalds. It'll fill you up and it tastes pretty okay, but it's still just a little unsatisfying.I will start on a good note, though: the concept is, admittedly, extremely interesting. All crime legal for 12 hours gives rise to pretty much anything happening in the film, not to mention it's pretty fascinating to explore the moral and emotional implications of committing a crime under such circumstances. Does it suddenly become right because it's legal? Are we free of our guilty conscience under these circumstances? Is our conscience determined by law in the first place?All the concept in the world means nothing though if it's not used properly, and that's The Purge's biggest disappointment. The film does nothing to explore the concept, and instead settles on being a fairly mediocre home invasion thriller. That would be tolerable if it were a good home invasion film, but really it isn't, and in fact it's very run of the mill. The main villain is so over the top in his mannerisms and apparent nastiness that he's rendered totally unbelievable, and ends up being more like a caricature than a character. Every other 'bad guy' is masked, which is pretty much Lazy Scriptwriting 101.So, we fall back on the action, which is admittedly pretty okay. Again nothing spectacular, and certainly not as frightening as the trailers may make you think, but pretty solid. Somehow you feel the film is going to be nastier than it is, but it never really kicks off the way it should. There's not enough gore to make it at least a somewhat entertaining splatter-fest, and not enough tension to make it truly exciting. Again, average. Matters aren't helped by the acting, with Ethan Hawk's performance being the only one that feels particularly good. The ending especially is a massive anticlimax; I'm not really sure what the screenplay is going for with it, but it's not exciting, or memorable in any way, shape, or form.We're left with a pretty average film all round, and one that's aggressively average. That's usually an alright thing; average doesn't mean bad, and usually, I would award an average film a 5 or 6 out of 10. It gets a 4, though, because it's such a missed opportunity. The excellent concept of the story belongs to a better, braver screenplay. Maybe next time.",4,1,2,3 February 2014
Joy," Flawed but generally very good.
","Despite thankfully never quite feeling like Oscar bait, David O Russel's Joy feels like a movie that's trying just a fraction too hard to please. It doesn't fall over at any of the hurdles biopics usually do, but it manages to create a few problems of its - ones that could have been easily avoided with a slightly changed script.The films biggest asset is obvious - Jennifer Lawrence. She's lauded from nearly every corner for her passionate and committed performances and once again she gives a brilliant performance here, albeit one different from how it's portrayed in the trailers - this is not a huge, operatic performance like in Silver Linings Playbook. No, this is a much quieter performance, one that finds subtlety where another actor could have found histrionic fits. It's compelling stuff, and the best performance I think she's yet put to screen.Alas the film doesn't quite manage to frame this performance as well as it could have. The chief problem lies with the writing of the rest of her family - the bittersweet drama of family has been a central theme of David O. Russell's work since he first started making movies, but here it just feels a tad over the mark. Joy's family mostly seem like horrible people in this movie, and whether that's true to life or not it doesn't work in the context of this movie. The contrast between Joy and her family is too stark, and comes off false. More depth needed to be written into this supporting cast.The script otherwise is as witty and sparkling as the rest of Russel's work, and features some great performances outside of Lawrence. Dascha Polenka is proving to be an incredibly warm on screen presence, and despite their characters falling into the aforementioned trap of being slightly too nasty, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro are both reliably compelling and interesting. The final 45 minutes, too, are a big asset - they're the most entertaining portion of the movie, as the plot shifts into fifth gear and an air of desperation (and later, glorious triumph) sets in.Verdict? Not quite the sum of its parts, but very entertaining and an easy Oscar contender in many areas.",7,4,20,23 December 2015
