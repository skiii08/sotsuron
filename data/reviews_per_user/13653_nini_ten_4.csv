Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Showgun Assasin-truly and utterly bill
","I'm crazy about Kill Bill, every shot, every frame is a powerhouse of every emotion and satisfaction combined. I'm don't mean to complain about it or criticize it at all, but the thing is: 1. I REALLY wish the 2 volumes were put together, because even though the length in each volume works as a whole movie, the sequential satisfaction does not. When you get to the middle of each film, they don't feel like middles, they feel like---somewhere in between, so when each volume ends, it will always feel like something's missing. 2. I wish i saw more background stuff, i wish i saw how Bill and beatrix first met, i wish i saw how both of them got into killing, i wish i saw how all of bill's houses looked, i wish i saw beatrix and bill as a couple and where they lived, i wish i saw where Elle lived and how she hooked up with bill during beatrix's coma, and where Sofie was in Vol.2---what i think i craved the most is a party scene where Bill and Beatrix attend together as a couple, classy stuff, and in the middle they murder somebody, the point is to see how a job really was done in the old days sort of speak, or the whole DIVA gang out on vacation in the Carribeans to murder someone. more luxury i wanted, doesn't mean i needed, but really wanted. By the way, i didn't really understand what Michael PArks was saying in his spanish accent. Overall, kill bill is genuinely and utterly awesome as a movie that pushes its limits. i lovved it ever since i laid eyes on the project plan before everything was made.",Null,0,1,16 April 2004
Coffee and Cigarettes," 3 strikes out of 11, maybe 4 strikes
","The 3 greatest segments of the movie were 1.'Cousins?',2.'Cousins', and 3. the last one with the 2 old men. The Roberto Benigni one had a nothingness charm, but it doesn't compare to those 3. The other segments were ruined either by obvious,half baked writing or unskilled acting, even for people as cool as those musicians, and even the Bill Murray one didn't work because the jokes got stale very quickly. Now, the best ones: 'Cousins?' worked geniusly and beatifully mainly because of Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan, without their acting Jarmusch's writing would only be good, but they made it great, and the fact is their charcters really matched up with what they were saying, like when Coogan says he loves Spike Jonze, that just sounds like something he would say even if you don't know him. Alfred Molina's acting lets you inside the character and entertains satisfyingly. 'Cousins?' is the most carefully crafted piece in the movie, or at least it seemed like it, it was also the most enjoyable and exciting one. the whole development of the conversation was very believable,hilarious, brilliant, and sweetly resonant. 'Cousins' had an unusually awesome quality also because of the acting, by the Cate Blanchett, it's considered a great achievement in her acting because of the timing between the 2 characters she played, to think that she held full control over a relationship between 2 people not only makes her a great actress, playing each one eloquently and colorfully, but it also makes her a director of this segment. This segment is all in all really, really enjoyable because these character's identities have such an incredible clarity to us it makes what happens between them come alive very strikingly, and the shortness of their interaction makes the segment quite disorienting alas enchanting. I wouldn't need to explain why the last segment was so good except I thought Jarmusch's writing was at his best in this one. Everything he communicated in this segment was things he cared most about. In this he really stuck it through with his best, he stopped trying to be quirky but really became quirky, man A: The world is conducted by acoustic resonance. man B: I have no idea what you're talking about, could you explain it to me? man A: No, not really. In this segement he transcended his creativeness into something magical and subtle, providing a good end to the film. The credits are incredibly enjoyable which makes you automatically like the whole thing, yet it is what it is, though if anything you should really see it for those 3 segments.",Null,1,1,23 June 2004
Before Sunset," The reality of middle age romance
","I think I understood the difference between this and 'Sunrise' is that 'Sunrise' is meant to be a precious experience, a journey, but 'Sunset' is more of an aftermath piece, it's less exciting, it's full of undermining dread because of the pathetic plane to catch and the regret. The 2 characters cannot escape their reality whereas in 'Sunrise' all they want to do is escape it. I guess the only regret for the viewer is that you'd wish they at least kissed or made love, because they would've allowed themselves to escape and feel better, though they're obviously extremely cautious and scared of such consequences. With Jesse and Celine, I've always enjoyed their conversations about their relationships more than the other topics they talk about, especially with 'Sunset', since they have serious unfinished business, and you'd wish they get to the romance quicker. A lot of things about their personal life are always really tragic but not that tragic, a kind of tragedy that too often renders with too much time feeling lonely, and that makes the most bittersweet characteristic of 'Sunset'. Jesse and Celine have really changed, believably. They're not the same and you can understand how they'd change from that night 9 years ago, and they're still resonant people to us. I think 'Sunrise' works as a more significant film than 'Sunset', but the most significant thing about 'Sunset' is letting Jesse and Celine be truly real by showing their place in reality, not their 'best self' nor their spontaneous 'young self'. Also, the reason why they didn't meet 6 months later in Vienna works out perfectly. In a way, that's kind of enough. I only wished they had that passionate soap opera moment.",Null,0,0,9 July 2004
Before Sunrise," Homage to nostalgia
","One of the great things about this is the characterization, I've never seen a movie so effective that way like this. You really know what the 2 are thinking. Also, it's this whole nostalgic/being young/Westerberg syndrome kind of piece, it's so incredibly satisfying and romantic it's beyond the criteria of what a good film is, this a a film that can be very personal to people, that's what makes it so exciting. The best parts of their dialogue is not when they have philosophical discussions but when they talk about their own life, when Jesse talks about his girlfriend or about being a father, or when Celine talks about people making fun of her or when she makes fun of Jesse, so many moments that are so poignant, so sweet, it's hard to forget.",Null,1,3,16 June 2004
