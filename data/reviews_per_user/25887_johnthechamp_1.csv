The Rock," The best action adventure EVER!!!!
","This film is hugely underrated.  Most people haven't heard of this movie. A brilliant cast, mind-blowing special efects and a great and unique story line.  Plus the added comedy and character development.  On top of that, one of the best bad guys ever who you sometimes feel sorry for.  A MUST WATCH!!!!!!",10,1,1,23 June 2001
