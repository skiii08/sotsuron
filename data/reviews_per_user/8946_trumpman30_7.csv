The Blair Witch Project," Waste of time..
","I spent about an hour and a half sitting around in my living room on halloween waiting for something...anything to happen.  Just when I thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house, nothing happens....big surprise.This movie is a complete waste of time..there is nothing scary about it unless you find filming shots of the woods, watching swearing teens, listening to a high pitched annoying girl voice (that was pretty scary), watching film from inside a tent with cheap sound effects playing outside, or watching a wobbly camera run through the woods at night (cant see anything), then you should skip this movie.  If I was out in the middle of the woods, I too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around..my map. This movie had a weak, if any plot.  This movie was one of the biggest let downs I have ever seen, and I've seen 'Batman and Robin.'
I've never seen BWP 2, but it's anything like this movie, it will be equally bad if not worse, because I would have to waste another 90 minutes of my life.",1,139,240,17 April 2002
The Legend of Bagger Vance," This film worked for me.
","I guess I'm really into the 'winning through adversity' films.  I really enjoyed films such as 'The Natural' and 'The Legend of Bagger Vance.'  I think the two were about equal.  They both show the hero overcoming adversity through a sport's golden age which is what makes this movie great. If you showed a golf or baseball movie today it would not be as believable because they no longer play for the love of the game but for the money. This was set in a time when the game was more dignified.  I never though much of Will Smith, thinking of him mostly as a comedy type actor but I think his greatness hit its peak when he started doing these drama type productions.  Smith is sensational in his roll.  If Redford had a mental picture of Bagger Vance before this movie started, I think he actually saw how Will Smith performed in this film.  Matt Damon was good also. 
Overall, a great 'feel good' film.  9/10",9,30,41,22 May 2002
Unbreakable," Not what it could've been.
","Now, for starters, this movie was an improvement over 'The Sixth Sense.'  It kept the twist ending at the end alive but also managed to keep an interesting and somewhat relevant plot throughout, something that 'The Sixth Sense' did not.  Both endings are pretty predictable though.I guess the thing that really bugged me about this movie is that it felt like it spent the entire movie building up the two characters and you see how truly amazing Willis's character is.  Then, at the end, Willis's character finds out that his mentor if you will, is the one that has been causing all of these horrible accidents just to find him.  Now, this is where the movie could've taken off but instead, we are slapped with text that is on the screen that says that the mentor has been taken to a mental institute.  How unexciting of a climax is that?",7,0,0,20 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," All you can ask for in a movie.
","This is what Star-Wars is all about.  Unlike its predecessor, Episode I, this movie actually FELT like a Star Wars movie.  There is not a single dull moment in this movie and it often left the audience cheering.  It has fantasy, drama, love, action, great score, great plot, great acting, great story line.  John William's score and its use was especially great. *Spoilers* When Anakin describes how he killed the kidnappers of his mom, we hear the Imperial theme for the first time in both the prequels. Throughout the movie, you can see how Anakin is driven further and further into hate and fear.  It was just a great movie all around and could possible rival some of the best movies ever made.  By far, my favorite Star Wars movie, and one of my favorite movies ever.  I liked it 10x as much as Lord of a Rings, a comparible fantasy movie, and I loved LOTR.  A MUST SEE. 10/10",9,0,0,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good, but not worthy of #3
","This movie was good, but I grade a movie on how much it moved and how much I want to go jump in line for another movie ticket.  This movie simply put, did not make want to see it again.  I even downloaded it off of Kazaa like a month ago and I have still yet to watch that version.  Why?  I can't really answer that question but I can guess.  For one, I thought the movie had many pointless scenes that just seemed to drag out the movie.  Did they really need all those shots of them just walking?  A lot of editing could've been done on this movie to make it much shorter.  Sure, the acting was good and the scenery was beautifully done, but the movie was boring.  Even the action scenes were boring.  The only part that even remotely made me want to cheer is when Legolas sticks his arrow through a monster then takes that same arrow and shoots another one.  The rest of the action sequences were not very well done.  As for the rest of the story, well, the plot was relatively simple.  It's pretty easily scene what's going on -- your typical good guy, bad guy story.  So, what makes this movie be up here with The Godfather and the Shawnshank Redemption?  This idea has been done many, many times before and they didn't even write their own story for crying out loud so I'm just not seeing it as one of the best movies of all time.  JRR Tolkien made this movie a 7/10 before they even started production.Episode II from Star Wars with its flaws in the love story and script is still a much better movie.  It makes you want to get up and cheer for your heros.The Casting, Acting, scenery and JRR Tolkien give this movie its points.8/10 but not even one of my top 10 favorite of all time.",8,0,0,21 May 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Haunting..
","Spoilers.  I got into this movie because I felt for the main character, Russell Crow.  I, for one, did not know anything of his mental disorder when I first saw this movie.  I knew that he had one, but not what kind. So, I'm watching the movie and thinking, 'Ok, this is the story of a life of a man who worked for the government doing spy work and was always in constant danger.'  I was scared when the people who he thought were Russians finally caught them and of course I didn't believe them when they said that he was in a phsychiatric hospital, but the more that I put the pieces together, the more it made sense.  It was creepy in my mind when his wife goes back to where he left all those letters and unfathomable to me how a man can imagine everything that he saw and pass it off as true.  It must be a truly frightening life style to live not knowing what is real and what is imaginary.  Somehow, though, he overcame all these obstacles.  This is a great movie, but it loses one point because the part about the Nobel Prize at the end was unnecesary and I thought was just added in there to make it a feel good ending.  I know its a biography, but you don't have to include everything.9/10",9,0,1,22 May 2002
The Sixth Sense," A good movie, but overrated.
","*Spoilers* I can start out by saying that I am somewhat biased to this movie because I do not like child actors.  Their characters are just never believable in my opinion.  That aside, this movie was pretty well done and had an alright story to tell, but what was the overall point to it?  What was the lasting emotion or thought on the movie?  The whole movie seems to center around Bruce Willis trying to get inside the kid and get him to accept him. Seriously, this takes up almost three fourths of the movie.  Then, at the end, it seems like the director realized that he did not have very much time left in the movie and kind of threw in that last little bit about the mother poisoning the child and rushed the big climax where Bruce Willis finds out he is dead.  It seems that the entire movie had just been put together for that one twist of an ending.  The ending is very good, but an ending cannot make up for the rest of the movie.The movie does have some genuinely scary and creepy parts but for the most part seems indecisive as to whether its a drama or a horror movie. 
There are some parts where I was left questioning, 'huh?' after watching it a second time.  I don't remember too well but did they not skip three months between the time Willis was shot and when the actual movie begin?  What was Bruce's character doing all this time and where did he think the time had gone if he truly did not know he was dead. I did not know about red being used as symbolism until they told me about it after the movie and that is probably why they put that segment at the end. No one picked up on it because it had almost nothing to do with the plot of the movie.  It's almost like the director threw that in there so he could say, 'Hey, everyone, I'm smart, I can use subtle symbolism.'  The symbolism itself is so broad that its largely ineffective for when something red appears it just has 'something to do with dead person,' even if a dead person had just touched it or something.There are certain saving graces about this movie.  Bruce Willis turned in a good performance and it did makeyou think in some parts, but ultimately a movie that will quickly be forgotten, maybe faster if everyone would stop making parodies of it =).  Overall, not one of my favorite horror/dramas. 5/10",5,1,2,20 May 2002
