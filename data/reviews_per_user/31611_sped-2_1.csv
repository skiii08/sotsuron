The Blair Witch Project," dont waste your time and money
","Please everybody, don't see this movie!!! It is really bad, a cool concept and idea but thats it. It is amazing that they found people to hype this movie so much because at my big-screen theater everybody hated it and so have also friends told me that people were reacting at their theaters aswell. There is nothing scary about this movie ,the only thing that will make you sick to the stomach is the out of focus camera. The actors were so bad that from the get go you stopped believing the whole thing.The audience really wanted to go with the movie and tried to pay attention but the 'scary sounds' were just to low. If they went back and re-shot this movie with a budget and good actors on a 35mm or even16mm you could have a real horror flick. I am so sorry I really wanted it to be good.....",1,0,1,5 August 1999
