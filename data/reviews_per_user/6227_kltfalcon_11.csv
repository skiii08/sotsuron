Antz," I was really something
","This story has many level. If I was a kid, I really enjoy this movie. But I already 26, I see things different than a kid. We live in the world when we just like antz. We have origanation to make things right. We never get out of the system. We follow it, but we never understand it. We work like hell, but we never understand what is meaning of all those works. It's not because we stupid. It just because we never try understand it. We never try to question it. So we born, we work, and die just like all those antz in this movie. But we never find out who we are.
Z isn't like another ant. He question why he do all those work. He wonder the world beside his home is. He isn't just question, he try to see this world. He try every opportunities, so he can see this world.
This movie make me think to myself. What meaning of my life. I recommend you to watch it. It is masterpiece.",8,0,0,1 April 2020

Catch Me If You Can," A great story
","I mark it as want to watch a long time ago. But in this time, I just have time to watch it. The movie tells a great story. Frank W. Abignale, Jr who is just a kid as main actress in this movie. After his father and mother get a divorce, he starts pretending to be a copilot, a doctor, a lawyer. He make 4 millions dollar by fake check. He is very talented. When Tom Hanks who is after him find him for the first time in a motel, he capable to fool Hanks. He is so calm in that situation. But beside that, he is so lonely, he call Hanks every Christmas to has someone talk to him. The ending is also great.
Leonardo DiCario who plays Frank W. Abignale, Jr is perfect. I really love his acting. I will watch it again.",9,1,2,28 September 2019
The Little Mermaid," It is classic
","Im enjoy when I watch this movie. The music, the story and the animation is quite good. The story is understandable. But why are they fall in love to easy. Ariel love the prince after she looks at him. She try to run away from her father because of that, and she try to trade her voice to meet him. Maybe that they call love at first sight. Eric love her because her voice. Maybe in their age, they easy to fall in love.

Aladdin," Boring

3 Idiots," A wonderful movie
","This movie really changes the feel of the Indian film. In the past, I felt that Indian films had something very superficial like the scenes in which actors looked directly at the lens (as seen through the 8-year-old bride film), and unnecessary slow motion shots, or as well as the music that takes up most of the movie (Enthiran). But this movie made me really like the Indian film. The music in the movie is really cute and suited to the situation of the film, it honors the film a lot.The film talks about what each person thinks about what the university really does for each person. What are we looking for in college? We learn rote and seek knowledge to get a degree that makes ours get a job with a high salary and then worry about rice rice money things. And here Shadon is different, he's against mechanical thinking, he's looking for a simple explanation for the definitions. He really learns to love the industry, he wants to learn it. He did not pursue knowledge, he did not pursue money, he did not pursue success. Simply everything he does because he wants to know more, because he is curious, he doesn't wants to race with anyone in the race of knowledge, money, or success.I really learned a lot from this movie. I was very touched in the scene that Shadon send his dad's friend to hospital, as well as when the friend suicide, then also when the delivering baby scene. A movie worth watching.",9,0,0,29 August 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful movie.
","We don't live in this world alone. Everyone interact with each other's life in the world.
Remember no man is a failure who has friends.
In the last scene, when Mr.George khows about the value of his life, he thanks everyone included Mr. Potter, he thanks for everything even he has to be go to jail. Isn't it wonderful.
I love the scene when Mr.Potter want to hire Mr. Geogre and the scene Geogre bet for Mr. Potter's help. Being good man isn't enough, you had to be strong to be good man. When Mr. Potter offer to hire him with $20,000 per year, he almost fall for it because he weaks in money (he is young man , 27-28,married, making $45 a week, supporting his mother). But he has endured this tempting because he is strong in character. When he is in trouble, he becomes weak, he can't keep his principle and bet for Mr. George help.
If I want to be a good man, I had to be strong.",9,1,1,24 August 2018
