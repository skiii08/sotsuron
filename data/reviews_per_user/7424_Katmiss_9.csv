Saturday Night Fever," ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE 1970s
","'Saturday Night Fever' is about much more than dancing. It contains a sturdy character study, which is what makes this film so great. That and the music.John Travolta stars as Tony Manero, a Brooklynite whose life consists of dancing at the local disco and hanging out with his friends after working at the local hardware store all week. This is one of Travolta's best performances. After seeing him as Barbarino week after week in 'Welcome Back Kotter', it was probably a great shock to his many fans that he would do a serious drama. But he pulls off this difficult role so well that it establishes him as a serious and great actor.Some of the best scenes in the movie involve Tony and his family. Tony is seen as something of a disappointment, especially compared to his brother who is a priest. The conflicts with Tony and his father are among the truest and most human I've seen in some time. It's a shame that they are not very well remembered among audiences today.The most well remembered and talked about sequences are the scenes inside the discotheque. John Badham, the director, makes good use of the camera and captures the energy and color of a local disco of the 70s. At the very least, it blows away 'Can't Stop the Music' and 'Thank God It's Friday', probably among the worst films of this era. Travolta himself is impressive in the dancing sequences. It is good to see an actor actually do the dancing himself rather than a double.The music is great, too. Most of the music is from The Bee Gees, the standout group of this era and this is some of their best work. Songs like 'Stayin Alive', 'Night Fever', 'More Than A Woman', 'You Should Be Dancin' and 'How Deep Is Your Love' not only represent the disco era, but they also enhance the film itself and not many soundtracks can do that.'Saturday Night Fever' is a wonderful movie, an insightful look at a time that has faded away from memory. So many people want to forget the disco era so badly that they tend to take potshots at the music and fashions. They forget that they lived that time and it should not be forgotten.
***WARNING: 'Saturday Night Fever' exists in two versions. My review applies to the original 'R' version which has a lot of offensive language and material. The alternate 'PG' version is the one used for TV and is also of interest. My advice: rent or buy the R version. This movie's soul is in that cut.R version: ****",10,0,1,11 July 2001
Scarface," A MASTERWORK
","Brian DePalma's 'Scarface' is a masterwork; a three hour epic about the drug scene in Miami. Most of the criticisms seem to be over the language and violence. Both are so potent that the MPAA gave the film an X rating. I thought that was a little extreme.Perhaps it is because for some, this cuts a little too close to home. According to a book 'The Cutting Room Floor', Miami cops testified that the film was very realistic. Oliver Stone wrote this film while kicking his cocaine habit, according to the biography 'Stone'. I believe that because the film is very harrowing to watch at times.Stone's script is unusual because it is so many different things. It is a social commentary about the drug culture and immigration and the effects of both on society. It is also a strong character study. Roger Ebert says it best when he calls the film 'a wonderful portrait of a real louse'. Most Hollywood films would gloss Tony Montana over, but it is to the credit of DePalma, Stone and producer Martin Bregman that they show Montana as a louse, plain and simple.But the strongest feature of 'Scarface' is Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana. Pacino has publicly said that Montana was his favorite performance and no wonder: Pacino has a field day chewing up the scenery. This performance came after his relatively subdued roles in 'Cruising' and 'Author! Author!', so he relished the opportunity to play such a larger than life character. He does it so well that we can sit throughout the lengthy running time (170 minutes plus intermission)and never be bored. It is quite a showcase for his talent and he deserved an Oscar for his efforts.As usual, the technical credits are superb. John Alonzo's Panavision photography is astonishing. DePalma demands the impossible and gets it.Giorgio Moroder's score also helps the film tremendously. It is quite different from the thriller scores, but effective in its' own way. The editing of the picture is exceptional and doesn't falter for all of its 170 minutes. DePalma's stylish direction is perfect in every way. He captures the violence, the humor and the pathos wonderfully. Another director wouldn't have done as good a job (well, maybe William Friedkin might have).I must warn you. While 'Scarface' has very little nudity, it does have excessive violence and a plethora of foul language (Pacino says f*** at least 300 times). It is not for young children to see. A more appropriate range would be older teenagers and adults. They will be able to appreciate the social commentary and exciting action that DePalma and Stone deliver on screen.**** out of 4 stars",10,0,0,28 July 2001
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," LAST OF THE GREAT WESTERNS
","George Roy Hill's 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is a Western like no other. It's so much more than your standard cowboys and indians shoot-em-ups that we've grown accustomed to. This film is about character and Hill provides us with two of the most likable outlaws in screen history and we care about them for two hours, not an easy task.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are cast as Butch and Sundance. I cannot think of more perfect casting. However, we have the stars to thank for that. The odd thing was that Newman was cast as Sundance and Redford as Butch originally. Newman suggested that they switch roles and Redford agreed. I think, that by playing against type, it shows that Newman and Redford are so much more than good looking leading men. They are fine actors as well.Ordinarily, a normal Western would have comedy relief. But the great thing about 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is that it is one big  comedy itself, although how much you find funny depends entirely on personal taste.In the one line summary, I said that this film is the 'last of the great westerns'. I think that is true. There were several good westerns that came out after this (There Was A Crooked Man, The Ballad of Cable Hogue, Two Mules for Sister Sara, Junior Bonner, The Outlaw Josey Wales), but until Clint Eastwood's 'Pale Rider' and Lawrence Kasdan's 'Silverado', both released in 1985, came out, there were no truly great ones. Along with Sam Peckinpah's brilliant 'The Wild Bunch', 1969 was the year of the last great Western.**** out of stars",10,0,3,28 April 2001
Cast Away," TOM HANKS IS AMAZING IN THIS FILM
","Tom Hanks is an amazing actor. He dominates 'Cast Away' so fully that one doubts it could have made without him. He should have won his record third Oscar, but the Academy, in their usual good judgment (I'm being sarcastic),chose Russell Crowe for 'Gladiator'. Boy, did they miss the boat on this one.Hanks is pretty much alone for about 110 minutes of this 143 minute feature. I'm not going to spoil it for you since the advertising teams from Fox and Dreamworks have done such a good job already (sarcasm again) Not knowing anything about the film is a major benefit. I don't pay attention to ads and I was able to appreciate the film's surprises.I loved the fact that it records an existence. So many filmmakers today think you have to have wall to wall action in order to keep an audience interested. But Hanks and the director, Robert Zemeckis, understand that a good story and solid characterization are even more effective. This is another winner from Zemeckis, who has been making one great film after another lately ('Forrest Gump', 'Contact', the chilling 'What Lies Beneath'; actually he has yet to make a bad film). The film's Panavision photography (by Don Burgess) resembles Kubrick's '2001' and George Stevens' 'The Diary of Anne Frank' in making wide open vistas claustrophobic.Just because I really, really liked this film doesn't mean it's flawless. 'Cast Away' has some problems. One is the ending. While I appreciate the fact that Zemeckis didn't tack on a sentimental, syrupy ending, the final shot of Hanks in this film comes off as forced. This is probably a compromise with the studios and I don't blame Zemeckis, Hanks or even the screenwriter. Another is Helen Hunt. Nothing personal, but she has yet to find a role that can eclipse her Oscar-winning work in 'As Good As It Gets'. Here, she has a nothing part that could have been more substantial. 'What Women Want' also had that problem and she was the LEAD! Here's to hoping that she'll find a good, juicy role worthy of her talent. If there's one thing I hate, it's squandered talent.Still, 'Cast Away' offers many pleasures and is riveting filmmaking from start to finish. This film deserved better treatment from the Academy. But since when does the Academy actually do that? The answer is hardly ever. Shame.**** out of 4 stars",Null,0,0,26 June 2001
The Usual Suspects," UNUSUAL, BUT A REAL CHEAT
","Bryan Singer's 'The Usual Suspects' is a good thriller, but how much you enjoy it will depend on personal taste. It has good acting (especially Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for this role), but it gets bogged down by it's plot and the ending is a real cheat.Roughly, the film is one giant enigma: 'Who is Keyser Soze?' We find the detective trying to figure out what happened during a heist gone bust: his only lead is Verbal Kint (Spacey) who weaves a tale of intrigue, double cross and even more questions than could possibly be answered during the rather short running time (108 minutes, it should have been about 30 minutes longer).Ultimately, the film is all style, but very little substance. Style can be a good thing: look at Brian DePalma's best films (Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Blow Out, Obsession). 'The Usual Suspects' has an ending very similar to 'Dressed to Kill', but Singer can't pull it off the way DePalma did. It just can't be believed.But the ultimate letdown of the film is hardly Singer's fault: he does an excellent job of directing a rather choppy and labyrinthine script and he does it with such style and grace (along with Spacey's performance) that I find myself recommending the film despite my reservations.
If you like to be confused and enjoy solving puzzles (like me), you'll like, maybe even love, 'The Usual Suspects'. But even those kinds of people will be compelled to say 'ENOUGH!' after an hour and 20 minutes of this film.

Pi," FINALLY! A REAL THRILLER!
","'Pi' the dazzling and bleak debut feature from Darren Aronofsky, refers to that unending number that is often rounded out to 3.14 and is used in algebra classes around the world.But this isn't a math movie. I think the best way to look at this film is that it is about obsession. The main character is so obsessed with finding the real number, which is believed to be infinite, that the film is a study of obsession and madness.But I don't want to give away the plot and spoil Aronofsky's nice surprises. I do want to say that I think it's amazing that 'Pi' is able to be such an effective thriller without resorting to the usual T&A and standard shoot-em-up chases. The grainy black and white photography only adds to the feel of a lonely guy's world.Some people complain that 'Pi' contains no big stars. I think that big stars would have hurt the film. Honestly, can you imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sly Stallone or Mel Gibson trying to find out what exactly is Pi? Unknowns only make this more believable. See 'Pi' more than once. It may take some more than a few viewings to fully understand it. But at least Aronofsky has some good ideas and is content to make a muddled film rather than a neat, contrived one. 'Pi' was one of 1998's best films.**** out of 4 stars",10,1,4,27 April 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," UNBELIEVABLE MESS!
","'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a disorganized mess which doesn't know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a horror film or a cops-and-robbers flick? A domestic drama or a human comedy? The movie seems to want to have it both ways and the result is an unbelievable mess!It was written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Both are talented writer/directors. What went wrong?Well, for starters, Tarantino's script has no focus; it tries to be the horror equivalent of 'Pulp Fiction' but without that film's slickness and charm. His performance is even worse. Someone should tell Quentin that while he is a really nice guy and is a talented writer and director, he should stay behind the camera. I imagine he pulled this script from the bottom of the drawer after 'Pulp Fiction''s success.Second, the film's first half is jumbled and boring. We want to see the good stuff and we get it but we have to sit through an hour of crazy talk and boring nonsense. And the vampire stuff is way too over the top to be effective. That is what plagued 'Fright Night Part II' and the same happens here.There are some good moments among the sleaze. Cheech Marin is funny in a triple role; and George Clooney works hard to salvage this mess. He has a great screen presence and great films such as 'Three Kings' and 'The Perfect Storm' confirm it.But even they cannot save the irreparable damage from the first half and while stylish and funny, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is too little too late.* out of 4 stars",3,2,6,3 May 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," THE MORE YOU SEE IT, THE MORE YOU SEE IN IT
","'2001- The more you see it, the more you see in it'That was the quote used to describe Stanley Kubrick's '2001:A Space Odyssey', the greatest film ever made, in my opinion, during it's initial video release in 1980 by CBS Video. I usually don't quote others in my own reviews (Ebert not withstanding), but I made an exception because I found it to be true.A deliberately complex film, '2001' has the rare power most films do not. It has managed to stand the test of time for 33 years. Now, that we find ourselves in the year 2001, one could be tempted to ridicule its' inaccuracies.I have and will resist the temptation. Kubrick isn't interested in predicting the future. He's interested in what will happen to human nature as we progress throughout time. He (and co-author Arthur C. Clarke) embrace ideas.The film is divided into 3 parts: 1,000,000 B.C.; 1999; 2001. One could make the case that it is about evolution. And it is. But that's the cover story. We, the viewers, are to make our own conclusions about what we see and that's the way it should be. That's why it's such a great film.It's a typical practice of the Academy to avoid broad, challenging films and indeed, '2001' was robbed of a Best Picture nomination. You mean to tell me that 'Oliver!', 'Funny Girl', 'Romeo and Juliet', 'Rachel, Rachel' and 'The Lion in Winter' are better films than '2001'. All those films have their defenders. I think they're excellent films, but not better than '2001' which has the benefit of making the audience think about what they have seen. These days, audiences don't want to think. But the recent deaths of 'Tomcats' and 'Freddy Got Fingered' are a good sign that the tide is turning. This is a film that demands multiple viewings and is a treasure for keeps. Well done.**** out of 4 stars",Null,0,1,22 May 2001
Carrie," MELDING OF TWO GREAT ARTISTS
","'Carrie' is a melding of two great artists, in this case, Stephen King, who wrote the novel and Brian DePalma, who directed the film. This is a tense, exciting thriller that is also a sturdy character study. It's hard to make a film that can accomplish both, but DePalma does it. King's novel mostly dealt with a telekinetic girl who is cruelly treated by her classmates. DePalma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen follow the novel fairly closely, with the exception of the ending, which is a great deal more sensationalistic and better, in my opinion. (King himself liked the finale and the film, as stated in his exceptional study of the horror genre 'Danse Macabre')As is the case in most DePalma films, the technical credits are superb. The cinematography (by Mario Tosi)is extremely effective; colors and shadows have never been shot more effectively in a DePalma film since. The film score is by Pino Donaggio, and it marks the first collaboration between Donaggio and DePalma. (Bernard Herrmann died shortly after 'Obsession' was completed) Donaggio is among the most underrated and overlooked composers of his time. His scores for 'Dressed to Kill', 'Blow Out' and 'Body Double' are all exceptional and all deserved Oscars. 'Carrie' is no less brilliant, as it accomplishes what all great scores are supposed to do: enhance the film without giving anything away. Paul Hirsch's editing is also extremely effective as it was in 'Sisters', 'Obsession', 'Blow Out' and 'Raising Cain'. But it is the performances that make 'Carrie' stand out. Carrie is played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of such power and strength that she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (the first actress ever to be nominated for a horror film; the second would be Sigourney Weaver for 'Aliens')She manages to hit all the right notes. A lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama. Spacek plays the role more realistically and the film is much more effective that way. (Just in case you didn't know, Spacek was a DePalma regular, but off-screen; she was the art director for several of his early pictures). Also, 'Carrie' marked the return of Piper Laurie to films after a too-long hiatus (her last credit was 'The Hustler') Here, she plays Carrie's mother. Again, a lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama, but Laurie resists the temptation. Her performance is a real knockout and also garned an Oscar nomination (she should have won, but typical Academy genius set in and gave the prize to Beatrice Straight who was in 'Network' for a whopping 10 minutes and really didn't do much.)Also, as a side note, this film also is a start for some future DePalma regulars such as John Travolta (his first major studio film) and Nancy Allen (her first major role)What I really liked about 'Carrie' is the absolutely perfect ending. I had commented before that 'Sisters' had an absolutely perfect ending. The one thing about Brian DePalma is that he knows how to end a picture. 'Dressed to Kill' had a really good one, although some people hated it as well as 'Blow Out'. 'The Fury' has the greatest ending of all the DePalma thrillers. A small note to finish: In 1999, 'Carrie 2' was made by profiteers at MGM. Despite a rich premise, the film was an artistic failure.  DePalma had nothing to worry about. The sequel (retread might be a better word) lacks everything that makes DePalma's original so good. Rent or buy the original, on tape (in pan-and-scan or widescreen)and DVD (widescreen)and forget the sequel, even if they give it away.**** out of 4 stars",10,110,141,18 July 2001
