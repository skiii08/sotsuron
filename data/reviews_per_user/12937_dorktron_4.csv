The Blair Witch Project," Over-hyped disappointment.
","I am not understanding the rave reviews found here.  The Blair Witch Project was an unfrightening disappointment that, in the end, left me wondering if that really was all there was, as many other people felt.  The final five minutes are the only part of the movie that even got my heart pumping a little faster.  Some other parts really just annoyed or confused me... there was too much bickering in daylight between the students, and yes, some have pointed this out as well: if they just followed the creek, they should have been able to get back, out of the woods at the least, to the outside world. The daytime shots, however, really got to me; after a while, you realize nothing frightening happens at daytime, and around 90% of the movie conists of daytime shots.  If the movie had more nighttime scenes that played with the mind a bit more (not this running around aimlessly with the camera's video off), then it might have frightened me even a tiny bit.  I give the Blair Witch Project a two out of ten, since it was intended to be a horror movie but failed pretty miserably at that.  One way the movie could have potentially been scarier is if they had more night shots and less painful-to-watch daytime shots.  Seeing as to how easy it is apparently to frighten American audiences, everyone should see this one and get their own opinion.  Many of my friends and I, however, felt this movie is a waste of great scary movie potential.",2,0,2,3 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Possibly the best of the summer '99 movies
","South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut was a surprisingly good movie.  I am a fan of the show, and catch it whenever I remember to, but I think I might have to be tuning into Comedy Central for South Park every single week now after seeing the movie.  The only painful parts of the movie for me were much of the anti-Canadian material, although not all (I joked about Canada when I was eleven... it gets old very quickly) and everything having to do with Sadam Hussein.  Otherwise, this movie was a laugh riot.  When I thought the movie was starting to go downhill, they introduced The Mole, one character who had me laughing with every word he spoke.  Please, see this movie... it'll make you laugh, and possibly even think of how you're raising your kids, or how we're all raising America.  This movie gets an eight from me... the strong anti-Canadian/Sadam Hussein parts were a pain to watch, but the rest of the movie is so great that this ends high in my books.",8,0,0,3 August 1999
There's Something About Mary," Am I missing something?
","I'll make this quick and blunt: There's Something About Mary is a worthless movie.  The comedy is so dumb that it's annoying to view.  I laughed maybe once or twice during the movie.  Look, Ben Stiller has SPOOZE on his EAR! If only seeing something as gross and disturbing as this were entertaining to me.  One out of ten.  Too bad the rating can't go much lower.  This one was supposed to be a comedy, but it failed.  Why couldn't those two director brothers do as well as they did with Dumb and Dumber?  I fear the sequel to Something About Mary and the audience the first one drew in...",1,29,61,3 August 1999
The Godfather," Boring drivel
","Simply put, this is a very poor movie.  The acting was substandard... Marlon Brando stuffs his cheeks, giving himself a speech impediment which is almost unavoidable and does not make for an amazing performance, and Al Pacino walks around with a blank, emotionless face throughout the entire movie (which is the point at some times, but not the whole time).  Diane Keaton also plays easily one of the most annoying roles I have ever seen in a film. Every scene in this film drags on and on and on, making it very possible to summarize the whole thing without leaving out details in around thirty seconds.  The closest explanation I've gotten from anyone I've talked with in person about why this film is so great to them is because 'it's the Godfather.'A movie that puts you to sleep and is not exciting or interesting does not belong as the greatest movie of all time to me.",2,6,18,2 February 2000
