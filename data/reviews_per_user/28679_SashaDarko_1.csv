Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin (2006)
","One word (OK, two) to describe this film: 'super convenient'. Everyone is way too connected and all events are way too convenient, with the twists being over the top and just not making sense even more. The twist in the ending is simply stupid, unlikeable and sugary, existing to please the audience. There's also a strong feel of everything being staged on the scene, the sense of the very script. And of course there are many usual tropes and predictable events, during the watching I was saying what will be coming next - and there it was, like I said.It's still a quality Hollywood movie: great filming, great acting, and especially the great editing. It's also not dragging, despite being almost a two hour movie. By the time it was over I thought the movie was about 56 min in and there's something more. However, nevermind the tired tropes and ridiculous twists, the most surprising thing about this movie is the inclusion of O Yujki Conjugate track in the soundtrack which has about five songs. OYC it's an obscure ambient British band and how their track ended up in a Hollywood movie with first class actors is truly a mystery, especially considering the low number of music tracks used.",7,0,0,21 January 2018
