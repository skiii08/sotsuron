The Avengers," Overrated by the hype. Good but not great...
","First thing first, that movie is good. And yes it is just good! Not great, best movie ever or something else! It was just good! Good action, good acting... But, man, the story was way too much clich√© (a bad guy wants to take down the Earth and heroes have to save the Earth and they win...) That's it! Loki was nothing memorable as a villain. Good but not great again. Marvel is so great for that! It's building up the hype and excitement of all the fans! It's been since the first Iron Man movie we're waiting for that one big movie! and marvel KNEW that the fans will never dare to realize how just good and basic the movie really is! I enjoyed the first Iron Man movie way much than this! And I speak as a huge comic fan. I was looking forward to this movie, but i wasn't dying of impatience like all the fans who overrated it! 8.7? Seriously?! What made the movie was only the characters! Because you really care for them and they were more comic book accurate than ever! But that's it... It was funny, entertaining, had great characters but this is way too much overrated by die hard fans who can't face the truth... It deserves a solid 6 out of 10! Its good, but not great... Puny god...",7,18,37,24 July 2012
Sicario," Sicario; A powerful and almost exhausting ride of a movie
","Sicario (2015) tells the story of a righteous, but stubborn, FBI agent played wonderfully by Emily Blunt. When she volunteers to be part of a special task group made to take down a Mexican cartel lord, she comes across a world she couldn't understand, a world outside the law.My thoughts; Sicario delivers on every level possible, with masterfully shot action and set pieces, perfect performances and characters.I'm having a hard time finding flaws with this film. The tension is palpable throughout the entire run time, you just feel this storm coming, and it grabs your guts and grips your attention.The third act of this movie is so satisfying, when it was over, I was literally out of breath. Like I was holding this deep worried feeling inside until the very last second of the movie. Oh, and the score was just simply superb, it nourished the atmosphere perfectly. I can't praise this movie enough, and I could go on and on about it.(And YES BENICIO DEL TORO IS BACK BABY!)Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, by far the best of 2015. 9 out of 10 (because no movie is perfect, right?)",9,0,2,18 October 2015
Steve Jobs," Thank you Aaron Sorkin for existing
","'Steve Jobs'(2015) is an unconventional biopic telling the story of the ups and downs of Steve Jobs through the means of his three biggest product launches.Oh man... This movie... This movie was GREAT! I had a blast! Let's be fair here, what makes this movie is the clever dialogues and performances. It's all talking and thinking, there's nothing blowing up in this one. It's not gonna be everybody's cup of tea, but if you are already interested in it just by reading this, well, you're in for a treat. Micheal Fassbender was flawless, loved Seth Rogen's Steve Wozniak, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, they were all superb. The dialogues were gripping, real, and meaningful. My only nit-pick would be the directing of Danny Boyle, I felt like it was kind off out of place at times, with his artistic involvement. It felt more like a movie for David Fincher to direct, as he is more sterile and calculated, which would be more fitting for a Steve Jobs movie. The very unique narrative structure (cutting the first, second and third act into the behind- the-scenes of the conferences) was a smart decision, it made the pacing smooth, enjoyable and unique. By the end, I just wanted more of this movie which is saying something. But, honestly, I can't see what this film would have been without Aaron Sorkin's script, he made the movie in my opinion.8.5/10 for 'Steve Jobs'(2015) :-)",8,0,2,9 January 2016
Inception," Unbelievable
","You've never seen anything like Inception, and you'll want to see it again and again.A brain-twister to be sure. But the fact that the plot demands attention only adds to the exhilaration. This is a story about dreams that requires the audience to stay awake.The action set pieces are deliriously spectacular; one involving a gravity-impaired Gordon-Levitt in an ever-rotating hallway is wondrous to behold.The movie of the year! You need to watch it, over and over again...It will be my favourite movie for my hole life!(I just cannot wait to The dark knight rises!):P11 out of 10",10,0,13,17 February 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," The greatest movie of all time
","The best movie ever made, period. I won't go on a very long and detailed review on the story(which is magnificent and perfect)I just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was perfect! I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough recognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was underestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is an art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what I'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and perfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a shame that they decided that.11 out of ten, totally deserves it.",10,2,3,23 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Meh.
","A fun time at the theatre but not much else. I liked the additions, and how the Force worked, but it was kind of a mess. Weird pacing, hyperactive editing, and plot points straight out copied from A New Hope. Rey was okay, she was overacting at times and her performance felt a bit too artificial, in fact the whole movie felt artificial. The directing was just, too much! Too much intensity, overly polished and produced, out of place crooked camera angles and slow zooms to make everything intense when it's completely unnecessary. Good performances overall, fun action, I was eating my popcorn pretty fast. Well timed fan services and winks to the original trilogy, but when I left the theatre I told myself:'Meh, it was fine.' Better than the prequels obviously, but that is not saying much. They crammed so much in one movie, that the movie itself felt claustrophobic. Kids will LOVE it. I, personally, liked it for what it was, but I was disappointed considering the hype and fantastic reviews. NOT A BAD MOVIE, at all, it's a fairly competent big budget space movie, but not as good as I thought it would be. Haters giving this 1 star are just lying. It is far from a bad movie, there was a lot of love and craftsmanship behind this film and it would never deserve a one star.6.5/10 :-)",6,15,22,6 January 2016
