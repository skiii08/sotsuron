Changeling," Interesting premise. Could've been shorter.
","Some of the scenes were totally unnecessary, and the film felt a bit dragged. That said, Angelina Jolie is a natural in the lead role, and is probably her best recent work.",7,0,0,19 June 2020
Pride & Prejudice," Charming, lovable, a delight!
","The background piano score does justice to the impeccable cinematography. It's poetry in motion.
MacFadyen is an amazing Darcy, and a fine actor. But it's all Keira Knightley stealing the show from there, with her bewitching charm and countenance. Every expression of hers is immaculate. Literally can't take eyes off her, much like Darcy in the film.",9,2,2,17 June 2018
