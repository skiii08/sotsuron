Requiem for a Dream," Intense, but flawed
","A very good film. Heart-breaking. Chilling. Especially Ellen Burstyn who turns in a wonderful performance. I would have liked to see the other three characters developed better, but its seems the director was more concerned with the cimematography than with the acting. That was just one of his flaws. The other was the editing, which was great a times (especially at the end), but at other times he needed to slow down a bit. He is obviously a product of the MTV generation just like I am. That's not bad, but its definately telling and teaches bad habits.Anyway, I recommend this film to everyone who doesn't like the typical mainstream movie. 9/10",9,0,0,21 August 2001
X-Men," A Singer Surprise
","When I first heard about an X-men movie being made, I was sceptical that any film studio could take it serious enough to make a good film. The last movie I liked made from a comic book was the first Superman made in 1978. After seeing X-Men though, I was pleasantly surprised.  Bryan Singer did a wonderful job turning one of my favorite comic books as a kid into what is now one of my favorite science fiction films.The only flaw I saw was the casting of Halle Berry as Storm. I think Singer knew this too because she only has two lines in the whole movie.
I can't wait for the sequel next year. Hopefully, my favorite X-men character, Pheonix, will make an appearance. Now I just wish Singer had done this years Spiderman. 7/10",Null,0,0,21 May 2002
