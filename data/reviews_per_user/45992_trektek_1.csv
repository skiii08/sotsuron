Iron Man 3," Great Movie!!!
","This post includes SPOILERS!! I thought the movie was spectacular!! Great plot, wonderful acting by all involved, exciting action. With that being said, I do have to comment about a few inconsistencies between this movie and the previous two. At least they appear to be inconsistencies to me and I am appealing to my fellow fans to either confirm my suspicions or dispute them. First, I thought that the miniature ARC reactor in Tony Stark's chest not only powered the electromagnet to keep shrapnel away from his heart but also powered the Iron Man suit. But in Iron Man 3, the suit runs out of power and must be recharged. I question this on the fact that in the original Iron Man, Obadiah Stane incapacitates Stark and steals the ARC reactor from him to power his own creation. Second, the Iron Man suit is 'keyed' to Stark (as confirmed by Stark in the final action scene) and another Iron Man suit is supposedly 'keyed' to his friend Colonel James Rhodes for use as 'The War Machine'. But in this movie, Rhodes is captured and forced out of the suit and then the suit is used by one of the bad guys as a 'trojan horse'. If it is 'keyed' to Rhodes, how was the bad guy able to use it? Third, and last, Stark tells Jarvis to destroy all the Iron Man suits and in the end scene throws the ARC reactor into the sea. How can it end like this when there is an Avengers 2 in the works that supposedly includes Iron Man?",10,5,12,5 May 2013
