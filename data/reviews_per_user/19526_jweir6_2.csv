Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Childish, but good
","Episode I is entertaining, but there are some problems.  Some things (the pod race and the Jedi duel) were better than any similar scenes in the rest of the series.  The main problem is that there is a child character (with annoying dialogue) as well as cartoonish character (with even more annoying dialogue) aimed at children.  This makes the movie come off as a kids movie. At least it didn't have a dog in it.",8,0,0,17 June 1999
The Matrix," Best American Fight Scenes
","This movie is the biggest step forward in Hollywood action movies in recent memory.  The fight scenes were the best I've ever seen in an American movie. Hopefully the bar has been raised enough that other film makers will be held to this new standard.The movie also had good special effects and an interesting premise.  The acting wasn't great, but why should we even pretend to be disappointed? We all know Keanu isn't great.  Give him credit for taking such a physically demanding part.",9,0,0,17 June 1999
