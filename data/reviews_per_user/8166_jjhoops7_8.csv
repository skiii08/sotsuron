Ford v Ferrari," A Crowd Pleaser
","Ford v Ferrari is nearly exactly what you expect it to be. In this case, that is not a bad thing. The performances are solid, the action is exciting, the stakes are high, and there is just enough background intrigue to create a meaningful central conflict. It's a crowd pleaser and a thrill ride, with appeal for just about anyone. The film never strives to be overtly political, nor does it push a strong social agenda. No, this is a movie about cars and the people who make and race them, and this is a story about American exceptionalism, akin to the space race or the miracle on ice; the difference being, the stakes are contained: Can Ford build a car that can take on Ferarri at Le Mans? And who is going to drive that beast? It's an America vs Italy story; a story of 'creatives' - doers - the racers, the mechanics, the visionaries - vs business interests - cautious, profit and image focused. Who will win in the end?",Null,1,1,17 February 2020
The Equalizer," Better than expected
","I really enjoyed this film. Denzel Washington proves time and time again he has immense talents, transforming what could be a generic action thriller into something fun and surprisingly emotional. I can't imagine this movie being nearly as good without him. His character moves from gentle and sympathetic to intense and heroic, with frightening efficiency. The movie never fully overcomes genre tropes, but it is a fun ride nonetheless.At its core, this is an 'old man getting dragged back into the game' story, and it spends enough time building a well-realized character with believable motivations. Denzel works a day job at a large hardware/home store, and spends late nights reading at a 24 hour diner. He takes sympathy for a young girl who is involved in a bad way with some Russian dudes. The story soon spirals into 'Denzel takes on everyone'. He believes is justice and acts as a moral arbiter for the everyday person, the down and out. The action often revolve around Denzel surveilling and taking out bad guys with old-man resourcefulness, incorporating every-day tools and home-goods into the violence. In a way, this is 'suburban Dad dream film', and as such, you don't have to take it too seriously.My major gripes with the film: The main villain is a cartoonish baddie. He is one dimensional and boringly evil. Also, every Boston accent is a travesty. Even for hollywood Boston accents this is not good (Denzel Washington shrewdly avoids attempting one).",Null,0,1,26 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Immensely Satisfying Conclusion
","This was an immensely satisfying conclusion to the Star Wars saga. Emotional, thrilling, character driven action with just enough classic Star Wars humor and surprising series callbacks. I really do not agree with any of the review bashing happening right now. I urge you to ignore critics and see it for yourself. Hell, ignore me too. Just remeber the internet haters will never be pleased, their expectations never satiated; they had it out for this one. I think it is bogus. This movie rocked.",Null,4,9,27 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A little messy and erratic, but very entertaining
","This film is a little all over the map. It never stays at one speed for long, and it springs back and forth jarringly such that it almost feels like 3 act play written by 3 different Tarantinos. The mid-late film feels particularly rushed. Instead of the tension building to a natural crescendo, there is an overused narrator who advances time with a lot of exposition. All I could think was 'Show! Don't tell.' Despite the jarring tonal shifts and pacing that feels constantly unsettled. it is very entertaining throughout. The performances are solid, DiCaprio and Pitt both channel their star-power to great dramatic and comedic effect, and there is a fine supporting cast. Yet, Margot Robbie as Tate goes heavily underutilized, and it's bizarre. For the amount of screen time, she is little more than eye-candy, and she has no particular character arc or importance to the story. At the end of the day, I can't help but feel that this film didn't really have much to say. It feels overstuffed and indulgent. The commentary on Hollywood, TV/Film, Celebrity, Hippies, the 60s/70s is all pretty muddy. But, alas, it's still a very good time, and maybe it doesn't need to be anything more than a big Hollywood fantasy...a fairy tale created in Hollywood about Hollywood, and that's sort of the point and part of the charm.",Null,1,3,13 January 2020
1917," Powerful, beautiful, but often contrived
","Initial reactions - I mean this is a gorgeous film with astounding set design, attention to detail, direction, and cinematography. WW1 comes to life. That much is not overhyped. But the plot often feels contrived. The sequence of events flow into one another without believability. The story hinges upon random things that happen to justify cliches that happens later to tug at your heartstrings (cough - the milk, for one) What could feel like a intimate, character driven war story, a small quest with high stakes, often feels like some like a odyssy like fantasy journey. I preferred the realism and temporal tension of Dunkirk. Where Dunkirk lacked in character building (albeit- deliberately) some may feel that this film took a bigger swing. But ultimately, Dunkirk stuck to it's guns and presented war as it was without telling you how to feel. 1917 often felt like it was desperately trying to make you care, trying to make you feel emotion, and it never quite worked. Very good, worth seeing, go see it, be entertained, be astounded, but recognize it's got a few issues.",Null,1,3,11 January 2020
Prometheus," Had potential, ultimately fairly dull and poorly executed
","This is the kind of film that looks fantastic in a trailer. Then you realize that unlike a trailer a feature length film relies on two hours of good acting, dialogue, visual effects, and a script/premise that actually makes sense and captivates an audience on an emotional level. In Prometheus the pieces never quite came together. There is potential in this film. It's certainly not unwatchable. But even with all the Alien intrigue and space action, it was a messy, confusing, and rather dull affair.",Null,1,3,28 October 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," Reverberates with life, intimate, sad, and darkly funny
","The power of Llweyn Davis rests on dramatic irony, That a film can be so beautiful, intimate and resonant with the audience, but in the world of the film, Llewyn can't seem to catch a break, struggling at every turn to convince the commercial music world that his art has value, that he has value. Therein lies the black humor of the film and it is encapsulated in one specific scene, where Llewyn performs in Chicago in order to secure a record deal. Here we find just one man performing for another. Llewyn reveals his soul in a haunting folk melody. The camera slowly creeps in, until nothing exists but Llewyn and his music. The camera then creeps in on the music manager, until it's us and his eyes, dead focused on Llewyn. The performance ends, the viewer enraptured, and then the music manager remarks, 'I don't see a lot of money here.' It's a brutal and ironic punch to the gut for both Llewyn and the audience. But there is also a redeeming message here. That your soul, your art, is valuable beautiful and incorruptible, despite what you may have come to believe about yourself by how the world treats you.",Null,2,2,31 December 2019
Spectre," A sensory splendor and emotionally impactful story, let down by ambiguous scripting
","This might not be the best Daniel Craig Bond, but it is a great film none-the-less, a visual and auditory feast, which is let down by its script, which could have brought further clarity to what is an emotionally impactful story. Firstly, the film is technically and artistically stunning showpiece. It continues the Bond globe-trotting experience. Each location is worthy of acclaim. From the opening Day-of-the-Dead sequence in Mexico City, to the closing credits, Spectre is striking. I'm not just talking about the static scenery either. The action is well-choreographed, suspenseful. and, given Bond's penchant for against-the-odds survival, the set-piece moments finely toe the line between 007 and over-the-top outrageous. Even in it's most frenetic, the action is visceral and not reliant on obvious cgi, so 'believability' ultimately wins out. Similarly, the music elicits a awesome and suspenseful chord. There is a constant undercurrent that builds the films tone of looming, pervasive background threat. On that note, the villain of this film is a throwback to Bond of old but represents a greater universal fear, anxiety brought on by all-seeing-eye of the information age. MI6 too is under attack, by threat of irrelevance, by way of technological progress, and some key architects of this progress. Bond's character is shaped by this impending threat, and the villain looming in the background. HIs tragic existence as a 00 agent is brought into light here. Bond wrestles with the demon of profound loss, his loved ones jeopardized by the life he chose to lead as an agent. As we come to learn, the film's villain is somewhat like a puppeteer, pulling the strings behind Bond's life and loss. At first glance, this does a disservice to Bond's story, alleviating his guilt by giving him a clear scapegoat for his pent up grief. But, as we come to learn, this connection is not arbitrary, but crucial to Bond's upbringing. As in Skyfall, we are given just a glimpse into Bond's past, of a time when he more human than agent. If throughout the film Bond appears traditionally disconnected, stoic, and dangerous, defined by his desire for cheap thrills of women, drink, and violence, at the expense of those he cares for, that guise in more transparent than ever, and in the cracks in his facade, we glimpse the humanity he wrestles with. For despite his roguish actions, Bond's fondness for Money-Penny, Q, and M, as well as his reverence for country and honor, are on display as well. He brings the crew into his world by bestowing upon them trust. He allows them to help him, a rarity for a man who built his life and career upon distrust in the world and others. Though this display of trust, Bond reveals his true colors. These MI6 relationships are the backbone of the movie, heightened by excellent work from Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, and Ralph Fiennes. Ultimately, despite all that I enjoy about this film. I can't help but feel the the script relies too heavily on cliche and ambiguity. I ask: Would it have better served this film to make the storytelling a bit more transparent to the viewer through richer dialogue and character motivations? Spectre's deeper themes may rely too heavily on visual language and extended metaphor to usurp the one dimensional traditional Bond tropes on display . On the other hand, this film is a sensory experience, and perhaps the ambiguity of the scripting and superficial gloss serves to reinforce the themes at play. As one must look beyond Bond's obvious actions to understand the man inside, the viewer must search beyond the film's veneer to uncover the emotional resonance.",Null,0,0,30 March 2018
