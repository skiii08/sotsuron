Requiem for a Dream," Not an easy ride
","Wow, what a disturbing movie. I really felt physically sick at many points in this film. Although is was very very well done..VERY, you couldn't pay me enough to sit through this beauty again. The cast was outstanding and I truly felt the pain that 'Marion' was feeling. I thought Marlon Wayans was awesome...never knew he had it in him. Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn were great too, but Jennifer Connelly stole the 'acting' show. Don't miss this one, but don't get it if you are in a romantic comedy mood. It is truly the anti-drug. Trainspotting was a good appetizer, but this is the main course complete with all the trimmings.",Null,0,0,1 October 2001
American Beauty," Hype?!
",American Beauty is masquerading as a clever way of retelling the tired tale of dirty old man and pretty young girl. I am not fooled by the external goings on in the movie that try to make me think it is something it is not. I guess for the average viewer it's risque and unique. Any movie that makes it 'essential' to the script to show two young actresses topless is lame. It is so oh very overdone.,Null,0,0,14 April 2000
High Fidelity," Disappointing Drivel
","This movie had all the parameters for a great ride. It was not. It was a 2 out of 10. Jack Black was good as the poor man's Philip Seymour Hoffman, but it was a total sham. I don't know anyone that wanted 'Rob' to get back with 'Laura'. The movie bite the dust when they ended up together for lack of better choices. Anyone who did like this movie should pick up a copy of 'I just called to say I love you'. Over and out.",Null,3,9,10 June 2001
