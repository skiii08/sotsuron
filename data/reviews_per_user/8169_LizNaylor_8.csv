Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca truly lives up to its amazing reviews. The themes, characters, scenes, and dialogue were distinct and unforgettable. The camera work was wonderful and the scenes were shot wonderfully. The cast was great as well. The plot could get confusing at times if a viewer was not paying attention, but as long as a viewer can keep up, it is fantastic. Casablanca is a classic love story dealing with war ad violence as well. This film was truly phenomenal and engaging throughout its entirety. The story was good because it was compelling the entire time. Bogart was amazing in this movie as well. Overall this movie is highly recommended.",Null,0,0,17 March 2013
Chinatown," Chinatown
","For people who like suspense, good acting, and a good story, this is the movie for them. This movie is able to reel a viewer in and keep them hooked the entire time. Jack Nicholson is fantastic in this movie as well. The last line of the movie 'Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown' is really memorable and will leave you sitting there for a few seconds in awe. The plot of the movie was well driven and moved along at a nice pace. The movie felt like it dragged along at some parts, but picked right back up again after a while. Overall, this movie contained many elements that make up a great movie. Action, suspense, and a good plot. This movie is a definite must-see for anyone who likes suspense-type movies.",Null,0,1,7 May 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
","This movie was so interesting. It was so real, it was as if you could feel the pain and misforutnes the people in the 1930's had to live through to keep their families together. This movie gave a first hand account of what these people had to deal with, such as not knowing where they would end up at the end of each day. To watch people suffer through that is really powerful, which is saying something because this is a film. The plot of this movie was really, really moving. The acting was so good, it was almost as if these people were actually living through this tragedy. This is a classic movie, and a must-see for people of all ages.",Null,0,1,7 May 2013
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","Annie Hall is a good movie because it has a realistic ending. A lot of movies today go for the same old, drawn out, predictable 'happy ending' that does not happen as often in life as it is portrayed in a vast amount of films. This movie is pretty heartwarming at times, and the reason that it is loved by many is the uniqueness of Woody Allen. A lot of people watch movies for a feel-good kind of ending, but there are people out there who want that realistic ending that Annie Hall gives an audience. Everything about this movie is good. Its acting, and plot, and the fact that Woody Allen is the director. There aren't too many movies out there where the director is also one of the main characters in the movie. A definite must see!",9,0,0,1 May 2013
The Graduate," The Graduate
","This movie gets better every time you watch it. The storyline is just so obscure, you cannot help but get sucked in and see what happens. There are a few twists in the movie as well. The ending is one of those endings that leaves you sitting there, wondering what could've happened next. The soundtrack, although a but repetitive at times, was really nice with the movie, it was a unique touch, to make it that much better. Dustin Hoffman did a good job playing an extremely awkward young adult in this movie. It made the plot that much better because of his acting. The Graduate is an all around good movie because of its interesting plot, good music, and good acting. This is a definite must see for anyone who can appreciate a classic.",9,0,0,1 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' In the Rain
","This film was truly so much fun to watch! From all of the catchy tunes, to every single witty character in the movie. Every character was lovable, even Lina with her high-pitched, one of a kind voice that a person could not forget. Kathy was such a lovable character that a viewer could not help but root for during the entire movie. Cosmo never had a dull moment in the movie either, making the movie exciting to watch as well. His songs and dancing were one of the big highlights of the movie. The colors throughout this movie were phenomenal as well, always bright and vibrant, keeping the movie interesting. All in all, everything about this movie was out of this world, from the catchy show tunes, bubbly characters, and fun plot, this movie is definitely a must see for everyone.",10,0,2,3 April 2013
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","Pulp Fiction is phenomenal on so many different levels. Quentin Tarantino is a truly talented director that goes to no end to make his films powerful beyond belief. Pulp Fiction is just one example of the many great ones. The moment you turn on Pulp Fiction, you know you're in for quite a ride. This film has all the necessary components to make it exciting, gangsters, fights, drug conflicts, etc. This movie is so mind bending because of all the twists and turns and chapters it takes you on. To say this movie is complicated would be an understatement, but when you're finished watching it, you are left sitting there thinking how amazing it actually is. Thurman, Travolta, and Jackson are just a few names whose acting make this movie what it is. You haven't seen a great movie until you've watched Pulp Fiction.",10,1,3,1 May 2013
Psycho," Psycho
","Everything about this movie is excellent. The genre of horror/thriller movies are always fun to watch, either alone if you're daring, or with a group of people to make it more fun. Hitchcock is a truly talented director, with many good movies, but this one is definitely up there on his list of great movies directed by him. The plot of 'Psycho' is extremely engaging. It has a viewer on the edge of their seat during the entire movie. This movie also has some major plot twists that cause the viewer to question what in fact they are actually watching, but since it is a Hitchcock film, that should be expected. All in all though, this movie was great because it had a plot that kept an audience invested in the film, and the acting w as good too.",10,0,0,10 April 2013
