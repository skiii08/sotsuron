"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A romcom with a difference
","As a big Simon Pegg fan, I must admit that this is probably my least favourite film of his. It just doesn't come close to 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', two of my favourite comedies of all time.It certainly isn't your typical romcom, if you can even call it that. It's more like a comedy with a hint of romance for the sake of a plot. It still has the classic Pegg silliness about it, just not to the level of some of his other films. Perhaps they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.'Run Fatboy Run' is a funny but underwhelming comedy movie, especially by Pegg's high standards.",6,1,1,11 December 2016
Ford v Ferrari," Brilliantly shot and acted, a great racing film
","'Ford v Ferrari', or 'Le Mans '66' as it is titled here in the UK, is a very enjoyable and extremely well-made racing drama film. It gets the balance between storytelling and action just about right, ensuring it is both entertaining and informative/educational as a true story and biography piece.My knowledge of racing and cars in general is rather limited, and I certainly had no prior knowledge of Ken Miles before watching this film, but 'Ford v Ferrari' does a great job at being accessible to all audiences rather than just those with an interest in this area. It's easy to follow and you need very little knowledge of motoring to understand what's going on.Christian Bale and Matt Damon are excellent in their roles. Bale in particular impressed me with his accurate Brummie accent, which can't have been easy to pull off. 'Ford v Ferrari' is great - recommended for everybody, but for racing fans it is definitely a must-see.",8,1,2,9 April 2020
The Blair Witch Project," Fresh and original, but not as frightening as I expected
","'The Blair Witch Project' is known for popularising found footage films and it remains to this day by far the most popular in the found footage sub-genre. It's inventive approach makes it a must see for horror fans and it remains fresh and original to this day. It also makes for a refreshing change to the generic, overproduced, jump scare filled horror films of the modern day.That said, for a film that is included on so many 'scariest films of all time' lists, it wasn't as frightening as I was expecting. The tension and suspense is all there but it ultimately comes to nothing and I did feel a sense of disappointment when the credits rolled. 'The Blair Witch Project' is an engaging and refreshingly original film, but it just didn't scare me as much as I wanted or expected it to.",6,0,0,11 November 2017
The King's Speech," Firth delivers a stellar performance
","'The King's Speech' ticks all the boxes to be considered a truly great movie. It is very well made with an intelligent script and some outstanding individual performances. Colin Firth as King George VI is probably one of the best in recent years and he thoroughly deserved his Oscar for it.From the emotion to the humour, this is a subtle and elegant film that relies heavily on the script and actors to succeed. The dialogue between Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush is the highlight of this movie. Two great actors working with great material.A thoroughly enjoyable and extremely well made film that will be remembered for all the right reasons. Great writing, great acting.",8,1,2,2 December 2016
The Benchwarmers," A love-hate comedy, personally I loved it
","It always amazes (and amuses) me when I read negative reviews of comedies like this one, describing them as 'stupid', 'silly' and so on. I can't believe anybody would watch a movie like this thinking they would get anything other than a ridiculous and intentionally dumb comedy. 'The Benchwarmers' knows what it wants to be and never tries to be anything else.This is one of those love/hate comedy films that some people with find hilarious and other will roll their eyes and switch off 20 minutes in. It will appeal mostly to those who enjoyed the likes of 'Napoleon Dynamite', and Jon Heder is once again hilarious in this film playing a character similar to Napoleon. I can understand why 'The Benchwarmers' isn't everyone's cup of tea, but anybody who enjoys light-hearted, harmless silly comedy will love this movie.",7,0,0,19 August 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Thin in just about every area other than the visuals
","'Blade Runner 2049' is by far the most over-hyped and overrated movie of the year so far. I wasn't a big fan of the original in the first place, but decided to go and see the sequel anyway because of all the rave reviews it was receiving. Rather like the original, '2049' is too slow, too shallow and relies way too much on the visuals, which is the only impressive part of the movie.Everything else about 'Blade Runner 2049' is massively disappointing as far as I'm concerned. The plot is sub-standard, especially for a near 3 hour long movie. It is convoluted and messy in parts. Fans of Harrison Ford will be disappointed too, given that he barely does anything in the movie, only first appearing around the 2 hour mark. I thought 'Blade Runner 2049' was thin in just about every area other than the visuals. The biggest disappointment of the year so far for me.",5,8,17,16 October 2017
Black Swan," Frighteningly good psychological drama
","I wasn't expecting to like this film as it isn't something I would typically choose to watch, but what a pleasant surprise I was in for. I thought 'Black Swan' was great - the best psychological thriller I've seen in a long time. The pacing and the way the film builds suspense and tension is masterfully done and I was hooked from start to finish.The flashes of horror in this film work really well. They are tastefully added and are never overdone, which was refreshing to see. The most impressive part of this film though is its ending, which I'll admit I did not see coming. It is perfectly executed and is a great way to end what is a very dark, creepy thriller.I liked 'Black Swan' a lot - this is a very effective psychological drama that builds brilliantly to a haunting climax. Unexpected, but great. Would definitely recommend!",8,1,1,27 October 2019
Scarface," An ultra-violent, ultra-entertaining gangster classic
","While other famous titles might first come to mind when thinking of classic gangster/mafia films, 'Scarface' might well have a claim to being the most brutal, over the top and relentlessly violent gangster film ever made. For pure entertainment value I can't think of many better. This film is a total blast, a hugely entertaining piece of cinema and one of the few three hour long films that seems to fly by.If there's one area in which 'Scarface' is lacking, however, it has to be the rather generic and predictable plot. The focus in this film is very much on the action and violence and, at times, it feels like the plot isn't given much thought, or at least it isn't the priority. That takes nothing away from the enjoyment of 'Scarface' though, which is a true gangster classic and unquestionably one of the best films of the 80s.",8,1,2,16 July 2018
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It's nice, great success!
","'Borat' is one of my all-time favourite comedy movies and is one of the few films that never loses its humour, no matter how many times you watch it. This is, in my opinion, Sacha Baron Cohen's best film by far - I don't dislike his others but they just don't come close to 'Borat'.This film is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish and there aren't 2 minutes that go by without something to make you chuckle. It's difficult to think of another film that manages to mock and offend so many different people, but it's the complete lack of giving a sh*t that makes it so special!'Borat' is a classic and Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedy genius, a must-see for anybody with a sense of humour!",9,2,3,27 April 2016
Requiem for a Dream," One of the most powerful and disturbing films ever made
","Like a lot of people, I'd heard the music from 'Requiem for a Dream' before I'd actually seen the film. Indeed it was that classic soundtrack that drew me into watching it. Based on the music, I was expecting something dramatic, haunting and disturbing, but I never expected something as powerful and meaningful as what I watched.'Requiem for a Dream' is an outstanding film in every respect, in fact it quite comfortably makes my 'all-time best' list. The reason this film is so effectively disturbing - even uncomfortable to watch at times - is because the characters and their stories are so accurate of real-life. Tyrone, Harry, Sarah and Mary Ann are not fictional characters, they represent the millions of people in the world who have lost their freedom, body, mind or soul due to drugs. It's a harrowing watch, but essential viewing at the same time.On a side note and mainly just for personal reference, this review marks my 500th on this site - hard to believe given that I only signed up (almost four years ago now) to vent my frustration about a dreadful TV show that I'd seen. Life has become a lot busier since then and it's hard to find the time to sit down a write a review, but I've every intention of continuing to post when I can... so here's to the next 500!",10,1,1,1 March 2020
Captain Phillips," Well-paced, gripping thriller
","'Captain Phillips' is an intense, gripping film that tells the true story of Captain Richard Phillips, who has to find a way to save himself and his crew after their ship is hijacked by Somali pirates. The tension is relentless as the Captain attempts to negotiate his release with the pirates.The most impressive part of this film is how well-paced it is. Nothing was rushed, no aspects of the story were skipped or changed. Equally, at no point during the 2 hour running time was there a dull moment. It maintained a steady pace and was thoroughly gripping from start to finish.This is a well made, well-paced drama/thriller that does a very good job at telling a dramatic true story. Definitely worth watching.",7,0,1,27 December 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," One almighty anticlimax
","I can't help but feel disappointed with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. Despite being glued to the screen for the vast majority of the film, I almost feel like I've been conned. The ending just didn't come close to what I was expecting. An hour and a half of tension and drama, and for what? One almighty anticlimax that felt like it had been given next to no thought or preparation.In terms of building up tension, the film is good. Despite the fact that almost all of the movie is set in a bunker with only 3 characters, it never felt in danger of becoming boring. Having said that, I wanted an ending that did the rest of the film justice. Instead I got 10 minutes of what felt like a cop out.I can't say that I didn't enjoy '10 Cloverfield Lane', because for the most part I did, but my disappointment as the mystery unraveled ruined the film for me.",5,8,12,22 November 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Breathes new life into a dying genre
","I'm yet to see the original version of this film, but 2007's version of '3:10 to Yuma' is good enough to stand alone, without drawing any comparisons to the 1957 original. I thought this film was excellent in just about every area. From the plot to the acting and the cinematography and visuals, everything was as good as I've seen in a any modern Western film.This film breathes new life into a dying genre. It's 10 years old now but we haven't had many Western films as big and bold as this one released since. In many ways it's a shame that Hollywood doesn't invest in making more modern Westerns like this one. There's definitely a market for more films like this, and part of the reason '3:10 to Yuma' stands out so much is that there is a severe lack of competition in its field. We need more films like this.",7,2,4,6 October 2017
The Hangover," You can't help but love this movie
","It's not very often these days that a comedy film comes along that is a) genuinely hilarious and b) like no other comedy movie that has come before it, but that's exactly what we got in 2009 when the first Hangover movie was released. This is a hilarious film all round, from the plot to the script and characters - whoever was behind the casting for this film got it absolutely spot on.Part of the reason why this film is so funny is that it doesn't even take itself seriously. The plot is so ridiculous and it's almost like they were trying to cram as many stupid scenes into the film as possible. 'The Hangover' is an example of how a comedy movie should be done... aim to make people laugh and the rest will take care of itself. It's now been 8 years since 'The Hangover' was released and I still can't recall a comedy film I've laughed at more since.",8,1,2,12 June 2017
The Ring," One of the best horrors of the 2000s
","'The Ring' is one of the few horror films that still makes me jump after multiple viewings and is probably up there as one of my favourites of the genre. I've always admired the way this film seems to sustain a high level of tension from practically start to finish. I can't think of many films that have done a better job at creating an eerie atmosphere and a level of creepiness that never seems to erode away no matter how many times you watch it.Part of the reason I like this film so much is it has a storyline you can actually buy into. Too many horrors focus too much on trying to scare the audience without giving enough thought to plot. For me an eerie horror like this with a convincing plot trumps anything that relies on gore and jump scares. Personally I would consider 'The Ring' is be one of the best horror films of the 2000s. Strong story, solid acting, successfully creepy and just as effective on second and third viewing.",8,4,4,24 December 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The first and best of the Indy films
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the first and, in my opinion, the best of the Indiana Jones films. This film is almost 40 years old but remains today one of the best and most iconic action/adventure movies of all time. For sheer entertainment value, there aren't many films that have come close to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' since its 1981 release.What makes 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' stand out from the rest of the Indy films is the story. It's fast-paced, exciting, tense and hugely enjoyable. There are some memorable individual action scenes that put any modern day CGI dominated action sequences to shame. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an iconic action movie that has stood the test of time. Definitely a classic of the genre.",8,0,0,1 September 2017
It," Frightening in parts but massively over-hyped
","The enormous amount of hype surrounding this movie made it something of a must-see for any horror fan, including myself. I was prepared to be let down, as I always am when a movie is talked up so much, but I was left with mixed feelings overall. There's no doubt that 'IT' is a brilliant production and there are some effectively frightening individual scenes but, as a whole, it just doesn't live up to the hype.The first half of the film is too slow. It contains more laughs than scares and, while I appreciate the need for character development, many of the scenes are completely pointless and not at all relevant to the overall plot. It also relies heavily on cheap jump scares, which is particularly disappointing given the naturally creepy and disturbing nature of Pennywise. The film picks up though and the final quarter of 'IT' is a real treat for any horror fan. It moves at a breathless pace, maintaining a high level of tension with a long, relentlessly creepy final sequence. On balance, the positives outweigh the films flaws and I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't been so over-hyped.",6,1,8,14 September 2017
Hereditary," Good acting but the story is less than convincing
","'Hereditary' contains some effective scare scenes but, rather like a lot of modern day horror films, the focus seems to be on maximising the effect of the jump scares rather than constructing a sound and convincing plot. While it's clear that some effort was put into developing the story and characters early on, I thought the storyline was messy, over-the-top and even quite silly towards the end.By far the most impressive aspect of 'Hereditary' is the acting. Toni Collette has always impressed me in the roles I've seen her in previously and she is again excellent in the lead role in this film. Milly Shapiro also deserves a mention for an effectively creepy and disturbing performance as the daughter. They make the film watchable and probably a lot scarier than it would have otherwise been. A few good scare scenes here and there, but ultimately a weak and unconvincing plot lets 'Hereditary' down.",6,4,7,5 May 2019
In Bruges," Decent entertainment once it finally gets going
","'In Bruges' has a lot of glowing reviews and an average rating that puts it up with the some of the best films of 2008, but I can't say I share the same enthusiasm for it. Firstly, even though dark humour is usually my thing, I didn't think 'In Bruges' was particularly funny. The constant crude language, especially from Farrell's character, was more irritating than humorous and didn't feel natural at all, and neither did the character's constant whinging.The second half of 'In Bruges' is a lot better than the dull and directionless first half, in which the two characters do little more than wonder around the city complaining about anything and everything. At least we get some action in the second half, though it only partly recovers what it a disappointing spectacle. 'In Bruges' isn't bad once it finally gets going and the humour will probably appeal to some people, but I was disappointed.",6,0,3,23 January 2018
John Wick," 100 minute long action sequence
","In this 100 minute long action sequence, the action is relentless. There's action, action, some more action, and then just for good measure, an added dose of action. Fans of the action genre will love it, especially since they don't have to concern themselves with any sort of plot.Seriously though, 'John Wick' is so blatantly action-oriented that any intentions of coming up with a plot and sticking to it go completely out of the window within the first 20 minutes or so. The film gets so carried away with itself that any story that it was supposed to be telling is soon forgotten about.If this is what the action genre has been reduced to, then why not just make a generic, special effect show reel instead of pretending that there's some sort of interesting plot behind what's happening on screen, when there blatantly isn't?",5,1,4,3 June 2017
Chinatown," First-rate, classy detective drama
","'Chinatown' is one of the best films of the 70s and without doubt one of the most memorable in the crime/detective genre. This is a first-rate picture all round with very few faults, if any. It's an intelligent mystery, complex yet relatively easy to follow, and has no difficulty in holding your attention from start to finish.Part of what makes 'Chinatown' so memorable is just how perfect it is in appearance. The cinematography is on another level to anything else I've seen from the 70s - each and every scene is crafted in such a stylish and elegant way. The script is also brilliant and gives us some classic lines, including of course the famous last line of the film, 'Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown'.'Chinatown' is a classic that lives up to its glowing reputation. It's difficult to fault this detective gem.",9,10,13,23 August 2017
Gravity," Stunning visuals, poor plot
","I was looking forward to seeing this movie for the first time after hearing and reading great things about it. The visuals and special effects certainly didn't let me down, they were stunning throughout. In fact, it seems they spent so much time on the fancy graphics that they neglected to accompany them with a meaningful plot. Essentially, this is 90 minutes of two astronauts floating around in space, engaging in tedious chit-chat whilst drifting from space station to space station. Sandra Bullock's character has a habit of pressing random buttons whenever she has the chance, with her preferred strategy of selection being the well known astrological formula of 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'. Unsurprisingly, her intelligence pays off and she lands back on planet earth, unscathed and without so much as a scratch!If fancy graphics are your thing and you're not too bothered about having a plot with substance, then I highly recommend 'Gravity'. If, like me, you're the opposite, then I suggest you look elsewhere!",5,1,3,24 April 2016
Lone Survivor," Solid, effective war drama
","'Lone Survivor' provides an accurate and effective portrayal of a group of soldiers on a mission to kill the leader of the Taliban. It makes for fascinating and, as you would expect, highly suspenseful viewing. The stripped back approach works to the films benefit, with the minimalistic editing and special effects contributing to the film's raw and real feeling.Mark Wahlberg suits his character well and delivers a solid performance throughout, though I do think so more character development was necessary as very little is known of any of the characters we follow in the film. Having said that, 'Lone Survivor' is successful in doing what it sets out to do - telling a fascinating true story in the most accurate and effective way.",7,1,1,22 July 2017
Wind River," Solid and engrossing but a bit sluggish in parts
","'Wind River' is a well-made film with some excellent acting performances and an engaging plot. It is also visually stunning with the rural setting providing some beautiful scenic shots and contributing to what is a very atmospheric film. The characters are well-developed and the plot is convincing enough to keep the audience invested in what happens, despite the fact the film goes through a few too many dull patches.The occasional slow patch is the only real weakness of the film, but it does affect the overall flow and ability of the film to sustain tension. These parts of the film don't really contribute to the development of the story and could have been trimmed or even cut from the film entirely. However, providing you have some patience to sit through some of the duller moments, there is plenty to admire about 'Wind River'.",6,0,0,22 April 2019
Darkest Hour," Great portrait of a great man
","I've seen a few Churchill films/documentaries before but 'Darkest Hour' is nothing like any of them. This film does more than just tell a story, it's a fascinating portrayal of Churchill's character, his traits, habits and even his brutal sense of humour. While the film details the events of Churchill's rise to power, the entertainment value comes largely from learning about the man himself.Credit must go to the brilliant Gary Oldman who captures Churchill's character to a tee. Everything from his voice and body language to his subtle mannerisms is perfect, and it's easy to forget that you're not watching the man himself. The highlight for me was Oldman's stirring version of Churchill's famous 'we shall fight on the beaches' speech. 'Darkest Hour' is a great portrait of a great man, highly recommended for those wanting to learn more about Winston Churchill.",8,3,10,16 January 2018
Memento," Ambitious and smart, but the rating is fake
","If 'Memento' was released this year, there is absolutely no chance it would achieve the average rating of 8.5 that is currently has on IMDb. That rating puts 'Memento' in the top 50 highest rated movies of all time. To say that such a ranking is misleading would be an understatement.This film is unique and like nothing that had previously been attempted before its release. The plot is ambitious and intelligently told, giving the audience an insight into the mind of a short-term memory loss sufferer. The film makes for absorbing, but also frustrating viewing. I got the impression that 'Memento' thinks its better than it really is.Overall, a decent and unique thriller, but the rating is misleading and not a true reflection of the quality of the film. Interesting? Yes. Top 50 of all time? No!",5,7,12,13 February 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Brilliantly written and beautifully shot
","I'm not normally a fan of war movies but this one stood out for all the right reasons. There aren't many movies that are written and shot as well as 'Inglourious Basterds' - I thought the movie was near faultless in those areas.Inevitably, 'Inglourious Basterds' is violent, though I didn't quite anticipate just how violent it was in parts. There's plenty of gore and brutal scenes that wont be to everyone's taste. The casting was spot on and there were some excellent individual performances, notably from Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt as Hans and Aldo respectively.'Inglourious Basterds' is a brilliantly written and beautifully shot movie that I would definitely recommend.",8,1,4,15 September 2016
Passengers," Flat and uneventful for the most part
","'Passengers' was one of the most interesting looking films of 2016, but it left me disappointed. This is a sci-fi/romance film, but it spends so much time dilly-dallying that neither theme is properly developed. Why are we forced to watch Chris Pratt aimlessly wonder around a spaceship for such a large chunk of the film? During this time practically nothing of significance happens. It's unnecessary and uninteresting.It's only after Jennifer Lawrence's character is awoken that 'Passengers' properly starts. It picks up in the second half and there are a few a moments where the film feels like its going somewhere, but it never really does. For the most part, it's flat. The suspense is limited to only a few scenes and there just isn't enough going on to maintain your interest until the end. 'Passengers' isn't a bad film, but it's a disappointing one, especially when you consider its potential.",5,1,3,11 September 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Moderately amusing, decent romcom
","'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' was very popular when it was first released, and seems to remain a popular choice with TV networks. Until recently, I avoided it at all costs, thinking it would be exactly the sort of movie I hate.After finally watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. Even with the odious and totally unfunny Russell Brand, it was adequately funny, an unexpected change for a romcom. There was plenty I didn't like though. There's a lot of crude humour in the film, and some of it just isn't funny. This film is the movie equivalent of a joke book. Some parts are amusing, others not so much.Overall, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' provides a few good laughs, but is rather hit and miss with its humour. A moderately amusing, but overrated comedy.",6,1,3,22 December 2016
Shaun of the Dead," The definition of comedy-horror
","'Shaun of the Dead' is as good as comedy-horrors get in my opinion. It perfectly sums up what this genre is all about - violence, gore, a silly storyline and hilarious characters. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old, but it is a timeless classic.I can't think of many better on-screen doubles than Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They are hilarious in all of the films in which they appear together. This one is probably my personal favourite though, it is brilliantly violent and gory, extremely funny and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.'Shaun of the Dead' is without doubt one of those films that everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime. It is the definition of the comedy-horror genre.",9,1,3,1 June 2016
Argo," Well-made, if not totally accurate
","I see a lot of people are unhappy about the historical accuracy of 'Argo'. As someone who knows little about the story behind this film, I feel unable to comment on if or just how inaccurate it is. What I can say though is that, as a piece of entertainment, 'Argo' is well-made and interesting.I liked the informative start to the film - I assume that bit was accurate at least? It makes for a refreshing change to the many biographical films that give little or no background to the events that occur and instead rely on the existing knowledge of the audience.'Argo' is a well-made and, at times, unexpectedly funny film. Historical inaccuracies aside, 'Argo' is solid is every department, with some especially impressive acting performances.",7,1,2,8 January 2017
12 Angry Men," A simple, timeless classic
","It just goes to show, you can have the largest budget, the greatest special effects and the most explosive action, but all a film really needs is a great script and a great cast, and '12 Angry Men' is a testament to that. Despite being over 60 years old now, this is rightly still considered by many to be one of the best films of all time.Despite virtually the entirety of this film being set in one room, this has to be one of the most compelling dramas I've seen. For a film with such a simple format, it had me hooked from start to finish.The characters are fascinating, they all have depth and back stories, come from different backgrounds and walks of life and each have unique characteristics and personalities. The script is also excellent, a masterpiece in itself.This is one of the simplest films ever made, but it's also one of the best. '12 Angry Men' is a timeless classic that will live long in the memory.",10,1,2,16 December 2016
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Strong and loyal adaptation of the classic adventure novel
","Film adaptations of classic novels often prove controversial and divisive, but I think this is a good example of how a classic fantasy adventure novel can be succesfully turned into a film while retaining everything that made the original book so popular. Taking on a special book series that brings back positive childhood memories for many is always risky and I think this film deserves a lot a credit for largely capturing the magic of the novels.It's a very well-made film, with impressive CGI and special effects, beautiful visuals and scenery and a great cast, but perhaps the most impressive part of this film is how it remains loyal to the original story. The temptation would have been there to chop and change to make the plot more screen-friendly, but keeping it as close to the original story as possible was definitely a wise choice. As fantasy/adventure films go, this has to be one of my personal favourites.",7,1,1,28 October 2018
Green Room," Tense but unexciting and predictable
","So little happens during the entire duration of 'Green Room' that it relies on individual moments of violence and gore to be entertaining. The film is tense, but never really reaches a level where it becomes exciting or unpredictable.Instead, 'Green Room' is rather bland and the plot goes exactly where I was expecting it to. For this type of film, it's also unexpectedly uneventful. There aren't any real twists, the characters aren't interesting enough. This is a film you watch but don't really care much for what happens to the characters.All in all, not my sort of film. Perhaps I went in with unrealistic expectations, but I was let down by what this 'horror' had to offer.",4,3,7,6 January 2017
Happy Gilmore," Some good light-hearted entertainment
","'Happy Gilmore' is another love/hate Adam Sandler comedy and your opinion on Sandler as an actor will probably determine whether you like this film or not. Although he has undeniably been in some stinkers, I've always liked Sandler and found him funny.It's the same old Sandler formula in 'Happy Gilmore' - silly characters, a ridiculous story and plenty of dumb jokes. Exactly what you would expect, but it does serve a purpose as a piece of light-entertainment and it does consistently provide laughs, which should be how any comedy movie is judged.Overall, 'Happy Gilmore' is definitely one of Adam Sandler's better movies. It's fun and entertaining, and that's really all you can ask for from a film like this.",7,0,1,5 April 2020
Madagascar," Good animated family fun
","'Madagascar' is a good animated family film, funny enough to be enjoyed by adults as well as kids. The main character work well together, though I would have liked to see more of the penguins and the two monkeys - the funniest characters in the movie.The plot is lacking somewhat and falls away towards the end, but there is enough fun to keep it going for the full 80 minute duration. There were some good choices for the voice actors and the animation was, as you would expect, colourful and on point.What certainly not spectacular, 'Madagascar' is good animated fun that can be enjoyed by all the family.",7,0,0,21 December 2016
The Danish Girl," Perhaps a little too sophisticated
","'The Danish Girl' is an extremely well made film with two outstanding lead performances from Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. Everything about the film has a sophisticated, elegant feel, from the constume design to the atmosphere and cinematography. This is a classy film.Although, in a way, this is to the film's detriment. The story is almost told with a mask on, it's difficult to see beyond the flawless surface and connect emotionally with the film. Everything is too nicey nicey, each scene is so perfectly crafted that it almost distracts you from what's actually happening in the film.This is a very good film, but it could have been an excellent one, had it made more of an emotional connection with the audience.",7,23,31,22 December 2016
The Irishman," I get the criticism, but I thought it was excellent
","As someone who loves (most of) Martin Scorsese's work and especially his old gangster films, 'The Irishman' was always going to be a must-see for me. As I usually do when seeing a movie, I went into this without watching the trailer and with as little knowledge or expectations about the story/film as possible, and I was not disappointed.'The Irishman' is excellent, another masterwork by Scorsese and up there with my favourite gangster films, though probably not quite on the same level as the likes of 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'. It looks fantastic with great cinematography and some smart use of CGI for anti-ageing effects. I really enjoyed the storyline, which has depth yet is relatively easy to follow, and the characters are very convincing.If it has any flaws they are certainly very minor and did not affect my enjoyment of the film. I would normally tend to agree with the criticism of the excessive length - nobody want to sit staring at a screen for three-and-a-half hours - but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'The Irishman' as it held my interest throughout. A fantastic film and another Scorsese classic.",9,8,11,4 April 2020
Finding Nemo," My favourite as a kid and still one of Pixar's best
","I have fond memories of watching this film at the cinema as a kid and enjoying every minute of it. The story, the characters, the vibrant animation - I loved everything about it. The reason 'Finding Nemo' was such a success is that it appeals to all age groups, the story and visuals are something everybody can enjoy and the humour is clearly intended to appeal to adults as well as kids.Pixar created something special when they created 'Finding Nemo' and still to this day it remains one of their best. The word 'timeless' comes to mind as I think, even with the rapid advanced in CGI and animation, this will always be a classic family movie that people will continue to revisit. 'Finding Nemo' is not just a great kids/family movie, but a great movie full stop.",8,0,0,26 October 2019
Superbad," Immature and crude but successfully funny
","'Superbad' is an immature, crude and at times offensive movie that, for obvious reasons, only appeals to a certain group of people. The movie consists of a basic, yet entertaining plot and a whole host of rude and inappropriate jokes. If it plays to your humour, 'Superbad' is a very funny movie.The characters in this film alone are hilarious. 'McLovin' provides plenty of laughs, as do the useless, childish cops. I do think the film is slightly longer than necessary, it does seem to drag towards the end and fails to justify the near 2 hour running length, but that is a minor criticism of what is a successfully funny comedy movie.If you like your comedies on the immature side and aren't easily offended by crude humour, 'Superbad' is definitely a film I would recommend.",7,2,4,6 January 2017
The Great Dictator," You, the people, have the power!
","The tagline of 'The Great Dictator' is 'the comedy masterpiece', and I couldn't think of a better line to sum this film up. It's a hilarious political satire, but it also delivers a vitally important message. This film was released at the time when Hitler was at the height of his power and the main character, dictator Hynkel, is obviously a reference to him.Charlie Chaplin is simply outstanding in this film in what was his first spoken role. To play two completely different characters, Hynkel and the Jewish barber, so convincingly in the same film is truly remarkable. Chaplin's speech at the end, which is very much HIS speech even though he's playing a character, is a piece of cinema I will never forget. Such a powerful, moving and compelling speech that remains relevant even today.Making a comedy out of such a tragedy is risky business, but Chaplin's anti-fascist message ensured it wasn't taken the wrong way. 'The Great Dictator' is a hilarious but meaningful and powerful film. A brilliant piece of cinema.",10,3,3,5 August 2017
Hot Fuzz," Brilliantly British and hilariously funny
","A lot of people doubted that 'Hot Fuzz' would even come close to 'Shaun of the Dead', and virtually nobody thought it would be better, yet both movies have identical ratings on IMDb and 'Hot Fuzz' seems to be preferred by many. Who would have thought that after the huge success of 'Shaun of the Dead'? I too loved 'Hot Fuzz' just as much, but there's no way I could choose between the two. I expected it to be good, to be honest I expected nothing less than another hilarious movie from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, but I must admit I was surprised at just how good it was. This is genuinely one of the funniest action movies there is, it is so well written.'Hot Fuzz' is a brilliantly British and hilariously funny film. This is a must watch for anybody who likes action-comedy movies.",8,0,0,1 June 2016
Orphan," Extremely creepy and disturbing
","'Orphan' is certainly one of my favourite horror movies. I love a good unexpected twist and this film has one of the best. I certainly didn't see it coming and it makes for an enthralling ending packed full of tension and drama. 'Orphan' keeps you guessing until the very end and does a great job at keeping the viewer intrigued.There are some disturbing scenes in this movie, not so much scary but certainly creepy. It is very suspenseful, especially after the twist is revealed and the film really starts to get exciting and intense. The acting and script are both excellent and make the storyline believable.This is an extremely creepy horror film with a brilliant twist. The plot is compelling and the movie as a whole is put together very well. It will keep you guessing until the very end. 'Orphan' is a great horror film.",8,1,2,30 May 2016
Home Alone," There's only one Home Alone
","Well... there's 5, but there's only one Home Alone series, and no matter how many movies try to copy the idea, none of them will ever come close to the original Home Alone. This is one of the most enjoyable, fun movies ever made, and will continue to be for years to come.'Home Alone' is such an iconic Christmas movie and there isn't a year goes by without it appearing on our televisions over the festive period. It is such a crowd-pleaser, a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age and movie preference. Frankly, if you don't like 'Home Alone', there must be something wrong with you!Merry Christmas ya filthy animals!",8,3,4,24 December 2016
Spotlight," Covers a sensitive topic with dignity
","'Spotlight' covers a sensitive subject matter, so it was imperative that the story was told with as much consideration as possible for those affected. I found it to be an effective and accurate portrayal of some truly sickening events, with appropriate emphasis on the dialogue and characters. The writers deserve a lot of credit for this.The film makes for compelling viewing and once your hooked, it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen until the film is over. Everything had to be done just right, especially as the shocking revelations were unfolding. It was generally very impressive.'Spotlight' does more than just tell a story. It tells a very difficult one and it does it with dignity. A very well made film.",7,0,0,11 December 2016
L.A. Confidential," Style, tension and drama in abundance
","'LA Confidential' is a very well-made, stylish and hugely enjoyable detective movie with the full package of everything you expect from a crime drama, from great action to tension and drama - this film has it all in abundance.The individual acting performances in this film are great, the trio of Spacey, Pearce and Crowe deliver perhaps some of the best performances of their career. Far from being the stereotypical action-packed cop flick, 'LA Confidential' gives us a proper storyline with excellent character development. That's what makes it stand out from the crowd.'LA Confidential' is comfortably one of the best crime dramas of the 90s. A proper detective story that has you gripped from the start, without the need for excessive action and violence. A must watch for fans of this genre.",8,0,1,24 February 2017
Deadpool 2," More expensive trash filled with forced humour
","People who liked the first 'Deadpool' have no reason to dislike this sequel because it is practically the same film. The only difference being 'Deadpool 2' lacks the originality and 'freshness' of its predecessor. The jokes are all the same and are just as unfunny as they were two years earlier. The plot is also just as absent as it was in the original.The aim of this film (and the first 'Deadpool') just seems to be to cram in as many crude jokes, as many action sequences, as much violence and as much CGI/special effects as possible. Everything is massively overkill, probably because the main audience for a film like this doesn't have the attention span to actually sit and watch a two-hour movie without a bunch of gimmicks to keep them interested.'Deadpool 2' is practically the same as 'Deadpool'. If you liked the first film, you'll like this one too. Personally I don't understand the appeal - all I see is expensive trash filled with forced humour.",2,1,4,12 November 2019
Midnight in Paris," Elegant but rather dull
","'Midnight in Paris' has a certain charm and elegance about it, no doubt thanks to the delightful Parisian setting and magical atmosphere, which the film captured perfectly. I enjoyed the film primarily because of this, but also because it is significantly lacking in other areas.I can't say I was particularly impressed with Owen Wilson, playing Hollywood writer Gil. He didn't do the character justice and it felt like he was completely out of his comfort zone. For a romcom, it lacked much comedy. Amusing is probably the most appropriate word, but even then the amusing moments are few and far between.The short running time does the film a favour, otherwise this would have been a drag. 'Midnight in Paris' is a elegant but rather dull film.",6,0,0,7 December 2016
Zodiac," Fascinating and successfully chilling
","'Zodiac' is a compelling and very well-made film focusing on an amateur detective's investigation into the infamous Zodiac killer, whose identity remains a mystery to this day. It is rare for a factual crime film to go into such detail about events that took place in real life, but 'Zodiac' ensures that all of the key points of this case are covered. As a result, the film is nearly three hours long, but every scene serves a purpose and the running time is never felt.The graphic scenes of murder at the very start of the film do a good job at setting the scene, throwing the audience right into the case and creating a tense atmosphere from the get go. The tension rarely lets up, with the pacing of the film ensuring that there's always a new plot development around the corner. The acting is also very good, with Jake Gyllenhaal delivering the stand out performance and probably a career best from him. An excellent film all round, highly recommended for those who enjoy true crime stories.",8,0,0,9 December 2017
Cloverfield," Decent if unremarkable found footage thriller
","I'm no fan of the 'found footage' format and have never understood the popularity of the original 'Blair Witch Project' movie, but I honestly don't think 'Cloverfield' is as bad as some of the other reviews would have you believe. The film is exactly what you expect it to be - a first person thriller full of scares, screams and CGI. It's unoriginal, uninspiring and unspectacular, but it was never intended to be in the first place.If you can put your brain into neutral for an hour an a half, 'Cloverfield' is a decent if unremarkable piece of entertainment. Okay, the constant camera movement is nauseating and the characters dumb and annoying, but it functions well as a cheap sci-fi flick. 'Cloverfield' is nothing new and nothing special, but it's okay for what it is.",6,1,1,13 January 2018
Hotel Rwanda," Powerful story about the impact of war
","'Hotel Rwanda' is a powerful and moving film that tells the true story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina's heroics during the Rwandan genocide. Admittedly I hadn't heard of Rusesabagina before watching this film and certainly wasn't aware of the huge role he played in helping over a thousand war refugees. I'm glad I decided to watch 'Hotel Rwanda' though as it's one of the most amazing acts of compassion I've ever seen.Don Cheadle was the perfect choice to play Rusesabagina, his performance in this film is near flawless. It is especially impressive given the added pressure of playing a real-life hero. 'Hotel Rwanda' as a whole is a very well-made film and, unlike other true story film, it never loses focus and presents the events as they happened. The production and cinematography is great, as is the acting by all involved.I would highly recommend 'Hotel Rwanda', especially for those like me who were not aware of Rusesabagina's story. An amazing story and a great film all round.",8,0,0,28 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Reviewers
","Hmm, I don't know what the people who have given this 1s and 2s were watching (or smoking), but 'The Hateful Eight' deserves at least half marks based on the dialogue, acting and cinematography alone, all of which were first class. To completely write a film off and give it 1 star because the story didn't meet your expectations is just stupid.Tarantino's latest film is predictably violent and, perhaps even more predictably, long. Most of this three hour movie is set in one location, and yet the dialogue and relationship between the characters is plenty enough to keep it entertaining. I've sat through films half the running time that felt longer than this.'The Hateful Eight' does too many things too well to be disregarded, as it has been by many. I thought it was a great piece of filmmaking and a movie I will definitely watch again sometime in the future.",9,3,8,9 December 2016
"I, Tonya"," Margot Robbie shines in this fascinating biography
","I hadn't heard of Tonya Harding prior to watching this film but what an interesting story she had. 'I, Tonya' is an entertaining biography film that manages successfully to be both fun and serious at the same time. The film is impressively constructed and the contradictory character interviews work really well, adding a lot of humour to the story.Margot Robbie is an excellent actress and it was nice to see her in a role that allowed her to shine rather than in trash like 'Suicide Squad'. She does a great job at portraying a complex and fascinating character.Tonya's story is certainly an interesting one that was worth making a film about. Ultimately only she knows the truth about what happened. 'I, Tonya' is a great biographical film - entertaining, educational, and all-round good fun.",7,4,5,3 November 2019
We Were Soldiers," Well-made but difficult to connect with
","There's no shortage of Vietnam war films out there and, of the ones I've seen, 'We Were Soldiers' has to be one of the weaker ones. While this film has everything we've come to expect from the high-budget war genre in that it's well-made, well-acted and looks great, it does nothing to stand out from the crowd and is relatively weak in terms of plot and originality.Despite what should have been an engaging and moving storyline, the pedestrian pacing and over-the-top dialogue and violence makes it difficult to fully invest in what's happening.'We Were Soldiers' is a solid, watchable film, but it is surprisingly forgettable and difficult to connect with compared to other similar war films.",5,0,2,27 October 2019
Molly's Game," Fascinating and rewarding biographical drama
","There is a lot to like about 'Molly's Game' and the film gets a lot more right than it does wrong. I always enjoy films based on a true story, especially when they are as unique and interesting as this one. It's also always refreshing to see a biographical film without knowing anything about the story beforehand. I for one had never heard of Molly Bloom or her story, so it really made for fascinating viewing.The film runs very smoothly and despite the rather long running length, it never goes through any lulls and always feels fast-paced and on the move. 'Molly's Game' is not only an entertaining film but it's also informative and educational. The story is approached well, digging beyond the surface and ensuring no detail is missed from the story.'Molly's Game' is a strong biographical drama that does a very good job overall at telling a fascinating story.",7,20,27,31 October 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," Wonderful combination of fantasy and reality
","Few would dispute that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it's also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren't many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.The combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone. Overall, a wonderful film and one of the best fantasy/adventures of the 00s.",9,18,21,4 February 2018
The Way Back," Beautifully shot, compelling survival story
","'The Way Back' is an impressive film all round. Based on a remarkable true survival story of a group of escaped prisoners and their 4,000 mile journey on foot to freedom, this film was always going to be make for fascinating viewing and the story certainly lives up to expectation. There are some excellent performances from the lead actors and the film is shot beautifully, capturing the stunning scenery and surroundings perfectly.I always appreciate true story films where the story is allowed to speak for itself, with no artificial Hollywood drama or superficiality. The plot of 'The Way Back' remains faithful to the true story it is based on and the characters have depth and personality. The film does go through a few lulls, particularly towards the middle, and does move at a slow pace throughout, so a good level of patience is required. Overall, this is a very good survival film and an example of how a true story should be converted to the big screen.",7,0,0,8 October 2018
Begin Again," A pleasant musical surprise
","James Cordon alert! If I'd taken the effort to look at who was starring in this movie, I would have probably avoided it, but in a way I'm pleased I didn't. Cordon aside, this was an enjoyable 2 hours or so. Like many others, I expected this movie to be riddled with clichés, cheesy dialogue and cringy scenes - we've come to expect it from this sub-genre.'Begin Again' isn't really guilty of any of those things, or certainly not to the extent where it ruins the enjoyment of the movie. The plot is about more than just music and the dialogue felt natural, with believable performances from Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo.'Begin Again' is a good movie all round. Definitely a must watch for music lovers and enjoyable for everybody else too.",7,0,0,14 September 2016
Alien," Probably the best film of the sci-fi genre
","'Alien' is by far the most enjoyable sci-fi movie I can remember seeing, though admittedly that is partly down to the fact it's a genre I'm not particularly fond of and tend to avoid. Films like 'Star Wars', loved by most, don't really do anything for me. Though I do enjoy a good horror, which 'Alien' most certainly is.Considering 'Alien' was released in 1979, it feels remarkably fresh. It's a film that has aged extremely well - even today the horror elements are just as effective and don't feel dated like in many other older horrors. It feels very polished, everything from the acting to the cinematography is difficult to fault. 'Alien' also builds and maintains tension as well as any modern horror. An excellent sci-fi horror movie.",8,1,2,17 August 2017
The Book Thief," Wonderful story and an excellent screen adaptation
","I should start off by saying that I have not read the book that this film is adapted from, and so I can't compare the two. I've noticed that virtually all of the negative reviews for 'The Book Thief' are from people who have read the book but were disappointed with the screen adaptation - personally I think the film should be judged in its own right.As someone who watched 'The Book Thief' without knowing anything about the story beforehand, I thought it was excellent. Sophie Nelisse is outstanding as Liesel and puts on a highly convincing German accent. The main characters are all likeable and the relationships between them is probably the best part of the film.This is a wonderful story and a great film all round, highly recommended!",8,0,0,26 April 2016
Blades of Glory," Watchable and at times amusing, but a let down overall
","Will Ferrell and Jon Heder have delivered some of the funniest acting performances over the years and are probably two of my favourite comedy actors. Heder's performance as Napoleon Dynamite will never get old and Ferrell seems to provide laughs no matter the material. For whatever reason though, neither of them are particularly funny in 'Blades of Glory'. This just feels like you average, generic comedy and neither actor really made their role their own.'Blades of Glory' had the potential to be a comedy classic but instead it's very hit and miss - probably more miss than hit in fact. Far too much of the first half of the film is laugh-free and for a satirical comedy it focuses way too much on storytelling and misses too many opportunities for jokes. Compare it to similar movies like 'Dodgeball' and it's clear that 'Blades of Glory' comes up short.It could have been great, but 'Blades of Glory' is amusing at best and a big let down overall.",5,1,2,3 November 2018
Horrible Bosses," Above average silly comedy
","There is plenty to like about 'Horrible Bosses'. It boasts a strong cast, including Jennifer Aniston and the hilarious Jason Sudeikis. The script is better than expected with a good number of funny jokes and witty humour, though a lot of the laughs are down to the cast and not the material.There are a few unexpected dull patches here and there, but it recovers and there are some really funny individual scenes. Aniston's character in particular delivers some good laugh out loud moments, but it struggles to be consistently funny. Overall, 'Horrible Bosses' is an above average comedy with a good cast. Recommended for those who enjoy silly comedy movies.",6,0,0,19 August 2017
The Polar Express," One of my favourite Christmas films
","I have a small collection of Christmas movies that I can watch every year without getting bored of, and this is one of them. I love the story and the animation is just beautiful.'The Polar Express' captures the Christmas spirit as well as any Christmas film I have seen. It has a truly magical feel about it and provides endless festive adventure and excitement. The attention to detail is very impressive, so much so that it's hard to believe this film is over 10 years old.I would consider 'The Polar Express' one of my favourite Christmas movies and one that I always look forward to putting on over the festive period.",8,6,8,2 December 2016
Black Mass," This is Depp's film from start to finish
","Had a less talented actor taken the lead in 'Black Mess', it wouldn't have been half the film it is. Johnny Depp completely carries this film, elevating what is some very average material and a generic script to something that is at least engaging and occasionally entertaining. His portrayal of notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger is brilliant, and is the sole reason that 'Black Mass' is worth watching.Depp aside, this film doesn't have much going for it. As someone who watches a lot of crime/dramas, there's nothing about the storyline or script of 'Black Mass' that makes it stand out. It's dominated by scenes of blood and violence and often gets carried away with itself, but beyond the high level production and Depp's excellent acting, 'Black Mess' is just a standard gangster film.",6,2,2,28 March 2018
Nacho Libre," Disastrous, Jack Black's worst film
","What a truly dreadful movie this is. I think I laughed twice, for the rest of the 1hr 30m running time I was sat there puzzled as to how anybody could think this movie was any good.I'm a big fan of Jack Black but this is, in my opinion, the worst movie he has featured in. Despite being a naturally funny actor, he wasn't at all funny in Nacho Libre. Not only is 'Nacho Libre' short on laughs but it's also extremely boring. The intention was probably to create another dumb Napoleon Dynamite-type movie, but Napoleon Dynamite was funny. Nacho Libre is just dumb.I hoped and expected that Nacho Libre would be a good comedy movie but it failed on so many levels. A disastrous movie.",2,0,2,22 May 2016
The Town," Good balance of storytelling and action
","For a film with such a dull and uninspiring title, 'The Town' is surprisingly bold and original. It effectively balances an interesting and engaging storyline with some great action sequences. Heist movies are always at risk of being generic and repetitive but this one ensures that never happens with an original, convincing plot and an interesting bunch of characters.The crime genre has become increasingly stale and action-obsessed in recent years, so 'The Town' deserves credit for focussing on story and character development as much as action and violence. Great action films with credible plots are hard to come by these days, but 'The Town' is one of them.",7,2,2,16 November 2017
Closer," Dark, intelligent drama
","'Closer' is a smart, well-written and unusually dark romance, with strong acting performances from 4 very talented actors at the top of their game - Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and Julia Roberts make this film a pleasure to watch.The plot is dark, even sinister, highlighting the very worst in human behaviour when it comes to relationships. It feels very realistic, even for such an unusual story. This isn't your typical romance and is very much an adults film. 'Closer' is a dark and intelligent drama.",6,0,1,23 May 2017
Suicide Squad," What a let down
","This film was hyped up so much that it was almost inevitable that it wouldn't live up to such high expectations, so I was half prepared to be let down. What I wasn't prepared for was just how shoddy and poor 'Suicide Squad' actually is. The plot is weak and its delivery is messy and at times confusing.Even the action is below what I had expected, which is unacceptable considering what can be done with CGI and special effects in 2016. How can something so hyped, so highly anticipated and with so much potential turn out as lame and underwhelming as this? The film is poor and great actors such as Will Smith are wasted on such disappointing material.I went into this film expecting to be let down, and I was. But it was a hell of a lot worse than I was expecting. 'Suicide Squad' is one of the most overly hyped and hugely disappointing movies of the last few years.",4,1,1,14 January 2017
Elf," Timeless festive fun
","There are very few Christmas movies, or movies in general for that matter, that I could watch over and over again without getting sick of. 'Elf' is one of those movies.We're approaching the festive season as I write this review and, being such a crowdpleaser, this movie is already appearing in TV listings everywhere. It seems to grow in popularity year-on-year and it's hard to believe that it's been 14 years since its release.Will Ferrell without doubt makes the film what it is. He gets his character spot on and provides plenty of laughs for adults as well as kids. There are some hilarious individual scenes and the movie as a whole is just great fun, which is what Christmas movies should be.For sheer entertainment value, 'Elf' is without question one of the best.",8,6,7,6 December 2017
Capote," Strong lead performance, average film
","Philip Seymour Hoffman does a wonderful job as Truman Capote in this film, so much so that he carries it from start to finish and is the sole reason the movie has received such positive reviews from critics and audiences. Hoffman is difficult to fault, but the film as a whole is far from perfect.'Capote' is supposed to be a biography of novelist Truman Capote, yet offers very little background on the man himself. People going into this film with little knowledge of Capote will be disappointed when the credits roll and find they don't know much more than they did 2 hours ago. Surely that's not what you would expect from a so- called 'biographical film'?For all it positive aspects, including an outstanding lead acting performance, 'Capote' is let down by its narrow approach. I wanted and expected so much more from this film.",6,1,5,2 May 2017
Life of Pi," Beautiful in every sense of the word
","'Life of Pi' is without doubt one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the decade. It is visually mesmerizing, so rich in detail and jawdroppingly realistic. I regret not seeing it at the cinema when it was first released because I think films as visually arresting as this one really need to be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated.There's more to this film than just CGI and special effects though. The story is just as beautiful as the visuals are and, unlike some of the other CGI heavy films of recent years, it has a plot with substance and characters with depth. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will no doubt watch it again at some point in the future.'Life of Pi' is a beautiful film both inside and out. Cinema doesn't get much better than this.",9,1,2,6 December 2017
Lost in Translation," Lost on me...
","I usually agree with the general consensus on what makes a good film and what doesn't, but very occasionally I find myself watching a widely popular film and wondering what on earth people saw in it. 'Lost in Translation' is one of those films. It did nothing for me and I thought it was very average and even forgettable.It doesn't matter to me how slow or subtle a drama film is, but I do expect it to connect with me and make me feel something. 'Lost in Translation' left me cold. I found it to be dull and uninspiring. The characters are wooden and emotionless. The plot does nothing and goes nowhere.Maybe I will rewatch this film on another day and see it in another light, but on first viewing, 'Lost in Translation' is lost on me.",5,5,7,24 October 2017
Interstellar," Pretentious, self-important and void of fun
","'Interstellar' is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. Going into this movie, everybody would have expected an extremely well made, visually beautiful spectacle, and that's what you get. However, everything else about the film is a disappointment.Sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun, unless of course you're watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. Throughout 'Interstellar', I found my mind wandering, and I must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. The film just isn't sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time.Whilst visually impressive, 'Interstellar' is void of fun. In fact it's void of anything that will make you change your expression. This is just one long, pretentious and self-important film that isn't anywhere near as good as the ratings suggest.",6,5,8,24 March 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Unusually deep for a crime drama
","Original, deep and thought provoking films like this one are hard to come by these days. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' takes a completely different approach to the conventional crime drama. Instead of detailing the story behind the missing girl, the focus is instead of the mother's way of dealing with the disappearance and how she handles her grief and anger towards the authorities.This film is excellent in just about every area. The script is intelligent and surprisingly funny, the storyline engaging and convincing, and the acting is first rate. Frances McDormand is outstanding in the lead and thoroughly deserved her Oscar.'Three Billboards' is a unique and fascinating film, great filmmaking all-round and highly recommended.",8,2,3,1 April 2018
Lion," Emotional drama, but missing that special something
","Based on an extraordinary true story, 'Lion' was always going to be an emotional and compelling film. It succeeds in doing what you expect it to, but is missing that special something that separates the best biographical films from the good ones. True story films like this one always have the ability to be emotionally overwhelming and powerful, but 'Lion' just never reaches the level to make you sit up and take notice.The film is technically great, with a strong script and some great cinematography, which contributes immensely to the feel and atmosphere of the film. It also features an exceptional acting performance from Dev Patel. In my opinion it's his career best, which is saying something given how good he was in 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Overall, 'Lion' is a solid and emotional drama, but it just didn't connect with me like the very best biographical films do. It's missing that special something.",7,1,1,7 October 2017
Forrest Gump," A special film that everybody should see at least once
","I must have seen 'Forrest Gump' 4 or 5 times now and it seems to get better with every watch. Few people would dispute that this film is a classic, with many memorable individual scenes and lines, but it's more than that for me. This is a film with heart and soul, with meaning and purpose - a film that is just as effective and moving the second or third time you watch it as it is the first. There aren't many films that can achieve that and that's what makes it so special.Tom Hanks is just perfect as Forrest and his performance is one of, if not my favourite, of all time from an actor. You know an actor has made a character his own when you just can't imagine anybody else in the role - Tom Hanks IS Forrest Gump. His performance, just like the film as a whole, is not to be missed.There aren't many films that I love enough to watch over and over, but 'Forrest Gump' is one of them. This is a film that everybody should see at least once in their lifetime.",10,1,2,28 August 2018
Gone Baby Gone," Convincing plot and realistic characters
","'Gone Baby Gone' is one of the strongest and most realistic mystery/drama films of the last decade. It is often difficult to buy into the storyline of films like this, either because they are too far- fetched, or the plot isn't properly developed. This isn't the case with 'Gone Baby Gone', it is very well-written and the characters all feel very realistic.This is a drama film more than anything and there is a lot of emphasis on the dialogue. The viewer has to pay attention to pick up on plot developments and the film has some very good and well-timed twists.I was impressed and thought that 'Gone Baby Gone' was a good film all round, with a convincing and well-constructed plot and an interesting and realistic bunch of characters.",7,1,1,16 October 2017
"Monsters, Inc."," Not Pixar's best, but a fun and likeable family movie
","'Monsters, Inc.' is one of Pixar's best known and most widely popular movies - an endearing and highly likeable family movie bursting with ideas and imagination. Though not one of Pixar's best and not a personal favourite of mine, I did get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie, especially the characters, which are all brilliantly unique, entertaining and genuinely funny.The storyline, as enjoyable as it is, is not on the same level as the likes of 'Toy Story' and 'Up'. I always get the feeling I'm watching something special with those movies, but I think 'Monsters, Inc.', for all its creativity and likeability, lacks that special quality to put it up there with the very best animated pictures. That said, judging it on its own merits, this is a great animated family movie and one of those movies that is just impossible to dislike.",7,1,2,17 July 2018
Fargo," A quirky and highly entertaining film
","'Fargo' is another quirky gem from the Coen brothers and one of the best black comedy I've seen from the 90s. I always finds the Coens' films to be hugely enjoyable but this one was particularly rewarding for me.I thought the plot was great and the characters fun and entertaining. The dark and subtle humour was also right up my street and provided lots of good laughs.I'm not sure how much of this supposedly 'true story' is actually true, but the storyline was clearly never intended to be taken seriously. That said, it is also quite effective as a thriller and as silly as the characters and plot are, it does have you gripped and wanting to know what happens next.A great film all round - interesting, absorbing and yet light-hearted and highly entertaining.",8,2,2,22 April 2019
Predator," Criminally overrated
","I fail to see how this film has earned a reputation for being a 'classic'. 'Predator' is nothing more than an average action flick with a thin and uninspiring plot. In fact, looking a some older critic reviews, that's how it was received when it was initially released. Only a number of years after later did this film start receiving such rave reviews, and I can't see why.Even for a so-called action film, there's too much waiting around, too much stumbling around in the jungle and not enough actually happening. There's nothing wrong with the action scenes, they are well made and some of the infra-red footage is cool, especially for its time. The film as a whole though is nothing special and far from being a classic. 'Predator' is a criminally overrated movie.",5,1,10,26 August 2017
Nightcrawler," Original, compelling thriller
","This is a fascinating and unique movie - I can't remember seeing anything like it before. It's one of a kind. The idea is an interesting one but the way it was executed on screen deserves a lot of credit, at no point did it feel predictable or repetitive like it could have easily done. The film has very few negative points but if I was t highlight one... personally I felt like I was waiting for something to happen that never arrived, maybe a twist or something that would have made it more memorable and distinctive. Nonetheless, I thought 'Nightcrawler' was a really good movie that kept me intrigued until the very last moment. One that I would recommend and happily watch again.",7,0,0,17 September 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," I don't understand the critics, this was great
","I'd heard lots of good things about 'Bohemian Rhapsody' so was surprised to see that the critical reception of it was far from flattering. From the perspective of an ordinary moviegoer like myself, there is a lot to enjoy about this film and not much at all to complain about. But then again, I'm not a film 'expert'.Personally I thought the film did a very good job at balancing telling Freddie Mercury's personal life story with the story of 'Queen' and their rise to the top. It's engaging, fast-paced, informative, and very enjoyable, and as someone who has always loved 'Queen' and their music, I was thoroughly entertained. I also thought Rami Malek was pretty faultless as Mercury - I wasn't too familiar with him before this film but I was impressed.A film about Freddie Mercury and Queen was long overdue and I thought 'Bohemian Rhapsody' lived up to expectations. I'm sure it has its faults, as the critics have highlighted, but to the average viewer who doesn't go looking for problems, it's great.",8,1,2,17 November 2019
Bird Box," Nonsensical tripe for the average zombie Netflix viewer
","Anyone in any doubt that horror movie standards are lower today than they ever have been should give 'Bird Box' a watch. Even at a time when illogical, incoherent, make-it-up-as-you-go-along movies are just about everywhere, this one struck me as being particularly dumb.The plot is pretty ridiculous to begin with and uses the usual 'sci-fi' cop-out to avoid having to explain anything. But even when pushing fiction to the limits, there are still some things that need explaining. Are we supposed to just accept that the characters can navigate dangerous river rapids while blindfolded and drive completely blind? Did I miss the part where they were revealed to be superhumans?I see that 'Bird Box' has drawn a lot of comparisons to 'A Quiet Place' and I would have to agree - both are truly awful movies with nonsensical storylines and gaping plot holes. There is no reason to prefer one over the other.",3,3,3,2 March 2020
Baby Driver," Cool idea but it falls well short of its potential
","'Baby Driver' was probably the movie I was most looking forward to seeing this year. The trailers looked awesome and with a director as talented as Edgar Wright at the helm, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, after a great start and a memorable opening sequence, it gradually falls away. The film is so obsessed with its style and appearance that it completely forgets to do what all movies are supposed to - entertain.The plot is, in a word, rubbish. I can't believe Edgar Wright went from thinking up something as brilliantly original as 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' to a generic car chase action flick like 'Baby Driver'. If you take away the music, this film has already been done dozens of times before. The main character is also remarkably uninteresting. I don't know if the actor is to blame here, but 'Baby' spends 90% of the film just standing there looking smug. I found the character boring and a bad rip-off of Ryan Gosling's intriguing character in 'Drive'.",5,9,20,24 September 2017
The Village," Completely forgettable with an underwhelming twist
","Firstly, 'The Village' isn't a horror film and I'm not sure why it was marketed as such. There's no scares, no gore, nothing at all that resembles horror. Describing it as a thriller is a bit of a stretch too as the 'thrills' are virtually non-existent. This is a drama film and a boring one at that. It's painfully slow and uneventful with a dull bunch of characters and a rather forgettable storyline.After sitting through such a drab 60 minutes or so, you at least expect an ending that packs a punch and makes the rest of the film feel worthwhile. Unfortunately, for me at least, the 'twist' ending was a big let-down. It was unexpected, but just because I didn't see it coming didn't make it any less of a disappointment. 'The Village' is just about watchable, but there's not much point when there are far more effective thrillers out there to watch instead.",4,0,5,7 November 2019
The Revenant," 10 for style, 0 for substance
","Stunning scenery and visually beautiful throughout... but I can experience that, and so much more, by taking a trip to a local nature reserve. At least there I don't have to experience such lousy storytelling, poor dialogue and highly improbable events.The 'plot' is repetitive and predictable, with holes the size of craters. Never before have I seen a man make such a miraculous recovery - from being on his death bed and unable to move, to swimming through ice cold rivers within the space of a few scenes.The film grows more and more ridiculous with every passing scene. At least there are some pretty snow covered mountains to look at... until the snow magically disappears.",5,2,3,6 November 2016
Bridge of Spies," Great historical drama
","'Bridge of Spies' is a very well made, informative and entertaining spy movie inspired by true events during the Cold War. Arguably the most impressive part of this film is the brilliant cinematography and design, with some great attention to detail. The film is beautifully shot and a delight to watch.Mark Rylance is brilliant as soviet spy Rudolf Abel, a compelling and mysterious man. Rylance got his character spot on, and of course I have to mention the ever-reliable Tom Hanks, who is near perfect as attorney James Donovan. As he always seems to be.The ending of the movie, which eventually arrives after 2 or 3 fake endings, was nicely done and topped off what was a great historical drama.",8,2,4,14 December 2016
American Psycho," On reflection, I thought it was great
","I wasn't sure what to think of 'American Psycho' when I was watching it, probably because I didn't know if it was supposed to be a comedy, a thriller, or a horror. On reflection, I've realised that it's a very successful mix of all three. It made me laugh, it creeped me out, and it has enough violence and gore to rival most horror movies.It's also an excellent character study that gives us an insight into the mind and thoughts of a psychopath. Christian Bale is great as 'psycho' Patrick Bateman, delivering a performance that is both highly convincing and entertaining to watch.Overall, 'American Psycho' is a great film that is probably more satisfying on reflection than 'in the moment'. It wasn't what I was expecting at all, but the more I think about it, the more I like what I saw.",8,0,0,26 December 2019
The Shining," Masterpiece in suspense and terror
","It's almost 4 decades since the release of 'The Shining', yet it's still cited to this day by many as the best horror film of all time. While there have been many great horrors released since, it's difficult to make a case for any of them being as terrorising and relentlessly tense as 'The Shining'. This is the mother of all horror films and, unless something truly groundbreaking comes along that completely reinvents the genre, it always will be.Jack Nicholson's performance in this film is one of the best I've even seen from an actor. Watching his character slowly losing his mental sanity is terrifying to watch, especially since it's so realistically portrayed by Nicholson. 'The Shining' is a relentlessly frightening film and the final sequence is comfortably one of the most terrifying, and most memorable, in film history. This is a must-see for horror fans, and highly recommended for film fans in general.",9,1,3,18 January 2018
"I, Robot"," Cool mix of sci-fi, action and drama
","If you put your brain into neutral and don't think too much, then 'I, Robot' makes for a good couple of hours of entertainment. What sets this film apart from so many other sci-fi films is that it doesn't go overboard with the CGI and special effects. The plot is always at the forefront of what is happening, which is rare for a movie like this.Will Smith is excellent as Detective Spooner. The presence of the increasingly intolerable Shia LaBuffoon is unfortunate, but it doesn't take too much away from the film overall. Ordinarily sci-fi movies aren't my thing, but I enjoyed 'I, Robot' a lot more than I expected. A good all round piece of entertainment.",7,0,0,22 July 2017
Over the Hedge," The odd joke for adults but very much a kids movie
","Dreamworks is famous for animated classics such as 'Shrek' and 'Madagascar', but 'Over the Hedge' is probably one of their least renowned movies. I didn't think I had seen it until my memory was jogged by the scene with the racoon in the dangerous garden. That should give you an idea of how memorable this movie is - not very.I continued watching though and it's a decent enough piece of entertainment. It strikes me as being aimed a lot more at kids than the likes of 'Shrek', which had a lot humour in it that would only be picked up by adults. The vast majority of the humour in 'Over the Hedge' is aimed at kids, including an abundance of fart jokes. The plot is also extremely thin... I guess Dreamworks were low on ideas after the release of Madagascar the previous year.",5,0,0,3 September 2017
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Not as witty as the original
","The original 'Madagascar' was one of the funniest animated films I'd seen in a long time, characterised by witty humour, hilarious one-liners and some brilliantly funny characters. The sequel is unfortunately a downgrade, a cut-and-paste job that loses a lot of what made the first movie so good.The plot in the sequel isn't as interesting, in fact there's not much of a 'plot' - not a lot happens. It did make me laugh on occasions, but no where near as much as the first film. 'Madagascar 2' is a decent enough sequel but it's not as witty and smart as the original.",6,1,1,16 April 2017
We're the Millers," Through plain silliness, this is a funny movie
","'We're the Millers' has got to be one of the funniest and most entertaining films I've seen in a long time. It makes for a refreshing change from the generic, politically correct garbage that is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid. At last, a comedy film that takes risks and doesn't go out of its way to avoid offending people.Everything about this film is just plain silly. The plot is absurd, the characters are ridiculous, but it all contributes to a very funny, highly entertaining movie. Jason Sudeikis puts in one of the funniest performances I've seen from any actor in a comedy film. His facial expressions alone are enough to crack you up.I didn't like the look of this film when it came out, but it proved to be a real hit. 'We're the Millers' is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and one I'm sure to revisit.",8,2,6,1 January 2017
Apocalypse Now," For the most part, a great war movie
","The first three quarters of 'Apocalypse Now' is excellent, a near flawless portrayal of the Vietnam War. The last quarter didn't do much for me at all, especially the butchering of the ox and the long, drawn out final scenes. I don't think either added much to the film overall.The film is brilliantly acted and directed with stunning visuals and cinematography, one of the most realistic and compelling portrayals of war I've seen. Martin Sheen delivers a memorable performance as Captain Willard. All in all, despite a final quarter that wasn't what I had hoped for, 'Apocalypse Now' is a technically great war film.",7,0,0,17 April 2017
Disturbia," One of the better mystery thrillers
","'Disturbia' is a solid, entertaining thriller that does exactly what it says on the tin. Whilst it's nothing new or special, it is well made, suspenseful and effective in building and sustaining tension.Shia LaBeouf and David Morse deliver solid performances as Kale and villain Mr Turner. Their characters are interesting and unpredictable and work well with the theme of the film. 'Disturbia' is well paced, the developments are appropriately timed and the film does a good job at keeping you guessing.All in all, a perfectly decent mystery thriller. One of the better ones I have seen of late, and one I would recommend.",7,9,10,24 December 2016
The Patriot," Mel Gibson's world of pure imagination
","For a so-called historical drama, 'The Patriot' seems to care a lot less about presenting the facts and reality of the events of the American Revolution and more about smearing the British through lies and deception.Not only are the events portrayed in this film misleading and historically inaccurate, but some are completely fabricated. In one scene, for example, a British soldier burns a church full of Americans to the ground, something that never happened and was clearly just thought-up by Gibson because the actual events weren't juicy enough for the anti-British narrative he was pushing.Presenting these events in a fictional context would be bad enough, but including them in what's supposed to be a true and accurate historic account is dangerous. It's also completely unnecessary, what exactly was Mel Gibson trying to achieve by distorting the truth, other than to vilify British soldiers?",1,5,12,1 December 2017
Dunkirk," Visually impressive but lacking emotion
","I don't know what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they just never appeal to me. Just like his previous films, 'Dunkirk' is technically great yet completely fails to connect on an emotional level. It's cold-hearted, soulless storytelling and no amount of visual effects can deflect from that.I know that the purpose of this film is to take a wider, more broad approach to telling the story of what happened in Dunkirk rather than following an individual character/event within the war, but for a film like this to be completely void of emotion is disappointing and it can't have been what Nolan had envisaged.The acting is good and the visuals are great, but beyond that 'Dunkirk' didn't do much for me at all. It's missing characters and emotion - two things that should be at the core of any war film.",6,3,4,10 November 2019
Ratatouille," An animated classic and a movie for everyone
","'Ratatouille' is without doubt one of Pixar's very best films and, along with 'Up', my personal favourite of theirs. This is more than just an animated comedy or a kids film, it's a film for everyone, regardless of age or movie preference. This film is impossible to dislike.The animation is stunning, the story so original and imaginative, and from the first scene to the last, this is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I must have seen 'Ratatouille' 3 or 4 times now and I seem to enjoy it more and more with every watch. Films like this don't come around very often. 'Ratatouille' is an animated classic.",8,1,1,4 June 2017
The Lego Movie," It really shouldn't work, but it does
","'The LEGO Movie' brings LEGO to life in a lively, action packed film. On paper, this movie really shouldn't have worked. Taking a popular kids' toy and making a movie out of it was a big risk and was never going to please everyone. Part of the reason it turned out so well is because it doesn't even take itself seriously. LEGO itself is the butt of many of the jokes in the film.The story is better than expected and the characters are funny and interesting. Visually this film is spectacular. The amount of detail in each frame is mind-blowing. It's amazing to watch. I would have never expected a film based on a toy to be such a hit, and not only with kids. 'The LEGO Movie' is about as good as I could have hoped it to be. If you think about the many things that could have gone wrong with this movie, it's impressive how well it was received.",7,1,2,17 August 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," Amazing true story with great performances
","I finally got round to watching 'Dallas Buyers Club', which had been on my watchlist for a while, and it did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it had everything I'd hoped for - amazing story, brilliant performances and some great humour.This would have been a great film anyway but the fact that it is actually a true story just makes it all the better. Ron Woodroof was certainly an interesting character and while I couldn't say how accurate the portrayal of his character was in this film, Matthew McConaughey certainly delivers a fantastic and hugely entertaining performance as him.Overall, a great film that I would highly recommend. 'Dallas Buyers Club' has everything and is probably up there as one of my favourite films of the last decade.",9,0,1,22 March 2020
The Exorcist," Forever a terrifying movie
","As someone who wasn't born until long after the release of this movie, I probably have a higher tolerance when it comes to horrors, but I still found this to be a genuinely frightening and disturbing movie.Virtually every aspect of this movie is horrific and enough to freak anybody out. For me it wasn't so much the jump scares or the menacing appearance of the girl, but many of the 'minor' things such as the vomiting and horrible voice that I found most disturbing.It's no wonder that this movie has earned such a reputation, I can only imagine the reaction to it at the time of release. Even today, in a time where special effects have taken this genre to a whole new level, this remains a terrifying movie.",8,1,1,18 September 2016
Goon," Annoying and totally unfunny
","'Goon' is a unoriginal one-joke comedy with an generic and boring plot that has already been done dozens of times before. It reminded me of a bad ice-hockey version of the movie 'Dodgeball'. But while that movie had some hilarious characters and very funny one- liners, 'Goon' relies on the same cheap and unfunny gag for most of its attempted humour.The main character is stupid and clumsy, but in an annoying way rather than funny. After the first two or three scenes of him destroying everything in his path, it starts to get a little tiresome. That's the film's only joke, and it isn't very funny or durable.'Goon' is an annoying and totally unfunny movie, lacking any originality or ideas to make it worth your time.",3,1,4,22 October 2017
Now You See Me," Stylish but shallow
","'Now You See Me' is a slick and stylish production and, depending on what you look for in a film, potentially an entertaining way to pass a couple of hours. The average viewer, who probably cares more about how a film looks than what is has to offer plot wise, will most likely enjoy 'Now You See Me'.Those who prefer a film with a coherent and logical plot, however, are going to be disappointed. Looking past the many on-screen gimmicks, and 'Now You See Me' is soon exposed for what it is - a shallow film with a poorly constructed and, at times, nonsensical plot. For all its fancy production, it lacks the most basic of requirements.",5,0,0,2 May 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Impressive visuals don't make up for a weak story
","I've never been a fan of J.K. Rowling or her work and 'Fantastic Beasts' did little to convert me. Though I understood the appeal, the 'Harry Potter' series was never my thing and I always thought the films prioritised style and visuals over substance.'Fantastic Beasts' is no different in that respect. Only this time, the plot is significantly weaker and the characters far less engaging. It's clear where the budget went - visually 'Fantastic Beasts' is very impressive and it's easy to see why this film would appeal to younger viewers.As far as the story is concerned though, it leaves a lot to be desired and certainly doesn't justify the long running time. In contrast to 'Potter', it's also rather forgettable and I doubt I'd be able to recall any of the characters - or the plot for that matter - in a few years time.",5,0,1,29 October 2019
American History X," Decent but overdramatic and overrated
","'American History X' is a decent but flawed drama about Derek, a former neo-Nazi who, after serving time in prison for the murder of a black man, reforms himself and tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny, from following in his footsteps. The film cuts back and forth between the past and present, showing us what Derek used to be like and the path that his younger brother is at risk of going down.It's a solid drama and an interesting enough watch, but with an average rating of 8.5 it's also massively overrated. Several parts of the film feel forced and not at all convincing, especially the ending which was over-the-top and completely unnecessary. The film contains enough drama without the need for an forced and overdramatic ending that contributes very little to the story other than some blood and violence. Overall, 'American History X' is a decent but overrated drama film.",6,3,6,24 September 2017
The Conjuring 2," Solid sequel to the terrifying original
","The original 'The Conjuring' was one of the best horror movies I had seen in a long time, a genuinely frightening and refreshingly unpredictable horror film that made for a welcome addition to the genre. I was just hoping that 'The Conjuring 2' didn't make the same mistakes as 'Sinister 2', which was a total disaster.Thankfully, the hugely talented horror director James Wan ensured that didn't happen and produced a very commendable Conjuring sequel. Whilst 'The Conjuring 2' doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original, it's still a very solid horror with plenty of scares. As in the first movie, the tension builds nicely until the final quarter, when the pace is relentless.I was impressed after originally fearing the worst for this sequel. 'The Conjuring 2' is a respectable horror movie, but the original is the more frightening and unpredictable of the two.",7,1,2,24 February 2017
No Country for Old Men," The Coens sure know how to entertain
","The Coen brothers have given us many great movies, but 'No Country for Old Men' has to be my favourite of theirs. This film is 10 years old now but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better piece of entertainment released since. It's an enthralling watch from start to finish and one of the most memorable and unique movies of its time. Maybe it's a bold claim, but I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s.'No Country for Old Men' scores top marks in all areas, but the best part of the film for me is the characters and dialogue exchanges between them. Anton Chigurh in particular is a fascinating character and is brilliantly portrayed by Javier Bardem.The ending has proved divisive among fans, but I'm in the 'liked it' camp. Finishing with the 'old man' of the movie retiring is fitting with the title and was also suitably low-key. A brilliant film all round.",10,8,11,5 September 2017
Liar Liar," Classic Jim Carrey, you get what you expect
","'Liar Liar' is probably the most Jim Carrey of all Jim Carrey's films, so naturally it's a love/hate film depending on whether you're a Carrey fan or not. I always have been and love the energy and charisma he brings to his roles, so 'Liar Liar' was always going to be entertaining for me.A film as silly and over-the-top as this would fail with just about any other actor, but these are the films that Carrey always thrives in. He's excellent once again in 'Liar Liar' and I can't fault any part of his performance - he's hilarious from start to finish. Carrey's facial expressions and mannerisms alone are enough to make you smile and he is probably the only reason why such a simple and shallow plot remains interesting for the duration of the film.As a Jim Carrey comedy, it gives you exactly what you expect and you can't really ask for anything more.",7,1,2,18 August 2019
Meet the Fockers," A watchable, moderately amusing sequel
","'Meet the Fockers' is a moderately amusing sequel to the original 'Meet the Parents' film. It has a few good laughs here and there but is far from hilarious and goes though too many unfunny lulls.Plot-wise the film is very thin and too similar to the original. While it does produce the odd humourous situtation, it is also clearly lacking in ideas and originality and it feels like just another generic, uninspired comedy movie.Comedy sequels often turn out to be disasters and so 'Meet the Fockers' at least deserves some praise for being watchable and somewhat funny. There are some good acting performances, particularly from Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro, though the film probably relies too heavily on these two for a lot of the entertainment as the storyline is lacking.",5,0,1,24 March 2019
The Pianist," An understated war classic
","There's no shortage of holocaust films out there but not many of them will stay with you like 'The Pianist' does. I remember the first time I watched this film, a few years after it was released and when I was still very young, and thinking at the time that it was one of the best films I had ever seen.To this day, it still is. This is one of those rare films that you can watch again and again and it will still have the same impact on you as the first time you saw it. The story is incredibly powerful and moving and it is superbly written, acted and produced. Adrien Brody is outstanding as the lead character - a flawless acting performance from beginning to end.'The Pianist' is a masterpiece that doesn't seem to get the recognition it deserves, especially when compared to other holocaust films. Definitely one of the best and one of my personal favourite films of all time.",10,0,0,16 September 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An unusual film, just not to my taste
","'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a rarity in the world of film in that there's nothing really like it out there. It's one of a kind and is near impossible to categorise, let alone describe. It's a fascinating film to watch due to its sheer weirdness, but it's also divisive in that some people will love it and others just wont see what all the fuss is about.I'm probably somewhere between the two - on the fence if you like. I was entertained for most of the film, but the story did nothing for me and neither did the humour. For all its style, the film lacks a solid and coherent plot and ends up just being a silly and shallow little adventure.Its quirky and weird nature makes it memorable, but it's a film I'll only ever watch once. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an unusual film, but just not to my taste.",5,2,4,27 September 2017
The Favourite," Not usually my thing, but I enjoyed this one
","Period dramas have been popularised of late by the likes of 'Downton Abbey' and 'Call the Midwife', and while personally period pieces aren't my cup of tea and I've never been particularly interested in watching them on TV, I was drawn to watching 'The Favourite'. Partly because of the excellent reviews it had received, and partly because a 2 hour film doesn't require as much commitment as a long, drawn-out drama series.To my surprise, and to the film's credit, I sat through the whole thing and did get some enjoyment out of it. 'The Favourite' does a good job at appealing to more than just the typical 'Downton Abbey' fan audience, which is probably down to the fact that it is surprisingly funny and the lead characters deliver entertaining performances. As with all other high-budget period dramas, 'The Favourite' is also a pleasure to watch with some beautiful cinematography and costume design. This is an accessible period drama film that can be enjoyed by a more general audience, as well as fans of the genre.",7,3,4,30 March 2019
It Follows," Weird... but weird is good
","It's nearly impossible to come up with an original idea in the horror genre these days but 'It Follows' gives it a really good shot. This is a creepy, bizarre film that makes for a welcome addition to a genre that has become increasingly stale and unimaginative in recent years.'It Follows' takes plenty of risks and it's inevitable that not everyone will 'get' this film, so it's no surprise to see so many negative reviews. 'It Follows' achieves most of its scares purely psychologically and does a great job at building tension and the whole film has a really eerie atmosphere about it.This is a weird film, even for a horror. I wasn't sure what to expect, and to be honest I'm not entirely sure what to think now I've seen it. All I can say is that it was weird... but weird is good.",7,1,2,3 June 2017
City of God," Bold, brutal and simply brilliant
","'City of God' or 'Cidade de Deus' is one of the most realistic and brutal gangster films I have ever seen and without question one of the best foreign language films ever made. Set in the slums of Rio, it gives an shocking account of gang culture in a city where crime and violence is the natural path for most young people growing up in deprived communities.The way in which the story is told, from Rocket's perspective, contributes enormously to the film. The narration, combined with the realistic storyline and characters, means 'City of God' plays more like a documentary than a crime/drama film adapted from a novel. There's no shortage of violence and some of the scenes are very hard-hitting, but 'City of God' is well worth the ride. A bold, brutal and simply brilliant film.",9,1,1,17 November 2017
Legend," Decent, but could have been so much better
","This is an interesting and enjoyable enough film but I can't help but feel a little disappointed. It didn't fully meet my expectations. A lot of questions were left unanswered and the movie as a whole feels like it is missing something.A lot of the humour wasn't necessary or appropriate, in fact I thought it somewhat tainted the movie and the story it was supposed to be telling. The violence is minimal - surprising for a gangster movie but not necessarily a bad thing, though I personally would have liked a bit more action.All in all, 'Legend' is a decent enough film and Tom Hardy is convincing as the Krays, but I was largely underwhelmed. There is nothing special about this movie and I will probably soon forget about it.",6,1,2,6 July 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Stylish, funny and absorbing... another great one from Tarantino
","You can always rely on Mr Tarantino to deliver something so 'out there' that it in many ways defies explanation. A film that somehow feels both pointless and directionless most of the time yet is completely fascinating and hugely enjoyable. 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is certainly a strange movie, but it's also a great one.The film is deliberately plot-light with the focus instead being on the characters and dialogue and the portrayal of 1960s Hollywood. The simple plot doesn't seem to matter though because, as a piece of entertainment, this film is difficult to fault. It's beautiful to look at and immersive from start to finish, with some outstanding acting performances from DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie.As with any Tarantino film, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' will not be for everyone. The running length, pacing and story may be problematic for some, but personally I got a lot of enjoyment out of it.",8,2,3,15 March 2020
Gone Girl," From intelligent to absurd
","I can't remember the last time I went from thinking a movie was great halfway through to thinking it was absolute trash when it finished, but that's exactly how I feel about 'Gone Girl'. The storyline goes from being intelligent and engaging to just plain ridiculous. The second half of the film just jumps from one far-fetched scenario to another, and the big plot twist at the end is frankly absurd.Even without the many plot holes and unanswered questions, a storyline like this was never going to be remotely realistic or believable. I'm afraid the hype around 'Gone Girl' is completely unjust. It tries to be too clever and the end result is an illogical mess of a film. The fact that they ask for two and a half hours of our time with material like this is insulting.",4,0,3,2 September 2017
Django Unchained," Outstanding, an instant classic
","This film is a total blast from start to finish and easily one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. There is literally never a dull moment during the near 3 hour running length and the film has just about everything; it's funny, it's exciting, it's tense, it's unpredictable and of course, it's relentlessly violent.'Django Unchained' is probably my favourite Tarantino film. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film as much as this one, so much so that I would consider it one of my all time favourites. For sheer entertainment value, there aren't many that come close to this film.Time flies when you're having fun and that is certainly true when it comes to 'Django Unchained'. So much so that I didn't really want it to end. An instant classic and another highly entertaining film from Tarantino.",10,1,5,6 February 2017
Get Out," Flat, predictable thriller with glaringly obvious plot twists
","'Get Out' is a disappointing and highly overrated movie that fails to meet even the most basic expectations of a horror/thriller. It lacks any real scares, is generally ineffective in its attempts to be creepy, and many of the would-be thrills fall flat due to the fact that the plot is, for the most part, completely predictable with many of the plot 'twists' glaringly obvious.To most viewers, it will be fairly obvious what is going to happen in this movie from very early on, and so the big 'twists' really don't have any impact at all. I was sat there waiting for something that I hadn't seen coming - a smart and well-disguised twist that all decent thrillers have, but it never arrived.Even to the very last scene, 'Get Out' is so predictable and never even attempts to think out of the box, resulting in a rather dull, boring and forgettable thriller.",4,22,33,9 September 2018
Drive," Absorbing and surprisingly violent
","It's an interesting idea to create a movie in which the main character, who all the action centres around, has no name and says very little throughout. Strangely though, it doesn't seem to matter, because 'Drive' manages to be absorbing and highly entertaining anyway. The film is slow moving but the air of mystery around the main character is enough to keep the viewer compelled.'Drive' doesn't mess about when it comes to violence. There's plenty of it, and then some. Bloody violence in an 18 rated film isn't that surprising, but I didn't expect just how graphic some of it was. In a way it was refreshing to see in a crime themed movie. I also feel obliged to comment on the music in this film because I thought it contributed immensely to the atmosphere and mood.'Drive' is a different type of movie that takes risks, but they definitely work. It's an interesting, tense and brilliantly violent movie. Nothing like I had imagined.",8,3,4,6 June 2016
Insidious," Decent, but Wan is capable of better
","I'm a big fan of horror director James Wan, but this is the first time I've watched one of his movies and felt underwhelmed. The 'Saw' franchise were much more complete horror movies and 'The Conjuring' remains one of the creepiest, most disturbing films I've ever watched.'Insidious' is still quite scary, but unlike Wan's other films, it didn't have much of an effect on me. Maybe it's because the plot didn't feel believable, or that it relied a little too much on jump scares towards the end. Whatever it was, I just didn't enjoy 'Insidious' as much as I was expecting. There's nothing wrong with it, it just didn't 'wow' me like Wan's other films.",6,0,0,12 June 2017
The Theory of Everything," Brilliantly acted but questionable direction
","'The Theory of Everything', a biographical film about British genius Stephen Hawking, doesn't do a lot wrong in a technical sense. It's very well written and produced with an excellent performance from Eddie Redmayne as Hawking. The film details the early years of Stephen's life, from his diagnosis with ALS disease to the complex relationship he has with his wife.My only query - and it is more of a query than criticism - is why there was so little time given for Hawking's actual thoughts and theories. We probably learn more about Hawking's wife and what she's thinking than Hawking himself, which is disappointing. After all, the film is titled 'The Theory of Everything', so one would have expected there to be a lot more focus on Hawking's actual theory.",7,0,0,29 August 2017
The Number 23," By far the worst of Jim Carrey's movies
","I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey and am normally happy to watch any film of his. This one being the only exception. 'The Number 23' is the first Jim Carrey film that I have watched and hated. It is centered around a conspiracy theory that, in itself, is just plain ridiculous. I couldn't take any of it seriously.Aside from the stupid plot, 'The Number 23' is also a tediously dull movie. It moves at a snail's pace at the best of times, in fact most of the time it does no moving at all. It's repetitive and goes nowhere.Less than half an hour in and I already couldn't wait for it to finish. Carrey himself doesn't do much wrong, but he doesn't exactly shine either. How can he with such dreadful material?",2,1,3,16 November 2017
Good Will Hunting," Damon's career defining performance
","'Good Will Hunting' is one of the best known and most popular films of the 90s. It's a powerful, moving drama about an unlikely friendship and features some of the best and most memorable acting performances of that decade, including a career defining performance from Matt Damon as the title character.It's easy to become emotionally involved in this film as you naturally want the main character to succeed. The friendship he forms with Robin Williams' character is hugely enjoyable and even despite the slow pacing, the story is engaging enough to hold the viewers attention throughout. While not a personal favourite of mine, it's easy to see why 'Good Will Hunting' is loved by so many people, and deserves its reputation as one of the best films of the 90s.",7,0,0,10 November 2017
Room," Gripping from start to finish
","'Room' is a powerful and tense movie that tells the story of a young boy who has been confined to a small box shed his whole life after his mother was abducted by a man, the boy's father, known only as 'Old Nick' in the movie.The movie centers around their escape and life in the world thereafter. As you would expect, it makes for a tense couple of hours of viewing but the viewer is rewarded in the end. The heartwarming relationship between mother and son is what makes this movie.'Room' is a gripping movie that will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, but it's well worth the ride.",9,4,7,16 September 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Imaginative, funny and charming
","This is probably my favourite Ben Stiller movie. There are plenty of so-called 'adventure' films out there, many of them are dull and uninspiring, but 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is one of the few that is genuinely interesting and enjoyable.This is a funny film, silly in parts, but the humour isn't overdone or forced. The plot in itself is verging on ridiculous, far from believable, but the film makes up for it in charm and entertainment value. Stiller is a naturally funny actor and he delivers an extremely good performance as Walter Mitty, a relatable and endearing character.This is a terrific adventure movie, one of the best in the genre. Interesting story, funny humour, relatable characters and beautiful scenery and production. A great movie all round.",7,3,5,15 July 2016
Schindler's List," Intense and powerful, great filmmaking
","It's easy to see why this film has such a glowing reputation and is referred to by many as a classic. It is, undeniably, an extremely moving and powerful portrayal of the holocaust. The story is an incredible one and it is told beautifully in this film.'Schindler's List' is an intense watch from start to finish and is inevitably packed with emotion. There are some brilliant individual scenes - the slow motion shot of the girl in the red coat comes to mind as particularly powerful and a great piece of filmmaking, though there are many others.It isn't my personal favourite holocaust movie - The Pianist still holds that accolade, but 'Schindler's List' is still an excellent film and one of the top must-watch war films.",10,9,13,20 September 2016
The Incredibles," Brilliant in every aspect
","Another milestone in animation was achieved when 'The Incredibles' was released. This film raised the bar to a whole new level, not only in terms of animation design but also in the depth and meaning of the story, and how it appeals to a much more wider audience than just young children.The characters are all perfectly thought out and the story is smart and highly entertaining. As you would expect, the animation is terrific, especially when you consider that this film is over 10 years old now. The very best animated films are timeless and people never get bored of them. The likes of 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story' are good examples, and I would put 'The Incredibles' in the same bracket.",8,0,0,6 June 2017
A Quiet Place," Absolutely awful, the positive reviews are mystifying
","I can't quite believe how this film has earned such positive reviews from both audiences and critics. This has to be one of the dumbest, most boring and most unrewarding films I've watched in a long time. Nothing is ever explained, there are blatant inconsistencies and plot holes in the story, and the characters are all incredibly stupid and avoid doing what everybody else would consider common sense in this situation.One of the things that annoyed me most about this film was the characters communicating in sign language. This makes no sense since the characters were making more noise simply by walking and moving around, taking stuff of shelves and so on, than they would have done by quietly whispering. Even when overlooking the plot holes, the film isn't at all scary and is tediously slow and dull. Clearly this whole concept wasn't thought through properly.",3,4,8,5 August 2018
School of Rock," Entertaining but a bit overrated
","'The School of Rock' is an entertaining, feel-good movie containing the inevitable mix of clichés, over-the-top characters and a very cheesy storyline. Jack Black is in his element in this role, so much so that it feels like the whole film has been built around him. He shines, as you would expect, with his character delivering virtually all the jokes in the film.It's a great feel-good movie, but other than that, 'The School of Rock' doesn't have much else to offer. It's a good choice if you're in the mood for something cheerful and uplifting, but personally I couldn't sit through this film over and over again like some people. Overrated is the word that comes to mind.",6,0,0,17 August 2017
The Game," Frustrating suspense thriller with an unsatisfactory ending
","I've never been a fan of overly complex thrillers with plots that are deliberately convoluted and confusing. I can never seem to get into them and they usually end up being more frustrating than entertaining. 'The Game' falls directly into that category, and is particularly unrewarding given the awful plot twist and horrific ending, which makes the rest of the film feel like an even bigger waste of time.On the surface, 'The Game' looks great. It's well made, the cinematography is top notch, and Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are excellent in their roles. While for these reasons it's a perfectly watchable film, the convoluted and unrewarding storyline, along with the unsatisfactory plot twist at the end, make 'The Game' a difficult film to like. It's clear that it wants to be a sophisticated and intelligent thriller, but ultimately it's too smart for its own good.",5,1,2,5 August 2018
Unknown," Intriguing thriller but too many plot holes
","'Unknown' is a decent enough thriller that keeps you interested and guessing until the end. The story has potential but is ultimately let down by some far-fetched scenarios and plot holes.In the opening few scenes alone there's one coincidence too many - Dr. Harris forgets his suitcase, crashes into a river on his way to retrieve it (after a container falls off the vehicle in front), and is then saved by a taxi driver who goes on to risk her own life (again) to help him find out who he is.I can't say that I didn't enjoy 'Unknown', it was a good 2 hours of entertainment, but it would have been a lot more enjoyable if it was believable too.",6,2,2,30 April 2016
Gran Torino," Impressive character-driven drama with a memorable ending
","If there's any Clint Eastwood film that sums up his 'jack of all trades' reputation, then this one has got to be it. There's nothing that the guy doesn't do, and this peculiar yet powerful character study is the perfect example of that. 'Gran Torino' is a very smart and hugely enjoyable drama film with a brilliant ending that tops off what is a truly great story.It is a story built on characters and friendship where you would least expect to find it. The character development is excellent, and rarely will you find such a convincing and diverse bunch of characters that work so well together. The film's strength is definitely in its simplicity, with the stripped back, raw approach complementing the storyline perfectly. 'Gran Torino' is an impressive character-driven drama with a memorable ending.",8,5,6,26 November 2017
The Hurt Locker," Engrossing and highly suspenseful
","'The Hurt Locker' is an engrossing, tense war film focusing on the daily lives and duties of a bomb disposal squad during the Iraq war. This is easily one of the most engaging and suspenseful war films of recent years, down mainly to the high risk tasks the soldiers are undertaking, but also due to the skillful way in which their story is told on screen.What sets this film apart from others in the war genre is its focus on the characters, the personalities and relationship with one another. This has been attempted in some war films before, with varying levels of success, but I thought 'The Hurt Locker' did it as well as any other in the genre. The excellent character development makes the viewing experience even more tense, creating a strong connection between the audience and the characters on screen and making us actually care for what happens to them in the end.",8,0,0,28 June 2017
Ex Machina," An unusual, fascinating film
","'Ex Machina' is a compelling sci-fi drama like nothing I've seen before. The plot is unique and unpredictable, it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen once you're involved in the storyline, such is the level of intrigue.For the most part this is a slow film, but the tension builds nicely towards a dramatic and unexpected ending. The characters are well- developed and interesting. Ava, the AI, is a fascinating and compelling character. Alicia Vikander couldn't have done a better job.'Ex Machina' is a intriguing film that I would definitely recommend to those who like something different and unusual.",7,1,3,1 January 2017
Children of Men," Flawed storyline with so many unanswered questions
","While I appreciate the well-meaning and important message behind 'Children of Men', its on-screen execution is extremely disappointing. This might be a sci-fi film but, given it's supposed to be portraying a real life scenario in the near future, the storyline should at the very least have some substance and believability to it. Unfortunately I couldn't buy into any of what was happening and it never really had me fully engaged.The problem is that nothing in 'Children of Men' is ever explained, including the most crucial part of the plot - why have women become infertile? We are just expected to go along with everything that happens without questioning why or how. The film becomes more and more implausible as it goes along, with an ending that is rather appropriately uninspiring and far-fetched. On a side note, if this film is supposed to be set 20 years in the future, why does everything from the cars to the TVs look exactly the same as in 2006?",5,0,4,16 July 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Superb Scandinavian crime drama
","As someone who went into this film having neither read the book or seen the English version, I thought this was an outstanding piece of filmmaking. This is exactly what I want from a crime drama - mystery, tension, suspense and unpredictability. This story has it all.The acting is superb, the film is very well-paced and the 2hr 30 running length is never felt. It keeps you guessing right until the end and most importantly, the story remains realistic and doesn't get overly carried away as many in this genre have a habit of doing.I'm a big fan of Scandinavian crime dramas and this is another from the top drawer. A thoroughly enjoyable and extremely well made movie.",9,1,2,24 March 2017
Mulholland Drive," Painfully slow, vastly overrated thriller
","'Mulholland Drive' is another pretentious and vastly overrated film that fails in its primary duty to entertain. Instead, it frustrates, bores, confuses, and ultimately disappoints.I hate films in which the audience is expected to sit through hours of dull and painfully slow scenes, only for the big reveal at the end to be just as underwhelming as the previous two and a half hours.Films like 'Mulholland Drive' are an acquired taste. You need the patience of a saint, a willingness to overlook many unanswered questions, and perhaps most of all, an inflated sense of your own intelligence. Otherwise, avoid this over-hyped, pretentious and painfully slow film at all costs.",3,1,5,2 May 2017
Dumb and Dumber," Hilarious, I love this movie
","This is without doubt one of my favourite comedy movies and, for me, one of the funniest films ever made. 'Dumb and Dumber' is a great example of a film that just never gets old. You can watch it over and over again and will still laugh at the silly gags just as much as the first time you saw it.There isn't a scene that goes by in this movie that isn't entertaining. Quite simply, it is sheer comedic brilliance from start to finish. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are naturally funny actors and playing Harry and Lloyd must have been a blast for them both.I love 'Dumb and Dumber'. It is a timeless comedy classic that will never get old.",9,3,5,24 December 2016
The Imitation Game," Great man, great story, great film
","I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Imitation Game'. It has everything; a wonderful story, brilliant production, great script and a strong cast. I'm not normally a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, but I can't fault his performance as Alan Turing in this film - he's outstanding. It can't be easy portraying a national hero and it must carry an extra pressure to get it right, but Cumberbatch delivers. As do the rest of the cast, strong performances all round.I'm pleased they decided to make a movie of Alan Turing's achievements and struggles, and it made for great viewing. I wish there were more biographical films of people who achieved great things but may not be household names. Alan Turing was a hero and deserves to be remembered as such.'The Imitation Game' is a fascinating biographical film that is both educational and entertaining. Highly recommended.",9,2,5,1 May 2016
The Evil Dead," Scary back then, unnerving today
","'The Evil Dead' has a reputation for being a cult classic but, like many older horror films, it certainly doesn't have the same impact today as it would have done at the time of release. Sure, there are some moments that make you jump, but the general horror elements are really quite tame compared to the modern horror.That said, the film does have its moments. There are a few scenes that are successfully unnerving, even with such dated special effects. The absence of any real story probably works to the film's advantage, with the focus being on unleashing as much terror on the innocent group as possible.'The Evil Dead' isn't as effective today as it probably was in the 80s but is still as successfully unnerving horror film.",5,14,18,7 August 2017
Paranormal Activity," Maybe it doesn't help that I don't believe in ghosts
","I've somehow managed to make it to 2019 without seeing the hugely popular and widely discussed 'Paranormal Activity'. I'd heard lots about this film, mostly positive, but for one reason or another never got round to seeing it until now. To say I was disappointed by 'Paranormal Activity' would be an understatement, in fact by the time the credits rolled I was questioning whether I had watched the same film as those who had raved about it.To me this is just a bog-standard ghost story, and a pretty boring one at that. Those with an active interest in ghosts and the supernatural would probably get some enjoyment out of this film, but it certainly wasn't for me. I kept waiting for it to pick up and for some genuinely frightening scenes that justified the hype, but they never arrived. Instead it was an hour and a half of (no so) creepy surveillance footage and the occasional jump scare, which you could always see coming.",3,1,1,10 March 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Perfectly captures the magic of the book
","I might be in a tiny minority here, but I actually prefer 2005's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' to the original 'Willy Wonka' film from the 70s. Yes, the original is considered a classic and rightly so, but there is something about this version that I love that just isn't found in the original. It remains loyal to the book whilst adding the odd new element to give it a fresh feel.I've seen this version a few times now and always enjoy it immensely. I particularly like how we learn more about the mysterious Willy Wonka character as we're taken back to his childhood. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Wonka, delivering a truly captivating performance and giving his own take on the character. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' turned out as well as it could have for me. It was never going to please everyone, but I think this is a brilliant remake.",8,4,6,9 September 2017
Black Hawk Down," Relentlessly tense and realistic war drama
","From the first scene to the last, 'Black Hawk Down' never lets up. The non-stop battlefield action, complete with relentless gunshots, explosions and bloodshed, makes for a very tense two and a half hours of viewing. Rather than focusing on a particular character or event, 'Black Hawk Down' gives a wider perspective of war - a realistic and hard hitting account of the horrors that take place on the battlefield.It's far from the perfect war film, however, and it's relentless pace means that not everything that takes place is totally clear. As it jumps from one frantic situation to the next with virtually no respite, it can be difficult to keep up with what's happening and to which characters, especially since the film is largely shot from the ground. That said, the film as a whole functions well as a war account and makes for a tense and absorbing viewing experience.",7,1,2,27 April 2018
The Hangover Part II," If it ain't broke...
","'The Hangover Part II' is very much a cut and paste job of the original 'Hangover', but when you consider what a huge success the 2009 movie was, can you really blame them? I found both films hilarious and am pleased they decided to go with the same approach for the second film rather than rolling the dice and risk ruining something special.Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis are all excellent and provide plenty of laughs with such ridiculous material. Galifianakis has the ability to crack you up with his facial expressions alone - some of the scenes with Alan in this film are priceless. 'The Hangover Part II' is another great comedy film, almost identical to the first film and equally funny.",7,0,0,26 July 2017
Prisoners," Well-constructed and highly suspenseful
","'Prisoners' is a real gem of a film, a thriller that is jam-packed with tension, suspense and unpredictability. The film is constructed in a way that keeps the viewer second-guessing throughout. It has twists and turns in abundance and it's near impossible to predict what's around the corner, let alone what happens at the end. This film has pretty much everything you could want from a thriller.Aside from the clever and suspenseful plot, the highlight for me is Hugh Jackman, who is as good in this film as I've ever seen him. His character, rather like the film, is unpredictable and difficult to read. He's also relatable and easy to sympathise with, despite some morally questionable actions.'Prisoners' has you hooked from very early on, and even with the unusually long running time for a thriller, it held my attention the whole time. A well-constructed and highly suspenseful thriller, recommended.",9,1,2,3 September 2017
Silence," Well-crafted but painfully slow and long
","'Silence' is exactly what you would expect from a Martin Scorsese film in that it is well-produced, written and shot with a strong storyline and engaging lead characters. There aren't many films that explore religion and faith as deeply as this one and there's no doubt that it is an intellectual, thought-provoking piece that Scorsese has created. It's also visually stunning - as a piece of filmmaking 'Silence' is difficult to fault.It is, however, very easy to fault as a piece of entertainment. For all its technical merit, the truth is that this is an overly long, tediously slow and largely dull film that the average viewer will struggle to sit through. The pacing does it no favours and the near three-hour running length is excessive to say the least. It could have been condensed to closer to the two-hour mark without losing much at all from the storyline.'Silence' is obviously more likely to appeal to those with religious/spiritual beliefs, and they would probably get a lot more out of this film than I did. A well-crafted film, but rather dull and unrewarding for the average viewer.",6,3,4,9 February 2020
Everest," Realistic and visually great, but it's missing something
","Being based on the true story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, it was important that this film stuck to the facts and didn't get carried away for the sake of entertainment. Thankfully, it did, and the result is a realistic portrayal of the events in 1996. That aside, by far the best part of the film is the stunning visuals and beautiful scenery which really makes the film a joy to watch.It is, however, far from perfect. For all the drama, the film failed to build up tension and goes through dull and flat patches with little happening. The film is, perhaps predictably, very slow-paced and takes a while to get going. There are periods of suspense, particularly at the end, but these are few and far between. Overall, a realistic film with some stunning visuals, but disappointingly short on tension and suspense, especially given the story.",6,1,1,1 November 2016
Into the Wild," An inspirational story that needed to be told
","'Into the Wild' tells the incredible true story of Chris McCandless who, after graduating from university, gives away his entire savings and possessions and leaves everything he knows behind in order to hitchhike to rural Alaska and live in the wilderness. It's a remarkable life story, unbelievable at times, and the film does a wonderful job at telling it.There is no trimming or twisting of the story to suit a certain narrative here. 'Into the Wild' just focuses on telling the story as it is, in the most effective way possible. The result is a long but well- paced and very well made film. It's understated but powerful with some memorable stand-out moments. It's probably better if you go into the film without knowing Chris' story. Unfortunately for me I Googled his name when deciding if I should watch the film and it ruined the end for me.",9,0,0,27 August 2017
Green Street Hooligans," The ultimate culture clash film
","'Green Street Hooligans' is more than just a hilarious comedy movie, it's also a brilliant look at two very different cultures and ways of life. One being the violence driven world of football hooliganism, and the other the life of a middle class academic. It's a film that has just about everything - humour, violence, drama, romance, and much more. It is so much more than a comedy film and it pulls off everything it attempts.While fights and violence account for a large portion of the film, it's the storyline and script that makes this film the classic that it is. Granted, a middle class American Harvard student finding himself in the English football hooliganism underworld is a pretty far-fetched scenario, but it does work and once you've got over the initial idea, 'Green Street Hooligans' is a hugely enjoyable film.",7,0,0,13 February 2018
Midsommar," Boring, pretentious dross for the critics to drool over
","'Midsommar' is another example of why you should never trust the 'expert' verdict of movie critics. If you are part of the 99% of people that judges a film based on its entertainment value rather than as a piece of art, then don't waste your time on this pretentious rubbish. It isn't entertainment, just artsy garbage.'Midsommar' is two-an-a-half hours of absolutely nothing. It isn't scary or disturbing, in fact its attempt at being the latter are more likely to disgust than disturb - some of the scenes towards the end of the film are vomit-inducing. The storyline is boring, the characters uninteresting. The storyline is so thin it could have been told in two-and-a-half minutes rather than hours.The reason 'Midsommar' has gone down so well, particularly with the critics, is because it looks so good. It's stylish, artsy and, perhaps most importantly, foreign. I'm yet to find a film with the all of the above attributes that the critics haven't drooled over, no matter how bad I or the general audience thought they were.",3,6,14,19 January 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Different kind of romance but not for me
","This is an interesting film, a romance like nothing I've seen before. I think the idea is a great one and it was executed well enough, though not wholly to my taste. If the filmmakers had adopted a more simplistic approach, this would probably be one of my favourites in this genre.The problem isn't so much the story but the style adopted. I wasn't too keen on the construction, the way the film is constantly toing and froing between scenes, scenarios and characters. I almost felt like the filmmakers were trying to be too smart and would have preferred it if the story would have been told simply.That said, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are highly convincing as couple Joel and Clementine. Their relationship and chemistry on screen is probably why this film is popular with so many people.",6,1,3,6 January 2017
Avatar," Visual feast let down by a lame storyline
","There is no doubt that 'Avatar' is a groundbreaking piece of cinema in terms of visual effects and cinematography. From the stunning landscapes and scenery to the design and appearance of the characters, 'Avatar' really is a visual feast and a pleasure to watch. One of the most visually spectacular films of all time.It is, however, let down by its shallow and uninspiring storyline - a storyline that almost feels secondary to the CGI and special effects and struggles to justify the near 3 hour running length. That said, the flaws in the plot don't really take anything away from the enjoyment of this film, which is still a pleasure to watch.",5,0,0,18 June 2017
La La Land," Just a wonderful movie experience
","Normally I would avoid any sort of musical film like the plague. I don't like musicals, I never have and thought I never would. But when 'La La Land' scooped up 6 Oscars and was nominated for a further 8, I just had to see it. Not only did I not hate it, but it was probably one of the most enjoyable and memorable movie experiences I've had in a long time.There are so many factors that contribute to making this film what it is, but I just have to talk about the incredible cinematography, which is on another level to anything I've seen before. Each scene is crafted with immaculate attention to detail and each frame is like a work of art, it really is a joy to watch. Then there's Gosling and Stone, who bring so much to their roles and seemed to take to the singing and dancing effortlessly.I must admit that I was a little skeptical about the enormous amount of hype surrounding this film - more often than not it leads to disappointment. On this occasion, however, I think it's justified. 'La La Land' is a wonderful viewing experience and one of the year's must see movies.",9,2,4,2 August 2017
Saw," For the shock and fear factor there aren't many better
","This is the first time since I set up my IMDb account that I'm struggling to decide on whether to give a film a positive or a negative rating. Despite having seen 'Saw' multiple times, the truth is that I still can't decide if I love it or hate it. Each time I watch it, I find myself thinking 'why am I watching this trash?', and yet it manages to keep me completely engrossed - and entertained - from beginning to end. It's one of those films that you struggle to enjoy in the moment, but once the credits roll you realise how good it was.Horror films are all about the shock and fear factor, and 'Saw' has that in abundance. The viewer is on edge throughout and the tension literally never lets up. 'Saw' probably goes as far as any horror film has done to satisfy horror fans. It ticks just about every box there is to tick, as well as a few others that didn't exist before 'Saw' came along. Whether you love it or hate it, or both as in my case, 'Saw' will always be a classic of the horror genre.",8,1,2,7 October 2018
Super 8," Distinctly average sci-fi thriller
","'Super 8' starts off promisingly enough, but after the initial scenario is set (in spectacular fashion), the film's lack of ideas are quickly exposed and it nose-dives fast. Technically it's very impressive - well produced and the CGI/special effects are excellent and realistic, but visuals only get you so far. When you dig beyond the surface, there's nothing impressive about 'Super 8' at all. It's no different to 90% of other sci-fi films that have come before it.It's a distinctly average sci-fi thriller that borrows virtually all of its ideas from elsewhere. Despite all the action sequences, explosions and other special effects, the generic, shallow plot and uninteresting characters make it a completely forgettable film. The glowing reception it received on release is baffling, especially from the critics. 'Super 8' gets an average 5 from me.",5,0,1,15 January 2018
The Last Samurai," Technically great but goes through too many lulls
","There are plenty of positive points to make about 'The Last Samurai'. It's a beautiful film to watch, not only because of the stunning landscapes and setting, but also the way in which the battle sequences are crafted and the impressive attention to detail. It's difficult to fault the film based on its technical merits.From an average viewers perspective, however, it's far from the perfect picture. There are one too many lulls for my liking - dull patches that don't add much to the story or film as a whole. Also, although there's nothing particularly wrong with Tom Cruise's performance in this film, he doesn't really come across as a natural fit to the role. There are a few actors I would have probably chosen over him.",6,0,0,5 August 2017
Sinister," Compelling and creepy
","I much prefer horror films with a naturally scary and compelling story behind them than those that simply adopt jump scares with little regard for any sort of plot, and while 'Sinister' is guilty of cheap scares and the odd ridiculous aspect, it is built upon a solid and extremely creepy mystery.Sure, it is riddled with clichés and lacks originality in the way it frightens, but ultimately you watch a horror movie to be scared, and 'Sinister' is successfully scary. The suspense builds nicely and the mystery will keep you guessing and guessing until the end.'Sinister' is a compelling and creepy horror movie that will satisfy most fans of this genre, even those that aren't easily scared.",7,1,1,1 December 2016
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Merry Christmas, ya filthy animal!
","'Home Alone 2' is my favourite of the Home Alone films. The first two are way ahead of the rest, but this one edges the first for me. It's virtually the same plot set in a different location, only this one has more laughs and more silliness.Macaulay Culkin and Home Alone are synonymous with one another, making further Home Alone films after this with a different kid was never going to work and was a big mistake. They should have left it at two and gone out on a high, because this was a great sequel.One of my favourite comedy movies of all time. The scene in the hotel room with the TV is comedy gold, they don't get much funnier than that. There aren't many films I'd rather watch instead of this, especially over Christmas.",9,0,0,29 December 2016
Up," An animated masterpiece
","This is probably my favourite Pixar movie to date. I loved 'Ratatouille' and 'The Incredibles' but 'Up' is in another league - quite simply outstanding. It's an emotional roller-coaster of a film, which is a remarkable achievement in itself for an animated feature, but Pixar rarely fails to deliver.The story is wonderfully uplifting and the characters are engaging. It is very well written and of course the production is terrific like with all Pixar movies. 'Up' is also surprisingly funny - usually the humour in animated films isn't my thing but this one did make me laugh. It is also visually stunning and I would love to see it again in 3D one day.This is as close to perfection as an animated movie has come and it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all. 'Up' is a masterpiece.",9,1,2,25 May 2016
Reservoir Dogs," Ultra-violent blood-fest
","This film inevitably divides opinion due to the sheer level of violence and gore that is crammed into its 100 minute running time. Regardless of your attitude towards Tarantino's excessive use of violence, however, it has to be said that this is one very well written, directed and acted film.'Reservoir Dogs' is smart and entertaining, with interesting characters, great dialogue and an absorbing storyline. This film seems to fly by, and not just because of the relatively short running time. The tension and unpredictability alone make 'Reservoir Dogs' a fascinating watch.Whilst this movie won't be to everyone's taste, it's undoubtedly an excellently made, highly entertaining spectacle, and arguably one of Tarantino's best.",8,0,0,8 January 2017
Don't Breathe," Everything I hate in a horror movie
","I was looking forward to seeing this film. It sounded like an interesting concept and had the potential to be scary, but it didn't take me long to realise that I was in for a big disappointment.The characters, for a start, are poorly developed and thoroughly dislikable. The one thing all great horrors have in common is the ability to engage with the characters and actually care for what happens to them. With 'Don't Breathe', I didn't care whether any of the characters lived or died.The plot is silly and we have yet another case of characters avoiding doing the bloody obvious for entertainment purposes. I expected so much more from this film, it was poor in all aspects.",3,7,13,4 December 2016
Sicario," Technically very good, but the plot is lacking
","I was left with mixed feelings after watching 'Sicario'. The film is perfectly good for the most part, everything from the cinematography to the acting is on point. It is, however, let down by a plot that lacks the strength needed for such an ambitious film.The odd minor plot hole or inconsistency can be overlooked, but the final straw for me was when the FBI agent gets a gun pulled on her by a 'colleague', forcing her to sign an illegitimate agreement against her will. Better writing and more thought earlier on and such a far-fetched scenario could have been avoided.'Sicario' is a decent, satisfying crime drama/thriller that is unfortunately let down by a plot lacking strength and thought. A good attempt, but a underwhelming outcome.",6,1,2,29 December 2016
Pulp Fiction," Refreshingly unique
","Like most people, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Pulp Fiction' and found it to be a refreshing change to the predictable and stereotypical drama/action movies we are used to seeing. 'Pulp Fiction' rips up the rule book and completely rewrites it.The film is bizarre, but not in a way that disillusions the audience. Instead, it's thoroughly gripping and demands attention. The dialogue is probably the best part of the film, you could tell from the opening scene alone that this is no ordinary dialogue and no ordinary movie.Good stuff, kept me entertained for the full 2hr 30m run time. Not a film I would consider among the best I have ever seen, but a refreshingly unique movie that I would happily watch again.",9,1,2,7 December 2016
The Shape of Water," Maybe not Oscar worthy, but a unique and captivating film
","I must admit that I was surprised to learn that this film won 4 Oscars, though I'm just as surprised by the many negative 1 and 2 star reviews that it has received. In terms of ideas and creativity, 'The Shape of Water' is as good as any film I've seen in the last few years. With a storyline as inventive and unique as this one, it makes for a fascinating couple of hours of viewing and, if you like films that take risks and dare to be different, there is a lot to enjoy about it.For all its ideas and creativity, however, 'The Shape of Water' is lacking in some areas and can make for frustrating viewing at times. The storyline is underdeveloped in areas, particularly towards the end where there are many unanswered questions and the ending itself is a little underwhelming. That said, 'The Shape of Water' deserves credit for injecting fresh ideas into the fantasy romance genre. It might not be worth 4 Oscars, but 'The Shape of Water' is a unique and captivating film.",7,4,6,8 July 2018
Mystic River," Intriguing mystery drama with great performances
","'Mystic River' is a very good mystery/drama with a compelling plot and some excellent acting performance. The story is deep and dramatic and the strong acting and character development provides added realism. Despite its slow pacing, the plot has the ability to grab you early on and has some unpredictable twists and turns.Sean Penn is great in this film and was thoroughly deserving of his Oscar. There are also very good performances from Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne and Marcia Gay Harden. The acting in this film, along with Clint Eastwood's excellent directing, really elevates the storyline of 'Mystic River'.Overall, 'Mystic River' is a great film. A strong mystery drama with an intriguing storyline and some excellent acting performances.",8,1,1,29 December 2019
The Witch," Decent but flawed witchcraft story
","'The Witch' isn't your conventional horror film. It isn't particularly scary or gory, but it is eerie and atmospheric. The film certainly has some positives - it is very well made and it does build up tension nicely, especially towards the end. It is, however, ultimately let down by some major flaws.The first being some of the acting. Generally speaking, it's okay, but some of the younger ones are guilty of overacting in a few scenes. UK viewers may also struggle to engage with Ralph Ineson's character, given his distinctive voice which is heard in many British TV adverts. All I could think of when he spoke was Dacia cars. 'The Witch' is also very, very slow to get going. The first half of the film is on the verge of becoming boring - there's very little tension and scares are few and far between, but it does pick up.Overall, I thought 'The Witch' was decent, but it could have been a lot better. It is unique in its approach, placing a greater emphasis on the dialogue and content rather than simply the gore and scares like a lot of other horror movies. A solid but flawed horror.",6,1,2,26 May 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Realistic and educational but not helped by the pacing
","We are all familiar with Osama bin Laden and the story of his decade-long evasion from justice but few will have known the details of the painstaking hunt that lead to his capture and killing. 'Zero Dark Thirty' tells that story and does it with great realism and attention to detail - it is fascinating to watch, especially if you aren't familiar with the events in this film beforehand.The film does a good job at remaining informative and realistic while never losing sight of the fact that it is a movie with the purpose of entertaining. It does have its flaws though and my main criticism would be the running time. I understand the need to tell the story as it happened and not cut corners, but at over two-and-a-half hours the film is too long and, despite the fascinating topic at hand, the pacing means you really do feel it.'Zero Dark Thirty' is a informative and necessary film that gives us a detailed insight into the decade-long hunt for the world's most wanted man. A very good film about a fascinating true story.",7,1,3,12 November 2019
War of the Worlds," Not as interesting or exciting as it should have been
","You could start watching this film at just about any point in its 2 hour running time and figure out the plot within 30 seconds. You won't have missed any crucial plot developments either, because there aren't any. For a film about an alien invasion, it's nowhere near as interesting or exciting as it should be.It's also extremely frustrating, with no hint of an explanation as to why these aliens have chosen to invade earth and why they seemingly wish to destroy everything in their path. Even if that doesn't matter to the average viewer, the events that follow the invasion are just as perplexing. If you can see past the flaws, 'War of the Worlds' is okay as a piece of entertainment. Tom Cruise is good in his role, but the fact that I didn't really care if his character lived or died says a lot about how uninvolving the film is.",6,2,4,17 April 2017
12 Years a Slave," Very good, but maybe a little overrated
","'12 Years a Slave' is a very powerful and moving film based on the true story of a black man sold into slavery. It was excellently received by critics and audiences alike when it was first released so I was really looking forward to seeing it for the first time when it premiered on British TV this weekend.There's no doubt about it, this is a very good film. Even with the highly irritating advert breaks every 15 minutes it was easy to become emotionally involved in the storyline. However, I must admit that I didn't think it was as good as many have suggested and there were parts of the film that I thought could have been better executed. In particular, I thought the scenes of violence were unnecessarily long. The audience can easily grasp what is happening without the need for prolonged scenes of brutal beatings that almost force emotions on you.Overall, '12 Years a Slave' is undeniably a powerful film that does a good job at telling a very difficult story. I thought it was well written and acted and I can understand the reasons behind the glowing reviews. A very good film, but I was expecting more to be honest.",8,1,2,6 June 2016
30 Days of Night," Everything you could want from a vampire flick
","'30 Days of Night' is an effective and surprisingly well-made vampire movie. It has everything you would want and expect from a movie like this - excessive gore, frightening jump scares, and a highly suspenseful plot. It all comes together really well and the combination of a tense plot and the bloody violence that comes with vampire flicks makes for great couple of hours of entertainment.Unlike a lot of, or maybe even most movies in this genre, '30 Days of Night' never feels cheap. Everything from the acting to the appearance of the vampires was as good as I can remember seeing in this genre. The storyline is engaging and well constructed for the most part, with the only noticeable flaw coming at the end when it start to get a bit messy. Ultimately though, '30 Days of Night' is great fun to watch.",7,0,0,19 August 2017
There Will Be Blood," An epic tale of greed, deception, faith and morals
","'There Will Be Blood' is without doubt one of the best drama films of the 2000s. This is a fascinating, brilliantly told story of faith and morals and contains one of the best and most memorable acting performances in recent memory. Daniel Day-Lewis fully deserved his Oscar for his performance in this film, it was flawless from beginning to end and makes the film what it is.Some films just have that special something that you don't find very often, and 'There Will Be Blood' is one of those films. It oozes class and everything from the cinematography to the music and dialogue is near perfection. The story is great and the characters fascinating in their own individual way. It's difficult to find a fault with this film.'There Will Be Blood' is a brilliant film all round and the outstanding lead performance from Daniel Day-Lewis makes it one of the most memorable of the decade.",10,1,2,18 September 2017
Ice Age," Fun and entertaining but perhaps a tad overrated
","'Ice Age' was hugely popular when I was growing up and has remained a fan-favourite after all these years. It gets the balance between being a kids movie while also appealing to older audiences just about right, which would explain why it is such at hit with people of all ages.This is certainly a good, fun family film and I remember getting a lot of enjoyment out of it as a kid. However, when comparing it to some of the other main animated family films of the 2000s, I can't agree with the ratings that put it among the best. For me, 'Ice Age' isn't in the same league as classics like 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredibles'.'Ice Age' is a good animated film that works for all ages, but I can't help but feel it is a little overrated. It doesn't have that special something that all the best animated family films have, but what that is I'm not quite sure.",7,1,1,16 March 2020
Whiplash," I wasn't expecting that!
","Despite the many glowing reviews on IMDb and elsewhere, I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film. I thought it would be similar to 'School of Rock', not only in terms of plot but also quality. Instead, 'Whiplash' offers something totally different to the music genre. It plays out more like a thriller - a brutal, tense and compelling thriller.This film scores top marks in all areas. The acting is first class and the script is sharp and intelligent, with a story that has you hooked from the very first scene. That said, it does push its luck in parts. Some scenes are far-fetched, such as when Andrew almost gets killed in a car crash before calmly jogging to his concert, soaked in blood. There's dedication, and then there's stupidity.Overall though, there is no doubt that this is one of 2014's best films, and perhaps the best music film I have ever seen. For sheer entertainment value, I would highly recommend 'Whiplash'.",8,3,4,25 April 2017
It Chapter Two," Despite a few positives this sequel is mostly hot air
","I wasn't much of a fan of the first 'It' film from 2017 and found this sequel to be generally much the same, only longer and with fewer original ideas. The CGI is impressive and the acting is good, but there's not much else I can say I appreciated about 'Chapter Two'.The big problem I have with this film, and to a lesser extend its predecessor, is its running length. There's just no need for it to be anywhere near 3 hours long and there were ample opportunities for scenes to be cut or trimmed. There isn't enough depth in the plot and it really does drag.The storyline is okay but rather predictable and quite clearly lacking ideas. It resorts to jump scares too often, most of which you can also see coming. Overall, while not a bad horror film, I won't be spending another 3 hours watching again.",5,1,2,14 June 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Good fun if you enjoy wacky, offbeat comedies
","Silly, childish comedies like 'Anchorman' are always divisive. There are a lot of people who hate these types of films, while for others they turn out to be real guilty pleasures. For this one, I'm the latter. 'Anchorman' did crack me up on more than one occasion and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. It's one of those that's just so stupid you must be dead inside if you don't crack a smile.The ridiculous plot and goofy characters mean that the laughs come thick and fast and, unlike a lot of other comedies of its kind, it never runs out of stupid situations and jokes. Will Ferrell was the sole reason I decided to give this movie a chance and he didn't disappoint, he was hilarious throughout as the anchor. For entertainment value, 'Anchorman' is great, but those who can bear silly humour and cheap gags should probably look elsewhere.",7,1,1,22 January 2018
The Green Mile," Great story and performances
","'The Green Mile' is considered by many to be one of the best films of all time and it's easy to see why it's held in such high regard. It's a brilliant film with a story that has it all - there aren't many films that will make you laugh and cry like this one will, and that's what makes it special.Aside from the story, this film benefits from some excellent acting performances. Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actors and he is simply outstanding as the guard, likewise the rest of the cast all contribute to an all round excellent film. My one gripe, however, is the overly long running length. As a general rule I don't like long films, and while 'The Green Mile' certainly didn't feel like it had been padded out, I do feel it could have been trimmed by half-an-hour or so.",Null,0,0,15 August 2017
Jaws," Iconic 70s suspense thriller
","I think everybody over a certain age will be familiar with Steven Spielberg's 70s thriller 'Jaws', and the majority will have seen it at least once in their lifetime. To many people, this is one of the first titles that comes to mind when thinking of classic and iconic films - it's instantly recognisable and contains many memorable scenes and lines.There's no question that 'Jaws' is one of the best suspense thrillers of its time. The way the films builds up and sustains tension throughout is masterful and it genuinely has you gripped from start to finish. Perhaps it isn't as impactful in the modern day as it was when it was released, party because of the development of CGI and special effects, but make no mistake, 'Jaws' is a classic and a film everybody should see.",7,0,0,9 August 2018
Inception," Pretentious claptrap for people with an inflated sense of intelligence
","Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' often gets a mention in many 'best films of all time' lists, despite the fact that this is probably one of the least rewarding and most pointless films I've ever watched.It spends the whole of its bloated two-and-a-half hour running length trying to prove how intellectually superior it is, yet requires the characters to spell out virtually every development of the ridiculously messy and convoluted plot.An intentionally complex and non-linear storyline is not smart, but pretentious filmmaking. What exactly is the point in such a bewildering minefield of a plot in which the ending presents more questions than the start? The only reason I can think of is to satisfy the ego of those who like to think of themselves as smarter than they actually are.'Inception' is one of the most overhyped, overrated and pretentious films I've ever seen.",4,5,7,13 July 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," An all style production that quickly runs out of steam
","'Murder on the Orient Express' is the latest addition to the ever growing 'style over substance' club. A film that is beautiful to watch, with no shortage of stunning mountainous scenery, but beyond the surface, it lacks much of what is expected from a whodunnit mystery thriller. If anything, the visuals work to the film's disadvantage. Cutting away to a shot of snow capped mountains in between scenes doesn't exactly help to build and hold any sort of tension.The pacing is also too slow for my liking, with the murder and subsequent whodunnit mystery taking too long to arrive. Even as the mystery starts to unfold, there's a lingering feeling that the film is cruising along and never really gets up to speed. For production value, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is excellent, but visuals aren't enough for a film like this, especially when you consider the material they were working with.",5,1,5,13 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Decent screen adaptation with great production
","I'll admit that I'm no Sherlock buff but I thought this was a fairly good film adaptation of the classic character. Despite a few naysayers, I thought Robert Downey Jr. delivered a convincing and entertaining performance as Sherlock - no actor could have pleased everyone playing such a popular character. The plot is decent, if a little shallow, and is aided by a smart and witty script.The best part of this film for me though is the first class cinematography and production value. Everything looks so classy and expensive and I've never seen London look as good as it does in this film. Honestly, this film is worth watching for the visuals alone. This adaptation of 'Sherlock Holmes' gets a lot more right than it does wrong and for the most part I enjoyed it.",7,1,1,4 April 2018
The Secret Life of Pets," Guaranteed to make pet owners smile
","'The Secret Life of Pets' is a thoroughly entertaining animated feature packed full of action, adventure and family humour. The animation is brilliant with great attention to detail, vibrant colours and special effects, making it a pleasure to watch.Any pet owner will be able to relate to the characters in the film, from the couch potato to the dog that sits at the door all day waiting for his owner to come home. Plot wise, the film is somewhat lacking, but it makes up for it with plenty of action and adventure.I enjoyed this film enormously and would highly recommend it. A great piece of animated entertainment.",7,2,3,22 November 2016
Arrival," Interesting enough, but far from a 'masterpiece'
","Sci-Fi movies are often the most over-hyped, and 'Arrival' is no exception. This is a decent enough film, but I'm finding all the 'masterpiece' comments hard to believe. What exactly did people see in this film to consider it a masterpiece?The plot is okay and, even if it is a little slow at times, it holds your attention throughout. 'Arrival' is very well made with some strong acting performances, as you would expect. However, there's nothing in this film that blew me away, nothing spectacular and as far as I'm concerned, nothing to justify the many glowing reviews it has received.Sci-Fi is a tricky genre to master and 'Arrival' certainly gave it a good shot. It's interesting enough, but don't believe all the hype because 'Arrival' is far from being a masterpiece.",7,0,2,2 April 2017
The Blind Side," Inspirational true story almost ruined by Hollywood
","Based on the remarkable truly story of Michael Oher, 'The Blind Side' really should have been an inspiring and touching film. If it had simply told the story without injecting artificial Hollywood gloss and melodrama, maybe it would have been. Instead, 'The Blind Side' plays more like a fictional drama filled with clichés and exaggerated scenes designed to manipulate the audience.I'm not too familiar with Michael Oher's story, but I'm pretty sure he didn't used to walk round with a gigantic sulk on his face 24/7 like is portrayed in the film. It's almost as if the film feels the need to constantly remind us of Oher's unhappiness - we get it. Fortunately, the story alone is good enough to pull this film through and it is somewhat rewarding in the end, despite all the melodrama along the way.",6,1,1,31 July 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," The most uplifting, thought-provoking film ever made
","It's funny to think that 'The Shawshank Redeption' was a complete flop when it first came out, only to now sit at the top of the IMDb 'greatest films of all-time' list. I'm not sure why it wasn't a hit a first because, like virtually everybody else who has watched it, I loved everything about this film and would also consider it to be one of the best films ever made.I can't add much more to the 4,116 reviews that have already been written, but what I will say is that I've never felt so emotionally involved in a film before as I did with this one. I'd heard great things about the 'Shawshank' and that can often lead to disappointment, but in this case my expectations were far exceeded. I have to mention the ending as well, which is just poetic - in my opinion the greatest ending to a film ever.An average rating of 9.3 on IMDb from over 1.6 million votes is truly remarkable, but thoroughly deserved. I can't speak highly enough of 'The Shawshank Redemption', an amazing film that is sure to leave you feeling emotionally overwhelmed.",10,0,0,17 July 2016
Parasite," Highly effective blend of genres
","I can't remember watching a film that covers as many genres as 'Parasite' (Gisaengchung) and does it so successfully. This is a highly entertaining film that starts off as a comedy/drama and gets darker as it goes along, becoming a rather sinister mystery thriller with some highly effective horror elements. Most films that try to cover multiple themes end up messy but 'Parasite' never felt in danger of that.At a time when the film industry seems to be increasingly short of original ideas, something as fresh as 'Parasite' is always welcome. The comedy genre in particular just seems to be made up of the same recycled jokes - this film is funny while being completely different to anything else out there at the moment and that alone is quite an achievement. 'Parasite' is great, highly recommended for those growing tired of the usual stale Hollywood productions.",8,2,7,9 November 2019
Rango," Different and entertaining, but not without its flaws
","'Rango' is an unusual blend of genres - there certainly aren't many animated family western movies out there. I like the idea though and thought that the western setting really added something special to the film. It's a unique visual experience that is unlikely to ever be replicated, or at least not to the same level as this one. It does have some very noticeable flaws though.The plot is adequate but lacks any real depth, which is predictable for a family movie, but even so. I also found 'Rango' to be unnecessarily long. There's no way an animated kids film with a plot as thin as this should be pushing 2 hours. Putting things into perspective though, 'Rango' is good overall. The characters are interesting and funny and the voice acting is all on point. Johnny Depp was a great choice to voice Rango and brings a lot of enthusiasm and personality to the role.",7,0,0,11 September 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 2 hours of my life I'll never get back
","'Birdman' has got to be a contender for one of the worst Oscar winners of all time. Quite how this crap won not one, not two, not three... but FOUR Oscars is beyond me. I hated it, everything from the pretentious script and the boring story to the nauseating camera-work and that never ending, highly irritating drum kit soundtrack, which I can still hear playing in my head now.Michael Keaton and the rest of this star-studded cast provide the only positive to speak of. The acting in 'Birdman' is very good and Keaton delivers a strong lead, it's just a pity that such a good performance is wasted in such a dreadful film. Anybody expecting a comedy, by the way, is in for a shock when they discover that the entire two hours is entirely laugh free. This is, in my opinion, one of 2014's worst films... four Oscars my arse.",3,1,3,27 August 2017
The Big Short," Informative, but not much else
","'The Big Short' is a good film to watch if you want to educate yourself about economics and learn about the housing bubble collapse, because it's highly informative and insightful. From an entertainment point of view though, there isn't much to be enjoyed here.Even if you can keep up and understand what's going on in the film, there isn't much to keep the viewer interested. The film is perfect for somebody who has an interest in the subject matter, but isn't much fun for everybody else. That said, 'The Big Short' is a very well made film and you'll feel slightly smarter for seeing it.An informative, well-made film that isn't sufficiently mainstream to be appreciated by large audiences, but great for people with prior knowledge and an interest in this subject matter.",6,1,2,1 January 2017
The Conjuring," A genuinely terrifying movie
","This has got to be one of the scariest movies ever made and certainly one of, if not the scariest I have ever seen. It has a lot in common with classics such as The Exorcist in its disturbing nature, incredibly creepy individual scenes and ability to genuinely frighten you.It takes a lot for a movie to stand out in this crowded sub-genre but 'The Conjuring' will be remembered for its disturbing imagery, edge of the seat tension and terrifying scare scenes. The film is well written, acted and produced and it is easy to become emotionally involved with the characters and plot.'The Conjuring' is a must watch for fans of this genre. It is easily one of my favourites and is up there as one of the most frightening movies ever made.",8,1,2,17 July 2016
Platoon," Raw and hard-hitting battlefield drama
","'Platoon' is a tough film to watch as it exposes the brutal reality of war. Of all the great war films, this one has to be one of the most distressing due to its realism and the truly depressing storyline and cruel ending.There are some genuinely horrible, harrowing scenes in this film that will no doubt stay with many viewers for a long time after the credits have rolled. The graphic violence only adds to what is already a tough film to sit through, but these scenes are necessary to show the reality of what these soldiers, and human beings, had to endure.A great war film, but also a horrible one. 'Platoon' is a raw and hard-hitting drama and one of the more realistic war films I've seen.",8,2,2,28 March 2020
Prometheus," Beyond the visuals, there's nothing
","I had a good idea of what to expect from 'Prometheus' and, for the most part, I was right. I knew it would be visually brilliant, with great attention to detail, realistic looking special effects and top-notch production. I also knew that it would be heavily flawed and would have plot-holes and unanswered questions galore, though it did surprise me just how much of 'Prometheus' made little to no sense.Much of the film defies logic and there is no explanation provided for many of the key plot developments. The whole film is built on the presumption that the audience will just be taken in by the visual spectacle on-screen without wanting to dig beyond the surface. For many people that may be the case, but I prefer films that have a coherent and logical plot behind them. Unfortunately, 'Prometheus' offers nothing beyond the impressive visuals.",4,3,4,14 September 2017
Halloween," Scary for its time
","'Halloween' was considered one of the scariest films ever made when it was initially released in 1978. Whilst it remains an unnerving watch almost 4 decades later, it is rather tame by today's standards. Though it's important to remember that 'Halloween' was made at a time when special effects, CGI and everything else that comes with most Hollywood blockbusters these days simply didn't exist.Not only is 'Halloween' special effect free, but there's also virtually no violence and gore. This film achieves its scares solely based on the story and the way its told on screen, and for that it is fully deserving of the recognition is has earned. 'Halloween' is an unnerving, tense and well-made horror film, but the scares today don't have the impact that they would have back in the 70s.",7,0,1,1 June 2017
The Water Diviner," Good overall but too slow at times
","'The Water Diviner' is a good movie with many positives aspects - the plot has depth, it is well acted out and Russell Crowe did a reasonably good job as director. You do, however, have to be patient and make an effort to stick with this movie because, in parts, it's very slow.I also wasn't keen on the many flashbacks/flashforwards which didn't really add anything to the movie and just made the storyline harder to follow. There's nothing wrong with the plot itself but I felt it could have been executed better on screen.Overall though I thought 'The Water Diviner' was a good movie with a plot with enough depth to keep it interesting.",6,1,2,16 September 2016
Despicable Me," Good fun, but nothing special
","Animated films often prove to be real guilty pleasures for me. This was one I had been wanting to see for a long time but have only just got round to it. It met all my expectations - the animation is great, the characters are great, and it's easy to see why it satisfied audiences of all ages and not just kids.However, drawing comparisons to other animated movies, 'Despicable Me' isn't one I'll revisit in a hurry. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because it lacks that special something that makes the very best animated movies memorable and timeless.I expected 'Despicable Me' to entertain and it certainly did. It's funny, action packed and all round good fun, but falls short compared to others of its kind.",6,0,0,7 December 2016
The Iron Giant," More than just an animated film for kids
","I remember the first time I saw 'The Iron Giant' as a young kid, it had me completely hooked and it was probably my favourite film for a short while. There is genuinely something special about this film that you just don't find in most animated kids films. It has a big heart and a touching storyline that is so much better than the artificial and meaningless animated features Hollywood continues to mass produce.There is something about hand-drawn animation in general that really appeals to me. It seems that with everything now computer generated / digitally designed, hand-drawn animation is on its way out, though this only makes films like 'The Iron Giant' even more special. I love everything about this film and would highly recommend it. This is more than just an animated film for kids, it's a wonderful story and a film I will always remember fondly from my childhood.",8,0,1,29 July 2018
Shrek," Childhood classic with great characters and humour
","Whilst stuck in coronavirus lockdown I've been revisiting some old classics from my childhood. I'd been wanting to re-watch the original 'Shrek' movie for some time so this felt like the perfect excuse/opportunity. Almost 20 years since its release, it's impressive how 'Shrek' has kept its appeal and is still one of the go-to kids' films after all this time.That's probably because there are very few animated children's films that have the ability to also appeal to adults. Whilst it is very much geared towards a younger audience, I think any adult who says they didn't enjoy some of the humour in 'Shrek' is lying - this film has universal appeal and that's what made it such a hit.After all these years, 'Shrek' still feels fresh and unique. It is a great film all round with an interesting storyline, entertaining characters and some very funny jokes.",7,0,0,17 May 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Top-drawer thriller
","'The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the most effective and suspenseful thrillers I can remember seeing. It has everything you want and expect from this type of film, including some superb acting performances from Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. The latter conveys evil in this film as well an any actor I've seen. His performance is truly mesmerising.The film is so atmospheric and sustains a high level of tension for large periods. The conversations between Agent Starling and Hannibal Lecter are brilliantly done and make for compelling viewing. The twists are delivered at the perfect moment and there's never a dull moment in the entire film.This is a memorable and brilliantly executed film that contains exactly what an audience wants from a crime thriller. It's clever, fast paced and unpredictable - a thriller from the top drawer.",9,2,4,14 January 2017
Mother!," Pretentious, nonsensical and extremely frustrating
","I'd seen how 'Mother!' had split audiences down the middle but I wasn't expecting to have such strong feelings about this film. The drama/mystery genre generally appeals to me and the more unusual the film, the more I tend to like it. 'Mother!', however, is very much an exception. Despite it being undeniably strange, I hated it and ended up turning it off after about an hour because I couldn't bare it any longer.This film has been labelled as 'artistic' and 'beautiful' by some critics and reviewers. I honestly find these comments laughable and they remind me of the people who consider the scribbles and splashes of a three-year-old on a canvas as valuable art. There's nothing arty about 'Mother!' whatsoever - it's just another piece of pretentious Hollywood garbage that thinks it's so much better than it actually is.'Mother!' is an incoherent, plotless mess of a film that gets gradually worse as it goes along. I could only tolerate so much before I had to turn it off for the sake of my sanity.",1,1,5,25 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Superhero fan or not, avoid this movie
","I would be lying if I said I went into this film with an open mind. I fully expected it to suck, and it did. Superhero movies in general aren't my thing but I did get some enjoyment out of the original 'Superman' and 'Batman' movies. 'Dawn of Justice', however, didn't do anything for me. It's an incoherent mess of a movie that makes little sense, lacks any real purpose and seems to go on forever.The whole idea of having two superheroes battling each other is a terrible one and should never have passed. It's clear that this movie is just a quick Hollywood money spinner, with minimal effort put in to developing a convincing plot or script. Instead, it's just all action and special effects, and even for a superhero movie, it's very heavy handed and overdone. 'Dawn of Justice' is a mess, and at two and a half hours, it also drags. Superhero fan or not, this is a movie to avoid.",3,1,4,2 September 2018
Blade Runner," Visually impressive but too slow and not very engaging
","A so-called 'classic' of the sci-fi genre, 'Blade Runner' is a movie I'd been meaning to watch for some time. With the sequel now out, I finally got round to seeing the original... and I'm struggling to understand the cult reputation that this film has. I thought it was a pretty standard sci-fi/thriller movie with the only highlight being the great visuals, which are particularly impressive given the age of the film.Other than how the film looks though, I didn't see much in 'Blade Runner' at all. In fact I thought it was pretty flat and even quite boring at times. It starts off at a crawling pace and never really gets out of second gear. For a thriller, it's way too slow and I didn't find the plot particularly interesting or engaging either. Overall, this movie is a classic case of style over substance and it didn't do much for me at all.",5,4,9,11 October 2017
The Ringer," Good way to pass the time
","As a comedy movie, 'The Ringer' is fairly average. It has a few good laughs, some funny characters and an entertaining plot, but nothing that hasn't already been done before. It's the sort of film you stick on when you need to pass a couple of hours, a film that you can follow without paying any real attention.'The Ringer' won't be for everyone though, Johnny Knoxville's acting as a handicapped person does come across a bit awkward at times, though I guess such a role can't be easy to play. Overall, this is a decent comedy with some likable characters. An easy-to-follow, entertaining story with a few decent laughs.",6,1,1,11 August 2017
Lucy," Nonsensical garbage
","'Lucy' tells the story of an ordinary woman who develops superhuman, godlike abilities after she is abducted by a drug lord. Lucy is forced to hide illegal drugs inside her in order to transport them abroad, but when the substance accidentally leaks, she begins to develop superhuman powers and abilities.This might be science fiction, but that doesn't excuse such a ridiculous plot. It's so illogical and dumb that, while Lucy might be gaining brain capacity, it feels like you as the viewer are losing your own. Very little of this story makes sense, especially the second half of the film which is almost entirely action and violence.The most frustrating thing for me is how Morgan Freeman is wasted in a role that could have been filled by anyone. Ultimately his presence brings nothing to the film. 'Lucy' is garbage and will probably only satisfy the die-hard sci-fi fan.",3,1,4,1 August 2017
Moonrise Kingdom," Another weird one from Anderson
","I've got to be honest - I just don't get the appeal of Wes Anderson's films. Quite how 'Moonrise Kingdom' and the more recent 'Grand Budapest Hotel' films are so widely popular I will never know. I would have thought that such oddball films would only appeal to a certain group of people, but it seems that the majority of viewers seem to either like or love Anderson's bizarre, random creations.'Moonrise Kingdom' is an unexplainable film. The only way I can describe it is as a weird mishmash of adventure, drama, comedy and romance with a very weird and very shallow plot. One of the main problems I have with Anderson's films is how much emphasis is placed on style and visuals. It seems like more thought goes into the camera movements in his films than the actual plot. It comes down to personal taste of course, but I'm not a fan.",5,1,1,7 October 2017
Flight," A very well executed character study
","Despite the safe and uninspiring title, 'Flight' is a surprisingly bold film that is unafraid of taking some big risks. This isn't your conventional, heart in mouth disaster thriller and, although it does contain the odd spell of suspense, it's actually more of a laid back drama and character study about a man battling his demons.The action is limited to only the first half an hour or so, after which Denzel Washington's character becomes the focus of the film and the storyline develops into something unexpected, though still enjoyable.As a character study, it's very well executed and never forces one feeling or another about the lead character, allowing the audience to make their own mind up. 'Flight' takes a lot on and not everything is totally clear in parts, but it's definitely worth watching.",7,1,2,6 February 2018
Unbroken," Well-made but too bland and middle-of-the-road
","'Unbroken' is set during WWII and tells the incredible true story of an Olympic athlete, Louis Zamperini, who survived 47 days in a raft at sea, only to be caught by the Japanese and sent to a prison camp, where he is tortured by a sadistic Japanese commander. It's an unbelievable story and one that had the potential to be turned into a memorable film, but 'Unbroken' doesn't really do the story justice.The main problem with the film is its surprising lack of any real emotion. It left me cold, I didn't feel a connection with any of what was happening on screen. Louis is such an easy character to sympathise with, he's somebody you naturally want to see survive and succeed, but I never felt that when I was watching the film. 'Unbroken' is an easy film to sit through because it's so well-made, but I felt detached. It lacks character and is too bland to be remembered.",6,1,1,9 August 2017
Final Destination," Unique, bizarre and strangely entertaining
","Ordinarily, a cheap and trashy film with a silly plot and weak script would be enough keep most people, myself included, away. 'Final Destination', however, more than makes up for these flaws in sheer entertainment value. The first time I saw this film many years ago, I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD, and it has remained something of a guilty pleasure all this time.Some films try way too hard to tick all the boxes and create the perfect picture, when sometimes all that's needed is an original, unique idea and enough imagination to put it into practice. That's exactly what 'Final Destination' is - someones imagination let loose, with the end result a highly flawed, but highly entertaining film.",7,0,0,25 June 2017
Casino," Great entertainment, but no 'Goodfellas'
","It's impossible not to compare 'Casino' to another of Scorsese's films - the gangster classic 'Goodfellas', which is my favourite film of his. 'Casino' is strikingly similar in style but is unfortunately overshadowed and often overlooked due to the success and popularity of 'Goodfellas'.But while 'Casino' may be in the shadow of 'Goodfellas', it is still an excellent movie in its own right. The film oozes style with stunning cinematography and great attention to detail in every frame. In terms of the plot, I can't say it's anyway near as enthalling as 'Goodfellas', but there is still plenty of entertainment to be had despite the overly long running time.",8,1,4,23 July 2017
Heat," Terrific, one of my personal favourite crime thrillers
","I recently re-watched 'Heat' and was reminded of what a brilliant film it is. This has to be one of the best crime thrillers of the 90s and is up there as one of my personal favourites in the genre of all time. It is a truly epic film, not just in terms of its length but also its brilliantly constructed plot and complex characters. 'Heat' has you hooked from the start and the action-sequences, visuals, and all-round absorbing plot holds your attention throughout.DeNiro and Al Pacino are two actors at the top of their game in this film and both deliver outstanding performances and real personality to their characters. There are lots of great actors but few can make the viewer feel as emotionally involved with their characters like these two - they are faultless in this film. 'Heat' is an epic spectacle and a classic of the crime genre.",9,2,3,11 March 2019
Deadpool," Desperately wants to be funny but isn't
","'Deadpool' desperately wants to be cool and funny but it fails on both counts. The best way to summarise what this film is all about is the following quote - 'Have you ever heard David Beckham speak? It sounds like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.' The film is packed full of these type of jokes and the one I quoted is one of the better (or less cringeworthy) ones. Most aren't funny in the slightest.I would usually write something about the plot but unfortunately there isn't one, so no spoilers here. That's right, a movie with no plot has somehow managed a score of 8.2 on IMDb - higher than some classics.Obviously I've missed a trick here, but 'Deadpool' didn't do anything for me. My score of 3 is only because of some of the action and violence which was mildly entertaining. Otherwise this was a bore.",3,14,31,24 May 2016
The Replacements," Avoid this garbage at all costs
","'The Replacement' is an unoriginal, boring and totally unfunny movie. One of the worst comedies I've seen in a long time. Almost all of this film has been borrowed from elsewhere, from the plot to most of the jokes. We've seen it all before, and done a lot better.The film's shortcomings don't stop at its unoriginality either, because 'The Replacements' is also tediously dull. There is nothing about this film that makes you want to keep watching, in fact it's so bland and uninteresting that there's little point sitting through it. That, combined with the poor humour, makes 'The Replacements' a film to avoid.",2,3,10,17 June 2017
300," An impressive but pointless collection of slow-motion battles
","This is a pointless movie. It serves no purpose other than to showcase a string of over the top slow-motion battles. There's no real story or plot to speak of, '300' is just an overload of CGI and special effects crammed in just for the sake of it. It's like they discovered what they could do with modern technology and decided to make a movie out of it.Granted, the battle scenes are impressive, but that's the least I expected. Another thing I expected and certainly got was the overload of stereotypes and clichés - it certainly isn't short of lines that will have you rolling your eyes. Though this does (unintentionally) provide some entertainment.'300' seems to have gone down well with a lot of people and I can understand why. There's plenty of action to keep the viewer satisfied, but unfortunately it lacks much else.",4,7,10,22 May 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Great fun, a very entertaining spy movie
","What a fantastic 2 hours of entertainment! I'm not normally a fan of this genre of film but I found Kingsman impossible to dislike. It's the perfect mix of action and comedy with an interesting plot.Yes, it's silly, especially the ending, but it's not intended to be taken too seriously. In fact, it wouldn't be half the movie it is without the humour - it would just be another generic spy movie. The cast are terrific, Colin Firth in particular delivers an excellent performance as spy agent Harry Hart.Kingsman is a fun movie that fulfills its action comedy tag brilliantly. If you're looking for a serious spy movie though, this isn't it. Watch James Bond instead.",8,4,7,3 May 2016
The Hangover Part III," The worst of the series, but it did occasionally crack me up
","Like most people, my expectations were low for 'Part III' of the Hangover series, and rather predictably it turned out to be the worst of the three. The first film was never going to be matched for its fresh jokes and hilarious, memorable individual scenes, but this was still a disappointing sequel. Part III is severely lacking in ideas and originality and, while it did occasionally crack me up, the laughs just don't flow like they did in the first film.If this was a stand alone comedy movie, judged in its own right, it would have probably gone down a lot better. I think the audience had unreal expectations of both this and the second film which were never going to be met and, as a result, many reviews, including from critics, are exaggerating just how bad it is. 'The Hangover Part III' is a perfectly watchable comedy movie, not terrible by any means, but disappointing when measured against the hilarious first film.",5,1,2,22 July 2018
Green Book," Enjoyable story of an unlikely friendship
","Based on a true story in the US deep south during the 60s, 'Green Book' is an enjoyable and moving film about an unlikely friendship between a black jazz musician and his white bodyguard and driver. It's a nice story and the film does a good job at balancing the humour and drama so that it feels neither too light or heavy.'Green Book' is well-written and looks great. The two main characters, Tony and Don, are brilliantly played by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali respectively. They work well together and share great chemistry, with some very funny moments and individual scenes.If I had one criticism, 'Green Book' does feel quite clichÃ© and somewhat forced in getting its message across. Of course, race relations were always going to be a big part of this film as it is set in a time in American history when racism was rife, but I do often feel films like this try too hard to make a statement rather than simply tell the story.",7,0,1,28 March 2020
Sin City," Comic book brought to life... complete with a wafer thin story
","I had a feeling I was going to hate this movie, and I was right. I only watched it in the hope that I would be pleasantly surprised, but nope... I disliked it just as much as I thought I would. The only positive point I have to make about this film is how it looks. There's no doubt that this film has style in abundance - it's a visual feast. In fact, the visuals were the only thing that kept me watching.Everything else about 'Sin City' I didn't like, from the wafer thin storyline to the ridiculously over-the-top violence. I normally don't mind violence in films but the violence in 'Sin City' was excessive to the point where it became totally meaningless. So, all in all, not my type of film at all. 'Sin City' oozes style but offers nothing in just about every other area.",4,1,2,9 August 2017
Happy Feet," Okay for kids, pretty tedious for adults
","'Happy Feet' is an innocent enough little movie containing everything you would expect from an animated family picture. Although it may be intended for family viewing, this is a kids' movie through and through and anybody over the age of 10 or 11 will probably struggle to get any pleasure out of it. Sure, there's lots going on, it's vibrant and colourful, there's lots of singing and dancing, but for the average adult there isn't much to enjoy.Watching films like this makes you appreciate some of the best animated family movies, the ones that contain something for everyone. The likes of 'Ratatouille' and 'The Incredibles' are good examples of movies that people of all ages can sit and enjoy. They have strong plots, memorable characters, and humour that doesn't just appeal to 5 year old. 'Happy Feet' lacks any of those things and soon becomes tedious for the average viewer.",5,0,0,1 April 2018
Slumdog Millionaire," Undeniably a great film
","I remember the hype around 'Slumdog Millionaire' when it first came out. Some people were even hailing it as one of the best movies ever, and it's easy to see why. It is a superbly written and produced film with an uplifting and thoroughly engaging storyline. Dev Patel delivers a near faultless performance as Jamal, though the entire cast are terrific.'Slumdog Millionaire' is one of those films that you hear so many positive things about and are somewhat reluctant to watch in case it lets you down. But unlike a lot of other hyped up movies, this one lives up to expectations. It grabs your attention from the start and keeps you absorbed right until the end. It takes a special kind of movie to successfully achieve that.This is undeniably a great film that deserves the praise it gets. It's not one of my personal favourites but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless.",8,1,2,28 May 2016
The Nice Guys," Actually rather good, I was surprised
","My expectations for this film were low given how many times I've read good things about a comedy on this site and been disappointed. However, on this occasion, I think the positive reviews are justified. Not only is 'The Nice Guys' a credible comedy but I was impressed by how well-made it is all-round.The first thing that struck me about this film is how good it looks - it's not short on style, especially for a comedy. There's some impressive action scenes and the film gets the balance between comedy and action about right - it's certainly fun to watch. Gosling and Crowe are both great in their roles and are very funny together.'The NIce Guys' was a pleasant surprise to me, it feels like a long time since I've seen a modern-day comedy that has lived up to the hype but I think this one did.",7,2,3,1 March 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Pathetic excuse for entertainment
","I don't know what I find more shocking - just how bad 'Fury Road' is, or the fact that it has an average rating of 8.1 on IMDb. If you want to spend two hours watching back to back action sequences, explosions and car chases without really caring for any sort of story or plot, then this is just for you.I didn't particularly like the other 'Mad Max' films, but I would watch any of them again over this. Literally NOTHING of significance happens during the entire duration of 'Fury Road'. Nothing. This is easily one of the most boring, pointless films I've ever seen in my life, and one of my least favourite. It has no redeeming qualities at all. Not one.Unless you want to stare at repetitive action sequences and have you ear drums ruined by persistent noise for two hours, I suggest you avoid this pathetic excuse of a movie.",1,9,16,1 January 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Emotionally moving true war story
","'Hacksaw Ridge', though advertised as a war movie, is more like a drama set on a battlefield. Not that there's anything wrong with that, especially given how engaging and emotionally involving this true story is.The film is very well-written and directed and it was a pleasant surprise to see the emphasis placed on the story and dialogue rather than just actions scenes. Andrew Garfield deserves a lot of credit for his outstanding performance as war hero Desmond Doss.True stories are always the best stories, and this is one of the most uplifting and inspirational I've come across in a long time. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a good film about a wonderful true story. Definitely one of the must-see movies of 2016.",7,7,11,24 March 2017
The Social Network," Informative and carries an important message
","It's hard to believe that it's been almost a decade since this film's release. Since then, Facebook's grip on people's lives only seems to have tightened and Mr Zuckerberg's public profile has grown significantly. In this social media-dominated age this film was definitely necessary and it provides an informative and compelling insight into the story behind one of the biggest invention of the modern day.'The Social Media' is a well-constructed film that gets the balance between educating and entertaining about right. The characters are the most interesting part of the film and I thought they were brilliantly portrayed by all involved. This film, while primarily aiming to tell the complicated story behind Facebook, also carries an important message - no amount of 'friends' on social media or money in the bank is a substitute for 'real-life' friendship. The sooner people realise this the better.I deleted my Facebook account many years ago now and don't miss it one bit. My problem isn't just with Facebook, rather social media as a whole and the (in my view mostly negative) influence it has on people. I don't think I'll ever understand why people feel the need to broadcast their lives to the world, but that's a rant for another time!",7,2,2,8 November 2019
The Pursuit of Happyness," An irresistible success story
","'The Pursuit of Happiness' is no ordinary rags-to-riches film. This is a real, raw and emotionally engaging story that will leave you feeling inspired, reflective and appreciative of everything that you have. The Pursuit takes you on a roller coaster of emotion, rarely does a film take you to such lows and yet still manage to be uplifting.The success of this film is largely down to Will Smith and the on- screen relationship with his son Jaden, which is heartfelt and touching. No actor could have done a better job at playing Chris Gardner than Will Smith - his performance in this film is near flawless. So good in fact that you soon forget that he's an actor and not the man himself.'The Pursuit of Happiness' is easily one of my favourite biographical films and one that always has me hooked. An inspiring, uplifting and touching film that everybody should see at least once in their lifetime.",10,0,0,14 January 2017
Goodfellas," Definitely up there with the best of all time
","The first title that will come to most people's mind when thinking of mafia films is inevitably 'The Godfather' - a timeless classic that many consider to be the greatest movie of all time. However, as good as 'The Godfather' is, there's something about 'Goodfellas' that I enjoy more.Maybe it's the way the story is told, or the fact that the violence in 'Goodfellas' is a lot more ruthless and brutal. It also has more entertainment value compared to the plot-heavy Godfather. Whatever the reason, 'Goodfellas' is a film I enjoy immensely and is up there as one of my favourites in the crime genre.Aside from the story, 'Goodfellas' is a near perfect piece of filmmaking, with a witty and intelligent script, brilliant acting throughout, and terrific cinematography. 'Goodfellas' is a near flawless movie.",10,2,4,21 May 2017
Sully," Great story but the film left me cold
","True stories are always the best stories and Chesley Sullenberger's is certainly an extraordinary one. The film tells the story of the pilot of a doomed flight, whose skills and quick thinking saved all lives onboard. It's a remarkable story, though I do feel the film didn't do it full justice. It felt more like a quick fix rather than a proper account of the events that occurred. Too much of the film is set in the aftermath and as a result, it isn't the heart in mouth drama that it should have been.Tom Hanks is excellent, as he always is, though I much preferred him in the similar 'Captain Phillips'. His character was a lot more vulnerable in that film and it also did a much better job at building tension. While there is certainly tension in 'Sully', it is restricted to only a few scenes and the cutting back and forth doesn't help at all. Overall, not a bad film, but I was expecting something a lot better.",6,2,4,10 December 2017
The Simpsons Movie," Seamless transition to the big screen
","Many 'Simpsons' fans, myself included, were fearful that the world's most popular TV show would fail to live up to expectation when transitioning to the big screen. It almost felt inevitable that 'The Simpsons Movie' would disappoint, and so when the initial reactions to the film were overwhelmingly positive it was a huge relief.'The Simpsons Movie' is every bit as funny as the TV show. The transition from small to big screen is seamless and everything that people loved about the show was successfully retained in the movie. The plot far exceeded my expectations and the jokes come thick and fast with many laugh out loud moments. Fans of the show needn't worry - it's hilarious.",8,1,1,23 July 2017
Dodgeball," One of those 'so stupid it's funny' movies
","'Dodgeball' achieves almost all of its laughs through the sheer stupidity of the plot and some ridiculous individual scenes. Over-the- top comedies like this usually either end up being complete disasters or very funny, and I would definitely place 'Dodgeball' in the latter category.The guy behind this film went on to direct 2013's 'We're the Millers' and the similarities between the two are clear. Both have ridiculous plots, silly gags and eccentric characters that, on paper, really shouldn't work. Not only do they work, but both were a complete blast to watch. The sort of film that you can't take seriously, because it doesn't even take itself seriously!",7,1,2,2 August 2017
Law Abiding Citizen," Watchable but too far-fetched to be taken seriously
","'Law Abiding Citizen' has all the right ideas but its on-screen execution is nothing short of a mess. The film starts off well enough and sets up a plausible scenario, only to undo all of its efforts by going down the 'make it up as you go along' route, with the second half of the film being nothing short of silly and amateurish. It jumps from one far-fetched scenario to another, before falling flat on its face with a ridiculous ending.There's enough going on to hold your attention throughout, but the second half of the film is so unconvincing that it becomes just another comic-book style action flick with zero depth or substance to any of what happens. It's disappointing given the potential that this film had and the promise that is showed in the first half or so. 'Law Abiding Citizen' is a watchable action flick, but the second half is way too far-fetched to be taken seriously.",4,0,1,27 September 2017
V for Vendetta," I was expecting something a lot better
","Having read some glowing reviews beforehand, I was really looking forward to seeing 'V for Vendetta' for the first time. Now I've seen it, I must say that I was underwhelmed. Maybe the reviews gave me false expectations, but the film just didn't come close to being the 'masterpiece' that many reviewers before me have called it. Aside from an intriguing main character and some great visuals, it left me cold.From the get-go, the film is more interested in showcasing a bunch of knife fights, explosions and firework displays (timed to music, of course) than telling any sort of story. As a result, the film becomes repetitive and tiresome very fast. The excessive action and violence is only interesting for so long and when it finally wears thin, the weak and poorly executed plot is clear to see.'V for Vendetta' isn't the film I was hoping it would be and I was expecting something a lot better to be honest.",6,3,5,27 September 2017
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Quirky comedy from the Coens
","While not as well-known as some of their other films, 'O Brother' is another great film by the Coens - a unique comedy/adventure with an enjoyable storyline and some genuinely hilarious individual scenes. It's a real whacky, offbeat comedy with equally eccentric characters that isn't intended to be taken seriously. It's clear that this film wants the audience to have fun, and it definitely succeeds.'O Brother' is put together really well. It looks great and is beautifully shot, making the most of the rural setting and stunning scenery. The Coens attention to detail always shines through in their films and this one in particular stands out for how every scene is crafted to perfection. It's difficult to find any technical faults. 'O Brother' is a quirky comedy gem from the Coens - a hugely enjoyable film.",7,0,0,12 August 2018
The Godfather," Awesome, a genuine masterpiece
","The term is far overused, but 'The Godfather' truly is a masterpiece and is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. There is little point going into too much detail with this review as there are already over 2,000 that I'm sure have covered everything that needs to be said.To summarise this film as concisely as possible: it features a brilliantly constructed, deep and absorbing storyline, first-class acting from all involved, outstanding cinematography (especially for its time) and one of the most memorable and iconic characters in film history.'The Godfather' is easily the most absorbing 3 hour film ever made and the fact that this has remained one of the most popular movies over 40 years after its release says it all. To sum it up in a sentence - 'The Godfather' is as close to perfection as any film has ever, or is likely, to come.",10,0,0,6 November 2016
