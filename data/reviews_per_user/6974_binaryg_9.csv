Catch Me If You Can," Finally a film by Spielberg that I can watch!!!
","I hate Spielberg. I have not enjoyed/hated every one of his films. Well, which is it? Not enjoyed or hated? Both. Before he became the KING of Gollywood his stuff was sentimental and boring. Over and over again I'd go see his films in the hope that somehow he'd risen above the lowest common denominator , or I'd sunk into the miasma of critical and popular American taste. He'd been able to trivialize slavery, the Holocaust and war in his view of the Normandy invasion. I only rented this because I was desperate to fill the two for one offer at my local DVD dealer. Add to this how I despise the American Everyman, Mr. Tom Hanks, (I tried to overlook that he [the latter day James Stewart] was in the film ]). I found myself chuckling. I found myself laughing. I found myself really enjoying a film, ONE, directed by Spielberg, and TWO, one in which,  Tom (Jimmy) Hanks (Stewart) is one of the stars. This is a funny and entertaining film, no matter what I've said about the principles.",Null,0,1,15 July 2003
Marie Antoinette," I Thought I'd Like It and...Ta Dah! I Did! Not Only That, I Love It!!!
","Having trashed two of the three movies Sofia Coppola has directed (I didn't see Lick the Star, yuck!) what made me think I'd enjoy Marie Antoinette? I'm old and worse yet, a male. Certainly not the demographic Marie Antoinette is aimed at, so I found when I ventured out to my local Cineplex to check out Ms. Coppola's 4th go at directing. I figured to use the theater as my personal screening-room on a Friday at noon. Oops! It was a school holiday and I entered one of the smaller of the 14 'theaters' into a crowd of a dozen or so chatting high school girls. I had mistakenly arrived 20 minutes early so I had an opportunity to eavesdrop on their discussion concerning the ethics paper they were required to write and what they were considering giving up for a week as required by their class. These must have been students at the nearby parochial high school. What public high school has ethic courses? They seemed a perfect audience for a film on Marie Antoinette. The theater continued to fill as film time approached. It filled to approximately ¾ capacity and I was, as best as I could determine, the only male person of my gender.So why did I think I'd enjoy a film by a director whose films seemed directed by a person with a spoiled child's view of the world? Well, what I'd read about Marie Antoinette resonated close enough with Moulin Rouge, Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge which blew me away. 'Lavish imagery and a daring soundtrack set this film apart from most period dramas; in fact, style complete takes precedence over plot and character development in Coppola's vision of the doomed queen' should sound familiar to Moulin Rouge fans.Well, as soon as the black and shocking pink credits showed up to the sound of The Gang of Four's 'Natural's Not In It' I knew I was in the right place. Kirsten Dunst was, in my opinion, a perfect choice. She's beautiful but not too beautiful. She has an aura of mischievousness which worked from start to finish. Ms. Dunst, at the young age of 24 or so, already has a long career in Hollywood. And she was only one of many. From Marianne Faithful, to Judy Davis, to Rip Torn, to Jason Schwartzman, to Asia Argento, to many others perfectly cast. For me, the film never dragged or bogged down. The sets were beautiful. (What can you say about Versailles and the French countryside?) The food was reminiscent to me of Wayne Thiebaud paintings, but more colorful. The costumes, the music, added to the sense of decadence I think the film aimed for. Yet Marie Antoinette's character never seemed decadent. Ms. Dunst's openness and delight in all presented to her, came across. Despite her loss of freedom and the difficulty in eventually becoming the Queen of France she was able to 'Party On!' What made the film, for me, exceptional, was how Sofia Coppola was able to make both Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI living, breathing, human beings, rather than grotesqueries. I was moved several times by their connection or lack of the same. There is a lot to see, hear and experience in Marie Antoinette. It is an accomplished and stimulating cinematic experience. I shall view it as much as I am able. This film has prompted me to review both The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation. The world is certainly in need of feminine perspective and Sofia Coppola has made a statement that she has the potential to be a very Great talent.Pardon my verbosity.",10,198,334,11 November 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Taramtino IS a Bastard!
","OK, I got that out of the way. (why basterds??? Oh, I get it, it builds up the mystique.) I liked IB more than I'd expected. I really enjoyed the constant cinematic references. I got hooked very quickly into the story and the actors' performances. I was even able, in the beginning, to overlook Brad Pitt and his over-the-top performance.The film is great to look at and well constructed and for a while I was lost in the web Tarantino was weaving.Yes, there is violence and blood. I was troubled by the death of the two females. But that had me wondering about my values. Why would I object to the death of women in a film but not so much a man??? I really tired of Pitt by the end and if the film had been shorter by 30 or 40 minutes it would have worked better for me.The end, where all the baddies are destroyed was a superior cinematic conceit. If only For those who are afraid that this film will somehow change the Holocaust history, get real and relax.",7,3,8,16 August 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Shiver Me Timbers, POTC Made Me Feel My Demographic!
","My first inclination upon hearing about a film based on a Disneyland ride was to abandon ship and stay away. But word of mouth from everyone I knew who'd seen it (my grandchildren included) led me to walk the plank and lay my booty on the line just to see Depp do Keith Richards. I am an aged Stones fan.  Johnny D. has Mr. Richards' chops down. And for a while this and Geoffrey Rush's, also over-the-top, Barboosa were enough fun to keep the film interesting. But my eyes began to glaze over at about ninety minutes, the umpteenth sword fight, and the innumerable howling moonlit skeletons. Arrg and avast matey!I'll turn in me peg leg as I'm just too old for this kind of fun.",5,0,1,2 September 2003
The Hurt Locker," Hurt Locker
","Males and females at IMDb both rate this film equally at 7.8 (but as usual it's 10 to 1, male raters to female). Then the other interesting demographic is males and females under 18, which is also skewered way toward males to females by 8 to 1, but both of these gave the film the highest approval rating at 8.3 of any demographic. And therein lies my objection to this film and especially to the fact that this film even was nominated, let alone won, best picture from gollywood. The academy, the industry, the military industrial complex all helped honor this film with the 'supposed' highest award.I was suspicious from the very beginning of Hurt Locker and as it went on, and on and on without any cinematic competence I began to compare it with 'Apocalypse Now' which did NOT win best film, best director, best supporting actor , best writing, best editing, best art directing, but managed 2 awards for sound and cinematography. Hurt Locker won 6 of the 9 awards for which it was nominated. I am saddened here that the first AAward given to a female director is given to a film which I believe to be a most unfeminine film. Women have mourned for centuries the loss of their children and husbands to war, yet we in the midst of two of our nation's longest war, Ms. Bigelow is put to the task of enticing under 18's to this violence as something they might want to take part in so they can, 'Be all they can be' as the film informs them more than once.We were and are in the midst of a severe financial crisis in which 'I'm lucky to have a job' is a phrase I hear often. These sub 18's are facing an uncertain future. But the a Huge growth industry, which has continued for decades now, in this nation, is the Military. The military will not go unfunded in this, the most violent society in the world.I don't believe that is any conspiracy here. But the message sent by this film is 'war is romantic.' I'm disgusted in the nation in which I live.",1,8,12,30 July 2010
Moulin Rouge!," Kidman and Luhrmann and Incredible
","Not often enough, a film is released that I have to see because I know I must. The last one for me was Titus and the one before was Thin Red Line. These are love it or hate it films. Moulin Rouge had me from the moment it started to the very end of the credits. It promised and delivered audacity. I've read the critics who've written Moulin Rouge is visually spectacular but the story line is weak. The story tells us that love is the most important thing a human can experience. Only those who have never fallen in Love can doubt that. I am on the wrong side of a romantic involvement, but Moulin Rouge reminded me of the power of Love. As for the actors: Nicole Kidman is Incredible and gorgeous(I can only feel sorry for Tom). She sings so well and her face is incredible to look at. Ewan McGregor (who's he?) sings incredibly. Jim Broadbent's characterization and singing are mesmerizing and Leguizamo is a comic, lisping Toulouse-Lautrec. The weaving of movie and MTV music is incredible. (Is that really what Roxanne is about?)Thank you Baz Luhrmann",10,0,1,2 June 2001
Black Hawk Down," Waving the Flag is Easier Than Thinking
","Black Hawk Down comes, at what seems to me, to be a crucial time in the development of American Democracy. As a nation we have been through a great deal over the past five months. In many ways we have passed through this time with high marks. We have not interred innocent Muslims, Afghanis, Saudis, as was the response in 1942 to the 'parallel' events at Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center. We have not yet (except for Afghanistan) bombed anyone back to the Stone Age.  For that, I am a grateful Human.The film Black Hawk Down makes me worry though, that any sense of reasonableness may last. Despite the film craftsmanship of Ridley Scott, this is a very flawed war film philosophically. It is jingoism at a time when this nation and its citizen's need is thoughtful reflection.
I came away from this film deeply disturbed by its need to resort to 'war film clichés.' That there is only one 'token' Afro American US soldier, and at the same time the Somalis are portrayed as nothing but a swarm of angry bees is inexcusable. See The Thin Red Line to see a thoughtful portrayal of enemy.  The one character we get even a minute amount of information on is obviously the first casualty. The speech at the end about 'Why we do this' (soldiers fighting battles) is nothing but an echo of the Tom Hanks' speech at the end of the 'anti-war' film, Saving Private Ryan.
Mr. Scott is not just any filmmaker. His gratuitously violent Gladiator won an academy award (sic). Like Mr. Spielberg, who has nothing but room to take chances to make the World a better place, only communicate to the lowest common denominator.I've read an IMDb user's comment, 'I was there - where were you?' My answer, I wasn't there thankfully. For a more honest version of what went on in Mogadishu, I suggest the PBS's (yes, the petroleum broadcasting network's) Frontline report, which was much more disturbing than this Gollywood version of 'War is Hell.'",1,29,60,9 February 2002
There Will Be Blood," Seduced by Blood and Oil
","I've watched four versions of Macbeth recently and the witches, among many things in the play, are fascinating for the spell they so easily cast on Macbeth. And so it was, after seeing There Will Be Blood I felt under a spell and seduced by director Paul Thomas Anderson's new film. I've seen it again since and feel more drawn on and into this poetic, and ambiguous work. I am amazed by the power the film has been able to exert on me. I'm amazed in the same sense The Shining drew me into the mystery of the characters and settings of that film. Instead of being led through the halls of a haunted hotel or the literal hedge maze, in There Will Be Blood I'm led down into the Earth where silver, gold, oil, and Hell exist and I am a-mazed. There are many images in There Will Be Blood of fire and damnation and of the Devil himself in the characters of Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday. Both know the Devil well. All of the acting is top-notch but Daniel Day-Lewis creates not so much a man as he does an elemental force of nature, a force that can and will destroy even those he deeply cares about, his own familyI see a great deal of Kubrick in this work by Anderson although a see many, many other cinematic references to other filmmakers, films, and characters. The sense of black, bleak humor the use of music bring layers of meaning and texture to the film are so reminiscent of Kubrick and really only speaks to the mastery and maturity Anderson has achieved at a young age and with only now five films in his career. He has made his own masterpiece, a film, which resonates with the history of the conquering of the American West, and with the with the course of current events where we find ourselves addicted to the oil pumping through our veins to such a degree that we kill and destroy to secure it. There Will Be Blood is a great film and for me represents a passing on of the Directorial Torch. Paul Thomas Anderson is a Poet of Light like Altman, Welles, Houston, Kubrick, and others before him.The Poets light but Lamps /Themselvesgo out /The Wicks they stimulate /If vital Light /Inhere as do the Suns /Each Age a Lens /Disseminating their Circumference-Emily Dickinson",10,2,6,19 January 2008
Donnie Darko," Donny Darko, the Harvey of the 21st Century
","This news item appeared in my newspaper today:'Spielberg to remake 'Harvey' rabbit classic Friday, August 7, 2009Steven Spielberg has a giant rabbit on his mind for his next film.Spielberg is directing a remake of the James Stewart classic 'Harvey,' the story of a bighearted eccentric who's branded a crackpot for claiming to have a 6-foot-tall invisible rabbit as his best buddy.Casting is just getting started, with production expected to begin early next year.The new version will be a contemporary update of Stewart's 1950 film, which was based on Mary Chase's Pulitzer Prize-winning play.The film is a co-production between Spielberg's DreamWorks Studio and 20th Century Fox. A release date has not been announced, but a Fox spokesman said the studio is looking to have the film in theaters late next year.Associated Press' My response to this news: (and please pardon me for quoting meself) 'Richard Kelly already effectively did this with 'Donny Darko', the 'Harvey' for the 21st Century. I don't have a lot of faith in SS not making something sappy starring the new Jimmy Stewart, Tom Hanks. Yuck!' I haven't seen 'Donny Darko' for a while but this remembrance insures I will watch it again very soon. A Remarkable Film.",10,1,3,7 August 2009
