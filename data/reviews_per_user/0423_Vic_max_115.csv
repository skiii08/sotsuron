Ford v Ferrari," Ford's foray into 1960s endurance racing
","You can't but help but root for Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles ... they're kind of the real racing die-hards being used like pawns by Ford management of the time. The movie leads up to the dramatic 1966 24-hour endurance racing event in Le Mans, France.What a great story! It brings together luminaries of the time like Enzo Ferrari, Henry Ford and Carroll Shelby in a fascinating true historical event. We also learn of a name that should be honored in like, namely Ken Miles. The movie has great characters, action, suspense and an amazing ending.For me, one of the coolest scenes in the movie is when Henry Ford II takes a ride with Shelby in the GT race car. He is overwhelmed with awe of what cars have become since his grandfather's time. The GT is no model-T.The 2.5 hour run time breezes and it's hard not to be glued to the screen the whole time. The movie's a winner in my book.",Null,3,6,20 November 2019
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Good On It's Own Terms ...
","I actually enjoyed this a bit more than the first movie. It was a little easier to follow and a bit more focused. The characters were also fun to watch, the action was well choreographed and the dialog was innocent and lighthearted.The plot is simple: A missing page of John Wilkes Booth's diary is found. It implicates treasure hunter Ben Gates' ancestor of being the mastermind Abe Lincoln's assassination. When he sets out to analyze and disprove the document, his search leads him to seek out a lost city of gold... in the US.The focus of this movie is on the fast-paced search for clues and answers. There's hardly a stray moment. As long as you're willing to accept a little fictional license, this movie can be enjoyed by just about everyone - it's worth checking out.",Null,0,0,20 December 2008
Angels & Demons," Pain in the Brain ...
","I didn't read the book that this movie is based on, so I had no idea what to expect going in. What I found was a movie with a great opening and ending, but with a painful experience for all the time in between.For me, most of the movie consisted of Tom Hanks motor-mouthing a barrage of historical references and connections I had no understanding of. It was too fast and detailed to make any sense of.Of course, I understood the overall plot: the race to find 4 Vatican cardinals before they are executed, as well as an antimatter bomb before it explodes in Vatican City.But again, the convoluted 'aha' moments of the lead character (Hanks) were so incomprehensible that all I could do was to watch as he went from one place to another. At that level of viewing, the movie was formulaic and boring.The only saving grace of this movie was the brief opening sequence and the ending segment. My recommendation: you'll probably be better off reading the book (which I hear is very good), then watching this movie. Otherwise, the critics have this one right (see Rotten Tomatoes); the approval rating from critics is under 40%.",Null,2,9,24 May 2009
Changeling," Excellent ...
","This movie takes its time to give you the full story of an amazing child disappearance case from 1928. I really appreciated this because I often feel cheated at the end of a good story when the ending is wrapped up in about 30 seconds.Angelina Joli does a very good job of portraying a determined lady in the midst of extreme psychological police pressure. They are trying to convince her that a child they found (and have given to her) is her missing child of 5 months, while she claims he is not. It's very effectively done, because sometimes you just want to reach through the screen and take matters into your own hand! The sets and visuals do an outstanding job of getting you into the feel of the late 20s ... the rollerskates of telephone operators, trolley cars, big box of Frosted Flakes and very old style cars are images not soon forgot.At 2h 20min, this movie is almost an hour longer than most movies - but it is time well spent. Highly recommended viewing.",Null,5,9,13 November 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Limited, but Good, Hard Laughs ...
","It's hard to tell someone else what's funny and what isn't.For me, I found that only about 15% of the movie got me to actually laugh. But that's not too bad because I almost never laugh in movies. Plus, in that 15% were some very funny and memorable moments.The movie is basically done as a travel log documentary of a fictitious Kazakhstan TV reporter (Borat) who travels to the United States. In the movie we watch his crude mannerisms and commentaries emerge with unsuspecting interviewees. This is where most of the humor comes from.Borat interviews / interacts with personalities ranging from evangelists and cowboys to etiquette coaches and gun dealers.For me, most of the jokes were misfires or familiar, predictable scenarios (esp. if you've seen the 'Ali G' TV series). However, in the areas where the skits did succeed - well, it's hard to put a value on a good laugh. I would describe the humor as crude - but creative and fresh as well.Be forewarned - there is a lot of material that deals with areas like racism, gender-bashing and homosexuality. Depending on how it comes across to you, it will be either vile and offensive or humorous social commentary.See this movie with a friend - sharing / recalling funny moments from the movie is a fun way to spend some time afterwards.",Null,0,3,12 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Some good, some bad ...
","As far as entertainment value, here's where I'd put Hulk in relation to other Marvel-comic movies:#1 = Spider-Man movies #2 = Iron Man #3 = The Incredible Hulk (this movie) AND (tied)#3 = X-Men movies#4 = Fantastic 4 moviesThe Incredible Hulk was a bit of a mixed bad - some good parts and some bad ones. On the positive side, the movie picks up where the 2003 movie left off (so it's not a repeat) and there were some cool, energetic fight scenes, especially towards the end. On the minus side, the Hulk looked a noticeably cartoon-like and Edward Norton (who plays the lead character) sounded a bit too effeminate.To its credit, the movie doesn't try to re-tell the story of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk (as was done in the 2003 movie), but rather continues the storyline of the government trying to capture him. He's on the run and yearning to get back with the girl he had to leave ... but worst problems are headed his way.One of amusing aspects of the movie are the cameos by Stan Lee (founder of Marvel comics), Lou Ferrigno (who played the Hulk on TV), Robert Downey Jr. (playing his businessman character from Iron Man) and even a TV clip with Bill Bixby (who played the TV Bruce Banner). Those were fun to watch. Many of the energetic fight sequences were also pretty great.However, the animation of the Hulk was almost like a cartoon. It was a bit annoying to watch given how well fictional characters can be made to look these days. Furthermore, Edward Norton's dialog was goofy sounding; he just didn't sound like a normal guy. His voice was about an octave too high (well, that's probably an exaggeration). Fans of the comic book seem to really enjoy this movie - so you are lucky if you're part of that group. For everyone else, know that the movie is decently good and 'middle-of-the-road' in terms of Marvel films.",Null,3,12,14 June 2008
10 Cloverfield Lane," Much better than expected
","I had reservations about this film - esp. because it seemed like it was done on a lower budget than those big 'hollywood' tent-pole movies I've become spoiled by. I don't want to say too much about the plot because that's part of the intrigue of the movie ... what's really going on?But THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE! It's wonderful to find a movie that builds tension, suspense, mystery and gets you to question your ideas about what's going on.Plus, the acting is great - and this movie thrives on great performances by the key actors involved. I was always interested in learning what was going to happen next.I'd rate it higher if it had a slightly more polished feel ... but as I said, I've been spoiled by big budget flicks, so don't let it distract you from what I'm saying.If you're looking for a taut suspenseful mystery and are intrigued with the 'J.J. Abrams' connection -- there's a good bet you'll enjoy this.",Null,1,5,11 March 2016
Marie Antoinette," Interesting insight on Antoinette ...
","I was really looking forward to watching this movie; something about watching conspicuous consumption and learning some history seemed intriguing. Although it was not exactly what I was expecting, it was a worthwhile experience.Basically, the movie is about the early life of Marie Antoinette. It starts with her arrival in France and mostly concentrates on the next several years in her life.On the plus side, the movie provides an interesting perspective on the emotional challenges faced by Antoinette. It also nicely depicts what it may have been like for her to become part of French royalty. I did not realize that there may have been a fair amount culture shock in this transition. Apparently, she had to essentially give up her Viennese heritage.On the minus side, her life is put into very little context with regards to historical events. This was probably intentional, but it makes the passage of time a bit confusing. For the most part, I couldn't tell how far apart events were because she looked the same and there was little reference to the outside world. Furthermore, I never really 'felt' the extreme conspicuousness referred to in the trailer for the film. It was there, but it didn't have the strong presence the previews seems to imply.If you're looking for a biographical retrospective on Marie Antoinette, you won't satisfied with the movie. However, if you want to gain some insight into why Antoinette may have acted as lavishly as she did, then you'll benefit from watching it.",Null,1,2,28 October 2007
Deja Vu," Takes a while to get going ...
","This movie has a 'scifi-esq' element to it so it's hard to imagine that it would take a while to get going. Yet, somehow, it manages to stall for the first 2/3 of the movie. Fortunately, it does finally pick up and get interesting.Basically, the movie is about a police officer (Denzel) who investigates a high-fatality ferry bombing. When he is teamed up with a government unit to look for answers, he learns they have a very unusual tool at their disposal: a device that can look back in time.The basic plot sounds like it's going to be incredibly interesting - but a couple of things are off so it is pretty low key for a while. The story is a bit slow in developing and the characters aren't that interesting. Not even Denzel - who is almost always interesting to watch - is not very engaging.The scifi element is interesting, but only for a little while when it is first introduced. Only in the last third of the movie does a feeling of suspense and unpredictability really come to the forefront.I do recommend seeing it if you're looking for an above-average movie. However, don't expect a thrill ride from start to finish. If you find it slow, give it some time and it will improve.",Null,0,1,18 October 2007
Rocketman," 10/10 for beautiful EJ Music ... 6/10 for Story Presentation
","If you love Elton John music and are curious about his story - definitely see this movie. It's in the style of a broadway musical so it's less dramatic and more like a dancing, signing musical stage production.I enjoyed the movie but feel that doing this as a musical wasn't the greatest choice. But the music is brilliant, the story is wonderful and the fact that he's still alive is a reminder to cherish this musical genius.",Null,0,1,3 June 2019
Star Trek," A treat for everyone!
","This movie is a treat for the Trek fans, sci-fi fans and those that are simply out to see a good action movie. All will be pleased. This movie breaks away from the standard 'over-the-top' boy-scout characters of previous movies and us some good 'edgy' characters instead.The movie is mainly centered around Kirk and how he came to be in command of the Enterprise, in a time of crisis. It's grand in scope and you get to meet all the principal Trek characters all over again. Except this time their younger, edgier and some things about them are different... it's all explained in the movie.This movie has a lot going for it - fantastic visuals, fast pacing and interesting characters. The Spock and Kirk roles were cast very well and the rest of the cast does a fine job as well.IMAX: Don't worry if you don't see it in IMAX - it's not a real IMAX movie (it was 'enlarged' to fit IMAX, not filmed in IMAX). I liked it fine on the huge screen, but you might actually get a crisper image on a normal sized theater screen.This is a wonderful summertime sci-fi action flick for just about everyone. If you go out to see any movies this year, this one of those 'don't miss' movies for 2009.",Null,1,8,9 May 2009
Coraline," Dark, Stylish, Visually Amazing .... and not really for young kids.
","First - if you see this movie, try to see the 3D version - not all presentations are in 3D. Second, know that this movie is way too dark (IMHO) for kids under 10. Not only could the visuals be too intense, but the pacing is not that of a children's show.OK - that said, this movie is great. The strength is in three areas: visuals (scenery, characters, and little 'details'), style (this is movie is simply a work of art - a very dark and offbeat style) and emotional impact (the film visually evokes a lot of childhood feelings about growing up).The basic setup: A little girl and her parents move into a big, mysterious old home. One night, she learns that a little door in the house opens into a passageway to a parallel world. In this world, there are alternate versions of her parents, friends and everything ... as she journeys back and forth, she learns more and more about this world ... and the story progresses from there.If that sounds a bit too simplistic, there's more to it in the full story. Plus, it's presented in a serious and dark tone - which adds to it's mystique. The only area I can knock it is in a tame use of 3D. There are definitely some spectacular 3D parts, but the way it's used in general makes it fade into backgroundIf you're drawn to the visual aspects of movies, then this is must-see movie for 2009.",Null,15,17,9 February 2009
Two for the Money," Exciting - like watching a game ...
","Great movie - opens with a nice attention grabbing situation and builds and builds. There are 3 principal actors and all three deliver great performances. Pacino is over-the-top intense as usual. McConaughey is humbling and interesting to watch. He goes through a journey in the movie that many will probably be able to identify with. Although I had a bit of a believability problem with the way the movie accelerates McConaughey's character into the high-end world of sports betting, the story and characters were good enough to carry me beyond that problem. The movie keeps building and building in suspense - very much like a close football game coming to the end. The movie is fun and gives you pause to reflect on yourself and the nature of gambling. If you likes sports-betting at all, definitely recommended.",Null,0,1,5 October 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 'Loose yourself in F^($'
","As wild as that line is, it's hilarious when you hear it delivered in this movie. It's one of number of memorable moments that you'll get from watching this comedic gem.Basically, the movie is about a fellow who gets dumped by his TV-actress girlfriend. When he goes to a Hawaiian resort to forget about her, he learns that that's where she and her new rock-star boyfriend are staying - and he keeps bumping into them! It's a pretty standard-sounding storyline, but the movie has plenty of gags and engaging moments to keep one interested. The fast pace makes it easy to stay interested. The movie is a bit edgy - so keep that in mind (case in point: there are some extended scenes with full male nudity of the lead, Jason Segel).All an all, this movie was very well done. Not only are there are a number of laugh-out-loud moments, but you'll get interested in the story as well. Definitely worth a watch if you're in the mood for a comedy.",Null,1,3,8 May 2009
Zootopia," Cool new world, interesting story ... good for kids and maybe adults too
","Full disclosure: I'm an adult who generally likes action and sci-fi movies. I'll go for an animated movie if I it has great reviews and people say it's enjoyable for 'all ages'. That was the case here and - yes, I found it entertaining.It's basically a story about evolved animals that live in a harmonious, modern-age city called 'Zootopia'. It's 'harmonious' because predators and prey live and work together without stereotypes and labels. Well -- that's what everyone wants to believe, but reality is a bit more messy. This is what a young female bunny named Judy learns when she pursues her dream to become a police officer. She also stumbles onto a mysterious case ... and things get interesting.It may sound a bit corny and adolescent, but the story and themes aren't. It's well-written with clever dialog, an engaging plot mystery and likable characters. Plus, 'Zootopia' is like this big world with different zones or habitats for different types of animal species. It's a pretty cool concept in itself.The only thing I didn't like is that much of film's environments are too dark (visually) with gloomy skies and a general lack of vibrant colors. Better background color contrast would have been nice too. I'm going to guess this was a stylistic call to highlight something about the story -- but I don't think it was worth it.Anyhow, that notwithstanding, I'd say this is a great movie for kids - lots of action, fun characters and nice variety of visual locations and props. For the adults: if you enjoy movies like Shrek and the Lego Movie, you might enjoy this movie. It has less wit than those movies, but still has a lot of fun dialog and a good timely story.",Null,9,21,14 March 2016
Hostel," Upgrades Horror Movies...
","This movie is a clear step above most horror movies. It helps raise the bar for all horror movies by simply having a nice mix of movie elements that work well together.Basically, the movie is about three American college guys who venture out of Amsterdam and into a region of Slovakia looking for more extreme female interaction. Once they arrive, they begin to suspect that everything may not be as good as it seems when one by one they start disappearing.Although this seems like a typical horror plot, the movie is well-done and believable. The European scenery, interesting characters, decent dialog and fast-moving pace of the movie completely separate it from the typical 'waste of time' horror movies.I also give the director high marks for not making this a gore-fest and overfocusing on nothing but blood and guts. The result is that he has created a real movie - and a good one.This is a pretty decent horror flick. If you're in the mood for this kind of movie and don't want a mindless slasher-fest, this will do nicely.",Null,7,11,25 October 2007
Us," Great emotional experience, failed intellectual experience
","The first 2/3 of this movie are great, but it kind of falls apart at the end. But the acting, atmosphere and characters are pretty good and make the movie emotionally exciting.However, the explanations, as they're revealed in the last 1/3 of the movie, are full of holes ... and therefore unbelievable. This is the only thing holding this movie back from being a truly great movie. In fact, it might have been better without the explanation!However, If you want a tense, emotional thrill ride (and can let your intellect go on hold) ... this movie will fit the bill.",Null,1,3,20 April 2019
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Barely good ...
","The movie is not in the same league as the first Ice Age. It's just a hair above above average and the ideal audience is young children.This movie is about a group of animals (essentially those from the first movie) journeying towards a reputed 'boat' from a coming meltdown - one that will drown them with a flood of water.The best thing about the movie was the animation and scenery. It was spectacular - the backgrounds, water, creatures in the water and the ways the white and blue colors were intermixed for ice and water were very well done.One the minus side were a host of things. First, making Queen Latifah the voice of a female mammoth didn't work well (at least for me) - I felt I'd rather go extinct if I were the last male mammoth on earth.The endearing squirrel and acorn return, but the scenes this time are excruciatingly long and ridiculous - probably fun for children though.The story / journey itself was just not that interesting this time around; it really felt plodding and slow. Finally, the Biblical references were hugely obvious and made me wonder for a moment if this was I was watching something religion-inspired. I don't think so - but it gave me pause.I think this is a great movie for young children. The higher in age you go, the less you'll like it - but I think most will still find something to like.",Null,0,0,20 June 2007
Balls of Fury," Funny - if this is your cup of tea!
","Comedy is hard to rate since it's so subjective. I happen to like the silly gags and comments in this movie enough to think it was a worthwhile experience.The star, Dan Fogler (who I'm unfamiliar with) had a great innocence and down-trodden feel about him, his dialog 'felt' genuine so it was easy to be interested in his character. Christopher Walken played a role he's really great at: a crazy, exotic criminal. Many of his lines were fantastically crazy - and he made them fun to hear. James Hong, the blind master/teacher also put in a great performance with some hilarious one-liners spoofing great martial-art teachers in other movies.The movie is basically about a former child ping-pong star who is recruited by the FBI to get close to their most wanted criminal. This criminal, it turns out, is a ping-pong fanatic and hosts his own death-match playoff.There are some nutty plot holes, but for the most part, this movie was pretty satisfying. In addition the performances, the set designs were really colorful and rich; they were really nice to watch.At this point in time, all you can do is watch the movie on TV. I recommend watching the first 5 minutes. If you like the type of humor you see, you'll probably like the whole movie. It's consistent throughout.",Null,0,0,29 July 2008
Superbad," Brilliant!!
","To be frank, I was expecting this to be yet another garbage-level teen romp flick. However, given the strong reviews from critics, I thought I'd check it out. Wow, what a fantastic surprise this movie turned out to be. The script is very cleverly done and the performances are outstanding.The movie is basically about three high school seniors who are trying to get laid before starting college. The only problem is that they're closer to nerds than jocks. The most ambitious of these three figures out that a great way to score is to promise to bring alcohol to a party. And so begins their underage quest to acquire liquor ...What is incredible about the script is that the characters and situations are entirely believable. Yes, lots of extreme things happen in the story, but they are acknowledged as such and flow beautifully with the way the characters are conceived.The performances of the three main actors, along with the two police officers in the movie, are excellent. In fact, the five of them carry the entire movie. They deliver some hilarious lines in way that sounds like they really believe what they're saying! They're all so interesting and fun to watch that it's a shame that we only get them for one movie.This movie is for mature teen audiences on up. If you're looking for an intelligently written and funny movie, definitely check this one out.",Null,0,2,12 August 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Great action, formulaic story
","This movie started out pretty great, but then seemed to be losing some steam by last 1/3 of the movie. Hugh Jackman was great as were his enemies (esp. Liev Schreiber who plays his brother) - all were believably villainous and intense, but somehow the story stopped being engaging. Things became so formulaic that I realized I've seen this plot line one too many times.Basically, the story tells us the background story about X-Men character Wolverine's childhood through adulthood. He doesn't have a memory of his past and this movie tells us the story of why.There's a great revenge-themed plot involved, but it just doesn't have a great crescendo. Wolverine/Logan's vengeance quest ramps up great in the beginning and middle, but seems somewhat empty or hollow afterwards. All the classic elements were there (hateful enemies, explosions, good people in jeopardy ... etc.) - but that's the problem - it's too formulaic ... to the point of being utterly predictable.If you're an X-Men's fan, you've probably already seen this film (or nothing's going to stop you!), for everyone else - it's got some great action and F/X scenes that make a solid first half, but it delivers a story you've already seen a 100 times before.",Null,0,3,12 May 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Average 'Forbidden-Love' Story ...
","There was nothing particularly remarkable about this movie. If you take out the novelty of the same-gender love aspect (pretend we're dealing with a male-female situation), there was nothing exceptional about the story.Admittedly, the casting and acting were both good - Jake Gyllenhaal works well as a quirky, outgoing and impulsive character. Heath Ledger comes across as a perfect iconic image of a cowboy - in mannerisms, vocal tone, and reservedness. Because he personified the role of a young cowboy so well, it was easy to be immediately interested in his character.However - outside of the good acting, this seemed like a standard 'forbidden-love' type story. It plays out known, slow themes. The setup is basic: two people find themselves drawn to each other while working in a remote location, yet go back to their conventional lives (and the story progresses from there).It just wasn't that interesting. See it if you're intrigued by the novelty aspect, but pass otherwise.",Null,5,26,7 December 2006
Terminator Salvation," Great special effects, good story and a conclusion to the series: nice!
","Given the harsh reviews that this film received from critics, I tried to keep an open mind. After the movie started, I began to think - hey, this is pretty good. It must really tank towards the end ... well, it didn't. It turned out to be a pretty good sci-fi flick from start to finish.One interesting thing about this movie is that there were two plots going on: one for the main character John Conner (Bale) and one for the Kyle Reese (Yelchin) - Conner's 'future' father in the earlier Terminator movies. That worked out fine. I enjoyed both story lines.The special effects were really great. There was a huge robot, superfast motorcycle bots as well as bizarre flying and underwater robot creatures. They were well conceived of and a lot of fun to watch. We even got to see Arnold Schwarzenegger again - even though it was all CGI. That was nostalgically cool.For all the negative critical sentiments there seem to be, I think this movie is a fine way to spend 2 hours. It has great effects, a good story and a conclusion to the Terminator movies. Who'd want to miss that? I recommend seeing it.",Null,11,21,31 May 2009

Juno," I didn't 'get' it ...
","I must be one of the few folks that really didn't get much from this film. I watched it because of the strong reviews. I kept waiting for it to get better. All I saw was a highly unlikeable teenage girl ... who doesn't really transform or learn to be a better person. She's kind of a dark goth witch that gets unexpectedly pregnant.The only interesting and watchable characters were the somewhat strange couple that were intent on adopting the baby. At least with them, there was a feeling of mystery: it seemed like just below their happy exteriors, some dark secret was lurking.As far as being a comedy, I never laughed once during the movie. The closest this comes to a comedy is that of a 'black comedy'. For the most part, it's more like a depressing drama. But heck, clearly a lot of people liked this movie. I'd recommend watching the first 10 minutes - if you like it, you're in for a treat. If you don't like it, it won't get any better.",Null,10,23,18 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Confusing plot ... but still lavish
","This movie has problems, but because 'something is always happening' and almost every segment is visually stunning, it's one of the rare times that I can say the movie is both a mess and kind of amazing.This movie is the third in the series of 'Pirates' movies and it's the type of sequel that relies heavily on information gained from the previous movies. In this final installment, there are two tasks that the 'sort of' good guys must tackle: rescue the pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from 'Davy Jones Locker' and fight the powerful British East India Trading Company (who are controlling the seas and forcing the Pirates out).I wish I had understood the above basic elements of the plot while actually watching the movie. It was really hard to understand what was going on and 'why'. I saw the previous two movies, but couldn't remember all the intricacies of what happened - nor remember the names of so many people and things that were referenced in this movie.However, like a ride at Disneyland, you can have a good time even if you don't quite get the background context. While much of the plot was confusing, the numerous little sub-plots were a little easier to understand - and a lot of fun to watch. There was never a still moment in the movie and many of the scenes were visually spectacular.If you're a big fan of the previous movies with a strong memory - you'll definitely get more out of it than the rest of us. For everyone else, don't try too hard to understand the 'big picture' -- just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Null,1,3,15 June 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," Fantastic Stuff - but a little short on story ...
","There is nothing that I didn't like about this movie except that it didn't feel like a complete story - more like a small part of a larger story. Outside of that, the visuals were great, the characters were interesting and the action was non-stop.Here's the setup of the Resident Evil movies: Resident Evil: A virus that transforms people into zombies is released in an underground research facility and infects the workers.Resident Evil: Apocalypse: The virus has now escaped and infected the inhabitants of the city above the research facility.Resident Evil: Extinction: The virus has now escaped the city and infected the world.Furthermore, the somewhat amoral corporation (the same one responsible for the virus in the first place) is working on a cure. The key lies in getting the original blood of Milla Jovovich's character ... and the story progresses from there.While the setup sounds interesting, the actual story told is too short. Too much time is spent on human vs. zombie fights. While they are well done, the plot doesn't get time to advance much ... and doesn't.It's too bad, because the visuals effects, characters and pacing are really well done. In fact, the visuals of the decaying desert-like surface juxtaposed with the few high-tech underground facilities left in the world are particularly interesting to watch. All of these aspects deserve a much more significant story.But it is what it is ... and it's still worth watching for anyone who really likes the previous Resident Evil movies.

Cloverfield," Edge-of-your-seat entertainment ...
","Beyond being a sci-fi movie, I had no idea what this movie was about. Well, after a lengthy character buildup (which was pretty good), the sci-fi, action and thrills kicked in. It was great - suspense and mystery all the way through. It's been a while since I've gasped at stuff on-screen, so I consider this a job well done.The movie starts with a lengthy party where we get introduced to the main characters and get a bit of their personalities and background. Everything is interrupted when a disaster seems to be occurring in the city's center. Unfortunately, the love interest of one of main characters is located there - and he, along with a few others, set out to reach her.I'm being purposefully vague because the less you know about this movie, the more you'll enjoy it.

","I liked this movie - it held my attention from start to finish. From the ad material I saw, I didn't think I'd like it very much - seen it all before - thought the most it would be is simply 'above average'. However, it was so well done that I'll remember the movie for a while. It is intense all the way through. The dialog is smart, witty and biting. The performances are unusually strong and believable. Usually it takes a little while for me to become interested in main characters, but in this case it was almost instant (and there are many main characters). Kudos to the directors, screenwriters, actors and others responsible for the movie - great end result.",Null,0,3,9 August 2006
Knocked Up," Clever Writing ....
","Although the subject matter wasn't really appealing to me, the critics and general audience reviews are right: this is a very well made movie. The acting is great, the plot fast-paced, the characters believable and the dialog witty and clever. It reminds me of Superbad - another movie that I would never normally see, but one which wins you over by it's sheer (albeit crude) brilliance.The basic premise is simple: a young TV reporter celebrates a promotion by getting drunk and inadvertently pregnant. The father-to-be is a good natured, pot-head slacker who has no money. When she decides to have the baby, she's not sure what her relationship with the father should be... and the movie progresses from there.It's a simple plot but the dialog is what makes this movie shine. No matter the scene, it was always fun to hear what the characters were going to say. Even though most of them were one-dimensional, the dialog made them seem human and easy to relate to. A fast-movie plot also kept the movie moving along - something was always happening and there was never a dull moment.While there is a certain level of crudity throughout, the movie is generally lighthearted and innocent. It's a fun movie to see.",Null,45,62,21 December 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," See it on the big-screen ... didn't quite work for me over the TV.
","Given the high ratings of this movie, I'm clearly in the minority of people who didn't quite 'get' this film. It's well produced, directed, acted and darkly styled. So - I'd venture to say this a pretty good movie for most moviegoers.But somehow, watching on the small screen with lots of singing - well, it just didn't grab my attention. I remember the huge difference in watching 'Singin' in the Rain' on TV (unwatchable) and then later seeing it in on a big screen with an audience (wow!) ... and maybe this is the same phenomenon.While it's clear that the movie is full of intensity, emotion and style - maybe something is lost when you see in normal definition TV. On that basis, I'd say this film is probably best experienced in a movie theater with an audience.",Null,1,1,15 February 2009
Blades of Glory," Nice .... OK ...
","The best way to describe this movie is 'light'. It's fairly innocent, filled with low-key humor and has a simple plot. If it strongly appeals to any audience, it would probably rank highest with very young teenagers. That said, the movie does have a slightly redeeming quality: the first 15 minutes are actually really good - if you're going to watch anything, see that much.Basically, the story is about two competitive male ice skaters who, because of excessive bickering (that turns physical), get kicked out of their sport. However, they soon learn that they are still eligible to compete in 'doubles' ... and that they are the perfect (any only viable) partners for each other. It's anything but smooth sailing! While the two lead actors (Ferrell and Heder) do a reasonably good job, the material they have is only a bit above average. It's good, but not quite past the threshold needed for a string of real laughs.Storywise, it's pretty simple. Team up ... attempt to overcome obstacles ... compete in big event for the 'gold medal'. The events and cameos by major ice-skating superstars (Brian Boitano, Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming) make the movie mildly amusing, but it never really takes off.As mentioned above, the first 15 minutes are the best part of the whole movie; if you're going to watch anything, see that much. The rest of the movie is mediocre.",Null,0,0,20 May 2008

","The best thing about this movie is its innocence and lightheartedness. There's nothing really offensive or distracting; it's simply an easy-going, pleasant, slightly above average movie. And yes, it's a little bit funny.The story is loosely based on a real person: Mexican priest Fray Tormenta. In the movie, we follow the main character (Jack Black) as he becomes a wrestler to support an orphanage (much like the real person).The priest actually becomes part of a two person wrestling team and we watch as they delve into matches that they are poorly prepared for. The scenery/sets, characters and story are decently good and pleasant to watch.Because there's nothing particularly great about it, I can't really recommend watching this movie. However, if you do, you will probably feel like it wasn't such a bad way to spend 90 minutes.",Null,1,2,24 January 2008

While Gould's character is recovering from a heart attack caused by the swindle, the Ocean gang is planning to break the bank on the hotelier's new, ultra-modern, secure hotel.If you enjoy elaborate and exotic methods - plans within plans - clever bait and switches ... this movie is for you.

We Are Marshall," Good Premise, But A Bit Too Slow ...
","I was surprised how hard it was to watch this movie. The premise was better than most sports movies, but somehow this movie's characters were not interesting enough to keep me engaged in the story.The movie is about a new coach that must rebuild a small University's football team after they are killed in a plane crash. He sets out to recruit and start the team anew amidst a grief-stricken town.One problem with the movie is that everyone is often moping around and we don't really know who they are (in terms of character development) so it's not really that effective or interesting. Matthew McConaughey usually puts in an engaging performance, but here his character across as someone with ADD and a flippant attitude. Given that he's a core character, that's not good.I realize that many people liked this movie, so I suggest that if this movie intrigues you, watch the first 30 minutes. If you find it slow and the characters uninteresting, quit while you're ahead - otherwise, enjoy the show.",Null,2,4,12 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Has all the right elements ... but falls short each time
","If you were to take a step back and think about all the different plot sequences (short events), they look good on the surface: fast-paced action, good dialog, humor, characters from previous movies, lots of cool worlds and great F/X.Furthermore, if you look at the big-picture story ... it's quite acceptable for a Star Wars story.So what went wrong? For me, the plot-sequences are not well-thought out and there too many of them for the movie's runtime. Many of the sequences have highly-convenient endings (like someone always swoops down at the last moment to avert disaster). You can almost count on that happening each an every time. It's a cop-out formula that's overused.Furthermore, the big 'reveals' were easy to guess. I'm usually terrible at guessing what happens next, but here it seemed obvious. They'd pose a question in a leading way, for example when raising the question of Rey's birth, pause for a long time ... and ... it's not that hard to put 2 and 2 together. It's like a spoiler during the movie.Secondly, the movie needs to be longer or have fewer plot sequences. The sequence endings seemed rushed and not well integrated with the film itself. If they had a bit more time to edit the movie and catch these kinds of problems, the result could have been very different.But without a doubt ... this is one of those movies you 'have' to see sooner or later because it involves the completion of the culturally iconic Star Wars story.",Null,54,133,23 December 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," Good character-driven movie ...
","I must admit, it took watching the beginning of this movie 3 times before I got interested enough to follow through to the end. Once I finally realized it was not really a comedy, the movie started to work for me.Generally stated, the story is about a recent college grad who lands a job as assistant to the head of a top fashion magazine. The funny things is, this isn't her field and her values are at odds with everything about her new job.If you think the plot sounds familiar, it is - it's been done a million times. Plus - the characters are fairly simplistic and one-dimensional.So what's so good about the movie? First, the performances for each of the characters are near perfect. They become very 'watchable' - you want to see what they are going to do next and what's going to happen to them.The second thing that really intrigued me were the bits of information about the fashion industry - they were very nicely integrated into exchanges between the characters. If anything, you'll get a feel for how ego, tension and subjectivity can play out in a fashion magazine.As long as you know that this is really a drama (or black comedy without much comedy), you can enjoy this movie from the start.",Null,0,1,27 July 2007
Notting Hill," Funny and Touching ...
","This movie is almost entirely character driven and it is great. It's very funny, positive and enjoyable. The story is very simple - classic boy meets girl (or vice-versa) scenario. However, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts' outstanding performances propel this movie to greatness.Hugh Grant delivers one of his best 'average, humble' guy performances in this movie. Many of his lines were some of the most witty and clever dialog I've heard in a while. Almost reminds me of how Jimmy Stewart could mumble lines and come off as brilliant.Julia Roberts was sparkling as a somewhat forward but grounded movie star that one could relate to. It was pleasant to see lots of big smiles from Julia.The other characters were literally 'characters' - bizarre, off-beat, odd-ball, goofy - but at heart warm and enjoyable to watch.If you're in the mood for a good laugh and pleasant movie-going experience, this is a great movie to watch.",Null,8,9,26 October 2006
Watchmen," See it in IMAX...
","I never heard of the 'Watchmen' before seeing the movie trailer. In fact, after seeing it, I thought that this would be like more like the Fantastic 4 (which wasn't one of my favorite movies) than Dark Knight.However, the critics and user ratings are right - this is an amazing movie - if you see it in IMAX. This is how I saw it. I seem to have had a very different experience than many of my friends who saw it on normal sized screens. The IMAX rendition is so striking (both visually and audibly) that any problems in storytelling are shunted into the background. As such, I strongly recommend making the effort to see it on the huge screen if you have that option.That said, it was well-acted, visually stunning and the pop-art references are fantastic. It is 2hours and 40 minutes long - and, in huge screen mode, just about every darn minute there was something amazing to look at.It's basically a mystery story about the death of superhero ... in 1985. Although in this version of 1985, the existence of superheros is a part of life (even though there are only a handful).Whatever you 'think' a superhero or comic-book movie can be like, this movie will challenge that (like Sin City did). It's not a kid's movie by any means. There is intense and graphic violence, explicit nudity and adult themes throughout. My advice is a big thumbs up if you've got an IMAX theater showing it. Since the critics and user ratings for this movie are both in positive territory, I say that indicates it's good flick no matter the screen size.",Null,2,5,22 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Best horror film of 2007
","The first 12 minutes gave me the feeling that this movie was going to be another low-brow horror/zombie movie, but then a very different story started and it was great. The plot, action, suspense and thrills worked really well. Don't let the word 'horror' give you the wrong idea though; this is simply a great movie that also happens to be a horror movie.Basically, the story starts 28 weeks after the contagious 'rage virus' has run its course in Britain. All the infected people have apparently died off and an American led NATO force is now dealing with survivors. At the same time that an amazing discovery is made, a disastrous sequence of events changes the situation for the worst ... and the story progresses from there.The things that impressed me the most were the interesting storyline and suspense. As the movie went on, I become increasingly engaged in the movie and found it hard to stop watching.While the actors were reasonably good, it took some time to get interested in their characters. A big reason for this is that you don't really get a lot of time with the lead characters in the beginning. As time goes on, they start to grow on you.This is not a movie for kids, nor is it a movie for those who don't like horror movies. However, for everyone else, it's definitely worth watching.",Null,0,0,22 May 2008

","The movie is loosely based on the true-life successes of the MIT Blackjack Team during the early 90s. In large part though, the characters and plot are generally fictional - but who cares - it's fun to watch! The lead character is interesting and because it's told like it's a true account of an amazing experience - it's pretty suspenseful.The movie is about a gifted MIT student who joins a 'secret' blackjack team that is run by a math professor. As his only option to pay for enrolling at Harvard Medical School the following year, he reluctantly engages in 'legally', yet covertly, scamming a number of Las Vegas casinos. He learns that it's a dangerous game though - not just because of the casino watchdogs, but the professor too! If the above plot line sounds interesting, then you'll likely enjoy watching the movie. There's tension, suspense, romance, guilt, big bucks and nasty thugs - all the makings of a fun way to spend 2 hours. Definitely recommended.",Null,0,2,4 March 2009

They are crossing the desert and get stranded out in 'the middle of nowhere'.If this sounds like a typical setup - it is, but it is done very, very well. These are characters that are interesting and 'real' - they are easy to relate to and interesting. The first half of the movie revolves mostly around them and this buildup is very well done.

American Psycho," Has good and bad points ...
","I didn't read the book so I'm just reacting to the movie as I saw it. The beginning of the movie was pretty good, but as it wore on, the novelty of the interesting characters gave way to a story that wasn't quite as engaging.The movie is about a 27 year old wealthy investment banker. His life seems built on life's excesses and peer status - a typical upscale Manhattan yuppie in the 1980s. But he anything but typical: we learn he has a very dark side ... as a sadistic killer.What was really fascinating to watch was his (and his friends') petty 'yuppie' mannerisms and lifestyle. Their superficiality was very well done. A scene involving 'who has the better business card' was amazing to watch.However, the movie came up a little short in the second half. It is focused on his dark side. It was presented so as to be abrupt, sadistic, and shocking. However, it didn't quite come off as intense as intended. Maybe in 2000 it may have been more effective, but it wasn't too surprising to see a person with a normal side coexisting with a secret killer/crazy side.It seems that this movie appeals to people who have read the book - so if that's you, you'll probably want to see this. For everyone else, it's not really worth the 100+ minute investment.",Null,1,3,7 April 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Good, unusual movie ...
","I really didn't know what this movie was about beyond that it had something to do with child beauty pageants. Very quickly the movie with its unusual characters grew on me and I was anxious to see where it would end up.The movie is basically about a family driving their daughter to a regional kiddie beauty contest - it's a real long drive and the family members (grandfather and uncle included) are all dysfunctional. It's anything but smooth driving! This movie is more drama than comedy. There are lots of amusing moments throughout the movie, but they are all against the backdrop of disconcerting family situations and pent-up emotions. The mix of the two is very well done. The movie is both funny and intense.Without a doubt, this is a character-driven movie and the characters are all interesting and very well acted. In fact, they are very unusual characters, but that made them all the more over-the top and interesting. Within the first 20 minutes, I realized that I was really interested in all the characters and wanted to see what would happen to them next. The all-star cast was really worth it.If you're in the mood for good humorous character-driven drama, this will fit the bill.",Null,2,4,29 July 2007
Knowing," A great story ... buried in a grossly bad movie ...
","OK, let's be honest here. As one sci-fi fan to another, I'd say 'sure, see this movie' but would add ... 'it has lots of glaring problems so be prepared.' I think you can see this 'like'/'dislike' perception being played out in the ratings. The IMDb ratings are (currently) above 7, yet the reaction from critics is very negative (Rotten Tomatoes rating < 25%).My take: There is a fun story underlying this film, but the implementation (the movie itself) is pretty bad. I rate it a '6' only because I enjoyed the story idea and the special effects.The movie is basically about an MIT professor (Nicolas Cage) who comes into possession of a 50-year old note from a time-capsule. It identifies (through numbers) all the major disasters of the last 50 years ... plus a three upcoming ones. He resolves to look deeper into the final three ... and wonders - why him, why now and what is about to happen? On the surface, the setup is very cool-sounding; something like that will always pull me into the theater. But when you watch the movie - it's kind of a train-wreck.The acting is bad, the way the reality-checks in the movie are nuts and even the film's color (or processing) is sub-standard (and I generally never notice that kind of stuff).Even with one of the most watchable on-screen presences like Nicolas Cage, the performances are almost painful to watch. The events drive this movie forward, not interest in the characters.I think the worst part of the movie is that no one did any serious 'reality-checks' in the script. For instance, the time capsule hardly looked protected - it looked like the burial hatch could could be pried open with just a couple of crowbars. A couple of kids could/should have raided that thing 2 days after it was put into the ground.Even the 'skeptical' scientific sidekick of Cage was unreal. His fellow MIT professor friend recommended that he dismiss his decoding of the numbers - even with what seemed like a 99+% positive correlation to disaster dates and death tolls. There needs to be more 'gray' area to inject believable skepticism - not go up against a 99% hit rate.Perhaps the last problem worth mentioning is timing. Everything is happening tomorrow or the day after ... literally. I'm all for tension, but the timing is just too infeasible without further and better explanation.On the positive side, the effects are fantastic. There are crashes and explosions that are among the best I've seen. The effects crew deserves an award for the intensity and thoroughness of their work: bravo!All in all, this is pretty interesting idea couched in a bad movie. I managed to maintain my fascination with the story in the midst of a lot of terrible movie-making. I would not recommend this to the average moviegoer, but to the sci-fi fan ... 'sure, see this movie, but it has lots of glaring problems so be prepared.'",Null,3,8,24 March 2009
Disturbia," 1 Good Acting Performance coupled with an Obvious Story ...
","The first half of this movie is really good because the lead actor, Shia LaBeouf, is really interesting to watch. You simply want to see what his character will do next. However, the second half of the movie brings in weak characters and an obvious plot. The quality of the movie drops off a bit.Basically, the film is about a teenager who spies on his neighbors using binoculars. It's his way of passing time since he's serving a 3 month jail sentence at home. Initially, his primary target is an attractive girl next door. However, he soon begins to suspect that his other neighbor may be linked to a missing persons case in the news.Shia LeBeouf puts in a great performance as the teenager under house-arrest. His mannerisms and dialog make his character interesting to watch. Unfortunately, when other characters enter into the foreground, they detract from the quality of the movie. The attractive girl neighbor is not quite believable - she's a little too over the top. And the suspicious neighbor is a little too obvious.Plot-wise, it's pretty average by today's standards. The movie doesn't quite deliver things you can't already guess ... and for a movie like this, that's not ideal.If you're looking for an above-average movie with a mix of good and bad elements, this is OK to watch.

If you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX - it's definitely a 'bigger' treat ... but FWIW, know this: it was 'converted' to IMAX from normal print - not created in the IMAX format.OK - that said, the movie IS worth seeing. I'd say it was somewhere between 'really good' and great. It's a fun story with fast pacing, entertaining characters and nice 3D effects.It's basically about a group of 5 likable 'monsters' that are pitted up against an alien attack. The main character is a new 'monster' - Ginormica. She's a young lady that was recently hit by a meteorite with a special composition ... one that made her grow to gigantic size.It's a fun story told in an imaginative way. The visuals are very nicely done - the backgrounds, characters and scope of detail are great. The movie also moves along at brisk pace - something that grabs your attention is always happening (this makes it work well for kids in the audience). Add to that the fun and oddball personalities of the monster characters and you have a winning combination.The 3D effects were good, although like most other mainstream animated movies - they start out strong and then get recessed into background. Still - make sure you see it in 3D! You'll be missing part of the key experience offered by the movie if you don't.All in all, this is a fun movie for adults as well as kids.

The music, story and characters were kind of interesting, but for me, not significantly so.Basically, this story of a fictional R&B girl group of the 1960s. We see their start and progression in the music industry over time. There are clear allusions to actual groups (most notably the Supremes) and the evolution of the music industry.The movie was interesting, but I'm not sure what I got out of it. There was nothing really new and the story was sometimes confusing; it jumps forward in time without any warning, and you just have to figure that out each time.Even though I think the movie was only marginally good, it clearly appealed to many other people.

","This was a good movie - not great, but good. I think the main reason for this is that I found it a little hard to identify with the lead character. He didn't seem very likable, respectable, wise or deep - any one of these would have helped. In fact, none of the characters seemed very appealing. Yet, the story and main character's experiences are generally interesting and engaging. Unlike other war movies, this one focuses on the pressures and tensions of the soldiers sent to fight a war. In this case it's for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. I found the seemingly realistic portrayal of what soldiers go through to be very interesting. This includes their dealing with feelings and doubts about relationships left behind, boredom, desire for combat, and tense interactions with others.What I ended up getting was a pretty interesting back story to a historical event.

But even if you start out with this feeling, the fast pace of the movie and great visuals will keep you distracted long enough for the movie to grow on you.The characters are so well performed (both visually and vocally) that this becomes a character movie and you start to care about what happens to the characters - rats and all.This is a movie that can appeal to everyone - kids through adults.

He is impressionable yet searching for his own answers.From this character, we see how it is possible to uncover deep understandings - not about others, but about one's own self. Watching the lead character go through this process is what makes this movie so interesting.The rest of the movie doesn't quite match the interest level of the lead character, but it is still good.

Saw III," A Sadistic Triumph ....
","This film is both well done and somewhat sadistic - so it's hard to get excited about it. There is a lot of graphic horror. Usually, horror movies are pretty ridiculous, but this one's done well enough that it's actually hard to watch.This movie picks up on the themes from the first two 'Saw' movies: people are put into positions of having to make truly horrific choices. These usually involve a person causing a permanent self-inflicted injury in order to survive - or to allow someone else survive. This last component is prevalent in Saw III.The principal cases here: a doctor is fated to save a patient ... or die with the patient, and a man is put in the position of having to save the people who were involved in his son's death.There are some twists and surprises as the story unfolds. If you can make it past the first 15 minutes of the movie, you'll survive the rest. The horror is genuinely strong, the story is reasonably engaging and the acting is decently good. If you're a extreme horror fan, this is the movie of the year to see. For everyone else, it's a little too disturbing to watch.",Null,0,0,29 March 2008

","Comedy is pretty subjective and I generally wait for comedy movies to come to DVD or TV before viewing them. However, the high critical ratings caused me to go see this one in the theaters. It was pretty darn impressive. There are several levels of humor going on and to boot, the story is actually interesting all by itself.The basics: The movie is about a group of actors who get stranded in a Vietnamese jungle while making a war movie. They find they have to fend for themselves and look for a way out. It sounds simple enough - but there's danger, a crazy studio boss, kidnapping, Tivo and more to contend with.Performance-wise, Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant. As is said in the movie, he's 'a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude.' He gets a little too deep into his role as an African-American soldier ... and he's just amazing to watch. It's hard to imagine that he's NOT actually who he's portraying. Jack Black and Tom Cruise are also fun to watch.The story is engaging and there lots of types of humor (situational, comic pop references and a variety of funny exchanges) - so this movie is pretty good bet as far as entertainment.

","I'm kind of an action / sci-fi / thriller movie enthusiast, so movies that sound family-oriented and fluffy usually don't cut it for me.Well, this one is one few exceptions. It was well-done and innovative ... and very enjoyable. About 12 minutes in, the movie switches from cartoon animation to real-life ... which is an interesting twist for a fairy-tale type movie. Amazingly, the story succeeds on pure acting and story, not on special effects.The basic setup: A princess is about to be married and become queen. However, the evil reigning queen does not want to give up her title. So, she transports the princess to another reality ... modern day New York City. But all is not lost, her prince charming and others transport there too in an effort to find her ... but not all of them want her back safe and sound.Yes, there's singing, happy flying birds and the whole nine yards ... but it all works and is somehow 'believable'. I think the latter is due to the fine acting jobs by Amy Adams (princess) and Patrick Dempsey (the lawyer she meets in New York). She's all about fantasy ideals and he's all about the real world pragmatism - and their interactions are fun to watch. If sounds simplistic, it is ... but it works.Instead of saying this movie is 'great for all members of the family', I'd like to address those who would not ordinarily see a movie like this: take a chance this one time; you'll be glad you did.",Null,0,0,27 November 2008

I think having so many characters involved watered down the movie's intensity and impact. But still, it's an amazing movie for the scope, scale and visuals that were achieved.If you get a chance to see it in 3D, do it. Some good effort was spent in making the 3D version extra spectacular and immersive. Either way, if you enjoy Marvel movies, this one's not to be missed.",Null,0,2,1 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," A rough and tough, 'beat'm up movie'.
","Words that describe this movie: gritty, tough, fast and action oriented. Bond fans differ in what makes a good Bond movie, so each individual fan will have to decide for themselves if this movie makes the grade.For my tastes, the overall movie was good. It seemed to get better as it went on. I did have some gripes (see below), but the uncompromising raw action and tone was kind of refreshing in current movie environment.The basic set up is that Bond is still filled with internal rage over the betrayal and death of his love from the previous movie ('Vesper'). He pursues those responsible without regard to human life. This becomes a problem for the British secret service as he pursues the links all the way to Bolivia, where a strange transaction is taking place.GRIPES: Some of the actions scenes were a bit too fast (editing cuts) to visually follow. Judi Dench, who I greatly admire, didn't seem to have enough makeup this time - I know it sounds strange, but if you noticed something about her forehead, you'll get what I mean.All in all though, this movie was a decent, heavy duty action movie. I'd say it's more of a 'guy's' movie than one for gals. Great on its own terms.",Null,2,5,16 November 2008
District 9," This time, we're the problem, not the aliens ...
","I liked this movie. It was definitely not a traditional sci-fi theme (like ... destroy the monster, save the world, destroy the scientific breakthrough that mankind isn't ready for). It was more of a tense sociological theme where a large number of aliens are being interned in an impoverished, restricted living zone. It kind of brings to mind 'Alien Nation' from the late 1980s.Aside from the above, this movie has several things going for it. First, the alien effects are pretty darn good - modern monster design is hard and these folks did a really good job. The pacing was good - there were no dead areas in the film where nothing is happening. There were also no big-name actors used, so the movie succeeds on Peter Jackson's association and the power of the acting, script and production - which were all good. It's also great to see that this movie only cost $30M; I hope this encourages studios to greenlight more of these movies.Now, the movie is not without a few issues. I would liked to received some more background info on the aliens and what has been learned about them. Also, a lot of the scenes were a bit formulaic, so as soon as you see the setup, you know the outcome.However, all in all, there's a lot to like here. If you're a sci-fi fan, I recommend seeing it. You'll either really like it, or at worst, think it's decent. It's the most interesting offbeat alien scifi movie in a while and we'll probably see a sequel in the not too distant future.",Null,1,5,17 August 2009
Toy Story 4," Enjoyable Story with Cool New Characters
","Kudos to the new writers for coming up with a charming new story to tell. It's definitely got its moments.On the plus side, it was interesting to see some interesting new characters like Forky, Gabby Gabby, the Benson puppets (Gabby Gabby's spooky henchmen!) and especially toy motorcyclist Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves). Even Bo Peep, while present in Toy Story 1 and 2, is nicely re-freshed. This was a good move to prevent audience fatigue with existing cast -- it worked.However, the stakes in the story are somewhat mild. There's no big catastrophe or catharsis involved. As such, it can't go as emotionally deep as its predecessors. Still it's really good - but just short of great.",Null,27,50,22 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A meandering masterpiece ... I didn't want it to end
","This is such an unusual movie. It doesn't really have a plot ... it's kind of like a 'day in the life of a fading Hollywood TV actor', but still it's just fascinating to watch. The acting, cinematography and production values for capturing the late 60s (and really ... dawn of the 70s) are about as good as you'll ever see. It's just art.And when it comes the ending ... wow. Especially if you know a bit of history. It's intense and amazing and I'll just leave it at that.That said, it is a little male-biased by modern standards, but it's capturing the mentality of a different time period. DiCaprio and Pitt play two wildly different characters that you just want to keep watching to see they do next. They will quite possibly win Oscars for their performances -- and Tarantino will no doubt be up for best director, best original screenplay and best film.If you enjoy Tarantino's moviemaking style - the dialog, the visuals, the period details and, yes ... the violence ... this is a must see. It's almost 2 and 3/4 hours - but I would have gladly stayed longer.BTW, if you stay a minute into the end-credits, there's a post credit scene followed by a fun radio (audio-only) contest commercial.",Null,329,567,28 July 2019

Will Smith did a great job as the genie and really gave the movie some personality.It's not without problems. There's predictable (clichÃ©d) dialog and some dance & action sequences that are awkwardly sped up. However, they're not enough to ruin the movie.The sheer imaginative scope of world that is created is so fantastical that I want to see more stories in this reality.

Ghost Rider," Better than it looks ...
","Although I can't really recommend watching this movie, it was a lot better than I thought. I generally like sci-fi/fantasy/monster movies, but this looked ridiculous. Well, it wasn't ridiculous, but it wasn't that great either.Basically, this is about a motorcycle stuntman who inadvertently sells his soul to the devil to help his ailing father. When he learns he got a bad deal, it's too late ... but he is then given a mission which could free him.The movie was much better than it looked in the trailers. However, the result was still not that great. Part of it may be that the idea of a supernatural motorcycle superhero may have been appealing in the 70s, but it doesn't seem very potent today. Other than that, the story is only mildly engaging. It could have been worst, so this is not such a bad result.This movie is not really worth seeing unless you're a fan of this comic book character.",Null,2,4,26 December 2007

Strangely, trying to make the animals so photo-realistic and life-like worked against the movie - esp. when they talked. If the animals were human actors - they'd be criticized to no end for acting like zombies. Soul-less.",Null,3,5,27 July 2019
The Mist," Sci-Fi/Horror Done Right!
","From within the first few minutes I was hooked through to the end. It's been a while since there's been a really good sci-fi/horror combo - and here it is - from Stephen King, no less...A mysterious mist shows up in a remote town, lots of military vehicles are seen speeding past, and shoppers in the town's grocery store become trapped when they realize that venturing into the mist is perilous. As the situation unfolds, fear begins to overtake logic.One thing I also really liked was that I didn't feel cheated with a minimal ending - so this was a big plus for me. However, the one thing that took away from the movie was the prolonged stupidity of the characters in the face of danger. It wasn't really believable. But the movie was so good in other respects, I let this aspect slide a bit.In general, this is a great movie to watch. Stephen King fans, sci-fi/horror fans and those that like thrills and suspense ... this is for you.",Null,1,3,28 March 2008
I Am Legend," Sci-fi with a different plot than typical ...
","A lot of science fiction is based on very familiar, simplistic plots. It was nice to see a sci-fi movie with a story in which you didn't know what was going to happen next.The movie is basically about a man in New York whose immunity spared him from suffering the same deadly fate as the rest of human civilization. Every day is a struggle to survive and things are getting worst.The movie hinges on the central character and Will Smith was a great choice for the role. The character, even with some flaws, is pretty interesting to watch. He has to battle with the terrors of the current environment and the painful memories of the past.Although there are things I can squabble with, the movie was good enough to make those problems seem relatively minor. I really liked the fact that I got to see a story in which I didn't know where it was going. The story was really good and sci-fi fans will be pleased.

Dog Day Afternoon," Still Great after 30 years ...
","I saw this film in 2007 - more than 30 years after it was released. Great movies seems to stand the test of time because even a generation later, it can still engage the viewer.This story is inspired by a real bank robbery event in 1972 perpetrated by John Wojtowicz ('Sonny') and Sal Natural ('Sal'). It is a bizarre tale with lots of black humor.Al Pacino, John Cazale, Charles Durning, James Broderick, the women hostages and even Lance Henrikson all do a great job in this movie. Great performances seem to last through time just like great stories. Everyone was interesting to watch. I didn't even realize the movie didn't have any music until later.It's easy to recommend this movie. Even though it's from another time, it's still fun to watch and all of the diverse characters will keep you engaged.",Null,1,2,25 December 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A movie for kids ...
","Unless one is a Fantastic 4 comic book fan, parent with their kid or simply a young kid, it wouldn't be fair to recommend this movie. It's visually colorful, innocent and has good special effects, but that's about it. The dialog, script and humor are a bit brainless - kind of what you might find on a TV show aimed at children.The movie is basically about an alien entity (a humanoid form on a surfboard) that comes to earth and leaves destruction where ever it goes. The lead scientist of the Fantastic 4 is called in by the government to find the alien ... but soon all 4 are involved in the endeavor.It's kind of fun to watch the visuals, but there's no way to take the movie seriously. It's really aimed at a child mentality. If you choose to see this, just be prepared be a bit lax on your standards.",Null,1,3,10 May 2008
Transformers," A movie about teens ... and for teens ...
","I'm a big sci-fi movie fan, so this was a must-see movie. However, the cartoon-like effects and 'everybody is a teenager' cast was a little too much for me. This was an excellent idea for a movie, but ended up being more like a 2.5 hour Saturday morning cartoon.The movie has a fantastic storyline. It's basically about alien robots that are at war with each other and are simultaneously searching for a lost artifact of their civilization. How cool is that? Unfortunately, it wasn't executed very well. Aside from minor plot-hole issues and endless brand-name product placement (more than I've ever seen in any movie), there were two main problems.First, all the critical roles are teenagers. Literally. I'm not just talking about the actors, but rather the literal ages of the characters in the movie. The top code-crackers at the Dept. of Defense are teenagers ... the critical characters calling the shots for all of mankind are teenagers ... the Transformers all prefer to communicate with teenagers. You get the picture. Sorry - it's just a little too crazy.Secondly, the effects were not very good. Much of the time, the Transformer scenes looked like cartoons. I would have gladly settled for fewer, but more realistic, special effects. I was willing to let it go in the beginning, but then the cartoon effects became so common-place that it became really annoying.If you're in the teenage demographic and a very forgiving sci-fi fan, you may really like this movie. For everyone else, this may end up being a let-down. Keep your expectations minimal.",Null,10,20,13 July 2007
Children of Men," A Chase Movie ...
","This was a good, fast-paced 'on-the-run'-type movie. If you're looking for strong sci-fi cinema aspects like special effects, exotic sceneries, etc., you won't really get it here - but that's OK as long as you know that up front.The movie: we are basically given a small group of people on the run. They are trying to get to a certain destination for a particular reason. - and that is the core of the movie.If that sounds a bit dry, the movie does have its perks. First, the characters are ethnically diverse and well acted. It's interesting to see such ethnic diversity on screen at once - it's kind of unusual given movies up to this point. As far as performances, Clive Owen turns in his usual intense performance and is extremely watchable. The other central characters seem to fade in the background when compared to Owen. Still, they do a pretty good job.Action? This movie is all about action - the main group is always on the move and the enemy and explosions aren't far behind. There's not a whole lot of intelligence behind all the chasing and running, but the sequences are well-paced, energetic, and often punch out a few good surprises.This movie felt most like a war movie that takes place in a third-world country. Most of the movie was set to hippie-acid rock music which can be a bit annoying if that style doesn't appeal to you. Also, unless you knew the premise, you'd never guess it was sci-fi.If you want to see a good chase flick with a war-like setting - this movie is for you. Sci-fi fans should be aware that this is conceptual sci-fi and be ready for an action movie.",Null,1,3,10 January 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy," Simply a fun movie to watch
","Different people will probably come away with different reasons about why this film is enjoyable: lots of aliens / monsters / spaceships, outcasts bonding together, tons of action and explosions, fast moving story, likable comedic characters, cool 70s pop/rock music, etc. For me, it was the spectacular scenery - wow ... some of it was just breathtaking to watch. The planetary landscapes and outer space visuals were especially rich and attractive. Even the animation was amazing. Rocket (racoon-like creature) is tough work for any team of animators - but he just looked 'alive' and real like all the other characters. Plus, many of the scenes featured numerous complex ships, creatures and environments with enough detail and independent movement that the universe felt believably teeming with life. Though it might have minor weaknesses here and there - it'd be misleading to dwell on any of them and not give a fellow moviegoer the highest recommendation for good summertime scifi fun.",Null,2,7,5 August 2014
World Trade Center," A little too long ...
","I have watched true-story disaster survival stories on the Discovery / Nat. Geo. channels and am familiar with many of the amazing acts of heroism surrounding 9/11 event. A wonderful aspect of this movie is about showing America at its best after such a horrible tragedy. This being said however, the movie just didn't work for me.Many of the scenes involving the family seemed unnecessarily stretched out. Horrific as the situations involving the main characters were, their scenes seemed a bit repetitive and again, drawn out. This movie was more 'situational' - not much happened in this movie as far as action. The disaster effects were pretty minimal. I was surprised that the whole movie seemed to have a low-budget feel - a surprise given the talent involved.I did like seeing their reproduction of the ground-level area of one of the WTC buildings. Seeing the shops and modern structures gave me a greater insight / feel of what it was like to actually be there. Also amazing was to see what was going on in the lobby/ground level. It almost seemed like a 'safe zone' for those coming from above. I also liked learning of the determination and 'can-do' attitude of the US Marines character.Overall, I think this movie could have been made much better. It's a tough one though - sensitive subject matter, so perhaps it ended up being what it was due to an over-focus on just one situation at the cost of avoiding everything else. I recommend seeing documentary versions of the 9/11 survivor stories instead.",Null,1,6,13 August 2006
The Dark Knight," You could hear a pin drop in the audience ... and it was packed.
","The first thing I want to say is that this movie is lengthy, so after you see it, you will probably forget how many things actually transpired in it. However, if you see various clips afterward, it's easy to get a deeper appreciation of how much effort was put into the film.One thing I won't soon forget is how I had to buy my ticket a day in advance for an IMAX showing. It was almost a full week after it opened - and it was a weekday during work hours ... and the show was still sold out. When the movie started, there were several generations of moviegoers in the audience and everyone was dead-quiet silent and focused on the movie - including me.THE MOVIE: Even though I wouldn't call it 'perfect' (you can find things to squabble with), overall it was great.The strengths are the story, characters, visuals and special effects. The basic setup is that a new criminal surfaces in Gotham City. He is a menace not only to the local authorities, but also to the well-established mob families operating in city. Eventually, he cracks a deal with the mob to get rid of Batman ... but this is only the beginning of this incredible story.One best things about the movie is that is has time to develop a complex storyline and intense characters. It's an hour longer than most movies (2 1/2 vs. 1 1/2 hours) and as a result, a lot of things happen (with well-done twists) and you really get a well-rounded, sophisticated story. In fact, one of the best things about the movie are the thought-provoking ideas that it leaves you with.The characters and performances are also really well done across the board. However, Heath Ledger's (the Joker) performance was mesmerizing. His character wasn't ridiculous (as most comic book enemies are), but fascinating, believable and ever-so engrossing. Even though Christian Bale had the title role, his performance couldn't quite eclipse Ledger's.The visuals in the movie were spectacular. The city of Gotham was finally made to like a real major city and the wide-angle cityscape shots were beautifully done. The scenes with Batman on top of high skyscrapers and the inner city details were also great. But again, Ledger was stunning in the role: the scenes of the hunched Joker walking through the streets at night, or of him with his upper torso crazily flailing outside of the policecar window are powerful.And special effects ... well, aside from the cool 'Bat' vehicles and extremely well-constructed explosions, some of the best effects are unexpected ones - such as some the jumps Batman does and unexpected ways he crafts his escapes (I won't spoil any of those).In short - don't miss this. See it in a theater and see it before you start hearing/seeing too much about it in the media or from others. This is one of the best values you will ever get for price of a movie ticket.",Null,3,7,24 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Basically - two long golf games ...
","This was a nice movie. Basically it consists of watching a couple of long golf games. Shia LaBeouf and Josh Flitter (who comes in later in the movie) are a likable team and are fun to watch as they are up against some very high-end players.There is some character development/background but most of the movie consists of watching golf play. It is very similar to watching a boxing movie - you just sort of sit and watch them do their thing and compete for a while. It's kind of interesting but not for everyone.One interesting aspect of the movie was the graphic depiction of how stress and pressure was affecting the players' minds. I haven't seen this done very often in sports movies so it was a nice touch.If you're a Shia fan or golf enthusiast, this movie would probably be of interest. Not for everyone.",Null,3,7,3 November 2006

","This movie still packs a punch 40+ years after it was released. Even though society and culture have changed quite a bit, the scenes of a young ('first-timer') college graduate being seduced by a family friend twice his age posses an intensity that seems timeless.Dustin Hoffman plays the bright and conflicted college grad who is almost forcibly propositioned by Anne Bancroft's character. Both do a fantastic acting job; but I'd have to say that for me, the potency of Bancroft's performance surpasses the rest and gives the movie its edge. Add to that the brilliant folk/mood music by Simon and Garfunkel and you have a movie that gives you a wild emotional ride over it's 105 minute runtime.To get the full dramatic and emotional effect of this movie, see it when you're not distracted and can devote your full attention to it. It's definitely worth the time.",Null,0,0,8 July 2008
Singin' in the Rain," Great Movie ... Needs to be seen on a big screen!
","Watching this on small TV is hard; I tried many times but was distracted away by other programs. However, when I saw it on a large screen with a group of people ... wow! It was pretty awesome. Suddenly what seemed like a corny old musical for a different generation became lively, engrossing, fun and kind of magical.The overall story is about a film studio in 1927 that is in trouble because their big new film, their first 'talkie' (sound) movie, sounds terrible. Their biggest problem is that the star actress (from silent pictures) has a voice that's pretty painful to hear. However, they find an innovative way to solve the problem ... but it's not without its own problems! At the heart of the movie is a romance between the studio's lead actor (Gene Kelly) and a new actress (Debbie Reynolds). It's complicated by quite a few things, but like the rest of the film, it's lighthearted and funny. I'm not really a fan of musicals or dance movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed both in this movie. The music is tuneful and is kind of a substitute for talking and self-expression; it's not done just to insert singing.As for the dancing ... well, I never appreciated Gene Kelly's remarkable physical prowess until I saw this movie. As mentioned earlier, one really should see this movie on a large screen to appreciate how intense his and his sidekick (the character Cosmo) physical movements are. Their dancing was spectacular and fun to watch. Like the singing, it was also nicely integrated into the movie.This movie was a lot of fun to watch and should appeal to just about everyone. If you're in the mood for an innocent, fun, romantic comedy with lots of music ... and can get yourself past any stereotypes you might have about this film ... you'll be richly reward with a great experience.",Null,0,1,17 June 2008

","Anthony Hopkins is easy and pleasant to watch in this movie. However, it takes a take a while for the story to start building interest. It's mostly a lot of talking and the movie proceeds at its own slow pace.The story is inspired by the real person 'Burt Munro'. The movie is about a 67 year old, generally-poor motorcycle rider in late 1950s New Zealand. He wants to set a speed record with his old, streamlined Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The story is about his journey to get to the Flats.The movie focuses on his charming personality and interactions with people. However, it is slow and is not really clear (during the movie) whether he is trying to set a personal record or a world record. He is in fact trying to set a world record that for 'sub 1000cc' motorcycles. It would have been helpful to know this during the movie, as well as what point the record would be broken. Things were happening in the movie - and I didn't know what to make of them because there was not enough information.If you're looking for an action/adventure movie about breaking speed records, look elsewhere. However, if you are interested in a decent character drama with a pleasant cast of characters and don't care about understanding the 'speed record' aspect, this could be a decent choice.",Null,1,1,13 January 2008

","There are three things you should know about this movie: (1) See it in the theater in 3D if you can (and IMAX 3D if you have the opportunity) (2) DO NOT BE LATE - there were no previews at my showing, so folks who were in the concession stands when the lights went down missed the beginning of the movie and (3) be ready for a long movie - it's 2:40 minutes.OK - I'll make this quick. Avatar is definitely worth seeing, but the greatest enjoyment you'll get from seeing it is from experiencing the fantasy world of 'Pandora' - not from traditional movie elements like performances, plot, dialog, themes, etc. Of course, those are all there and they are very well done, it's just that they're not what makes this movie great.Being exposed to a spectacular alien landscape with vivid colors, 3-dimensional perspective, fantastical creatures big and small, intricately detailed imagery and exotic locations is a large part of what this movie is all about.If the visuals of the movie were any less strong or the acting/script/etc. were not strong enough to support the world Cameron created, the movie could easily have been a disaster.I strongly recommend watching this in the theater because after watching the previews on TV, you're definitely going to lose a lot of the ambiance and atmosphere by watching it on a small screen. I plan to see it in the theater again.",Null,2,5,23 December 2009
Grindhouse," Brilliant ... but a little Boring
","This movie brilliantly spoofs the cheesy horror/revenge/action movies of the 1970s. The number and quality of stylisms they recreate is dazzling. However, the movie is almost too true to form in that it just wasn't very compelling to watch.Basically, the film consists of two, separate 90 minute movies. It is presented in a style reminiscent of double-feature low-budget exploitation-action films of 1970s. It is shown with fictional 'previews' of upcoming attractions and even the look of faded and scarred film.The first movie deals with an alien/zombie fest while the second involves a crazed stuntman who assaults people using his car.The effort the filmmakers made to fill the movie with numerous old-style movie clichés is amazing. Without a doubt, they are fun to watch. However, they cannot make up for uninteresting storytelling. Neither story was compelling - either in plot or characters. I was never once curious about what was going to happen next or who was going to live or die. That's not good.Maybe the makers of this film went too far with emulating the dull movies they were spoofing; we're faced with 3+ hours of dull storytelling. If you're pop-culture fan of the '70s, this is definitely worth watching. For everyone else, the best way to see it is through snippets.",Null,0,1,5 April 2008

","'Saw' was better than I expected. From the name and the genre, I was expecting something akin to 'House of 1000 corpses' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. I found 'Saw' to be a step above these movies. It had an interesting intellectual component that left one guessing about a central mystery. (This mystery involved how the characters got into, and will get out of, their predicament.) I found the performances, dialog and character decisions to be believable - which is unusual for this genre. I was also surprised to see that there were some fairly well-known actors in the movie such as Danny Glover and Dina Meyer. I was impressed with the quality of movie that was created given a limited budget. Although a definite step above most horror movies, I wouldn't recommend the movie to the average viewer unless one likes the Horror genre.

Up," Good movie; wouldn't call it great though (but you can, that's fine!).
","Perhaps the best part of this movie was the beginning, but after that, it was really more like a long kid's cartoon. Sorry - I know lots of people (including critics) love this film, but I'm just calling it as I saw it. There were no earth-shattering scenes that I'm replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that I will quote one day, nor mind-blowing visuals that I will tantalizingly dwell on. For me, it was just a good movie, nothing more.A lot of this movie is like Wall-E. There's a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. If you like that sort thing, great! The action-oriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great.A real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. A mysterious exotic 'creature' or something would have been far engaging. Instead, we get an ungainly, multi-colored bird that's kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoa-puffs cereal bird.3D: This movie was pretty tame in its use of 3D. It's there, but after 10 minutes, I'll it kind of fades to the background. Just a day later, I remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3D one.Soooo ... what do I recommend? I recommend seeing it! Even though I give it a 6/10, I know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average movie-goer will like it is high.What I would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it.

Invincible," Slow ... but OK
","I generally liked the movie, but it was fairly slow and listless until the second half. Then it picked up some steam - but not a whole lot.The movie is loosely based on events dealing with a bartender who answers an open call for tryouts for a professional football team.This is a somewhat unusual sports story in that a lot of details seem purposely left out - and it sticks out big time. For example, I can't remember seeing any sports movie in which the score of all the games are simply left out. It's just strange.Also - it's a bit slow and doesn't have the kind of energy / excitement level that usually accompanies such sports stories. In fact, it's pretty lackluster for the first half of the movie - then it starts to get a bit interesting for the viewer.Still, because it's 'inspired' by a real person's life, it was interesting just for see for that reason alone.If you tend to like sports movies inspired by true events, you'll probably like this movie.

The Descent," Good editing, lacking elsewhere
","I had some positive expectations for 'The Descent' but few were fulfilled.The first quarter of the movie was hard to get through. The characters were not very interesting and I never found myself favoring any of them. The 'enemy element', lets call it, was pretty mediocre. However, I do realize that it's hard to be highly original in this area and that this is not a high-budget film - so it's not bad.The quality of the picture during daylight was a bit bad and gave me the feel of poor film resolution rather than a dark tone or ambiance.Another problem I had was plausibility. I had problems with the plausibility aspect of the 'enemy element'. Usually I tend to overlook these things, but there were some strong feasibility issues here (I won't list them so as to spoil anything). Even 'The Cave' did much better job in this area.Perhaps the biggest problem I had with this movie was that it was simply a collection of surprise camera shots rather than mounting tension with the characters (like 'Alien'). Because I didn't really care for the characters, it was hard for me to feel any fear.As for what I did like - well, those surprise shots I refer to above are pretty good and unexpected (even for those who've seen a lot of these kinds of movies), so they work well. In fact, I could hear some audience members gasping / reacting to many of these moments. Also, some of the underground scenes were pretty good at setting up a claustrophobic atmosphere.Overall, there are definitely a few scares/surprises in this movie, but more was needed for me to consider it 'good'.",Null,0,2,13 August 2006
Titanic," Greatness
","This was a great movie. It's hard to see how I could improve on it. It was over budget - ambitious - and amazing.I'll start with the period scenery of the early 1900s - very nicely done. The range of dress styles and accommodations aboard the ship as they relate to class was impressive. The recreation of the Titanic was also well done. Throughout the movie the viewer gets to journey throughout this large ship and see everything from the huge engine room through first the class dining area.Also nicely done was the music (songs and music vocalizations). They integrated very nicely with the story and the idea of an ocean liner.The story - though fictional - was entertaining. Instead of creating a simple story at the time of the Titanic, Cameron gave us two - one now and one then - and linked the two nicely. There is plenty of action, romance and fun.Of course, everything in the story happens against the backdrop of one of the most famous disaster events in history. Cameron took his time depicting the tragic event and gave us a seemingly realistic insight into how events unfolded during the sinking event. The special effects were excellent.If you're in the mood for a great story and have an interest in the Titanic, definitely consider watching this movie.",Null,0,3,14 August 2006
The Happening," Saw it on video ... Was worth it.
","For those who went to the theater - sorry if it didn't work out; for the audience that will see this movie on TV through DVD and/or pay movie channels where it's not as big a deal - it's definitely a cut above generic/junk sci-fi.Plus... it's well acted, intense at times and serious throughout. Whether you do or don't like where it's going, you'll feel compelled to watch to the end.If you haven't seen the trailer, the movie is essentially about a mysterious occurrence that 'happens' in the northeast section of the US: masses of people are going into a dazed stupor ... and then killing themselves.Since it's a typical M. Night movie, the above story is what's going on in the background. In the foreground, the story is about a couple struggling through marital problems. Mark Wahlberg and Zoey Deschanel do a great job of portraying the husband and wife characters who have very different personalities.Again, if you watch the film on TV, I don't see how you can really go wrong. The demands are much lower than if you were at a theater. It's got decent acting, drama, and medium-fare sci-fi.",Null,2,5,14 December 2008
The Fountain," Stylish, Emotional and Unusual ...
","This movie was pretty different from most I've seen - but in a really good kind of way. It was emotional, visually impressive and presented in a very unique manner. It was kind of a work of art.The story is about a medical doctor/researcher whose wife is dying of a tumor. He is desperately working on finding a cure, when something else is discovered ... and the story progresses from there.Given the setup, the movie has an emotionally intense / serious tone. It is presented from three different vantage points: the core plot, a visualization of what's going on in the doctor's mind, and a visualization of a book the doctor's wife is writing.The visualizations in this movie are pretty stunning. When combined with the classical-type music the combined effect is very poetic. I will probably remember some of the haunting visuals for a long time.If you're looking for a good, serious and meditative fantasy/sci-fi movie - here it is. This is worth the time and will leave you with a lot to think about.",Null,1,2,23 January 2008
Glory Road," Started Slow - but got better and better and better ...
","This 2 hour movie is pretty lackluster for the first 50 minutes or so. Then it picks up and the intensity builds and builds right to the end. It's simply one of those great sports movie that's really well done.This is the story based on one of the most historic series of games in basketball history. A 'minor' coach hired is hired to coach an equally 'minor' Texas basketball team - but decides to do something different. He hires black players to play ... the year is 1965.Because it's based on true events it has an immediate interest value. The fact that it deals with the colorblind 'win or lose' dictum of sports coupled with racial tensions makes it all the more potentially interesting.The movie delivers the goods: great performances and a lot of sports suspense. However, you have give it chance - the first one forth of the show is kind of slow.For basketball fans and general audiences alike - this is a good movie worth checking out.",Null,15,17,4 September 2007
The Witch," I kind of liked it -- but wouldn't recommend it for the average moviegoer
","This is a well-done independent film ... but it's definitely not for everyone.Think of it like a critically acclaimed, low-budget foreign-language drama or art film ... if you'd normally go see a movie like that, then I'd recommend seeing it. Otherwise, this might not be the right movie for you.There were more than a few people who walked out on the movie in my showing - probably because they were expecting a more traditional 'hollywood' style / mass-appeal movie, not Shakespearean-like dialog in a limited 17th century setting. I'd say that's 90% of the movie.Outside of that -- I kind of liked it after I let go of my expectations. It's dark, well acted and, even if the dialog is nearly impossible to understand, quite atmospheric in terms of a period piece.It's basically about a fundamentalist religious family that starts to experience misfortune when they separate from their settlement. Mentally, they can only understand the world in terms of being sinners and that fate is the will of God --- or is due to one of the kids becoming a 'witch' by siding with Satan.Yes - there is a supernatural element going on - but don't expect to see as much as it as you'd get in a traditional horror / scare movie.Again - if good acting, atmosphere and foreign language or art-type films are something that would interest you -- then you have the right mindset and I'd say definitely it out. Everyone else -- I warned you.",Null,1,4,21 February 2016
30 Days of Night," Location makes it worthwhile ...
","The world really doesn't need another vampire movie ... but this one is pretty good anyway. While the plot is pretty basic, the acting, visuals and concept make this movie appealing.The movie is set in Barrow, Alaska - the northernmost point in the United States. The city is about to enter a yearly 30 day period where the sun doesn't rise. Unfortunately, this time there are some nasty visitors. When the sun sets, the inhabitants must hide to survive ... and the story progresses from there.The plot is pretty standard - hide and seek with the bad guys. However, the geographic isolation of the city and the 30-day period of night give the movie an interesting atmosphere. Furthermore, the characters / acting are pretty good. The characters are smart and easy to relate to.The vampires, while only a step above shrieking zombies, are very freaky-looking. Whoever was responsible for the visuals did a great job. Barrow looks pretty isolated and sparse, so it's easy to get a feeling of desolation and helplessness.If you like movies which employ a strong sense of isolation (like Alien, The Shining, The Thing), chances are you'll appreciate this movie all the more. Good characters make the movie succeed - a worthwhile watch if you're open to seeing a vampire movie.",Null,1,3,9 October 2008
Joker," Intense, dark ... and maybe even relatable
","This is not your typical comic book movie. No superpowers, superheroes or end-of-the world scenarios. In fact, there's not really any modern special effects. If the 'Joker' wasn't one of a most culturally recognizable villains, this movie may not have the wide impact it's having.However - he is a central character in the DC comic universe. This movie gives him a plausible, wildly dark and often sad origin story. This would not be the same movie without Phoenix's eccentric performance. He made it disturbing and believable. If he wins the Oscar for lead actor, it will be the second time someone won an Oscar for being the Joker (the other being Heath Ledger in 2009).The story may hit a deep note with many people who've felt disenfranchised, alienated or ignored by society or their families. For 2 hours, I felt drawn into the world and crazed reality of the main character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker). For that - I have to say it was a compelling watch.",Null,9,16,7 October 2019
The Last King of Scotland," Engaging story ... takes a little while to develop ...
","This movie provided an interesting insight into Ugandan leader, Idi Amin. It used a fictional character and storyline to show us the many sides to Amin's personality. Although not much happened in the first 2/3 of the movie, it did redeem itself with an engaging, suspenseful plot. After watching the movie, I feel I have a better sense of Amin.The story is about a young Scottish doctor who goes to Uganda to help the poor. However, through a chance encounter, he ends up becoming the personal doctor of Amin instead. His initial enchantment with Amin begins to wane as time goes on.Whitaker's performance of Amin was outstanding. I completely forgot that I was watching a famous actor and completely believed that he was Amin. McAvoy's portrayal of the young, 'speak his mind' doctor was also strong.Although this movie takes some time to develop into an engaging story, the last third of the movie was ultimately was worth the wait. In the beginning, we are mostly exposed to the introduction of characters and situations. Things are happening, but there is no goal/suspense/etc. That occurs in the last third of the movie when the doctor starts to have problems and wants to leave.If you have any interest or curiosity about the man Idi Amin, this movie delivers some insight into his character through a good story.",Null,0,1,24 November 2007

Stranger Than Fiction," A Good kind of Strange ...
","This movie has an innovative plot line and it kept me engaged until the end. I wouldn't exactly call the movie funny; I'd say the word 'endearing' is more appropriate.Basically, the movie is about a quiet, reserved man who comes to realize something very unusual is happening to him: he is hearing a voice in his head. Not just any voice though - a voice that describes what is happening to him in rich, literary detail. It sounds very much like narration ...The strongest aspect of the movie is definitely its unusual plot. How it unfolds and what happens is what keeps the movie interesting. The innocent tone gives the movie a heartfelt atmosphere. Ferrel seems perfectly cast as a mild-mannered character and Thompson seems right for the role of a neurotic writer.If you are in the mood for some light entertainment, this is a great choice.",Null,0,0,13 November 2007
Hancock," Believe the reviews ... this is not a good movie
","I like Will Smith as an actor. I like sci-fi movies. I even like the cool trailer for this movie ... so I thought this film couldn't be too bad. Well, it actually was pretty bad. Among the most annoying things were: poor visual quality, unlikeable characters and a bad story.The 'idea' behind this movie sounds great: a reckless and drunk superhero with unknown origin is inspired to turn himself around. In the process, he learns that he is not the only one of his kind in the world ... and the story progresses from there.This could have been a really original (and humorous) story. However, it falls apart very quickly. The first sign that something was wrong was the visual feel: much of the movie had kind of a dull lighting and contrast. It reminded me of movies of the 1970s. In fact, many of the outfits even had a dated look. It all felt very awkward.Another problem was that the characters are pretty annoying. It's a given that Will Smith's character should be unlikeable at the start - but the film fails to ever make him pleasant. The other main character, his 'good guy' PR agent, comes across as both intellectually challenged and wimpy as a husband, so it's hard to feel anything for him. Lastly, Charlize Theron's character is no more respectable or likable than the other two.Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is the story. It sounds good in principal, but when you see how it is fully imagined (executed), it's painful to watch. The story starts out OK but then it degenerates into a love-triangle quagmire with characters that are hard to root for. It's just not interesting.Will Smith is a very talented actor; he's generally interesting to watch no matter what movie he's in. However, with so many Will Smith fans writing scathing reviews, my advice is simple: trust them. This is a bad movie - enjoy the trailer but skip the movie.",Null,14,30,5 July 2008
Lord of War," Good across the board ...
","This movie really drew me into the main character's world and kept me engaged all the way to the end. The opening is very strong and it's easy to get hooked in right from the start.The movie is based on real life situations / events of gunrunners. It follows the life of a clever immigrant who realizes two basic needs of people: they need to eat and they need weapons. Regarding the latter, there's not a lot of competition and margins are high.Nicolas Cage gives a brilliant performance and keeps the viewer interested in the lead character and his world throughout the movie. The supporting characters also deliver excellent, intense performances.If you see this movie, you'll not only see a good movie, but you'll get an insight into the wold of international arms dealing. This is not a movie that presents material 'over the heads' of viewers like some movies that deal in world affairs - it is easily accessible, understandable and enjoyable. Definitely recommended.",Null,0,0,18 June 2007
WALL·E," Kids will love it ...
","I liked this movie, but it has a different feel from previous Pixar movies. It relies heavily on non-verbal expressiveness and visuals to tell the story - similar to the short 'cartoons' that Pixar shows at the beginning of each of its big movies. As such, those who love those animated shorts will probably enjoy this movie a lot.The movie had a very youthful feel to it so it will probably be fun for many kids. For example, there's a lot of time spent on 'cute' fumbling movements and personality quirks. There are also a fair amount of bashful attempts at affection (like secretly following the 'girl robot' around, or trying to hold her hand). And the people -- they look like fat potatoes! It's kind of amusing to watch, but I think you really have to like this style of movie to get the most from it. As for myself, it's not quite my favorite style so it didn't work well on me.The basic story is about a small robot 700 years in the future that is alone on earth. His name is 'Wall-E' and he is very slowly working to clean up a huge metropolis area that is now an abandoned wasteland. Then one day, a mysterious ship lands. A very high-tech robot, called 'EVE', comes out and begins to perform a survey for a 'classified mission' ... and the story progresses from there.I won't go into details because the plot from that point on is kind of interesting. There are also some some beautiful animation scenes, like EVE's flying survey of the metropolis and their later dual 'dance' in space. However, there weren't enough of them to make up for the kiddie-feel of this movie.At this point in time, the name 'Pixar' is strong enough to be 'the' reason that people will go to see this movie. My advice is to think about the cartoons that Pixar plays at the beginning of their movies ... if you really enjoy those, you'll probably love this movie.",Null,1,10,29 June 2008
The Good Shepherd," Huh? Too fragmented and slow ....
","This a very long movie. It's a bit confusing unless you intend to rewatch the beginning after watching the end. Then ... you can understand the beginning better. Sound confusing? It shouldn't be this hard to watch a movie. Plus, the first 2 1/4 hours of this nearly 3 hour movie is kind of boring.The movie is basically about the life of a man during the start of the CIA. We follow him from his induction into an elite fraternity (or order) into his career with the formation of the CIA.If it doesn't sound interesting, that's because that's all there really is. Unless you're a CIA history buff and are interested in this stuff, it's a bit boring for the average viewer. There is only one place where there is a real plot - and that's right at the end for about 15 minutes.Furthermore, the way the movie is chopped up and given how long it is, it's likely you'll forget the what happened at the beginning by the time you get to the end.For the average viewer, this movie isn't really worth the time. For the CIA history aficionado - knock yourself out.",Null,11,14,9 January 2008
Parasite," An odd movie ... but good
","I can't help but think that if I were Korean, I'd somehow catch more nuances and details ... and end up appreciating this movie a bit more.I kind of wish Bong Joon Ho called it something else. Since he's done several well-received sci-fi themed movies, I couldn't get it out of my head that 'maybe' a sub-plot in the movie involved sinister parasites. Nope - it's purely a metaphor. And that's still fine.I liked the movie and was interested to see how it developed. But I wouldn't say it was spine-tinglingly suspenseful, shocking or fully engrossing. There were a couple of plot twists that took the movie in new directions. However, I don't think Ho was able to fully capitalize and leverage the twists after the moment had past.The story is unusual but I didn't find myself having any thought-provoking ideas after the show was over. No doubt it still was interesting to watch the story of two families from different socioeconomic classes interact. It kept my attention throughout it's 2 hour runtime ... but I'd still call it 'good' ... not 'great'.",Null,1,5,2 November 2019
Music and Lyrics," Refreshingly pleasant ...
","Every once in a while, it's good to see a movie that's simply pleasant to watch. Yes, it is formulaic, simplistic and even a little flawed. However, the story's context of pop music and lyrics is refreshingly interesting to watch.The story centers around a largely forgotten pop icon of the 1980s. He is given an opportunity to write a song for a current teen pop star - only he can't come up with lyrics. Surprisingly, the girl who comes in to water his plants seems to have a gift for that sort of thing.Even though the songs aren't perfectly performed and Grant doesn't have as many snappy remarks as usual, this movie seems to hold it's own charm. The story and characters are fun to watch and the pop music melodies are pretty good.If you're looking for something innocent and entertaining that is not a kid's movie, this is a good choice. like about it.",Null,0,0,31 December 2007
Platoon," Well Done ...
","I liked Platoon because it was able to achieve an intenseness needed for an effective war movie - and then tell a story. A great contributor to the tone of the film was an excellent cast. Everyone had distinct and believable personalities. In fact, because they were believable, the story can be effective. We can understanding and experience the good and bad of human nature.One aspect of the movie that I really liked was lack of constant 60s music playing in the background - I think a war movie (for me) works better than infusing it with period rock music.A good indicator that a movie is working is the presence of suspense - and there was plenty of good suspense throughout this movie. Another good indicator was the presence of highly emotional scenes. Stone did a great job with some heart-wrenching scenes - shocking and horrific and all too believable. Finally, Stone put in some good surprises - great writing job.In general, if you're in the mood for a good war movie, Platoon is an excellent choice - one of the few I'd recommend.",Null,0,1,18 September 2006
The Queen," Highly Intriguing ...
","This was a great movie. I enjoyed watching a story about some mysterious real-life characters: the Queen Elizabeth, her mother and Prince Charles. I felt like I was watching a 'behind the scenes' of a major real-life event.The story is about the nonpublic actions of the royal family during the week when Princess Diana's death was announced. It depicts the amazing disconnect that occurred between the queen and the British people.Helen Mirren was great as the bewildered queen and Michael Sheen was outstanding as the Prime Minister. I have no idea if the royal family is as nutty as was portrayed, but the performances were terrific. Each member of the family had their own unique and strange behavior. Perhaps the only character depicted as sane and full of life was the new Prime Minister Tony Blair.Given that this movie only covers a weeks worth of time, it is amazing that it is able to tell an intense story and give insight to the characters involved.This is a must see for anyone interested in the British royal family.

1408," The 'Haunted House' theme revamped ...
","Although the movie takes up the tired 'haunted house' plot/theme, strong acting and a clever script manage to keep the movie interesting.The movie is about a popular author who writes books on haunted hotels. Contrary to what he writes, he's actually a skeptic and thinks everything's a con. Following up on a simplistic message on a postcard, he resolves stay in a particular room at a hotel. He thinks he's being conned by the hotel staff when things start to get strange ... but begins think twice.One of the best aspects of the movie is that there is a fairly intelligent character who's a skeptic. It is well-played by John Cusack who is constantly trying to dismiss everyone's warnings and all the strange things that occur.On the minus side, the movie seemed a bit long because a haunted house plot with only 1 main character can only go so far. As movie-goers, we've seen it all. The script is clever, but this genre is a hard wall to climb.If you like Stephan King stories or supernatural movies, this is definitely worth watching; for everyone else, consider it an above-average movie choice.",Null,1,1,28 March 2008
Raging Bull," Intense Rage ....
","Scorsese has a talent for making movies depicting 'blue-collar' rage - and this is one of those movies. It's a very good movie, but I'm not sure what I got out of it.Basically, the movie is about the tumultuous emotional life of 1940s middle-weight boxer Jake LaMotta. The movie roughly covers the last 10 years of his boxing career to his early retirement years.Though it is based on a famous boxer, it is not really a boxing movie. This movie is about the internal fury burning within the boxer and how it affected his immediate family members.The performances are outstanding: De Niro (LaMotta) and Pesci (his brother) played their roles with visible intensity. Moriarty, (his wife) also did a great job, though her role was a little more one-dimensional.I'm not sure what I got out of this movie after watching it. Yes, it's intense and well-acted and the plot is engaging - but I don't feel I would have missed anything by not seeing it. Maybe one had to see it when it came out in 1980.In any case, if your a fan of Scorsese or any of the actors, definitely watch this. For everyone else, it's got all the right elements of a good movie, but not as much to think about or marvel at as in other Scorsese films.",Null,3,9,28 November 2007

Now, it's not without its flaws - but it's not easy doing 'yet-another' superhero movie either. Fortunately for audiences, the overall result is strong.Basically, Iron Man is about a billionaire businessman and weapon scientist who has a change of heart after he is injured in a war zone. He develops a new energy source and body armor that give him the ability to fight terrorists - especially those who are using weapons he helped develop. But things turn out to be a little more complicated than they seem ...If you like special effects - this movie has scenes that won't disappoint. The body armor / suit looks pretty cool and the flying sequences are outstanding. (There's an older movie called the 'Rocketeer' which had similar scenes, but didn't capitalize enough on them enough like this movie).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow all do great acting jobs - especially Jeff Bridges, whose performance is superb. While the editing and some aspects of the plot seem a bit too rushed at times, the overall movie succeeds anyway.It's hard to think about who would 'not' enjoy at least something in this movie - so it's pretty easy to state that this one's worth seeing for just about everyone.",Null,2,4,9 May 2008

Casino Royale," New and Improved Bond
","Whether you're a Bond fan or not, this movie delivers on both the action scenes and storyline. Gone is the brainless action and gadget-fest. In its place is a rugged, sophisticated and vulnerable character that audiences can relate to.Basically, the story involves a 'bad guy' who organizes a high-stakes poker match (a game at which he excels) to acquire funds he lost through failed financial speculation. It is also the story of Bond transitioning into his '007' status - so it is where he begins.It may sound a little dull, but don't be fooled - it's got plenty of action, suspense, and time to develop a liking for the character of Bond.Some aspects of Bond are updated in accord with the times - for instance, gone are sexual references to females in the opening credits. Although there is still the male magnetism that Bond 'exudes', it seems less over-the-top than in previous movies.All-in-all, it is a darker and more reflective / sophisticated character that we see and it is an improvement. This is a fine movie for both Bond fans and first-timers.",Null,1,3,31 December 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," See it on TV / DVD ...
","This movie is more suited to watching on TV. It's kind of low-budget and even slightly fuzzy at times. The crude lighting reminded me of 1970s-era movies. OK - that aside, the movie wasn't all that good. You really have to love Woody Allen's style to appreciate this movie.The story's setup wasn't very believable. Basically, 2 lady friends are 'out of the blue' propositioned by a local artist who wants them to travel with him to another city to sightsee and have sex (all three of them together). And of course ... they accept ... ya right. No matter the cleverness and speed of the dialog, that basic setup is hard to swallow. There are a few other improbable actions further on in the movie, but it starts there.On the plus side, the acting was really good and the dialog brainy and witty. However, the discourse sounded like Woody Allen talking instead of real/normal people.The intense confrontations between the characters and social conflicts that arose were kind of interesting - but not enough to recommend this movie to the average moviegoer. If you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll probably appreciate this film far more than others.",Null,5,15,31 August 2008
Beowulf," Great visuals coupled with an 'ok' story ...
","I saw Beowulf in IMAX 3D and the opening images were pretty amazing. However, as the story went on, I began to wonder if the effects would make up for a not-quite-so engaging story. My answer is ... not really.I'm glad I saw it, but I take out the 3D effects, I'd drop the rating to a '5'. If I take out the rich visual details, I might drop it to a '4.5'.The one thing that happens with great animation and effects is that after a while, you kind of get used to them and they fade to the background. That's what happened here. What one is left with are the characters and story.I can't speak for anyone else, but I really didn't relate to any of characters. Given that the story is based on a poem, it's clear why the characters might be very limited.The same is true for the story. I can see how it stems from a good tale, but the story was delivered in only a 'slightly above average' manner.The positives are all about the effects: great 3D effects, great action scenes, stunning backgrounds and fantastic facial details. The people behind this aspect of the movie did an amazing job. I also applaud the filmmakers in finally introducing some animation material that goes clearly beyond a 'G' rated audience.If you're a 3D enthusiast, you need no recommendation - see it! For everyone else, my recommendation is to see only the 3D version and only if you enjoy great visual effects.",Null,0,1,26 November 2007

The science aspect, which I usually tend to ignore, bothered me and felt like too much of a stretch. It just felt strange - If we use 100% of our brains, we become like gods?What happens if a cat or a chicken uses 100% of it's brain? Boggles the mind.The movie 'Limitless', which also speculated on using near 100% of the brain, felt more believable and interesting.

","There is no way to do justice to this movie with a quick review. Virtually every element of this movie is a work of art. This is no surprise given the fact that it is done by a master of cinema, Alfred Hitchcock. From the catchy opening tune, right through to the end, the movie is captivating and fun to watch.The movie is about a cutting edge photographer who is stuck in his apartment for several weeks with a broken leg. The only view is of other tenant windows ... so that's what ends up looking at day after day. Of course, if you watch other people all day long, you're bound to start seeing something out of the ordinary eventually ... but murder ... or are you reading into something too much? That's the basic setup of the movie. It's kind of voyeuristic intrigue since the viewer only sees what James Stewart (the main character) sees. Everything from the color to the sounds to the dialog are fascinating to experience. There's never a dull moment.I'm seeing it some 50+ years after it was made and all I can say is that it has clearly stood the test of time. Recommended viewing for everyone.",Null,0,1,24 June 2008

","I liked this movie, but I wasn't as overwhelmed with it as others seem be. It's a good story filled with a number of emotional-tugs typical of Indian storytelling. It held my interest through to the end, but I didn't really think about the film afterward.If you're thinking about seeing this movie - you'll be glad to know two things: It's filmed in English (so no subtitles) ... and it's not a drawn-out Bollywood singing/dancing musical. You'll get an interesting story with great acting - and I'm sure you'll rate it no lower than a '6'.The movie is basically the background story of a poor Indian fellow who ends up as a promising contestant on the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. As he moves from one correct answer to the next, we see flashbacks of the rough-life struggles he had to endure while growing up that led him to the answer.It's a cool way to tell a story. If you don't know what living in poverty is like in India, this'll be a somber and touching eye-opener. While it's well acted and written, it wasn't especially engrossing (to me at least). However, as I stated above, I think most people would rate it no lower than a 6 so it's a pretty good bet if you're looking for a good drama to see.",Null,2,8,18 February 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Good movie about struggling in life ...
","This is a character-driven movie and it succeeded well. I enjoyed watching Will Smith's character as he faced day to day challenges with grace and humility. Somehow, it was reassuring to see the kind of people that we can be when things get hard.Basically, this is the story about a man whose financial crises and failing marriage finally cause him and his son to face increasing hardships together.Will Smith puts in a great performance. Even while his life is crumbling around him, Smith's character comes across a real. Somehow, he (the character) maintains an upbeat attitude to make money and deal with his son. His son (played by his real son Jaden) also puts in an endearing performance.Like many similarly-themed movies, this film is focused on one part of the character's life. After becoming interested in the characters, I would like to have seen the movie continue onwards past the point that it did. Yet, there's only a limited amount of time to work with in any movie - so that's understandable.If you're interested in a watching a movie about the human-spirit in the face of adversity, this is a good movie to see.",Null,0,0,14 November 2007
The Simpsons Movie," I couldn't help but laugh ...
","I don't easily laugh during movies, but this movie had so many clever gags, it was almost impossible not to. In fact, most of the audience was regularly laughing throughout the movie - something I haven't seen happen in a very long time.The storyline basically involves Homer Simpson polluting a community lake and causing the entire city to suffer the consequences. Namely - being shut off from the rest of the world by a giant glass dome.Yes - it's crazy, but the story is strung together by a million one-liners and gags. They are so imaginative that it's hard not to acknowledge a certain comedic brilliance that went into making this movie.Even though the movie is simple animation, it is very nicely one. The rich colors, 3-D shadowing and rich visual backgrounds make the movie very visually appealing. I was surprised at how much I ended liking the movie just for the visual scenes alone.The one thing that did not happen at any time is boredom. Even though some of the jokes didn't work for me, the fast pace and constant action of the story kept me nicely occupied. There was never a moment where I had a chance to stop and think about anything - I was constantly engaged.Although this type of humor won't be appreciated by everyone, you can get a pretty good idea of what's in store by watching an episode of the Simpsons. If you find anything funny about it, you'll probably greatly enjoy this movie.",Null,1,4,25 August 2007
Atonement," The power of a 13 year old girl's accusation ...
","There's a rape at a British estate in the early 1900s and it's unsettling to see how much impact a young girl's word can have. This movie is about the lasting impact of such a claim. It walks through the years and depicts how people's lives are affected - most notably the young, lower-income fellow who was accused and lady he loves.I can see how this story could be very powerful, but in terms of this movie, it's doesn't quite work. The first 1/4 of the movie sets up the incident nicely, but the rest of the movie seems a bit slow. I'd say that it's even easy to predict. There is a good plot twist at the end, so aside from the beginning, this is the other strong point of the movie.If you've read the novel, it's a good bet (based on readers' reviews) that you'll like this movie. For everyone else, there's not enough of a sustained intensity to make this a compelling watch.",Null,0,3,17 December 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The first 'actually funny' Will Ferrell movie ...
","I still can't believe how 'laugh out loud' funny this movie was given that it had Will Ferrell in it. His movies are usually just excessively goofy and not much else - but not here. This movie was great - one terrific gag after another. I was very impressed.The movie is about the rapid rise, fall and comeback attempt of a quirky, redneck-like car driver 'Ricky Bobby'.To pull of the gags, the acting had to be near perfect - and it was. Will Ferrell, John Reilly (co-driver) and Sacha Baron Cohen (Ferrell's nemesis in the movie) pull of terrific performances.This is a bright, somewhat innocent, fast-paced movie. Everyone should be able to find something to laugh about all the way through to the credits. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,13 March 2008
