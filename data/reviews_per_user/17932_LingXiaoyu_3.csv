One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Never my favorite Disney animation
","I'm a huge fan of the series of Disney's animated films. I remember I saw 101 Dalmatians when I was very little and I watched it with my father again and again and he loved it a lot. I was just never really that much into it. I love the original story by Dodie Smith, but the film just lacks something essential. It contains a lot of happy childhood memories for me but I haven't yet figured out the missing piece.The story is familiar to most of us. When Anita and Roger get married, they both have a dalmatian. Anita has Perdita and Roger has Pongo. Soon Perdita starts expecting puppies. Anita's old friend Cruella De Vil pops in and wants to buy the pups to make a fur coat for herself, but fails. She then hires two dumb criminals to do the job for her, but the dogs are smarter than she thought.101 Dalmatians is a real classic but the missing feel's just always there. The best thing in the film are probably the dumb criminals, who are mostly responsible for the funny scenes in the film.",6,3,9,30 March 2005
10 Things I Hate About You," One of the better teenage comedies
","To be honest with you, I've never really been into these teenage comedies. 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the better ones, tho. It's slightly based on the Shakespeare play Taming of the Shrew. It's about love (what else?) mostly, but it also has some other qualities plus attitude! My favourite character must be the all-around tough and rough chick Kat Stratford played by Julia Stiles.To play out the basic plot, there's two sisters, Katarina and Bianca Stratford. Kat is the outsider, attitude-girl who pretends never to have cared for anyone. Bianca on the other hand is real outgoing, smiling girl who boys find attractive. Neither of the two sisters have been allowed to date boys, it's strictly denied from them by their overprotective father. Bianca can date when Kat does, but that never appears to happen. Two boys have a crush on Bianca and the rich boy pays a guy to date Kat so he can date Bianca. But what the rich boy doesn't know, is that the other boy, Cameron, is dating Bianca behind his back. And Kat doesn't know that the boy who seems as if he had a huge crush on him is just really been paid to go out with her.The best thing in this film is definitely the music, especially the music Kat likes in the film. I'd love the soundtrack, it's definitely in my wanted-list! If you like a nice, humorous teenage romantic comedy, this is the one to get, I assure you. It just doesn't get any better.",7,0,1,30 March 2005
Cube," Try to find your way out!
","This film is one of the biggest surprises I have ever seen. I remember seeing a trailer for it back when it was released and immediately wanted to see it. I couldn't find it and almost forget it, until one day this year I found the DVD. I bought it, went home and watched it and when it ended I was still thrilled. This was something so different. All the things that happen are kind of set in the same space.As good as this film is, it's also a little disturbing. It's also like a lesson of what people are like and what happens to certain people in this sort of frightening situations. I was scared by the film (even tho most of my friends haven't been) because of the human nature factor in it.The actors in the film are lesser known (at least to me) and they do superb job. I would highly recommend people to give this film a chance. It's just all how you want to view it.",10,5,12,21 April 2005
