The Incredible Hulk," Hulk smash
","Its a really really good movie, it has really great acting Edward Norton was the perfect bruce. all the actors were good for the part except the bad dude. he's cool and all but he didn't fit in the part. the grafics were much much better than the old hulk. thank goodness i saw this movie i almost lost faith in the hulk but this movie revived him with a vengeance. If you haven't seen this movie your either broke or just plain dumb. You can not 'repeat' can not miss this movie. Please do yourself a favor go watch this movie. If your an avengers fan you must watch this it is one of the building blocks to the greatest movie ever The Avengers.",8,2,4,23 June 2008
