Black Swan," Black Swan is a dirty bird!
","Never have I been so disappointed in a movie. Being a fan of ballet, I had anticipated a classic film done in good taste with beautiful actors, sets, and music. I was shocked and disappointed to find this film laced with totally unnecessary scenes of gratuitous sex, perversion, sex offenders, sexual harassment, and filthy and offensive language. The dirty old man on the subway, bus, or whatever was the last straw that prompted me to change the channel. It really is a shame the topic of a ballerina dancing the parts of Odette and Odile was not approached in a wholesome way by a different director and screenwriter.The movie has a good cast that, unfortunately, was wasted on this perverted nightmare trying to disguise itself as a film. All I can say is, 'Thank God I did not waste money on a movie theatre ticket or on a DVD of this horrible trash.' I would advise everyone to pass on this one.",1,4,12,29 December 2011
