Casablanca," Classic proves itself to be somewhat desirable
","I now can finally say I watched Casablanca. Putting my shame aside for not reviewing this high acclaimed film at an earlier date, i can say that I was half way impressed. Going into the film my expectations were a bit high, so that could have something to do with my final thoughts. I expected my mind to be blown, and to a certain degree i suppose it was. This was my first exposure to the legendary actor, Humphrey Bogart, and i was surely impressed. His acting is simply legendary and for me, he made the entire movie. The visuals were also very eye appealing. I must admit that about midway through i did get a little lost, and tried to regain focus but just couldn't. I mainly focused and was sort of awed by the presence of Humprey Bogart, his style on the screen is intriguing, smooth, and something to look up to.",7,0,3,18 October 2010
Citizen Kane," standing the very test of time and much controversy
","Absolute Classic. 'Citizen Kane' is possibly the single most important film of this century. Setting aside the (then) controversial subject matter and the grief Welles went through over this film, watch the film at least once for sheer enjoyment. The black & white cinematography is brilliant, the direction is smooth, and the key players all turn in outstanding performances. Orson Welles richly deserved his Oscar for Best Actor this time around. Even the makeup, while seeming 'overdone' by today's standards, is effectively used. This movie belongs in every movie lover's library. The film does such a great job at taking the viewer on a personal journey. The verisimilitude does well at enhancing the glorified storyline.",Null,0,1,17 December 2010
The Birth of a Nation," Interesting, somewhat educational.
","Before taking this movie out from my school library I was warned that it is ' three hours long, and good luck in staying awake.' Trying not to go into it with preconceived notions I took the film for what it was worth. Considering it was produced nearly one hundred years ago, it was good. I tried to put myself in the shoes of an audience member, sitting in a theater in 1915. The visuals were certainly good for its day. I actually didn't grow bored with this film, believe it or not. I did the best I could do following the plot. I am a big civil war fan, so that may be why this film appealed to me. For me it was very interesting to look back into the year 1915 whilst virtually looking back to the 1860s. I thought the acting in the film was very good all around. Without the presence of sound, they still seem to illustrate what they're talking about. The score of music selected for the film is interesting, some of it I enjoyed, it played a crucial part in some of the battle scenes. It was interesting to see the mindset of the average family back in that time period, and the role of African Americans. It really opens up the eyes of someone viewing it in todays age, how far we have come, and how lost and confused we have been in the past.Interesting portrayal of historical characters. Casting director was on the money when it came to casting Abraham Lincoln. I was also impressed with the budget they must have been working with. There were a vast amount of extras, not sure if they got paid for their service.. most likely not. All in all it was an interesting view into our past as a nation. I have to say, something peculiar stuck out when I was about half way through the film. I realized that all these people that were in this movie are surely dead and gone, and most likely have been for almost a half a century.",6,1,4,15 September 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Nice Fantasy Ride
","I enjoyed this film, I had heard a lot about it over the years, but never had the chance to sit down and watch it. I also have heard a lot of mention on behalf of famous actor Paul Newman, who I had never gotten a chance to view one of his films until now. The movie itself did well in capturing the essence of suspense and adventure. It had me on the edge of my seat at times and evoked a sense of wonder. I think the American people all have a side to them that wants to rebel against government and the law. This movie, which came out in 1969 stands to represent just that. As the cultural revolution is in full swing, this movie helps capture the imagination of freedom with these two characters. The cinematography is very well done, there are a lot of shots that i found to be extremely visually appealing. There certainly is a good job done in the process of creating verisimilitude. The film easily captures my own spirit and my own personal desire to rebel. I would sincerely recommend this film to just about everyone. Paul Newman and Robert Redford do a marvelous job in creating their characters and dutifully playing them out to create a sense of reality for the viewer.",8,0,0,17 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," graphic look into the feel and realness of the average struggling American family during the Great Depression
","Upon review of this classic, I found myself immersed into the feel of this film. The lighting in this movie casts a certain element of darkness,doom,and gloom which indirectly reflects the time period this is being portrayed in the film. The plot was interesting, I followed the story and it was an interesting look into what our grandparents and great grandparents had to endure during those times of hardship. I found it also liberating to a certain extent, it made current situations and problems in my current life seem not so hard up after all, at least i haven't been forced out of the home and shipped off to a farm to work for a measly 2 cents... Not yet of course ( considering the shape of our current economy / government ) I enjoyed the casting of shadows, and that most of the film was shot at night, this really gave me the sense of darkness, loneliness, and uncertainness. Not quite sure if the director had that intention in mind while in production, but anyway you look at it, it holds a unique element of darkness to it. I would strongly recommend this movie, its fun, serious, and educating, and tells a story during an important time in Americas history.",7,0,1,17 October 2010
The Graduate," entertaining, amusing, delightful, and insightful
","Id like to firstly say that the music in this movie, done by Simon & Garfunkle was truly great and really made the movie what it was. The music goes hand in hand with the storyline. Sam O'steen does a wonderful job at editing the film to fit in tune with the certain songs done by the group. Dustin Hoffman plays a great part in this movie. He is intelligent, but wittfully stupid in a fashion that is pretty funny. He gives his character a certain innocence throughout the film, which is very entertaining to watch him get in certain situations. The sexual content of this film really was revolutionary for its time. 1967 the cultural revolution was in full swing, and you can certainly see it portrayed in this movie. The rebellion against the Hayes Code, which would very soon after this movie get reduced by the federal courts was stand out. Certain scenes directly offend and step on the toes of Hayes code enforcers. I thought it was great to see, I think that it was director Mike Nichols way of joining in on the cultural revolution and making a bold statement that the old road is rapidly fading. I would certainly suggest this film to anyone. Great stuff.",7,0,2,15 December 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson makes Hollywood well aware of his presence
","This film I found to be very entertaining, as well as interesting in its ending. Jack Nicholson makes his presence and unique style well known with the debut of this film. He plays a character that plays a character which takes true talent on behalf of the actor. He pretends to be crazy to get out of working, and ends up in an institute where things just get more crazy. His ability to capture the attention of the audience is very prevalent. He brings a certain charisma to the screen, one that makes you truly identify with his character. The cinematography in the film is also great, a lot of the shots are actually taken in an old broken down mental institution, which give the film more verisimilitude. Certain camera angles that play off Nicholsons character are also very good, they give you a solid perspective of what he is actually seeing while being in a looney bin. The ending I think carries a certain message along with it, it leaves the viewer very uneasy as the credits role. I think that it was artfully constructed to invite the viewer to think beyond Nicholsons humor in the movie and investigate a moral issue.",10,1,2,15 December 2010
