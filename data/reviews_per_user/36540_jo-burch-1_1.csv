The Sound of Music," The best film ever!
","I was brought up on this film. My mum, my grandma and her mum all loved this film. It should be on the national curriculum! It's just a wonderful escapist film with no offensive language, no violence and no prejudice. It is a light hearted and lovely film set in beautiful surroundings with songs to fill your heart. People berate it everywhere and that is because they have not bothered to watch it and understand it. It's not realistic in the sense that people don't burst into song in the streets no, but it is quite lovely to watch with your family.It is no coincidence that this film has transcended all generations and boundaries and will never die. Long may it go on and my daughter already loves it too :-)I would urge all families to show it to their children. You can take from it whatever you wish. those who berate it are usually the ones who would rather watch Terminator or get pleasure from watching people having their heads mashed to a pulp by a tattooed Neanderthal in a string vest...",10,1,7,3 February 2007
