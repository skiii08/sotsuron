Source Code," A 4 is being generous....
","OK yet again...rave reviews have mislead me. And yes, the only reason that I saw this movie was because everyone said how good it was. I don't get it people? This movie is out there. It makes no sense and if there is one thing I hate, it is trying to make sense of a movie. I want to be entertained when I go to a movie, not trying to piece all the puzzles together.This movie is very repetitive, keeps showing the same scene over and over. Yes, it has to do with the premise of the movie but goodness gracious, I couldn't stand it after about 20 minutes. You know what I mean if you have seen it.Overall, I don't know. I don't get it. I am surprised that this had the success that it did. I've never been a fan of Gyllenhaal either.The one positive thing is that I saw this at the cheap theater. =)",4,1,5,29 May 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," It works
","You know usually I'm not into romantic comedies, as I find that most of them fall short & are extremely cheesy. I really liked this movie though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great. Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost never happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute. This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people would enjoy it. 9/10!",9,231,307,30 July 2011
The Notebook," I. love. it.
","Oh my gosh, this is one of the best movies ever! The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams is outstanding. This movie pulls you in and keeps you rooting for a happy ending all the way through! I have watched this a million times, and it still stirs up emotion. I don't usually like sappy love movies, but there is something different about this one. It feels real.This movie shows how true love doesn't let obstacles get in the way. It becomes an unstoppable force. Ugh, I can't say enough good things about this movie! Almost anytime I see it on, I stop what I'm doing and watch it! Definitely a must see!",9,1,4,8 May 2010
Dear John," Not bad
","Wow...I was expecting this movie to be awful after all of the bad reviews I've read. Nothing is wrong with this movie! Nothing is wrong with the acting. It's actually a pretty good movie. I am not usually one for romantic movies...usually because I find them to be lame. There are definitely moments in this one that tug at your heart and get you teary eyed.I really felt for John in this movie. His character had a tough life... and the relationship between him and his father...It made me really sad! That Nicholas Sparks! He knows how to stir up emotions...I have not read the book, so I can't compare the two but I say the movie is worth watching.",7,39,50,29 May 2010
Shutter Island," Entertaining
","I liked this movie a lot. I was a little skeptical about seeing it because I hate sitting through 2 1/2 hour long movies, but really didn't notice it when I was in the theater. It holds your attention throughout the entire film, constantly adding suspense and moments that make you wonder what the truth is and which characters are untrustworthy. The one gripe I do have about the movie is the ending. The film up until the ending was so good that I think the ending should have brought a lot more to the table. I was definitely expecting a twist, but not a let down. Still, this movie is worth seeing.",8,1,3,8 March 2010
District 9," Pretty good...!
","One of my favorite things about this movie was how incredibly entertaining it was. A little ridiculous at times...sure.. but worth seeing. It kept my attention pretty much the whole time. (Ok.. it took about 10 minutes for me to get into this movie and the last 10 min or so dragged a bit but other than that, a good movie.) District 9 was very different than anything I have seen before. Usually I am not into alien movies. Saw the previews for this movie months ago and probably would have never thought to have seen it if I hadn't read all of the great reviews about it before hand. I am not surprised at how many people have liked this movie because it was well done.",9,1,3,20 August 2009
Bridesmaids," Laugh out loud comedy
","OK, I gotta admit that when I saw a preview for this movie I thought it looked lame. However after hearing many good reviews about it, I decided to give it a go. Hooray - this movie is actually funny! Matter of fact, I look forward to seeing it again and might even buy it when it comes out on DVD. Kristen Wiig is hilarious. This was the first time that I've actually watched her act, never really saw any of her stuff before this movie. Also, I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to movies. It takes a lot to make me actually laugh out loud and I was doing a lot of that in this movie. I think that any female could relate to Kristen's character and some of her experiences. She doesn't quite feel up to par with where she's at in her life but fortunately there is a lot of humor that comes from this. I'm sure even some guys would enjoy this movie. Overall - Enjoyable, cute and hilarious!",8,5,11,4 June 2011
Insidious," So scary....
","When I first saw a preview for this movie, I knew it looked like it had potential. It had been a while since I saw a decent scary movie so I was looking forward to it. I went into it expecting some scares but nothing too bad. Wrong. This movie scared me out of my wits. I don't think I have ever jumped more during any other scary movie. The audience was spooked too. I saw many other people jumping out of their seats and even heard a few actual screams.What I loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you, not gross you out. The images are frightening for sure. Insidious doesn't waste any time trying to creep you out. The scares already start with the opening credits. I sure was not expecting this to be one of the scariest movies i've seen but it lives up to that. That being said, I don't think I'd have the guts to see it again!",8,258,392,2 April 2011
Kick-Ass," What the heck??
","What in the world???? HOW does this movie have so many good reviews? It was awful! I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. I only caved because of it's ongoing good rating. I had a feeling about 10 minutes into it, that it was not going to get any better and unfortunately I was right.First of all, I thought that this was supposed to be a comedy? It is in no way a comedy. It is extremely violent and full of blood (who would have thought?!) I do not know the last time that I saw a movie this bad. Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! There are just so many things wrong with it. I also have a huge problem with an 11 year old girl being a killer. That really disturbed me. This movie had no idea what it wanted to be. There are so many different genres wrapped into it. It had absolutely no flow to it whatsoever. I love a good movie, regardless of its genre but this movie flat out sucked! It was completely inappropriate. I honestly felt like one of those people on the show Punkd while I was watching this. I felt like this movie had to be a joke.AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1,8,19,14 June 2010
Limitless," Surprisingly awesome
","I went into this movie not expecting much. I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper and paired with being bored on a Saturday night, this movie seemed like a good option. Wow. I was pleasantly surprised with how good this movie was. It really grabs your attention and holds it the entire time. This movie has a little bit of everything...action, romance, suspense, humor. Cooper did a great job in his role.The main idea of the movie shows how people who don't usually experience much success in life, react once things start changing for them. Achieving more and more success becomes an endless cycle. You start to get bored with all that you have and you crave more, until soon enough you crash. I won't say too much more about the movie, other than it's definitely a must see. Best one I've seen this year.",8,0,2,20 March 2011
Inception," I wish I was sleeping during it.....
","Alright. I know that this movie is getting rave reviews, but after seeing it last night I am wondering why!? I saw a preview for this about 2 months ago and had been wanting to see it ever since. Geez, what a letdown once I finally saw it. Unfortunately, I can not think of one good thing to say about this movie. I was lost as to what was going on only after 5 minutes into this and it kept getting more complicated. I was expecting this movie to be on the weird side, but it made no sense to me whatsoever. I don't think I have ever wanted to walk out of a movie so much in my life. The only thing that kept me staying was the hope that this movie would pick up. It's 2 1/2 hours long and trust me, it feels like that and more! It's just rather dull. Nothing really going on, the effects are just OK...nothing to really save the movie. It didn't hold my interest, didn't keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next, there was no wow factor, nothing. Huge disappointment.",1,23,73,18 July 2010
The Conjuring," Is this a joke??
","I was almost afraid to watch this movie based off of the reviews. Thought I would be scared for days. I read several comments stating that this movie was horrifying and the best scary movie people had seen in years. I kept waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this to get better, or scary even. Nothing. I literally thought to myself that maybe I was watching the wrong version or something and wasn't seeing what everyone else saw. Far fetched I know, but that's how unbelievably disappointing this was. I was not scared at all and I would not typically consider myself someone that is hard to scare. Granted there are a few moments in this movie where you tense up just a bit, thinking something is going to pop out but that's about it!! This simply did not hold my interest. I just don't get it.",1,8,16,7 September 2013
Get Him to the Greek," Hilarious.
","This movie is so funny! I had no idea. I saw it out of boredom...not really expecting a whole lot from it. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. I was shocked. There is a lot of vulgarity in it which gets kind of annoying at times but the movie itself is so funny that you can't help but like it.I have been a fan of Jonah Hill for a while but didn't really like Russell Brand too much before this. They actually have great chemistry together. The laughs keep coming throughout the entire movie. I would recommend it! As long as you're not easily offended and can appreciate some pretty ridiculous humor, then I think you'll like it too.",8,19,41,6 June 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," The terror doesn't stop once you're out of the woods..
","As many others have stated, it is hard to fully review this movie without giving too much away. I actually had been waiting for this to come to theaters for a while. I kept reading updates on it saying the release date had been pushed back. Ironically, when I finally saw an actual preview for it, I thought it looked disappointing and dumb. However after reading several good reviews, I thought i'd give it a go.This movie SEEMS to be a predictable, uh oh somebody's going to torture us while we're staying at the 'Cabin in the Woods' and while that somewhat holds true, the story line is so much deeper than you would think.I wouldn't go so far to say that I was scared by this movie. It certainly has its creepy moments, but it's more entertaining than anything. Quite entertaining.The last 25 minutes or so are really freaking cool. If you are into the horror genre, I think you will appreciate this movie and it's unexpected originality.",10,2,15,22 April 2012
The Wedding Singer," Love it
","I don't usually write reviews for movies on here but I just wrote one for a movie I recently saw so now I am going to comment on all my favorites. This movie is so stinkin cute! I have lost count of how many times I have seen The Wedding Singer but it never gets old! It's a somewhat romantic/comedy... I say somewhat because the movie is cheesy yet adorable. I even bought the soundtrack for this movie a couple of years ago because the music in it is great.. (If you like 80's music.) Adam Sandler nails his role and is quite likable. As is Drew. If you have not seen this movie, I suggest you go rent it. Or just wait for it to come on television.. because it usually airs a lot. 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,20 August 2009
