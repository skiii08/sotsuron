The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Impressive
","A friend of mine recommended the book, but it was really difficult to find it in my country. I don't know the book, but the movie is almost perfect. Emma Watson (Harry Potter) is amazing and, in this movie, is the perfect partner for Logan Lerman. They both alone have that spark needed to be in front of a camera but together are an explosion of feelings. Regarding the subject, when you start watching the movie, you feel that it will be another typical High-School movie but it is not. This movie will catch you every 5 minutes with different wonders. After watching the movie you will not be able to know how to feel.",9,2,4,3 November 2013
