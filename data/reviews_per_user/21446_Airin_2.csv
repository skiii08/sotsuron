The Blair Witch Project," first person
",The movie being first person drew me and my friends in so much more. Im glad they decided to make it this way. It made it so original and more scary. I loved the switch between video and film. It added to the overall illusion of the film. What a great story. I can't wait to go watch it again.,10,1,3,4 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Keep em shut for this one
","Aside from all the sex (which didn't bug me) I found this movie to be SO boring. Could they hold the shots any longer? God I think I could cut this movie back from three hours to an hour. I really don't like Kubrick's style. I know he's original and all, but the least he could do is explain the whole movie. He leaves so many things unexplained. Ugh...",4,0,0,4 August 1999
