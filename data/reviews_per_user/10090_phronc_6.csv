The Longest Yard," Well done remake
","Here is a good example of how you can do a good new version of a movie. Normally I would say that I am sick of Adam Sandler (sorry Adam, I like your work a lot), that same IL' dumb character... the same old jokes, etc. But not here. He actually took a departure from his normal characters for this role, and it worked. They pretty much stuck to the original story, and added just the right amount of humor. All of the cast were great. Bringing Burt back was a nice touch as well. It wasn't as dark as the original flick, but that's OK... The heart of the film was the same. Good job! I recommend viewing this one! It is worth the $ for the ticket. I will probably buy it on DVD... heck a boxed set of the original and the remake would be very cool.",7,1,3,5 July 2005
Madagascar," Not too bad...
",This was a funny movie. It wasn't great... it was no Nemo... But it was funny. It was a tad lacking in the plot. But the one liners were great. As a bunch of little skits it worked really well... but all together there was something missing. The Penguins were GREAT! They should have their own shorter length movie (even they would probably not be able to hold a 2 hr movie). But something like 'The Penguins take Bermuda' or something... or maybe a 007 rip-off with the penguins. That would be cool. Each of the characters were pretty funny too. Except for the lion. He was kind of not that funny. Maybe it is because of Ben Stiller. Getting sick of the same IL' character from him too... and it is sad that it even comes through on an animated movie. Yikes!,6,1,2,5 July 2005
Batman Begins," Awesome
","This was one of the best Batman movies ever. The effects were good. Thestory line was good. The worst part about it was Katie Holmes. I hate to bash her, but she could have been left out of the movie and it would not have made a difference. Christian Bale was OK as a Batman, not great but WAY better than George Clooney (sorry George). Michael Cane and Liam Neeson were great, as was Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, and Cillian Murphy. I can't wait to see if they make another. If they do... DON'T change anyone that worked on this one! Keep the same director and writers! This is a prime example of how a good prequel can be made. Just pay attention to the original story and try to be true to it (as much as possible), forget about the 'new interpretation' B.S.",8,0,1,5 July 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Eh...
","OK, so Angelina is hot. Great (can never really get enough of her). But can you really base an entire movie on just that (and for the women, just Brad's looks)? I suppose so, because that is what was done with this movie. It really didn't have a lot of substance at all. Sure there were some very humorous scenes. Sure there were some cool gadgets and a cool car chase. And sure there were a couple of good one liners. But that's it. Other than that it was kinda boring/mediocre. Please, please, please do NOT make a second one of these or a sequel! Vince was very funny in this, and the one good thing was that they never showed his mom... and had him living at home with her... that was funny.",5,1,2,5 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Not that great....
","Luckily I was aware that this movie was not going to be anything like the original book or movie, and I have low expectations for all re-makes of old movies as well as screen adaptations of books. So, my opinion of this movie could only go up when I went to go see it. Was I wrong? Yes. Although over all the movie wasn't bad (if I had never seen the original), it also wasn't good. Tom Cruise, was mediocre in the role. All of the other actors and actresses were a bit better than he was. The story, although it showed some interesting things about human nature, was flawed. Why was his the only family that lost NOBODY?!?! His son should have died going over that hill. EVERYONE else who went over did. And the movie would have been no worse off with him dead. There are other weirdnesses that go on, but you get the idea. The effects were good. The fact that they tried to keep the facts of the aliens the same was good. But the story (it would seem was solely based on this one man's attempt to survive and keep his family alive, as well as show how low human beings can go) is about all there is substance wise. Expected more from Spielberg.",5,0,0,5 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wow
","Now this might be one of my favorites of the Star Wars movies (not including Episode IV, the original, that was awesome), and might be tied with Episode V. Well done! I was pleased with this episode of the sage, it was a pleasant departure from the last two (Episodes I and II). They were such disappointments. It was nice and dark (which is good considering the title). Man, it was really surprising to see how just cruel and destructive Anakin Skywalker becomes, as well as how he comes to be Darth Vader and how he ends up in the life support suit. Wow. I really liked this. The only thing that I was a little confused by was how Anakin was able to take out so many other Jedi, but had such a hard time with Obi-Wan. Oh well, every great movie still has a flaw or two.",8,2,4,5 July 2005
