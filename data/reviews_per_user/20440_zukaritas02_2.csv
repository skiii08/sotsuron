Iron Man 3," Not a fan of the comic series, but seriously...
","Don't need to be really into the comics to notice the absence of quality in this film.1.Iron Man's suit doesn't even withstand getting hit by a truck. 2.The dozens of the Mk suits that come up at the end are made of paper, too. 3.I can keep going, repeating what everybody just said.Oh, and the big mystery: Why is this movie rated 7.*/10??? It does not deserve it at all. Everybody in the room was like 'What??' at the end, I can only think of people that never go to the movies are the ones that are high-rating it.I read somewhere that Disney was involved in here. I cannot imagine what the new Star Wars movies will be like.",Null,2,4,2 May 2013
If I Stay," Wanted to like it
","I got into an advance screening yesterday. I got warned that this would be a romantic-drama kind of movie and I was prepared for that. Turns out, it was just your average clich√© teenager love movie.The movie fails to express any real, palpable emotions. In some defining parts of the movies, where you should start getting some feelings, I rather felt annoyed by awful sound effects, terrible acting and depressing transitions.Don't even get me started on the high predictability of the whole movie. You WILL know what happens next. This movie is to be watched on a lazy Sunday afternoon.I will give credit to the awesome music played and how it was acted by Grace. She actually did act well in 60% of the screen time, but she fails to deliver in the defining moments of the movie. I really wanted to like this movie. 4/10.",4,21,46,20 August 2014
