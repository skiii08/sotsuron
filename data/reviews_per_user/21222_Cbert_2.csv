The Blair Witch Project," If 'scary' means 'bad', this is one of the scariest films I have ever seen!
","I can only assume that the people that are giving this film a 5 star review are the same people that live in the back woods of Kentucky, love Jerry Springer and think that the 'Faces of Death' movies are 'quality' entertainment. This is without a doubt the biggest let down of the summer. It is a shame because Artisan has done a great job promoting the film with a fantastic website and trailers that are much scarier than the film itself. While I will admit that it gave me the 'willies' a couple of times, overall this film is absolutely flat. Do yourself a favor...rent a truly scary movie (like The Changeling or The Exorcist) from your local video store.",Null,1,3,17 July 1999
Blade," Fun movie
","I would have never picked this movie to be such an enjoyable ride...good action, fun performances, clever tricks.  Worth watching.",8,0,1,28 February 1999
