E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The best movie ever made!
","E.T. has got to be the best movie of all time.  Who else but Steven Spielberg could make America fall in love with a short, stubby alien?  The man is a genius, and this remains one of the most beautifully touching movies ever made.  It's one of those movies that even 100 years from now, people will still be watching.  It was robbed at the Oscars, it should have beaten Ghandi, hands down!",10,1,2,28 March 2000
Final Destination," The best since SCREAM
",This is one hell of a scary movie!!  You didn't know what to think or when to think it!  I give this movie a 10!!!  It was a scary movie for teenagers that's the most creative thing since SCREAM!!!  It totally creeped me out!,10,0,1,18 March 2000
