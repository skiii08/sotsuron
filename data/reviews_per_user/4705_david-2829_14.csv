The King's Speech," Believable portrayals and original subject matter make a gripping historical film.
","Fantastically believable portrayal of the stuttering King George VI and his journey to overcome that challenge to lead his country in a difficult time.I thought I had an idea of what somebody would do to portray stuttering... and luckily Colin Firth did something different and so much better. Geoffrey Rush as the perceptive, bold but caring speech therapist actually portrayed calm and peace and belief in 'Bertie'... actually giving us an emotional connection much like the real George VI must have experienced.The backdrop of the building Nazi invasion and World War II provides the tension for the importance of the challenge. George VI thrust into a position he did not desire (due in part to his public speaking difficulties) is rough enough, but in the kind of situation so fraught with peril is terrifying. Colin Firth imbues George VI with a sense of 'realness' allowing us to connect with his sadness, his anger & frustration, his fears.Not much to criticize, it felt like a masterpiece the entire way through. Many times great movies are not highly repeatable for the difficult subject matter, or painful emotions they drag us through. This movie is also difficult to watch but because of something entirely new to me -- stammering. It really is hard to see such struggle with something most of us take for granted. Brilliant!",10,0,1,14 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good, not great -- does not have the repeatability of the original trilogy.
","Admirable attempt to create a new adventure in the Pirates canon with no egregious violations but certainly a host of minor infractions. It's fun, sometimes funny, with some favorite characters as well as a few new faces and succeeds at entertaining even as it falls short of it's venerable history.First the GOOD: Johnny Depp, while not quite as out of balance or odd, still delivers the quirky pirate we've all come to love. Geoffrey Rush also reprises a favorite character with relish and aplomb. Ian McShane as Blackbeard has surprising presence and I enjoyed the mystery and intensity he brings to the role. Also good are a few good action scenes, some funny moments as Barbossa & Sparrow attempt a daring heist and are captured, and the interesting twist on mermaid folklore.Another great moment was the inclusion of a true classic scene from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride - the 'Skeleton on the bed with a magnifying glass'. It was a joy to see they're still working in elements from the Disney ride that launched this billion dollar empire.The NOT-SO-GOOD: The two primary offenders happen to be the dialogue and the land-locked conquest. First of all, this is a Pirates movie, and that should mean a lot of action on the sea, canons shooting, fighting and outmaneuvering and the mystery of discovery. Instead, we spent at least 3/4ths of the movie getting prepared to set sail, or searching for the Fountain of Youth. Oye, ye Land Lubbers!The second major problem is the dialogue doesn't have the punch, or the comedy worked into the original. There is too much exposition about the quest, and everybody seems to already know where the Fountain is. Jack Sparrow is more coherent and succinct, with less meandering and fewer odd word choices. And I think we miss out on a lot of comic potential without the two bumbling sidekicks or a love triangle involvement.The interaction between Sparrow and Angelica (Cruz) is never quite believable. We don't sense Jack actually pining for her, nor does Angelica seem any bit entranced by Sparrow. She is overly dedicated to her father for reasons not explained or believable. I can't believe this... but I miss Keira Knightley's internal struggles and wish Cruz had more of that conflict.The movie definitely suffers from the lack of a true good guy (ie. Will Turner) and a true bad guy (ie. Davy Jones). This setup had allowed Jack Sparrow's self-serving nature to be showcased, moving on a whim to whichever angle served him best. In Pirates 4, Jack Sparrow has taken the 'good guy' role, which doesn't fit him quite right. CONCLUSIONS: While it's not a bad movie and I was happy to see it, this movie is going to be more sharply criticized for its shortcomings. Too much land-trekking, more mundane expository dialogue, too light on comedy and not enough discovery.It's a fun ride, but not repeatably wonderful like the 'original trilogy' (which is becoming a more common phrase isn't it?)",6,1,4,23 May 2011
Hot Fuzz," Cop Buddy Movie genre mashup with humor, drama and action!
","A hilarious blend of comedy, action and drama taking aim and squarely blasting the cop buddy movie genre. Too serious to be a 'spoof', but filled with humor both obvious and subtle, this is the type of movie that begs repeat viewings. It's a cross-genre mashup that might be hard to define, but sure is fun to watch.In 'Hot Fuzz' we get the traditional mismatched cop buddies, but it's taken to the extreme, and actually works very well. Even the dichotomy of a rural setting for a crazy murder mystery plot adds to the surreal as well as the humor.My biggest gripe with the film is that I'm not a fan of overt gore. True it is done in a comedic manner for effect (ow, ow , ow), but it caught me off guard and is unnecessary. Severed heads, impalement's, blood-spurting wounds... the explicitness should be left to horror films.Another minor gripe was that some of the action stuff was cut way too fast and makes you dizzy. I appreciate the idea of adding multiple cuts to add energy, but this was over-the-top. Perhaps the decision was purposeful, lampooning even the style of action movies... but for me it was a little distracting.'Hot Fuzz' is at it's best with the many laugh out loud moments: the runaway goose, translating the local dialect, the human statue 'threat', the bodyguard who just says 'Naarp!', and wordplay twists throughout. These smart bits of humor make the film a keeper... just be prepared for high action and some gore with your laughs.",7,0,1,10 March 2011
Megamind," Noisy, wild, hyperactive, crazy... pretty good!
","Noisy, wild, hyperactive, crazy... depending on how you interpret those words will likely determine how much you like this movie. The comparisons to 'Despicable Me' (which came out a few months earlier) are inevitable, as is those who will line up behind one or the other as better. Personally I go with Despicable Me for its extra heart, wittier dialogue and more laughs.One thing that Megamind has in abundance is dazzling animation on a grand scale. The destruction is phenomenal in some scenes, and the battle between Megamind's Monster Machine and his Monstrous Creation (Titan) has some of the hardest hits I've ever scene in any film. I also liked the insights into the superhero genre and seeing the caricature hero & villain both evolve in the course of the movie.It did start to get predictable in the last half, to the point where I started guessing lines of dialogue (much to the amazement of my boys) and correctly foresaw plot twists. Also, many scenes in the movie are backed-up by raucous 80's & 90's metal, and there's a lot of noise and high-intensity action throughout the film. While I do like this stuff, it has to be balanced for the right impact and here it just felt like an assault of the senses. Last of all, there is a lot of exposition, (starting from the opening intro) and I think it would have been a better film to follow the old adage, 'Show, don't tell'.Overall, it was enjoyable and entertaining. Some good laughs, some hard actions, great special effects... worth watching. But Ohlo, not for small children!",7,0,0,11 April 2011
The Town," A Boston crime family excels at bank robbery, but nobody is perfect. How will they continue while keeping ahead of the cops?
","Powerful and distinct characters richly portray a life of crime in Boston in this gripping tale of expert bank robbers trying to stay one-step ahead of an ever escalating police manhunt.It's a challenging tale of Good vs. Bad vs. Worse when our mastermind bank criminal (Ben Affleck) decides he's had enough of his seedy, immoral life and wants to change for the better. But can he escape from not only the cops who are banging at the door, but the cohorts who depend on him and refuse their blessings for his departure? 'The Town' is a well-done movie which is sometimes hard to understand the thick accents and mumbled words. However the storyline is easy to follow, mostly linear, well-acted with some tense moments as we fear discovery and capture for our criminals. Interesting that we root for Ben Affleck's character, because in spite of all his robberies and crime he has a soft heart and desires change. It's revealed that he fell into this lifestyle, and so we feel forgiveness is allowed.Compared to something like Oceans 11, the heists pulled off seem relatively simple - especially the grandest theft of the movie, which was just too easy. I also felt a little more could have been done with plot elements like the give-away tattoo and the potential for the intelligent girlfriend to discover the true identity of her boyfriend.But what little there is to criticize is easily compensated for with excellent action and an intriguing plot. We seem to be eternally interested in geniuses (even if their smarts are in the field of robbery.) Car chases, ambushes, gun fights, disguises, crime families... what's not to like!",8,1,2,2 January 2011
The Devil Wears Prada," Above average chick flick with humor, fashion and great acting.
","An enjoyable chick flick elevated by some great performances, lots of fashion sense, and common themes we can all identify with: balancing work and social life, trying to get ahead without sacrificing your morals, and the battle of pursuing a dream but not alienating family and friends.Meryl Streep was admirably awful, not her acting but her character. If this is an insight into the fashion industry, I certainly don't want to be a part of it. On the flip side, it's an intriguing world we get to see a glimpse of without being overwhelmed by insider-only lingo. Anne Hathaway also does well at creating a sympathetic character we can cheer for, even though we're pretty sure she's going to somehow win everybody over.This movie is like popcorn... easy and fun to eat, not too heavy but with good flavor. It definitely is above average in the chick flick genre, and I believe its appeal will be wider because of the humor and smarts. There's enough for the guys to enjoy with their gals, and I also appreciated it being a fairly clean movie. A few good moral dilemmas, but nothing you haven't experienced likely in your own work environment.But why do people toss cell phones into water? Turn the thing off and sell it on ebay!",8,1,2,16 March 2011
Disturbia," Cool mix of suspense, horror and teen romance with some great twisty story elements and admirable acting
","I haven't seen 'Rear Window' but I think this movie works just fine without being called a remake. I appreciated the pacing of story and how we didn't learn everything at once. Although it could be argued that this neighborhood has way too many people who don't go to work, it does make for a good story. Also makes you wonder what you might discover if you had a bird eye's view and all day to study your neighborhood.The setup was a little forced, but sufficient enough. The real fun begins when our 'hero' gets his Xbox and iTunes accounts deactivated and he's forced to fill his house arrest boredom by spying on the neighborhood. Luckily for him a cute girl moves in next door and another neighbor seems suspiciously like a serial killer in the news.There were a number of good plot twists and the traditional 'bad guy tells good lies in front of the cops' moments. It's also fun when the cute girl decides to check-in on her voyeuristic neighbor. I think it drags a bit in reaching its final conclusion, but not enough to ruin anything.If you like a little bit of scare from time to time but aren't a big fan of gore (maybe a little?) then you'll enjoy this movie!",8,1,2,16 February 2011
A Bug's Life," Fun, detailed and hilarious story about an ant who wants to make a difference.
","A real classic in animated children's movies, full of wit, humor, great characters and a story that appeals to all ages. Full of quotable lines and excellent voice talent, and one of the funniest 'outtake' reels ever created.The tale of a quirky inventor trying to make a difference for his colony is heart-warming and lesson filled. It strikes a chord in us all, the powerful need to make an impact, improve the world around us and better the lives of those we care about... especially when nobody believes you can do it! The humor has broad appeal. From some slapstick for the kids (Flick crashes into the river bed rocks)... to inside 'bug humor' (the grasshopper with a sign 'Kid pulled my wing's off') for those who understand more about the bug world. It's got jokes throughout the entire movie... even up to Heimlich sprouting little wings and saying 'From up here you all look little ants.' haha Not only are the visuals strikingly real in many places, but to take things down to the world of bugs creates a fascinating perspective on things. From raindrops that are like bombs to the 'city life' of a country house's junk pile. 'This stop, Deeeeead Rat!' Yes! All this, and more, from a 'kid's movie.' One mark of a great movie is that you watch it again and again over the years, and still manage to enjoy it every time you see it. That has certainly been the case for me with 'A Bug's Life.'",10,0,0,6 June 2011
Die Hard," Genre-defining, macho madness with a rarity in action films - some semblance of realism!
","This movie is as great now as it was when it came out - filled with snappy one-liners, awesome explosions, terrorists to stop and only one guy who can do it.Alan Rickman makes for a slimy, believable villain which ultimately gives us more reason to like the hero. Nothing ruins an action film like some stupid, pushover villain... or one of those meathead buffoons whose muscle mass impairs proper brain function.The everyday hero John McClane is made believable by Bruce Willis. It works so well because the situation is plausible, McClane has skill and knowledge (as a police officer) and he gets beat up, shot, cut, bruised, burned and more. He doesn't do a Rambo, but hides in the shadows just mucking with the bad guys plans often enough to really tick 'em off! You know a movie is special when the title becomes a useful summary in describing other films: 'Die Hard on a plane', 'Die Hard on a bus', 'Die Hard with a Femal Lead', etc. But it's the rare movie that balances the necessary elements so well: pacing, believability, acting, dialogue, ingenuity, and fun.See it again!",9,2,3,8 May 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Powerful, poetic and plausible! 'Wow' at the performances and 'Whoah' at the message
","Finally watched this movie 36 years after its theatrical release. Definitely a special combo of brilliant acting, anti-establishment vigor and messages of living life and standing up to oppression.I don't see this as a movie about mental health so much as the human spirit. Nurse Ratched is the epitome of freakish control, obeying rules no matter how inappropriate and showing an inability to see things from other people's perspectives. She truly is a scary villain... which makes McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) such a great hero.Yes, McMurphy has problems and a criminal past, but we cheer for his spirit to break free from the frightening halls of Nurse Ratched's mental ward. That's why we forgive his breaking rules, and boisterous persona... because it's hard to sit back and watch the human spirit trampled so thoroughly as it is inside that mental hospital.I really liked the movie, but it seems ranked a little too highly overall. Ranked #9 of all times at IMDb at the time of this writing... it just seems a tad over promoted. Perhaps nostalgia helps, of which I have none built up yet. It may also be that repeat viewings improve upon the feelings explored. But no doubt it's place on the MUST WATCH list is well warranted.",9,1,2,2 February 2011
Despicable Me," You're Despicable if you miss this one!
","A delightful surprise which was better than expected and an excellent family film. It's often a fine line to tread when trying to keep both adults & children entertained, and this movie successfully crosses the tight rope.Plenty of jokes for the adults, 'I said DART gun.... why do you have to be so.... old' but filled with plenty for the kids: great visual effects, comical yellow henchmen, believable children, an amusement park and more.Some of the action is a little over-the-top, as is quite common in this genre, but there were frequent breaks from the noise with a nice mix of softer, quiet scenes too. Voice-acting is excellent, with Steve Carell proving his versatility yet again. Another vocal bonus is the non-English bubbly language of Gru's little minions.Definitely in the upper echelon for family films, although not as deeply resonant or finely tuned as Pixar's best.",8,1,2,31 January 2011
Toy Story 3," Brilliant, Satisfying and Emotional! Pixar has added even more depth to the Toy Story franchise.
","Fantastic movie that boldly completes the trilogy in a satisfying, tear-wiping story of insight and meaning. It's a rare moment in film where the sequels continue getting better, adding context and depth each time which makes the whole more than just the parts.Pixar took a huge risk to revisit the movie (again!) which made it famous. Even more incredible is their willingness to risk marring this brand by advancing the storyline and tackling issues like friendship, freedom, purpose, milestones and letting go.It might not be as kid-friendly as the first two Toy Story movies, but then again, it's been 15 years since the first movie. The audience has grown-up, just as Andy has. I actually appreciate the story arc and trying to answer the eventual questions we all had - 'What happens AFTER Andy?' If you're concerned for your children... simply wait until they're a little older. I think it would've been less brilliant to simply try to copy the same formula from 1 & 2.I know that at some point early in the movie I stopped even thinking about animation or even toys as the movie is so well done all you see are characters. When they face the prospect of death together, it's as touching as if they were alive -- and after all, we've grown to know and love these characters too.For those that liked the first two better, just wait. We had YEARS of admiring them on repeat viewings. I think Toy Story 3 will gain in nostalgia value and eventually be seen as the perfect ending to the series. Even now I'm wistful thinking about that final scene, and the touching concern shown by Andy (and the writers) for our special friends.",10,0,1,5 February 2011
The Social Network," Thoroughly engrossing film about the origins of Facebook, the players behind it, and the reasons for the lawsuits that arose from its birth.
","Brilliant! I loved the pacing, the music, the acting and more... definitely one of the year's best! The dialogue and characters are unusual, fascinating, appealing... yet also somewhat repellent in their brilliance. We get a glimpse into the challenge of being a genius at the expense of social graces, but it's also that detachment from caring that provides some of the sharpest verbal comebacks. Stinging in their truthfulness, what normally might be left unsaid is a joy to see spoken with such disdain & conviction! If you have any bit of entrepreneurial spirit, you will be inspired by this movie. It's invigorating to see the incredible potential of one brilliant idea mixed with timing and understanding it's growth mechanisms (so as not to ruin the potential). Also important is the underlying message that poor business decisions and dishonesty will most likely bite you in the butt. The bigger the business, the bigger the dogs chasing you!",9,1,2,17 January 2011
The Fighter," Thoughtful elements with exciting boxing and superb acting!
","Hard-hitting (haha) drama about much more than boxing. It's about making tough choices when you need to change directions, perseverance and a family that loves each other even if they have some pretty crazy ways of showing it.This movie had me tense and on-the-edge... I had no idea going in what to expect, and there was no pre-ordained Hollywood ending. The fighting was realistic, although never took over the movie. It's not a boxing film, it's a story-driven look at two under-privileged brothers fighting for honor, to provide for their family and to do something with their lives.You might have heard of Christian Bale's Oscar-winning acting in this movie, and it is worthy. Mark Wahlberg is also great in a less demanding acting role (but more demanding physically!) The supporting cast rounds out the realistic and important family dynamics... excellent all around.I really enjoyed this film! It raises a number of issues and gets you thinking. What opportunities have you let go because of perceived 'duties.' Or are you ruining your life with drugs? If you're in a messed up family situation, is there something positive to grab on to? Can you find redeeming qualities and benefit from that? There is a lot of heart behind the hurt, and I know I'll watch it again someday. Just terrific.",9,0,1,1 April 2011
