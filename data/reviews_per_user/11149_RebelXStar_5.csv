Saturday Night Fever," The only way you're gonna survive is to do what you think is right, not what they keep trying to jam you into
","There are some movies that are referenced, parodied and talked about so much that when you finally get round to watching them, you go into them feeling like you've already seen them. Saturday Night Fever was one of those movies for me.After watching all of the pop-culture defining musical movies of the late seventies and eighties (Grease, Fame, Flashdance, Footloose, Dirty Dancing etc.) I went into Saturday Night Fever thinking I knew exactly what I was going to get.Imagine my surprise when far from being a lighthearted musical about the late seventies disco scene in the vein of 'Flashdance', it was a story about struggle, despair and desperation that was very dark and sometimes outright depressing - scenes of gang violence, a rape, an attempted rape, an accidental suicide and plenty of racist language - all set against a backdrop of disco music including the now iconic soundtrack by the BeeGees. I think when I first watched Saturday Night Fever I felt I was in a similar dissatisfied place and situation in my life as the movie's main character, Tony Manero (played with just the right amount of swagger and charm by John Travolta), a Brooklynite in his late teens who plods along in his day job at a paint store and lives for the weekends when he can let loose with his friends on a Saturday night at the local nightclub, where thanks to his good looks and dance talent, he is something of a local celebrity.Unlike his friends though, who seem to have no aspirations beyond going out, getting drunk and laid at the weekends, he knows that his lifestyle has a shelf-life and by his own admission dancing at the disco is one of only a few times and places he feels appreciated and worthy; even within his family he lives in the shadow of his older brother, Frank Jr., whom his family idolises due to his vocational choice to become a priest. When the opportunity to enter a dance competition at the nightclub arises he is convinced to enter with his friend, Annette, even though he is reluctant because he knows Annette is in love with him and he doesn't feel the same way for her.Then Tony meets Stephanie. On the surface, Stephanie seems to have it all together with a good job in Manhattan and a nice apartment but Tony soon realises that not all is as it seems with her.And unfortunately for Annette, Tony doesn't hesitate to trade Annette in for her as his dance partner, in the hopes of getting to know her better.While Stephanie's aloof and haughty manner makes it hard for a true romance to blossom between them, there is a definite chemistry and connection between when they dance. The more they get to know one another they realise they have similar goals and aspirations to rise above their humble surroundings and move on to better things.I watched this movie with a completely different set of eyes than the vast majority of IMDb it seems, as I don't see the relationships between the main characters the same way most view them at all. While most people seem to think that because Annette was objectively more attractive and adored Tony, that it was wrong of Tony to ditch her in favour of Stephanie, who acted like she was better than him, at least in the beginning. It's fairly obvious to me why Tony doesn't like being around Annette; she represents everything he hates about his current life and Stephanie represents where he wants to go. The relationship and friendship between Tony and Stephanie and especially the first scene of them dancing in the studio together, is one of the highlights of the movie for me. I think people take Stephanie's haughtiness too personally anyway.",8,4,4,19 December 2016
Singin' in the Rain," Make 'Em Laugh
","The year is 1927 and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the hottest couple on silent film.However, the industry is changing and with the arrival and success of the world's first talking picture,'The Jazz Singer' the studio must step up their game in order to compete.There is just one problem; while Lina was blessed with Hollywood starlet looks, her voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Oh, and she and Don can't stand each other. Their romance is all for show, but only Don seems to know it.Instead, he is in love with Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an aspiring actress he meets one night while he is being chased by adoring fans.When Don and Lina's first talking picture 'The Dueling Cavelier' bombs at a test screening, Don enlists the help of Kathy and his best friend, Cosmo (Donald O' Connor) to save his career.They come up with a plan to turn the movie into a musical, using Kathy's voice dubbed over Lina's. But when Lina finds out she takes revenge by insisting that Kathy keeps dubbing her voice in future movies, putting Kathy's own career in jeopardy.I'm not even exaggerating when I say the amount of energy everyone, especially Gene Kelly and Donald O' Connor, emit during their performances in this movie is immense and it's exhilarating to watch.When filming the sequence for the movie's title song where Don reflects on how happy his blossoming romance with Kathy makes him, Gene was giving it his all despite suffering with a fever at the time.My personal favourite song numbers include Donald O' Connor singing 'Make 'em Laugh' where Cosmo impresses upon Don the correlation of humour and success in Hollywood, and the ballet number during the Broadway Melody sequence.Is there any point talking about the direction or cinematography? Not really; though the cinematography during the ballet sequence and the scene where Don sings 'You were Meant for Me' to Kathy is especially beautiful, it's all pretty much perfect.",10,1,3,4 November 2015
Jaws," This was no boat accident
","When a man-eating Great White shark makes the shores of Amity it's feeding ground and closing the beaches isn't an option because the island's summer tourist trade will be affected, hydrophobic police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) enlists the help of marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) to help him hunt the beast.Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws is a rare case of the movie being considered better than the book, cutting out much of the novel's miscellany (including a mafia and marital infidelity plot line) choosing to focus only the battle between man and beast giving a more concise and concentrated story, quite literally throwing you in at the deep end with the demise of doomed free-spirited skinny dipper, Chrissie in the opening scene.Often quoted as being the first big summer blockbuster--and the movie certainly was successful--I resent the label as it implies that Jaws has nothing of substance to offer. While the scenes on and in the water provide the thrills, the scenes on dry land show and develop well-rounded and engaging characters that you truly want to root for. All three of the main male characters are superb in their respective roles.Robert Shaw as tough sea-dog, Quint is a fan favourite, however I find myself far more drawn to out-of-depth everyman Brody and science minded Hooper. With that said, Shaw plays the part perfectly and his delivery of the USS Indianapolis speech is chilling and one of the great moments in cinema.Of course I couldn't review Jaws without mentioning John William's brilliant music score. The Jaws theme did for swimming what Psycho did for taking showers; just those first few notes alone have the ability to strike fear into the minds of anyone who dares step into the water.",10,2,4,7 December 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Oh, baby. Welcome to my world.
","When handsome billionaire and closeted sexual dominant, Christian Grey meets timid, virginal college girl Anastasia 'Ana' Steele he sees great submissive potential in her and goes to great lengths to pursue her.And by 'great lengths' I mean try to control every aspect of her life and by 'pursue' I mean stalk her relentlessly.For obvious reasons I went into this movie with very low expectations, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Don't get me wrong, it's bad; a given seeing as though the source material it's based upon is bad... and the source material that's based upon is bad. But a lot of what is wrong with it is mostly due to E.L. James' problematic writing, which I can't fully blame upon the film makers (who, to give credit where it's due, seemed to go out of their way to make a glossy, slick looking movie.)For example, when Christian declares, 'I don't 'make love'. I ****... hard' to Ana only then to apparently 'make love' to her in the very next scene after she reveals to him that she is still a virgin.Or how he repeatedly tells her that he is not good for her and she is to stay away from him, but when she does exactly that he pursues her and tries to persuade her yet again to become his submissive.Or how Ana keeps asking Christian to show her what she's in for if she agrees to his demands and then getting angry when she doesn't like it.She redeems herself slightly in the contract negotiation scene where she tries to meet him halfway by agreeing to the things that she is comfortable with and eliminating the things that she isn't, but then she's right back to agreeing to letting him do what he wants to her and getting upset when she doesn't like it.Well, you get the idea.",5,0,2,22 March 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Whatever you do, don't fall asleep
","When Nancy Thompson's best friend, Tina is brutally murdered by her boyfriend, Rod, she isn't one hundred percent sure that he is the culprit even though all evidence suggests that he is.The day Tina died, she confessed to Nancy that she'd had a nightmare, so terrifying that it left her fearing for her life. She'd dreamt that she was being chased through a dark boiler room by a horribly burnt man named Freddy, who was trying to kill her with a bladed glove. A typical nightmare, except that Nancy had the exact same dream.After Rod confesses to Nancy that he, too, dreamt of Freddy and is found hanged after Nancy dreams that Freddy visited him in jail, it confirms her suspicions that he is not the real killer and that something much more sinister is going on.The nightmares start escalating and she begins to wake up with real injuries on her body after having them inflicted upon her during her dreams, until she is literally forced to stay awake in order to stay alive.Nancy starts to believe that she is going crazy until her alcoholic mother confesses that Freddy was once a real person; a serial child killer who was burned to death by outraged vigilante parents when Freddy evaded jail due to a technicality.After she discovers that she is able to pull objects from her dreams into the real world, Nancy sees this as an opportunity to defeat Freddy and take back control of her dreams and her life.A Nightmare on Elm Street came out at a time when the slasher genre was getting very stale but writer and director Wes Craven managed to put a unique and refreshing spin on it.In contrast to the fictional movie serial killers that came before him (Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason) Freddy is neither mute nor robotic. Instead, he is very animated and relishes in verbally taunting his victims before he kills them. Robert Englund was clearly having the time of his life playing Freddy; so much so that it has become synonymous with him as an actor and it's hard to picture anyone else in the role (sorry Jackie Earl Haley) and he even went on to star in all seven sequels (eight, including Freddy vs. Jason) plus the short lived TV series 'Freddy's Nightmares.'Heather Langenkamp does a decent job as Nancy, and is everything a horror movie heroine should be; vulnerable but strong.Johnny Depp provides some delectable eye candy as Nancy's boyfriend in his first movie role. I have personally never seen Ronee Blakley act in anything else (supposedly she is a credible actress), but I have a hard time deciding if she is just bad in the role of Nancy's mother, or whether it was a conscious acting choice to play her as over dramatic and over the top to make her seem more detached and in denial of the situation.",7,0,1,9 November 2015
