3:10 to Yuma," Fabulous!
","Russell Crowe and Christian Bale and all the other actors were superb! I think this will stand out as another one of the great westerns to see and re-see over and over. Really happy we saw it! (And I didn't know I would like a western like this.) The plot, action and anticipation were right on. The great acting is the most important thing to me, no matter how good a story it is, and that didn't disappoint at all. It makes me want to see another movie with Russell Crow and Christian Bale, either together or separately, it doesn't matter. Christian Bale's 'son' also did a great job acting very convincingly. I will definitely buy this movie on DVD later and watch it again and again!",10,2,5,10 September 2007
The Illusionist," Great independent film!
","We just saw this movie today and we both thought it was fantastic. Jessica's acting was great as were all the others. I was surprised and delighted to see such an exceptionally good film in the theater. Edward and Paul's acting -- in fact all of the cast -- were wonderful. This is a unique film. The story/plot also have a lot to do with this. Excellent. It's at the top of my list for this year. I think the writing deserves a lot of credit along with the superb acting to keep the audience's interest throughout. There were no superfluous words unnecessary to the script or story. To keep us guessing in the movies is not easy to do, yet this movie accomplished just that.",10,1,2,27 August 2006
