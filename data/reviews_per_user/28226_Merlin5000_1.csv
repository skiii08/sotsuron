The Expendables 2," Garbage....
","This movie is an awesomely awful repetition of cliché after cliché after cliché!!The tired lines get old real quick. I guess the star power is driving the rating. This movie seemed more like a night out with the guys drinking. Oh wait, they all decided to blow stuff up!! hit record and call it Expendables 2.Too big of a budget for such a lack luster experience. I felt cheated.What a waste of time for me. If you like it hey, enjoy.My favorite part was seeing the credits roll. LOL.",1,1,3,9 November 2012
