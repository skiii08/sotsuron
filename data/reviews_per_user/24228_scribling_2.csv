Sucker Punch," The greatest film ever!
","The imagery on screen in this film is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. There is some dialog and filler between the incredible awesomeness that we could really do without, but other than that, it's unbelievable. I'm not kidding. This movie was truly awesome in the true sense of the word. I've never read a comic book in my life but if this is what comics are like - I love comics! Movies just don't get any cooler than this. I couldn't care less about the storyline. I don't even know if they were speaking English. This movie has style right from frame one. Aaron Simms shows his brilliance. Aaron is amazing. I have never been as slack-jaw awe stuck watching as film as I was with Sucker Punch. I'm going to edit my copy down to the hour or so that it should be and watch it every night. I imagine that not only is it fun to watch but it must have been fun to make. It has all the shots and camera moves that we've all wanted to see and do - but no one was ever been brave enough to do.",10,1,3,22 September 2011
Get Out," I like it better when it was called 'The Stepford Wives.'
","Weak plot, no character development, no plot twist, not scary, not dramatic ... Just ridiculous. I cannot understand why people say they like this one dimensional movie. There were skits on Key and Peele that were much more entertaining and original.",3,4,17,19 March 2018
