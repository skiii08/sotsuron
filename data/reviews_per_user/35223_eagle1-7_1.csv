The Blair Witch Project," True Imagination at Work
","I just caught this particular movie on cable last night. It was just about 60 minutes into the movie. My wife who was with me had paid to see this movie at the theater(she regretted that.) I had to agree with her assessment of the movie at the time. However after viewing these user comments on this site, I have to agree that this is a very scary movie because it lets your imagination go wild!!!!!  Who hasn't been out in the woods alone at night hearing strange and terrifying sounds that make you want to barrel back home. Why do you think Halloween is so fun;because of the dark and strange sights that inhabit the streets and towns on that night. Not to mention the weird sounds. There are still alot of people still afraid of the dark(even if they would never admit it to you) much less the woods. I will now admit that I can't go out to the woods by myself, it creeps me out. It is a primal fear of the unknown. It is something learned from movies, Hollywood, bad childhood experiences. Whenever I try to do this thing my heart starts to pump furiously as if it is preparing my body to flee something that my mind cannot detect!! Maybe this is an anxiety attack. I don't know. My wife experiences the same thing if I try to get her to ride a roller coaster!So we have something in common. I remember one time when I was a kid and walking along the road to the store late one night when all you heard at that hour was a dog barking. All of a sudden, from out of the night emerged a loud whirring sound, that caused my adrenaline to pump like mad, and resulted in my legs starting to move my feet so fast, that I actually peeled out in the gravel and fell down. It was just then I looked up  in the direction of the sound not finding  a flying saucer but somebody moving their rotatable antenna. So you see our imagination can scare us or help us as in inventing things that will help others. It is all in how you look at it. Just this past summer I and my wife took a trip to Canada, and one of the things that I had always wanted to do was take a seaplane ride. We were given directions to this destination.It was 50 miles away! My wife told me we should get some gas first as our gas meter was just under half a tank, but I figured that we had enough. I thought that our way of travel would be on paved roads but as it turned out, it could have been the same road those men traveled in 'A Fire From The Sky' It was a turning, twisting dusty road that slowed us down quite abit. I was trying to get to the place before nightfall, but my wife wanted me to slow down because she was afraid we would be killed. What was driving me to push our car beyond it's limits, again that primal fear. We made it before the nighttime, thank God!!I hope that my comments help someone who has the same fear\s to recongise this. It seems the only time someone gets help with these things is when it is mentioned in Ann Landers, or some other outlet.",Null,0,1,2 October 2000
