Black Swan," Mediocre
","I really don't understand what so many reviewers saw in this movie. I don't want to overreact and say it is terrible, but there is nothing in it that inspires or makes one think. It is a well made film. The directing is good, the performance by Natalie Portman is very believable. However, the problem with the movie is that Nina - the main character is flat and uninteresting. Right from the beginning of the movie the viewer is lead to believe that Nina is good, but all I saw is a confused and obsessed individual. She does not love anyone, she has no friends, she does not care about anyone... The only bright spot is her dream to become a leading ballerina in a Swan Lake production, however the movie never really explains why this dream is important to her, and for this reason it is hard to see this dream as anything but another of Nina's obsessions. In short, I just didn't find anything in this movie worth watching. And while I can't say I regret watching it, I would not recommend it either.",6,37,56,22 February 2011
The Hangover," brainless and overrated
","This movie is completely brainless. I don't think that a movie filled with toilet jokes without a hint of intelligence is necessarily bad. Sometimes it's good to watch something like Down the Periscope, Police Academy or the like. But usually those movies have a corresponding rating on IMDb. I do not see how Hangover is in any way superior to any of the movies of its kind. It is forgettable and bland. I do not say that it is completely unfunny, but neither is it original. If you need to waste about 2 hours of your life, while drinking a couple of beers with friends this movie is not a bad choice (although not the best in my opinion), but you would also not miss a thing if you never watched Hangover.",5,1,2,25 December 2011
Batman Returns," The worst movie I've ever saw.
","This movie is bad beyond belief. I don't know, perhaps, there are worse movies than this one, I just haven't seen them. And I am not the kind of person, who would say it about any movie that I did not like. I never gave a movie 1 star before. I do not believe in giving a movie 1 star if I think it is over-hyped or I disagree with the high ratings it received here on IMDb. I would give it 4/10 3/10, whatever I think it deserves in my opinion. And Batman Returns is still 1/10 for me. Everything about it is bad. There is not much story to speak of. There is Batman/Bruce Wayne, the rich man, who fights bad guys. There is not 1 additional thing in the movie that we learn about his character. What are his motivations? Not a word. There is another rich man Max Shreck - he is bad. Nothing more to say about him. Does he care about anything (his money, his power, women, other people idolizing him). Well we do not learn anything about him either. There is Penguin. We know his parents abandoned him, because he was a freak of nature and he has disgusting habits. Well, he is disgusting, I get it from the first introduction do I need the whole movie about seeing him do terrible things to others... But I am not expecting much out of a story. It is a superhero movie. They don't usually offer much in terms of character development. Although, this movie is the worst one of the pack. However, the story is not the worst part. What is truly terrible is the acting! Should I call it amateurish. No I think it would be offensive to amteur actors. I honestly believe that if somebody just picked up some random people from the street and cast them they would come off more believable, more human-like than what we see in this ... garbage movie. And some last remarks. I am no writer, but I can create a better script in a couple of days. I am no director, but I can create a better movie than this stinker. P.S. Usually when I watch a bad movie, I just start making fun of how unbelievable the script or terrible the acting is. This piece of crap is beyond my capacity for humor. I was bored out of my mind and finished watching the movie only because I was astonished by how terrible it was.",1,5,18,4 May 2012
Coco," Predictable, unoriginal, but well executed
","For me Pixar has become synonymous with a new way of making fairy-tales that has both the fantasy setting and themes associated with traditional fairy tales, yet at the same time unconventional characters, and original stories that would be interesting for an adult to watch even if the kids are not around. Coco however is much more of a typical Disney movie full of one-dimensional characters and completely unoriginal plot where one can guess the ending after watching the first five minutes. It is a well executed animation, that does a pretty decent job of keeping your attention while it is still going, but it leaves absolutely nothing behind, the moment it is over. It was a great idea to set this during the day of the dead Mexican festival, yet one original idea about the setting is simply not enough to make a a full-featured film around.",6,0,5,7 January 2019
Sin City," Unbelievably boring
","I first tried to watch Sin City about 2 years ago and ended up turning it off after about 15 minutes thinking what a piece of garbage. However, I generally trust IMDb ratings especially when the number of people who rated the movie are more than 100,000. So today I decided to give it another chance... this time I turned it off after 30 minutes, and this time I am sure that I will never watch it again. It is not the violence, which I don't really mind. I like Reservoir Dogs, or Kill Bill. I love Pulp Fiction. They are also violent movies, but they have human beings as their main characters. The characters are sometimes sadistic, unpleasant, evil, etc, but still human. Sin City on the other hand is about comic book characters, who have nothing human in them, except maybe for the bodies, and even the bodies can take countless bullets, hits to the head by sledge hammers, or be repeatedly hit by a car without showing any ill effects 10 minutes later. Well, I can also watch a fairy tale and completely suspend the disbelief if that is needed for the advancement of the story. But there is no story in the movie either. A fifth grader could've come up with a deeper plot, and a five year old experienced more complicated emotions than any of the 'characters' in this movie. However, despite my general dislike for the movie, I tried to be objective in my ratings. It had quite good visuals, and that is why I give it a 3. But if you want to watch a movie that has something, beside a series of stunning pictures, stay away. And when I use the phrase movie has something, beside stunning pictures I do not mean deep meaning, real life problems, I mean it as an opposite of complete void, because Superman, or Die Hard are Shakesperean tragedies compared to this garbage.",3,1,3,20 April 2012
