Sucker Punch," You can't ask for anything more than THIS!
","I had high hopes for this movie and it did NOT disappoint. The movie is full of action and suspense. The action scenes in the movie are perfectly made,taking you into a new world that seems like video games. It leaves you hanging to know what will happen. The story likewise is simple but very nice and leaves you thinking. The twists and turns are awesome. The VISUALS <3 WOW.It's what makes Zack Snyder's movies special. I won't spoil the movie for you,but the movie is a must-watch =D Also, I really liked the fact that the movie is not in 3D. Just because a movie is in 3D doesn't make it nice. I am really glad Zack Snyder didn't make this movie into 3D.All in all, GREAT movie.",9,46,90,24 March 2011
