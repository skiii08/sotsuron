Alien 3," A step down from the first 2
","I watched the extended cut of this film, so I don't know about the normal cut. Unlike others I think the movie is good. I understand what the directors was trying to do, but I feel like it wasn't the best executed film. It feels like a prison drama in space with tacked on alien aspects more than an alien movie. I do like many aspects of this movie. I like how the alien comes out of an ox (or dog depending on the cut you watch), I enjoy how the tone of film was shift immediately as soon as the movie starts, I like how the film is suspenseful, and I like the twist and the ending. While the suspense in the movie is great it can be very boring at points. I love the score in the film. I also like how they tried to reinvent the shape of the Xenomorph. I also like how it is revealed how Ripley has a alien inside of her and how she has to sacrifice herself to save everyone else. There is many faults in logic in this movie also. How did a alien get on the ship in the first place. I also think that the effects are crap. You might think that this make sense because it is a 28 year old movie, but the first and second Alien have much better effects that still hold up today even though they came out 12 and 6 years before respectively. The pov shots are also way over used. Even though this movie has several flaws it is still good, but no where near the masterpieces that are Alien and Aliens.",7,0,1,16 June 2020
Gremlins," My Favorite Movie
","This is a classic film. It is my favorite film of all time ever since I first watched this movie. It perfectly balances horror and comedy elements and is in my opinion better than Ghostbusters, ET, and Back to the Future. If you haven't already seen this film then you should immediately",10,1,2,11 June 2020
Alien: Resurrection," A disappointing and cringe piece of garbage
","This movie is bad on every level. The tone feels confused trying to be lighthearted and serious and the same time, but ends up a mess. Unlike alien and aliens or even alien 3, which have a cast of characters that have great personality, this film has a cast of gimmicky good for nothing characters. Not even Ripley could save this movie, because in this film she isn't playing herself. She is playing a clone of herself, so even time she is in the movie she seems confused and over sexualizes aspects of her personality. They also feature the aliens way to much in this film taking out any suspense that could possibly be there. The are also many scenes including the spider scene and the overly insane chestbursting scene (if you watch the movie you will know what I mean) where I can't help but laugh at how absurd the movie is. I do like the twist at the end to an extent, but it is very poorly executed and the new design of the newborn is terrible, the scene where Ripley finds failed clones of herself is very powerful, but not as well executed as it could be. I found the death of the newborn hilarious even though I don't think it was supposed to be. I don't recommend this film, because even though it has so bad it's good moments, most of the film is either boring or bewildering. At least something like Batman and Robin is funny all the way through. This is just a sad excuse for an Alien film and seeing as Alien 3 wraps up this TRILOGY perfectly please for the love of God skip this one.",3,0,1,21 June 2020
