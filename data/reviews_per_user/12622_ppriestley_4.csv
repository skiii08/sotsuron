The Avengers," Extremely Overrated, just your average action movie.
","Went to see this with low expectations and it was just as bad as I thought it would be, very overrated.All the lead up films are average, Incredible Hulk was OK and Captain America and Thor are poor films but the two Iron Man films are pretty good but not brilliant.There's so many story lines they could have done to make this film brilliant but the storyline reminds me a lot of Transformers 3 except this has a bunch of superheroes instead of robots, the same old storyline of the bad guys want to take over planet earth and the big problem with this film is we never really care about any of the characters, there's no emotion in this film whatsoever. This is a major spoiler don't read this part if you don't want to; Agent Coulson who is in the lead up films, dies and they try to make it emotional but none of the superheroes really care except maybe Iron Man but he's not that upset about it.As for the acting performances they're all poor, the only actor who can come out of this film with any credit is Robert Downey Jnr who is the reason I'm giving it a three out of ten, he is the stand out performance in this star studded cast, he is very good as Tony Stark/Iron Man and is the only good thing about the film. As for the rest of the cast they are all poor performances which is surprising because it such a good cast; Scarlett Johannson is bad as Black Widow and as for Jeremy Renner, he doesn't get much screen time as Hawkeye, there's a little bit of a story between these two characters but they never expand on it. Chris Evans gives a wooden performance as Captain America, for me doesn't make a good Captain America. And Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk is a slight improvement on Edward Norton but not brilliant.Then there's the villain Loki played by Tom Hiddleston who is so cheesy and predictable it is unreal and there's nothing threatening about him at all and with some saying the best villain ever, must be joking, he's a joke.So to conclude, I don't know how this has got a 8.6 rating so don't believe how all the hype and fan boys, it is on a par with Transformers 3 which is not a good thing, just non-stop action for no particular reason, to sum up a very poor 3/10 when they could have done it so much better.",3,4,19,30 June 2012
Warrior," As good as Rocky!
","Went to see this film on it's opening night last year and I was blown away, Warrior is the best fighting film since Rocky all those years ago, that's the best accolade I can give it.The story is brilliant, the script is cheesy at times but is very good. As for the acting, it's top class all across the board, but Nick Nolte & Tom Hardy are the standout performances for me. Nick Nolte's performance as the former alcoholic father of Tommy(Tom Hardy) & Brendan(Joel Edgerton) is absolutely brilliant and the scene between him and Hardy is very emotional and probably Nolte's best scene.And then one of the most talented actors around at the moment, Tom Hardy who plays Tommy Riordan a former marine who returns with a chip on a shoulder and is an unbeaten MMA fighter since he school days and Tom plays this role to perfection and if it were up to me, he'd be up for an Oscar along with Nick Nolte who also rightly deserves the nomination.And Joel Edgerton who plays Brendan, who's settled down to a family lifestyle and works as a teacher but is in debt and Joel Edgerton also pulls out a great performance.The action scenes and fights are very hard hitting but what makes it brilliant is the story of the brothers and the emotion in the film. There's certain plot holes and problems with the film like there is in any film but the 2 hours and 20 minutes fly by.The ending is one of my favourite endings, but it is a little bit corny but I loved it and a couple of scenes made me cry, the ending will make you tear up at least, made me cry anyway.You need to watch Warrior because for me it was the film of 2011 and one of my favourite films of all-time.",10,1,4,7 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," One of the best film I've ever seen, the best trilogy of all-time.
","The Dark Knight Rises was the best cinematic experience I've ever had and the film doesn't live up to the hype, it exceeds it.The film is near perfect, the acting, writing and cinematography is outstanding and what I liked about it was Christopher Nolan and Wally Physter who has been Nolan's cinematographer for Nolan's last 4 films don't use much CGI, he tries to keep it a realistic as he can, not like Transformers and Avengers, it looks impressive but I prefer Nolan's filmmaking. Glad it wasn't in 3D, I watched it in IMAX for the first time, it was unbelievable especially the prologue involving Bane and a plane.As for the acting, Christian Bale pulls out his best performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, slightly better than his performance in Batman Begins and Dark Knight, Michael Caine is brilliant as always as Alfred and a couple of scenes involving Alfred and Bruce Wayne are very emotional. Tom Hardy who I am a big fan of, he's brilliant in warrior and I think he deserved an Oscar for his role as Tommy Conlon and is great in just about everything he's in and same goes for this, he is menacing and very powerful as bane and as for the voice, I could hear him fine, there's no issue with the voice. Gary Oldham as Jim Gordon is excellent as always and so is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. What surprised me was how good Anne Hathaway was as Catwoman, she's elegant, sexy and tough, all the qualities needed to play Selina Kyle and dare I say it, she's much better than Michelle Pheiffer's Catwoman in Batman Returns, she's mesmerising. The newcomers in Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Miranda Tate and John Blake, firstly Marion Cotillard who plays a Wayne enterprises businesswoman and major spoilers ahead so don't read if you haven't seen it yet, Miranda Tate turns out to be the daughter of Ra's Al Ghul who trained Bruce Wayne n Batman Begins and she come to finish the job with Bane as her protector and John Blake is played brilliantly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, him and Anne Hathaway were the stand out performers in this movie for me, he is like a young Jim Gordon and the ending is jaw droppingly good, for me Gordon-Levitt is fast becoming one of the best actors in Hollywood.As for the story, it is near perfection and that is down to the genius of Christopher Nolan and his brother Johnathan, this film brings everything full circle and ties all the films together. the film is 2 hours 45 minutes but it absolutely flies by, it's thrilling from start to finish. The only issue I had with the plot was Bane's killing was a bit quick, all the build up and Catwoman just shoots him and he's dead, I think he needed more of an prolonged, I wanted to see him suffer for what he all did and Talia Al Ghul reveal I thought undermined Bane as just a henchman a bit but over than that, the plot is fantastic.The ending has caused some debate but I don't know why, it's pretty definitive and is a fantastic ending to a fantastic trilogy. Batman takes the bomb away from the city and saves the day but does he survive? It's pretty obvious to me that he's alive, Alfred sees him at the caf√© with Selina Kyle and it's not a dream, he fixed the autopilot and survived. And Blake revealing his legal name as Robin, I jumped out of my seat and seeing the bat cave at the end and becoming Robin or night wing whatever, Nolan's ending are always genius. Just because Nolan made Inception doesn't mean every ending he does is open to interpretation, but I can't see a robin film, as good as an actor Gordon-Levitt is, it just wouldn't work. I have to talk about the director of the franchise, Christopher Nolan who for me is the best director of our time and soon he will be up there with Kubrick, Hitchcock and Scorcese, if he isn't already. The three best directors for me are Nolan, David Fincher & Quentin Tarantino but Nolan is the best of the three, Fincher's very good but not as good as Nolan and Tarantino is a genius with his early films but hes made some bad films and comes across as a big head. But Nolan just produces masterpiece after masterpiece, the dark knight trilogy in my opinion is the best trilogy of all-time, the prestige is a very underrated film, memento, Insomnia and the Following and Inception, they're all great films. Nolan is a movie genius and deserves an Oscar for this film, it's an incredible achievement and it's about time he starts to be recognised for his incredible work. He makes these blockbusters but with a great story so the explosions and violence is an integral part of the story and not just an excuse to show off. The batman reboot that is rumoured should not be made because no one will top Nolan's interpretation of the batman story, just look at the Spider-Man films,the originals were very good except 3 but they made the remake this year and it was very poor, can't imagine how anything will top the Dark Knight Trilogy in the new batman movies, it's an impossible task, I for one wouldn't want to take Batman story on after Nolan.To conclude, you have to see this movie, it's the best comic book movie ever, it's slightly better than the Dark Knight and if it doesn't win best picture at the Oscars never mind nominated, the people who run the Oscars need there heads testing. My prediction Nolan best director and best picture and Joseph Gordon-Levitt best supporting actor.Astonishingly good. 10/10",10,9,18,31 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Explosions and no story, Typical Michael Bay.
","This film is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. There's no doubt it will be a commercial success but as a Film it is absolutely shocking.It starts off with Sam trying to get a job and some rubbish about the Russians and the dark side of the moon, then you get Robots fighting for 1 and 3/4 hours over something you don't care about, the final scene lasts a whole hour which drags like hell.As for the performances, Shia LeBouf is same old shouting Optimus a lot and screaming. The newcomer in Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is an abysmal performance and can't really see her hitting Hollywood movies, she should stick to the modelling.As for the 3D aspect, I only saw in 2D so don't know how impressive that is but a couple of action scenes are visually stunning but thats it's only positive.So I'd give the film probably a 1 out of 10, couple of good action scenes, hardly any story to it and terrible acting Performances. Another shocker from Michael Bay.",1,19,39,9 July 2011
