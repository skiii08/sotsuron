Kill Bill: Vol. 2," jusco's review: Kill Bill: Vol. 2
","Was I satisfied with the finale of Tarantino's epic 4-hour Kill Bill (I combine Vol. 1 and 2 because you can't watch one volume and not watch the other; it's the same as watching just half of any film)? Yes. Did Vol. 2 reach the high standards set by Vol. 1? Not quite, but nevertheless it was still entertaining. Immediately, you'll realise that there is more talking and less action than in the first volume. Several things happen: The Bride deals with the final two assassins, a flashback of her martial arts training with a Chinese master is shown and we finally get to see Bill (his face was unrevealed in the first volume).The pace significantly slowed down in comparison to its predecessor but it does relatively manage to maintain the suspense just enough to keep us riveted. A long-drawn flashback to the events that occurred in The Bride's wedding chapel was much too lengthy for its own good and unnecessary. The Bride's interaction with the last two assassins felt a bit disappointing. This time, it is China and its martial arts that provide the bulk of homages in the film (the first volume being Japan), presenting Pai Mei, the legendary master who teaches The Bride.But it is David Carradine that shines as Bill. My first impression of his performance as the titular character was that it felt much too unnatural, too over-acted. But overtime, I came to accept that it was unusually fitting of the ruthless nature unique to his particular character. The way he talks, every move he makes seems perfectly calculated. We come to understand why people fear him. Bill is deadly, make no mistake.Though not as commendable as Vol. 1, Vol. 2 brings sufficient closure to one of Tarantino's greatest films. It was an exceptional ride and you can only feel happy for The Bride at the end. People ask what's the point of this film; but then again, our world craves senseless violence, so I think I can confidently state the reason why this film is so popular is because there are a lot of people out there entertained by excessive violence. The threatening consequences of our dying morals is a topic for another time. I suspect this full-length feature inclusive of Vol. 1 and 2 was made for the sole intention of gratifying Tarantino's infatuation to create something that is just shocking and purely violent. Talk about intense self-indulgence. But if we were ultimately entertained, I guess that can be pardoned.",7,0,1,24 December 2010
Shaun of the Dead," jusco's review: Shaun of the Dead
","What do you get when you put the apocalypse, zombies and the chaotic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together? You get Shaun of the Dead, a marvelously crafted, written and acted comedy with everything thrown in: troublesome parental relations, a girlfriend who's drifting away, idiotic and exasperating friends and of course, a ton of zombies and Simon Pegg armed with a cricket bat to bash their heads in. Brilliantly written by both Pegg and Edgar Wright, it is the first and solid debut of three films that form the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy (Hot Fuzz, the second film, is even more hilarious and a must-watch).Pegg plays Shaun; 29-years-old, struggling to please his girlfriend and doesn't know what to do with his life. Frost plays his housemate, Ed, who is just well, crude. The two find themselves awaking one morning to find the apocalypse at their doorstep; or more specifically, too many zombies wandering in the streets trying to eat people up. Shaun teams up with his friends and parents and decides to do something about it, for once in his life. So begins the mass killing of zombies accompanied by the audience's laughter the entire journey.This is a hilarious film and both Pegg and Wright have already established themselves among the best in comedic writing. Though there are those who don't find zombies as exciting, the humour is enough to give it a watch. The clever plays by the cast combined with the irresistible and gory bashing of zombies makes for a film that provides Shaun with a new focus and meaning in life. It doesn't quite contain deep and moral lessons for us, but it's entertaining, and that's all that matters.",8,0,2,2 January 2011
Snatch," jusco's review: Snatch
","Snatch is an eccentric, original film that combines both gangster and comedic elements to create a relatively successful and refreshing film ('original' is subjective; it's supposedly too similar to Guy Ritchie's previous film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but then again I haven't seen that yet). The plot follows two interlinked story lines set in the London criminal underworld: one revolves around an attempt by several parties to steal an 86 carat diamond, the other about a boxing promoter and his unfortunate dealings with an unmerciful gangster. Despite the seemingly simple plot, the various twists and turns are surprising and even hilariously absurd. Think deadpan comedy with imposing guns and terrifically witty dialogue. It's like watching a slapstick cartoon come to life. Edited rather stylistically, contrary to the conventional theatrical manner, it moves at a faster pace than most films and has a cool, fitting accompanying soundtrack.This film features an impressive ensemble of actors (I just now realise the lack of female characters; this is a 'manly' film). But the two standouts were Jason Statham and Brad Pitt, two widely-known actors; the former known for being one of the iconic 'action heroes' in films such as The Transporter, Crank and The Expendables, the latter known for being a 'pretty-boy-but-still-immensely-talented actor' in films such as Seven, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, just to name a few. Imagine my surprise then at Jason Statham's impressive delivery of Guy Ritchie's brilliantly written dialogue. I was unimpressed with his action flick performances, but in Snatch, he proves he is capable of more than just throwing punches and shooting guns. Brad Pitt had an interesting character to play; how did he pull off so well an Irish gypsy (or derogatorily known as 'pikey') who excels in bare-knuckle boxing, is obsessed with his mum and whose heavily-accented words are completely indecipherable? One of my favourite of his performances.Snatch thrives on the ability to entertain audiences with its unique deliverance, laugh-out-loud dialogue and outrageous happenings. However, that's as far as it goes. Halfway through the film, the dialogue starts to feel a bit stale and overdone, the style of editing is a bit vexing and the story seems to go nowhere. Some of the performances were mediocre, as if the actors were unable to grasp the true character they were tasked to play. This was one of the films where the entire journey failed to overrule the unsatisfactory ending. This film is smart, make no mistake, but Guy Ritchie shouldn't have overdone it for his own good.",6,0,2,24 December 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," jusco's review: El laberinto del fauno (Pan's Labyrinth)
","I was hesitant to watch Pan's Labyrinth with high expectations despite hearing nothing but rave reviews, lest I end up disappointed, but I was foolish to even worry in the first place; del Toro has created a captivating masterpiece. A Spanish-language dark fantasy (watch in Spanish with English subtitles), it's a fascinating journey into a young girl's adventurous mind and the courage, often lacked even by adults, which she musters to overcome her fears and the hardships she faces.Very simply, the premise is this: Ofelia, a young girl, travels with her pregnant mum to a mill in the middle of the Spanish woods where her stepfather, a heartless Captain, is leading a group of men against the remaining remnants of several Spanish Maquis. She stumbles across a fairy and a faun located deep inside a labyrinth who assigns three dangerous tasks for her to complete. For what reason, and whether she completes them, you'll have to watch to find out.The strength lies in several areas, but most notably in Ivana Baquero's stellar performance as Ofelia (she was only 11 at the time!) and the various supporting roles. In fact, it's unfair to label the other actors/actresses as supporting characters as they held considerably main roles as well. Maribel Verdú, as the caring housekeeper, Mercedes, carried out an especially powerful and astounding performance (I knew I recognised her somewhere; ah, right! She was in Y tu mamá también, portraying a very different character).In addition to the acting, the Cinematography and Art Direction is superb (it didn't win those Academy Awards for nothing!). The shots (especially the panning shots) are so natural but integral to the film, providing well balanced pacing and expertly works the audience's emotions.But what establishes this film as different from other fantasy films is not only the creepy fantasy element (do remember, it is a dark film), but also the intense and thrilling background story of the conflict between the Fascist regime led by the Captain against the rebelling anarchists. In fact, the war element is just as strong as the fantasy element. They both surprisingly and naturally work well together.Highly recommended, and if you have the chance, do watch it. It's been a while since I was so emotionally attached to a film. You're in for an electrifying ride, I guarantee it.Personal Highlights: In one of the tasks entrusted to Ofelia, del Toro crafts one of the most riveting and suspense-filled scenes in the entire film, carried out brilliantly by Ivana. According to del Toro, Stephen King, the master of horror, squirmed during this very scene!",10,3,8,24 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," jusco's review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1
","Bravo, David Yates. You have done it once again.For those who haven't read the books or watched the previous 6 films, don't even bother. You'll be lost and confused the entire way. But for those familiar with Harry Potter, I dare say you'll be pleased with the faithful adaptation presented to us. It's an entertaining ride from start to finish and despite having a runtime of 146 minutes, there wasn't a moment I felt it too long.Touching on technicalities, it is undoubtedly a superbly filmed piece. And since the majority of the film is set in the Muggle ('real') world, it provides a new and refreshing experience with beautiful scenery that isn't Hogwarts, all a backdrop for the wizarding characters and their exciting ventures.And the acting is just brilliant. It's weird to think 9 years ago, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and (the ever beautiful) Emma Watson were just little kids thrown into the world of what was to be one of the greatest film series ever. Being roughly the same age as them, I can say I've travelled with them, grown with them, matured with them. That is exactly what they deliver, an extremely mature performance that shows their undeniable talent; and of course, the supporting characters, all veteran performers who just add to the brilliancy.The pacing was criticised, and justifiably so. If you're looking for a concise and action packed-to-the-brim film, similar to the previous films, you won't find it here. But you will find a dark and emotional work that draws you in if you're willing. Bear in mind, it is only the first half of the epic finale. Oh, and the much talked about 'dance scene' that immediately divided audiences and critics alike? I didn't have a huge problem with it, but it certainly felt disjointed and out of place; not necessary, but I have to say, it was sweet.Was it the best in the entire series? Some may argue yes, but I personally felt Half-Blood Prince to be superior, though this is a close second. Part 1 is a perfect setup for the resounding finale waiting in store for us next year. This was thrilling as it is; I can't imagine how electrifying Part 2 will be.Personal Highlights: Other than all Emma Watson scenes (she can truly act), do watch out for a particular animated sequence in the middle of the film that is creative and innovative. Also, Harry and Hermione's visit to snow-covered Godric's Hollow is one of the most beautifully shot scenes in the entire film.",8,0,0,24 December 2010
Children of Men," jusco's review: Children of Men
","This is a powerful film. It is not a film to be watched lightly; in fact, you can consider it as disturbing as George Orwell's 1984 or Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The commonality between the three works? All portray a futuristic dystopian society that though may initially seem unrealistic, eventually causes you to think twice: 'Hey, this isn't all that far-fetched. In fact, this is really scary.' Where to begin? Children of Men, directed by Alfonso Cuarón (also known for directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Y tu mamá también), is set in 2027's London. The premise: global human infertility. A baby has not been born in 18 years, implying the upcoming extinction of the human race. And what do people usually do in times of distress or trouble? Create even more problems for themselves, thus leading to collapses and breakdowns, destruction and terrorism. In addition, UK is the only nation still maintaining an actual functioning government, attracting people from around the world. And conveniently, UK's slogan is this: 'Illegal immigration is a crime.' And the list goes on.In the midst of this rather bleak environment (bombs exploding, people dying), there is a disillusioned man by the name of Theo, played by Clive Owen, who is tasked to help protect and safely escort an African refugee named Kee out of the UK before she is arrested as an illegal immigrant. Just what is so important about Kee? Well, nothing much, except for the fact that she's pregnant and possibly holding the key to salvation of the entire homo sapien race.This is an amazing film on so many levels. I'll briefly touch on the points. First, the acting. Clive Owen gives a superb performance as Theo, who attempts to act tough and apathetic, but who really has a caring heart and a strong sense of responsibility, duty. And of course, Michael Caine never fails to impress; in this, he provides the much-needed humour by acting as Theo's rather eccentric friend, Jasper. His hobby? Smoking weed, naturally. The rest of the cast is just as solid.Second, the cinematography is to be highly commended. The camera work is quite possibly one of the best I've seen in any film. It contains several single-shot sequences that are just mind-blowing. You can easily get sucked into the scene, as if you were really there on the grounds, especially during the intense battle scenes. The advantage of such continuous and fluid shots is the ability to engross the audience completely, never giving them time to take a breather.Third, the soundtrack works ever so efficiently. It was unique enough for me to notice but not so overpowering as to distract you from the film itself. It creates an original and innovative feel by combining multiple genres of music, drawing the right emotion out at the right time.But ultimately, Children of Men makes you think, and it makes you think hard. In the beginning, I was hesitant. Mass infertility? It all sounded a bit implausible. Yet, the genius of it is how it handles effectively other matters to provide the necessary realism to construct the futuristic and broken London. It is not a film that thrives on the plot of Theo protecting Kee and her baby, but rather on the intensive reflections on life itself.This is essentially a study and analysis of human behaviour, of human emotions and of the effect of disheartened desperation. It leads to the cruelty that unfortunately resides in many of us. It leads to the apathy, the despondent feeling of giving up because life is just not working out. It leads to the death of faith. Jasper points out (in reference to Theo's deceased son): 'And then, by chance, he was gone. You see, Theo's faith lost out to chance. So, why bother if life's going to make its own choices?' But the beauty of this film is the faint hope that weaves itself in and out. Let me tell you, it is a roller coaster ride. Things happen so shockingly fast, all you can do is just sit and stare in disbelief. It's tough to watch at times. But this is also a film of self-awareness, of maturity, of growth. Theo goes through that transformation and journey, of discovering the need to grasp tightly to that hope, despite the widespread misery (and he certainly goes through some unimaginable hardships). It's what keeps him going, it's what keeps the audience watching.It's interesting then, when comparisons to Christianity are made. And these are not worthless comparisons. There are many things to be learnt from this film, and even more to meditate on. Issues of politics, racism and human relations are introduced, and of course that faith, that possibility. If only we can implement this hope in our very lives!",10,1,7,24 December 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," jusco's review: Kill Bill: Vol. 1
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest and most consistent film directors around (don't forget eccentric). This film is no exception of the high quality expected of his works. It is easily one of his most accessible films and an exciting cinematic piece of art. The premise is simple: The Bride undertakes an epic journey of revenge, having to defeat four professional assassins before reaching her ultimate prey, that is, Bill. You have to understand, Bill had his heart broken by her, and thus he had no choice but to slaughter her fiancé, her fiancé's family, and of course, her as well (conveniently done by putting a bullet through her head). However, she miraculously survived and thus the stage is set for an ultimate tale engorged with spiteful vengeance. Honestly, I seriously doubted that I would derive any pleasurable enjoyment from this. It didn't quite sound like my cup of tea. But if you put morals aside (kids, revenge is bad), Kill Bill is a highly engrossing action-packed flick that never ceases to entertain.Uma Thurman delivers a spot-on performance as the main character, angst-filled and extremely frustrated, but equipped with fierce determination. This lady means business and you know better than to get involved when she starts wielding a samurai sword, chopping limbs and heads off as if it were second nature – no, it's probably more like first nature. In Vol. 1, she faces two of the four assassins; but it is the second assassin, O-Ren Ishii played by Lucy Liu, which the majority of the film involves – an anime-style flashback sequence of her childhood is ingeniously crafted.The highlight of the entire film is a lengthy fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii's henchmen in a Japanese-style night club, reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded's battle with multiple Agent Smiths. It is epic. Beautifully choreographed and shot, I was unable to draw my eyes away from one of the most spectacular fight sequences I've seen. Unfortunately, The Bride and O-Ren Ishii's showdown at the end was overshadowed by this sequence; extremely disappointing but considering the rest, forgivable.This is also easily one of the top three most violent, bloody and gory films I've seen. For those with weak stomachs, stay far away from this one. It is a film that glorifies the aestheticization of violence from start to finish; I wasn't able to appreciate the violent extremeness as much as other viewers or critics – which I suspect is a good thing; I haven't been fully desensitised yet – but I do understand the reason it is called stylish art. Despite being unnerving, at times it was very pretty to watch (ah, what has our generation come to, describing excessive violence as 'pretty' and 'stylish'?).The film pays multiple homages to different film genres and cultures, the most apparent in Vol. 1 being Japan with samurai swords and Japanese dialogue prevalent. Tarantino's films always contain the right music, the soundtrack never failing to invoke the particular emotion he wants to draw from the audience, usually nerve-wrecking suspense, thrill and shocking excitement. When the credits came rolling on, I was a bit thrown off at the abrupt ending, even feeling rather cheated; that's it? Then I remembered this is just Vol. 1. Needless to say, I was ready and eager for Vol. 2. Bring it on, Tarantino.",8,1,3,24 December 2010
Pride & Prejudice," jusco's review: Pride and Prejudice
","Pride and Prejudice, the novel's latest adaptation by Joe Wright, is a delightfully charming film that surprisingly works well for its limited runtime of 129 minutes. I will not compare this film with the ever-faithful, ever-acclaimed 1995 television serial, for both work equally well but just on different levels. The selling point of this film is the fact that it will easily appeal to the younger generation; it is a great introduction for those unfamiliar with the novel or Jane Austen (as it was for me). A modern rendition of the classic novel, it still manages to maintain the wittiness and romance through the impressive performances of the young and attractive actors/actresses.Keira Knightley, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses currently, delivers a pinpoint portrayal of Ms. Elizabeth Bennet that sparkles with witty personality. Her execution and deliverance of the novel's smart, memorable dialogue is spot on – her talent is evident, having able to meet the high standards that have always tagged along with this particular character. Her counterpart, Matthew Macfadyen, does an equally good job as Mr. Darcy, and his transformation throughout the film is well acted. Some may be dissatisfied with the youth or the lack of maturity of the cast, but as mentioned above, being an adaptation aimed at appealing to a younger audience, one must allow proper applause for the cast; it is by no means an easy task to effectively act as a set of defining literary characters.My only complaint was it being too short; there were a few scenes that seemed to arrive much too soon, but it is understandable considering they were trying to compress it into one film. I'll be more than happy to redirect you to the above-mentioned television serial – just under 6 hours, it is given plenty of time for the events to play out.Highly recommended for those who have yet to succeed in sitting through the novel – it is a hilarious and emotion-provoking film – or for those who desire a fresh and lively look at their favourite novel. Highly eloquent, highly intelligent, this modern telling of an all-time classic is worth the watch.",9,2,3,24 December 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," jusco's review: How To Train Your Dragon
","Well done, DreamWorks. When you set your mind to it, you can create good animation films, despite being under the gigantic shadow of Pixar most of the time. How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent and enjoyable film with Vikings and Dragons, mixed with good, pure humour, thrilling, jaw-dropping actions scenes and chases – on dragons, of course. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a Viking who is so not a Viking. He's that puny, stick figure in comparison to his disappointed and huge, buff dad, Stoick (voiced by Gerard Butler) who also happens to be the village's chief. Hiccup can't kill dragons to save his life. But what he does instead is accidentally catch the most powerful and deadly dragon in history, a Night Fury, and befriends it. He feeds him fish (no eel), makes a harness and trains him to fly while riding on his back.It's your typical story, and the dragon flying scenes are almost mirror images of Avatar's grandiose scenes; Hiccup is that weakling and underdog, yet it's just human nature to cheer him on. Along the way we want to see him defy the odds and succeed against everybody's expectations. Quirky and fun, this extremely well-made animation teaches a great lesson for kids: don't be afraid to be yourself and believe that you can achieve great things. Of course, it's just as entertaining for adults, and along with Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, DreamWorks has struck gold with another animated masterpiece.",7,0,1,22 January 2011
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," jusco's review: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
","It's like Snatch's twin brother, which I guess is understandable considering it's the same director. Guy Ritchie's first film is in typical fashion; bizarre, erratic, whimsical. Once again following several interlinking story arcs, it is a puzzling crime film with a lot of laughs and deaths. Four young men find themselves in debt to a crime lord (£500,000!) and they conspire to steal money from their weed-growing next door neighbours. On top of that, two antique guns and a whole bunch of characters find themselves unknowingly involved and pitted against each other; a perfect setup for a comedic and violent tragedy. Containing smart dialogue and sharp, stylish camera work (different from Snatch's editing, but still unconventional) and relatively solid performances all round, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a solid debut from the British director. Unfortunately, if you end up watching both Snatch and this, you'll be sick of the similar styles and tones. However, it is still hilarious and of course, shocking, and it's well worth a watch. Though Snatch may have had more laugh-out-loud moments, I personally enjoyed the crafting of this film better; the editing was not as distracting, thus allowing smoother flow, and I also found the ending brilliant. But please, I beg you Mr. Ritchie, don't do it again. We've had enough of heavily-accented British crime comedy films, especially from you.",6,0,1,24 December 2010
The Social Network," jusco's review: The Social Network
","Many would probably agree with me that upon hearing David Fincher was directing a Facebook film, there were two general reactions: 1) a Facebook film?? are you kidding me?? 2) David Fincher and Facebook?? shouldn't it be David Fincher and provoking thrillers, like Seven or Fight Club or Zodiac??Well, Mr. Fincher, you have officially and successfully pulled it off, and we're more than willing to shut up now.This is a film based on the founding of the Internet social networking phenomenon site, Facebook, which I highly doubt needs an explanation (unless you're one of the rare few not in the overwhelming 500 million who has an account). But please be aware, this is far from factual. If you're looking for a faithful documentary or biographical film that portrays the humble beginnings of the website and the eventual lawsuits over the disputes about who actually owned the shares, you're looking in the wrong place. But if you're looking for a film that is intelligent and witty, you're in the right place.I emphasise again that this is a smart film. In fact, probably much smarter than what most people are used to, but the genius of the film is how it is able to effectively bring us along with the fast paced turn of events without confusing the audience. It contains brilliant dialogue that must be attributed to Aaron Sorkin, the scriptwriter. From the first scene, you are already thrown into a world of highly astute and quick-witted conversations. But then again, this is Harvard; can you expect otherwise?Apparently, Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg was far from accurate; the real-life Mark Zuckerberg is known to be quiet and reserved. But this can be easily overlooked for Jesse Eisenberg's execution is in perfect style: quick thinking, witty and though at times irritating, eventually wins the audience over to symphathise with him. Andrew Garfield had a relatively easy character to play, Eduardo Saverin, the rich businessman who supports Mark but eventually sues him. But Justin Timberlake – I had no idea he could act so well – was the standout. His character, Sean Parker (the founder of Napster), is so charming to the point of annoying, and he played his role very cleverly.This film does make you think about the constantly evolving world of technology that is currently dominating our lives. It causes you to question the issue of privacy, the issue of morality and the issue of Virtual vs Reality. How many profiles portrayed on Facebook are similar to the person in reality? How different? How can this type of social networking site benefit us, or even harm us? Is our society too reliant on said site or is it a perfectly harmless way to interact and socialise, to make new friends and acquaintances? Just a few questions to think about.The Social Network has been described as a cinematic masterpiece. That it is.",9,0,1,24 December 2010
