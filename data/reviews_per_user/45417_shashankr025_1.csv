Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Everything I expected it to be.
","I must admit, I knew what was going to happen. Like many other impatient viewers, I too had read the screenplay online long before the movie hit the screens. But it did not diminish my movie experience in the least.The camera changes from black-and-white to color to grainy, and back to black-and-white... and back to color. But Tarantino's prolonged and indulgent ode to his influences and pop-culture is driven to a riveting end. From the moment we see the killer turned expectant bride in that chapel, rehearsing for her wedding to a record store employee, to the final scene of the final chapter, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an exhilerating and mostly satisfying cinematic journey.I did find the Budd story a little bit of an unwanted diversion. Instead, Tarantino could have let the casino scene with Bill make it through the final cut (if you don't know what I am talking about, you can read the script online). It would have had more relevance in developing Bill's character, which is of course crucial. But strong performances all around more than make up for this shortcoming.I especially enjoyed the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei. I felt Tarantino succeeded at maintaining the fine balance between edgy humor and over-the-top ridicule in paying homage to Chinese Kung-fu movies, with those sudden facial close-ups, Pai Mei's arrogant laughter, and his repeated stroking of that wispy beard.But to me, the best chapter was easily the final one. I was pleasantly surprised to see how genuine the interaction between father (Bill), mother (Beatrix/Uma) and child (B.B.) looked onscreen. David Carradine, who puts in a strong performance throughout, shines especially in this chapter. In particular, the `goldfish' scene where he recounts how their daughter learned about life and death was captivating and insightful.I give this movie 9/10.",9,1,2,16 April 2004
