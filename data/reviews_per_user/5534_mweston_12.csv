Minority Report," 4 stars (out of 4)
","The year is 2054. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, who works in the 'pre-crime' division of the Washington, D.C. police force, and is a key figure in a successful experimental program to arrest murderers before they commit the murder, based on the visions of three 'pre-cogs' floating in a tank. The film opens with a 'red ball' case, in which there is little warning and therefore time is of the essence. The pre-cogs provide visions and (inexplicably) the full names of the future murderer and the victim(s), but nothing else, so John is left to try to narrow down the location based on that limited data.He goes to work in front of a futuristic wall sized display, using special gloves that recognize his movements and gestures as commands to zoom, discard, and so on. Classical music plays on the soundtrack, conveying the impression that he is as skilled as a concert musician at working his way through the data. Eventually he has enough clues to leap into action with the rest of the SWAT-like team, flying across town in a futuristic blade-less helicopter-like vehicle, trying to reach the murder scene before the murder occurs. The pre-cogs' determination of the time of the murder is down to the second, so they always know exactly how much time they have left.Soon after they return, the pre-crime unit is visited by Detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), who has been sent from the Justice Department to looks for flaws in the system before an imminent critical vote on whether or not pre-crime should go nationwide. We also meet Anderton's boss (Max von Sydow) and learn more about Anderton's past.If you've seen the previews, the next revelation will be no surprise, but you might want to stop reading now if you want to minimize your knowledge of the plot... John Anderton's name shows up in the system as a future murderer. It is predicted that he will murder someone who he has never met in less than 36 hours. He runs, and the movie takes off running with him.I think what makes the film work so well is the story. It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, whose short stories are also behind 'Blade Runner' and 'Total Recall.' One of the two screenwriters wrote the screenplays for both 'Get Shorty' and 'Out of Sight.' It's simply a first-rate whodunit with lots of twists and turns that feel real, with great humanity mixed in.The film also presents a fully fleshed out view of the future. There are sensors in public places that can identify and track people by their retinal patterns, and in a memorable scene, mechanical spiders that fan out throughout an apartment building to scan all the occupants (the spiders are excellent computer animations, while the building itself was apparently a real set). There are newspapers that change to show the latest news, and advertising posters on the walls that customize themselves and talk directly to the specific people as they walk by (a particularly objectionable part of this future if you ask me).The acting is solid if not spectacular, with the possible exception of Samantha Morton, who is very good as one of the pre-cogs. I also think Tim Blake Nelson is good in a small role.The cinematography is consistently a little hazy looking and almost monochromatic. This is obviously an intentional effect, but it was a little distracting to me.I just realized that I haven't mentioned that this film was directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is far from the cold detachment of 'Artificial Intelligence: AI' and probably closer to some of his earlier work. Think of it as 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' with way more action, or 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' with less but a more thought-provoking story.This film is one of the few films that has gotten a wide release that I can recommend without reservation. This summer, this film and 'Road to Perdition' are the best bets among the event films.Seen on 8/11/2002.",9,0,0,15 October 2002
Bloody Sunday," 3 stars (out of 4)
","This docudrama recreates the filmmakers' view of the events in the Northern Ireland city of Derry on January 30, 1972. It starts by showing an announcement by the British outlining the restrictions against public assembly in Northern Ireland. A protest march is clearly not approved.The night before a planned civil rights march, Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt from 'Waking Ned Devine'), a Protestant member of Parliament representing the Irish Catholic district where the illegal march will take place, is making preparations. We see him moving through the streets, greeting people and trying to reinforce peaceful, non-confrontational interactions with the 'occupying' British military force. We see that there are doubts about whether the march should go on and whether or not the more radical marchers will remain peaceful, but Cooper is resolute: 'If we don't march, civil rights is dead in this city.'Meanwhile, the leaders of the British military know that a march is planned the next day. The upper-level officers give the directive that success will be defined by the number of so-called 'hooligans' who are arrested. They make detailed plans for exactly where the march will go and where they will attempt to make the arrests. They spend little time planning what forms of force are appropriate.And so the stage is set. With thousands of marchers, most will be peaceful while a few will inevitably push the boundaries. And on the military side, some will have measured responses while others will overreact.The film style is intense. One is reminded of Black Hawk Down, with the washed out, almost monochromatic, color palette. Another similarity is the shaky handheld camera work, although I believe this film goes too far (TurboSpastiCam(tm)). But a contrasting aspect of the style here is to cut to black and then pause briefly between scenes, which gives you a moment to think and catch your breath. The accents are difficult to follow, not just at the beginning of the film but throughout, and subtitles would probably help.The acting is uniformly good, making you feel as if you are watching a true documentary, with James Nesbitt clearly standing out. He has the most interesting part, and he lets you inside to feel what he is feeling. The film has won many awards, including the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival and an audience award at Sundance.After the film is over, one is left to wonder just how accurately it portrays the events. Not having studied the history, I can't say for sure, although I suspect the film is somewhat biased, but is probably not blatantly so.If you have trouble with shaking cameras, you should stay very far away from this film. For everyone else, this film is worth watching. And if you wait for the DVD, you can decide if subtitles help.Seen on 10/13/2002.",7,5,10,9 December 2002
Insomnia," 3 stars
","I remember the point during this film when the first event happened that would be a spoiler if I mentioned it, and it wasn't very far into the film. So don't expect this review to give much more than a feeling for who most of the characters are and the general atmosphere.The film opens with detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart being flown over some lovely but forbidding landscape in a twin engine float plane, discussing an investigation that Internal Affairs is doing on them back in Los Angeles. They arrive in Nightmute, Alaska, and are met by a junior detective named Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who is a big fan of Dormer's -- even having written a paper on one of his cases when she was at the police academy. Dormer looks tired already, and he hasn't even figured out yet that the sun won't set during his entire stay in this town.The case they have been sent here to help out on is a murder of a high school girl. The very early parts of the investigation are routine, with the Los Angeles cops bringing a great deal of expertise to bear, helping the locals see what they may have missed or assumed. Then the aforementioned event happens, and the film becomes more interesting and also much more tense.The performances are good, though unremarkable. Pacino is unable to sleep (hence the film's title), and becomes more and more tired as the days go by, and this seems believable. Swank is fine but isn't given as much to work with, except perhaps in one brief scene near the end. I did like Paul Dooley (who played the father in 'Breaking Away') in the small role of the local police chief.This film was directed by Christopher Nolan, whose previous film was the outstanding 'Memento.' This is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, which is available on DVD but which I have not seen. This film doesn't use as obvious of a hook as did 'Memento,' but it does frequently use short flash images to show what Dormer is thinking about. Not all of these images make sense at first, but eventually things do come together. And speaking of images, the cinematography is very good, especially of the Alaskan countryside (although much of the film was shot in British Columbia).This film is very good, to the extent that I have been very close to giving it another half star. It's mostly gone from the theaters here, so see it soon if you can.Seen on 6/23/2002.",7,1,1,10 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 2.5 stars
","The Republic and its Jedi Knights are facing a growing crisis. The separatists (the Federation, I think they are called, which is too similar a word to Republic to keep straight which is which) are growing stronger, and the Jedis' ability to sense what's going on through The Force is being clouded by an increase in energy from The Dark Side. Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is needed for a crucial vote and is being protected by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Jedi-in-training Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). There are some exciting scenes in the movie, but the overall story really is almost as dull as this sounds.Jar Jar Binks is, thankfully, seen and heard far less than he was in part I. Yoda has become a purely computer generated character, like Jar Jar but not annoying. R2-D2 and C-3PO provide comic relief, although the latter's puns seem out of place on at least one occasion. The human dialogue is stiff throughout the movie, but the love story between Padme and Anakin is especially painful. And Christensen's Anakin at times seems to change 180º from one line to the next, which might be intended to suggest how unstable he's becoming as he prepares to become Darth Vader in part III, but just seems ludicrous in the context of this movie. There is absolutely no acting here that could be considered very good, for which I would have to blame George Lucas, as writer and director, since these actors have shown that they can be significantly better than this.In the movie's defense, there are some very entertaining scenes. Near the beginning, the three dimensional chase through the city is reminiscent of 'The Fifth Element,' only better. And there are some big battles later in the movie, after everyone is finally talked out. But after all I had heard about these final scenes, I was surprised when the end of the movie arrived, because what I had seen had not lived up to the hype.See this is you want to be entertained. If you want to see a fine example of film making, on the other hand, try something else.
Digital cinema: This movie was not filmed. It was recorded on high definition (about 2 million pixels/frame) 24 frame/second video, and all of the special effects and editing was done digitally. At most theaters, the digital images have been converted to film for normal projection, but I did seek out one of the few theaters that is projecting the movie digitally. Specifically I saw it at the Century 22 in San Jose, CA on 6/16/2002, sitting near the center of the third row.I have to saw that I was quite disappointed. Even before the movie began, the text displayed during the advertising spot for the digital projection system demonstrated glaringly apparent jagged edges on the diagonals (I overheard someone else use the term 'jaggies,' so it wasn't just me). Throughout the movie I was periodically reminded that this was digital -- it looked like a giant projection television (which of course is exactly what it was) -- although I was able to forget this for stretches of several minutes.The benefits of digital projection were also apparent: the picture looked just the same as it would have when the movie first played, because there is no physical film to wear and tear. And the picture was stable, without any jitteryness or, as I have seen on occasion with film, gross misalignment.There are stories that the next (and last) part of the Star Wars series will be shot with cameras capable of recording about 10 million pixels/frame. That, combined with a somewhat smaller screen and/or a less demanding seat, might allow digital cinema to compete with film. But we're not there yet. For now, digital projection should be used only for low budget movies that have been shot on relatively low resolution video. For these movies, removing the expensive requirement of a transfer to film will make a big difference in how much money is available for the rest of the production.",6,0,1,10 July 2002
The Bourne Identity," 3 stars (out of 4)
","A man (Matt Damon) is found floating in the ocean, miles from shore, by the men of a fishing boat. He is presumed dead, but, quite surprisingly, he is alive. Before he regains consciousness, the ship's doctor sees two bullet wounds on his back, and removes the bullets. He also finds another scar that hides a small object which projects some numbers and letters.After the man regains consciousness, he says that he doesn't remember who he is, how he was shot, or how he ended up floating in the ocean. He recovers physically, but still has no idea who he is.After he goes ashore in southern France, he uses the clue of the numbers and letters that were embedded in his body to start to learn more about who he is, including that his name might be Jason Bourne. He meets Marie (Franka Potente), who helps him, which is good since it seems that many people would like to see him dead.Meanwhile, we see CIA agent Conklin (Chris Cooper), who is trying to clean up after an assassination that was planned but never happened, by an agent who has disappeared.The plot is more involved than this, to the point where I wasn't 100% sure that I followed everything. There are some things that don't make sense and others that seem a bit unlikely, but it makes *enough* sense to avoid distracting you from the action scenes, which are the reason this movie exists, and which work *very* well. That you don't know exactly what's going on, especially earlier in the film, keeps the tension effectively high. And the acting and the special effects, like the story, are good enough to avoid distracting you.Unlike 'XXX,' this film is definitely recommended if you're looking for an entertaining action film.Seen on 8/23/2002.",7,0,1,15 October 2002
Lilo & Stitch," 3 stars (out of 4)
","When we meet Lilo, a little Hawaiian girl, she is swimming and body surfing in the ocean, which she loves so much that she's late for a rehearsal of a hula dance. Soon thereafter we learn that she lives with her older sister Nani (voice by Tia Carrere, who really is from Hawaii), and that they don't always get along. Furthermore, a social worker incongruously named Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames) is suggesting that Lilo be taken away from Nani unless things get better real soon.Meanwhile, somewhere else in the universe, we meet Experiment 626 (who is later named Stitch, and whose voice is by one of the two directors). 626's mad scientist creator, Dr. Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers) has been put on trial for creating 626, a creature designed to be very powerful, intelligent, and dangerous. 626 is sentenced to exile, but escapes. And from the title of the film and the previews, you know that he ends up in Hawaii with Lilo.The animation here is very different from the computer generated films that are common these days, and more like the two dimensional animated films of years past. The backgrounds are often lovely watercolors, and most of the animation is also hand drawn from what I've read, although based on the credits there is also some computer animation.This is also not your usual Disney animated film, although it was made by Disney. Both Lilo and Stitch have some pretty objectionable habits, and the jokes target many pop culture icons. I heard that the film was made with much less detailed committee supervision than would usually be the case at Disney, in exchange for (as I recall) a smaller budget.The soundtrack is good, including Hawaiian music as well as a bountiful selection of Elvis Presley songs (six, I believe).The biggest downside to the film is that the message is a little too precious, although this is not a big complaint, and I found it less obnoxious than 'Ice Age' in this regard. The basic message is one of family, whether or not that family is a traditional one with a mother and a father, or a makeshift one as we see in Lilo, Nani, and Stitch. The Hawaiian word 'ohana' is used, which means more or less the same thing as 'family.' This is timely for me since we just became members of the Hawaii International Film Festival's Ohana in preparation for attending their film festival in November.This film is definitely recommended, even if you have no children. I originally gave it another half a star, so it's at the upper end of this rating. And I expect it to be a strong contender for the Academy Award for best animated film of 2002.Seen on 8/16/2002.",7,2,2,15 October 2002
Spider-Man," 2.5 stars
","Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a very smart, very socially awkward high school student who lives with his aunt and uncle. He is in love with Mary Jane Watson (a.k.a., 'M.J.', played by Kirsten Dunst), and has been since she moved in next door when they were both children. One day they are both on a field trip, and a genetically altered, radioactive spider bites Peter. He feels ill and goes home to fall asleep. When he wakes up he begins to figure out that his body has changed. He is far stronger, can stick to surfaces, and then there are the webs. Meanwhile, Peter's best friend's father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), runs a large company attempting to sell advanced technology to the military. When an experiment in human augmentation stalls, he decides to make himself a human guinea pig, and he begins his transformation into the extremely schizophrenic Green Goblin. That's just the set-up. There's a lot more story, as Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, and then, with the help of his uncle, figures out what Spider-Man should stand for. Tobey Maguire does a better job of this transition than most actors one might have thought of casting for a superhero role would have, but he isn't given enough to work with. And Kirsten Dunst has even less to do. Willem Dafoe might be the stand out, but only because he is supposed to chew the scenery and does, quite effectively.
Director Sam Raimi is apparently a huge fan of the comic book hero, and he has given this film a distinctly comic book feel, starting from the comic book opening credits. This can be charming at times, but, for me at least, falls flat at many others. The dialog is unintentionally funny far too often. I'll sum up here with my summary as we left the theater on 5/17/2002: This movie somehow manages to be both entertaining *and* lame.",6,0,0,12 June 2002
Spirited Away," 4 stars (out of 4)
","Chihiro is a little girl. She and her parents are driving to their new house in the suburbs to meet the movers, but they take a wrong turn and end up at the entrance to what looks like it might be an abandoned amusement park. She doesn't want to go in, but her parents insist. Things don't go smoothly, and soon Chihiro is on her own, exploring what looks like an enormous bathhouse.But this is no ordinary bathhouse. Soon Chihiro discovers that it is populated by many spirits, mostly in the form of creatures the likes of which she (and the audience) has never seen before. I'd love to tell you about some of them, but I don't want to spoil the wonderful surprises. Okay, I will mention the soot creatures, who look like little black Koosh balls with eyes and whose job it is to carry coal for the boiler.I went into this film on 11/22/2002 with very high expectations, since it has gotten universally good reviews. Usually high expectations are a bad thing, and in fact during the very early parts of the film I wasn't convinced. The green line running down the middle of the screen for maybe 10 minutes didn't help either. But once the story entered the spirit world, the film became simply *magical*. I was just watching to see what wonderful thing Hayao Miyazaki (the writer/director of this film and also 'My Neighbor Totoro' and 'Princess Mononoke') would come up with next.The animation is sometimes startlingly realistic and other times not at all, and the combination works wonderfully. About the only negative thing I can think to say is that the film seemed like it might have been a touch long, although I couldn't even begin to suggest anything to cut. I understand that this film is being distributed in subtitled form in addition to the dubbed version I saw, although for non-Japanese speakers the dubbed version is probably a better choice for the first viewing. Hopefully the eventual DVD will offer both options.The United States doesn't consider animated films to be appropriate for anyone but children, but that's just wrong. This film passed 'Titanic' to be Japan's number one grossing film *of all time*. It absolutely deserves consideration for the Best Picture Oscar, and if it does not get at least a nomination for best animated film, something is very wrong.See this film!",9,0,1,11 January 2003
Men in Black II," 3 stars
","I think I'll reverse the normal structure and start with my conclusions before I describe the film. I'm a big fan of the original film, and from the previews I had hopes that this one might be better. Then I read Roger Ebert's review of this film, where he gave it 1 1/2 stars, and I thought it might be awful.My experience was in between. This film is definitely *not* as good as the first film, and the previews contain most of the best bits, but it is often quite entertaining without ever really having any parts that I would call bad. I left the theater happier than when I entered. In contrast, both 'Spider-Man' and 'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones' had definite lame moments and disappointed me on the whole, and so I felt that a slightly higher rating was due to this film.Now, back to your regularly scheduled film description...The film opens with a clip from a television show hosted by Peter Graves. It has amazingly bad, Ed Wood level special effects, and it tells the story of the 'Light of Zartha.' Even though this clip is mostly repeated later in the film, I can't remember exactly how the story goes, which doesn't speak well for the screenplay. In any case, we soon see a spaceship land in a scene very similar to one from the TV show. The alien inside, named Serleena, is made up of an innumerable set of tentacles, but it morphs into the form of Lara Flynn Boyle after seeing a Victoria's Secret advertisement in a magazine.Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and his partner Agent T (Patrick Warburton) have to convince a very large alien worm-thing to stay in the part of the subway system where it's supposed to be. Apparently J has had many partners since K (Tommy Lee Jones) left at the end of the first film, and soon he is again without a partner. He is assigned to a case of alien murder, initially partnered with Agent F (the talking dog from the first film, used much more extensively here). In the process he meets a waitress named Rita (Rosario Dawson), who witnessed the murder.The big thing that worked in the first film was the interaction between Smith and Jones, and it takes quite a while for the two of them to get back together here. As you probably recall, Agent K was neuralized (caused to forget his agent years) at the end of the previous film, so bringing him back takes some effort. But as you already know from the posters, K *does* come back and the old chemistry is still there, pretty much. But then again, I thought Agents T and F were pretty fun too, in their own ways.There are some parts and people that don't work as well. Boyle is an interesting, which is to say wrong, choice to play the villain. The part was originally given to Famke Janssen, who would have probably been better. The special effects aren't bad, exactly, but they do seem a little cheesy at times. What was original in 1997 is derivative five years later. But if you're a fan of the first film, as I am, you'll want to see this one.Animated short: The film was preceded by a cartoon titled 'The ChubbChubbs are Coming!,' which is not listed on IMDb yet but does have an official site on the Sony Pictures web site. It's not quite as good as 'For the Birds,' which preceded 'Monsters, Inc.,' but it is very funny, with references to 'Star Wars' (Yoda and Jar Jar Binks), 'E.T.,' and I'm sure others I've forgotten. Call it 3.5 stars.Seen on 7/3/2002.",7,0,0,12 July 2002
Black Hawk Down," 4 stars
","This film tells the story of an American mission in Somalia in 1993. It starts with a too brief history of the situation, proceeds rapidly though introducing the characters (who for the most part you don't find yourself remembering or even caring that much about), and then dives into the action for the bulk of the running time.At the moment (this was written right after I saw the film on 2/17/2002) I'm still shell-shocked. To my eyes, 'Black Hawk Down' is as good an anti-war film as I've *ever* seen, yet I'm sure that for the right people it would be seen as a pro-military film. Similarly in this country we would likely root for the Americans in the film, while I have read that bootlegged copies of this film shown in Somalia drew cheers whenever an American was killed. Perhaps this is a sign of a balanced approach.My opinion of 'Saving Private Ryan' has grown over the years since I first saw it because the images have stuck with me, and I find myself wondering if this film will be similar. For the moment I will rate it assuming that is the case.",9,0,0,18 April 2002
A Beautiful Mind," 3.5 stars
","I saw this on 2/19/2002. The title refers to the mind of John Nash, a brilliant but eccentric mathematician played by Russell Crowe. This film, which is based on the real life of John Nash, opens in 1947 when he arrives at Princeton, and continues through a period of 47 years. During this time his eccentricity is seen to deepen into mental illness, and we see his struggles against it in a way few others could attempt.Crowe's performance here is quite remarkable, both in terms of portraying the changing phases of his life, but also his ability to show us what he is feeling in his early encounters with his schoolmates and his future wife (played very well by Jennifer Connelly) and his later battles with mental illness. Ed Harris, on the other hand, is under used. The direction, by Ron Howard, is quite good in its ability to show us the inner workings of Nash's mind, both in its mathematical brilliance and in its struggles with sanity.The biggest aspect that holds this film back from greatness is its simplification and Hollywood-izing of Nash's life. For example, Nash's bisexuality is left out of the film. But even if the package is just a little too neatly wrapped, this is a film that is highly recommended.",8,0,2,18 April 2002
Ice Age," 3 stars
","The humans have (unseen, before the film opens) killed a sabertooth tiger, and the tigers want revenge, so they plot to kidnap a human baby. Diego (voice by Denis Leary) is charged with this task, and he partially succeeds, but finds himself sharing three-way custody of the baby with a woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), who rightly don't trust Diego alone with the baby. Manny and Sid want to return the baby to the humans and Diego agrees, although he secretly has other plans. All of this occurs as the ice age is beginning and almost all animals are migrating south. Interspersed with this main story we occasionally see a hapless sabertooth squirrel thingy trying valiantly (and painfully) to find somewhere to hide the acorn he has found. Besides the squirrel there are a number of other very fun bits, such as dodo birds performing 'Tae Kwon-Dodo' and showing why they became extinct, as well as references to Star Trek and Titanic.The animation is not as polished or flashy as in Shrek or Monsters, Inc., but it might be a little more human. On the whole, I definitely enjoyed this film and would recommend it, but the story which holds the brilliant bits together is pretty obvious and a little too precious to let it measure up to the high standards set by other recent animated films.",7,0,0,5 April 2002
