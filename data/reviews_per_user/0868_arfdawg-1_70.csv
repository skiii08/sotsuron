Ford v Ferrari," Let's Re-Work History, Why Don't We?
","Is it watchable movie that has zero street cred.
Just another Hollywood phony re-work of the truth.Is it entertaining?
Yes.But little is based in reality.AND we learn that Bale is the real actor. Damon is less than a light weight.",2,3,31,18 January 2020
Angels & Demons," Rather Boring
","This got good reviews here.I didn't like it much.Way to overly complicated.As well as being very very very very very talkie.I was rather bored from the beginning. Some of the dialog is actually laughable.The plot:Following the murder of a physicist, Father Silvano Bentivoglio, a symbolist, Robert Langdon, and a scientist, Vittoria Vetra, are on an adventure involving a secret brotherhood, the Illuminati. Clues lead them all around the Vatican, including the four altars of science, Earth, Air, Fire and Water. An assassin, working for the Illuminati, has captured four cardinals, and murders each, painfully. Robert and Vittoria also are searching for a new very destructive weapon that could kill millions.",2,1,2,12 May 2014
First Man," No Wonder this Bombed
","This has to be the slowest movie of the past 20 years. But what's worse, it's sort of pointless. It goes round and round with no purpose.VERY poorly directed.I was bored to tears in the first 12 minutes. And the boredom continued.Plus...no American Flag on the Moon? WTF?Did a commie make this film?",2,3,8,28 December 2018
The Equalizer," Not a Great Film by any Stretch
","In The Equalizer, Denzel Washington plays McCall, a man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. But when McCall meets Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), a young girl under the control of ultra-violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by - he has to help her. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer. What a joke.This is a silly movie that plods along with sporadic action. For the most part, you will sit through 130 minutes bored out of your mind.There's one good action scene about 30 minutes into the film and then at about 50 minutes into it the plot thickens.At this point you pretty much know how the movie is going to wind up.And then it just gets dumb with Washington righting every wrong on the planet in the most implausible fashion.The entire movie is silly. And it drags on and on forever.",3,5,9,12 December 2014
Ali," It's OK
","In 1964, a brash new pro boxer, fresh from his Olympic gold medal victory, explodes on to the scene, Cassius Clay. Bold and outspoken, he cuts an entirely new image for African Americans in sport with his proud public self confidence with his unapologetic belief that he is the greatest boxer of all time. To his credit, he sets out to prove that with his highly agile and forceful style soon making him a formidable boxer who soon claims the heavyweight championship. His personal life is no less noteworthy with his allegiance to the Nation of Islam, his friendship with the controversial Malcolm X and his abandonment of his slave name in favor of Muhammad Ali stirring up controversy. Yet, at the top of his game, both Ali's personal and professional lives face the ultimate test with the military draft rules are changed, making him eligible for military induction during the Vietnam War. For the life of me, I've never figured out how Ali can be considered such a great human when he was a member of the Nation of Islam -- an organization that to this day hates whites and jews.He definitely was a great fighter among great fighters. During a time that will never exist again.The movie cast Will Smith well, although it's apparent n the fight scene that he's a wuss and couldn't punch himself out of a paper bag.As bio pics go, it's OK. Not great. Just OK",6,1,2,9 April 2014

Gravity," Worst, Most Over-Hyped Movie of this Century
","Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) in command of his last flight before retiring. But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone - tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness.It's an idiotic premise that just keeps delivering more idiotic scenes.Firstly Ryan is supposed to be brilliant but she comes off as an incompetent little girl. And Clooney's monotone voice will drive you nuts. He can't act at all. All image no substance.The movie completely lost me when Clooney start's knocking on the Russian space station's window! I started laughing it was so bad. It reminded me of Jason in the Friday the 13th when he's in outer space! I swear!This is hands down the worst most over hyped movie I've witnessed in a decade.",1,4,11,24 February 2014

Darkest Hour," A Trump Allegory
","The Plot
Within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation. As the unstoppable Nazi forces roll across Western Europe and the threat of invasion is imminent, and with an unprepared public, a skeptical King, and his own party plotting against him, Churchill must withstand his darkest hour, rally a nation, and attempt to change the course of world history.Churchill seems to have A LOT in common with Trump.A maverick who goes against the grains and NEVER gives in.

Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the 'Basterds', a group of Jewish- American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.Wow this movie is one plodding boring mess.

As a result two hibernation pods open prematurely and the two people that awoke, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), are stranded on the spaceship, still 90 years from their destination. Starts off good with Chris Pratt. Goes down hill once a-hole Lawrence is introduced. The movie would have be WAYYYYY better without her. She's really a vapid untalented dumb entitled chick.For some bizarre reason Pratt becomes obsessed with her. Couldn't he find a hot chick? So 30 minutes into this nearly 2 hour movie, it becomes unwatchable.",2,7,22,31 December 2016

","Let's get this out of the way -- we know exactly why this movie gets so much buzz. It's a quota film for Hollywood.So now let's discuss if it's any good.It looks good. It's reasonably well acted and the direction is good, BUT....It's freaking excruisiatingly slow. Nothing happens for such a long time. Thirty five minutes into it still nothing of merit has happened and it starts to get really long in the tooth.And the acting starts to get really bad. Like way too over the top over nothing. And it gets a wee bit silly. The character actions start not to make any sense.The acre tactics arent so scary. In my opinion thing really start to crumble. And it gets really really stupid.",3,16,23,23 May 2019
Aquaman," This is Not an Even Marginally Good Movie

Really? He's shrivelled like a prune Please retire.Do you need the money?Oh and the other bad plastic surgery guy is Gary Shandlin. I take it he was looking to be taken seriously and that's why he made this movie, but the result is just the opposite.The movie is typical fair for the suoer hero genre. Lots of loud shooting that desensitizes kids to violence, but no one can blame Hollywood on the school shootings because they are in bed with the Dems, just like the left media is.",5,1,6,17 May 2019

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Worst of the Last Three
","This movie was made as if someone said 'Let's throw absolutely everything against the wall and see what sticks.'The film is filled with major holes in the plot and poorly written scenes that don't make a lot of sense. And the Jesus powers are ridiculous. It just shows a lack of creativity and tired sloppy writing.Let me give you one example that doesnt give away anything. There is actually a scene where the characters land on the outside of a ship and then proceed to walk around the outside hull wearing nothing but their clothing -- no space gear whatsoever in deep space???? REALLY?It will make a ton of money but it's the worst of the last three. Still way better than the middle three, however.",6,9,34,22 December 2019

American Hustle," don't buy the hype
","A fictional film set in the alluring world of one of the most stunning scandals to rock our nation, American Hustle tells the story of brilliant con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale), who along with his equally cunning and seductive British partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who doesn't have a brit accent is forced to work for a wild FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper).DiMaso pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia that's as dangerous as it is enchanting. Jeremy Renner is Carmine Polito, the passionate, volatile, New Jersey political operator caught between the con-artists and Feds. Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) could be the one to pull the thread that brings the entire world crashing down.Overly long movie that likes to do that retro 70s look and thinks it's kewl. Bale in his imitation of a Tony Soprano accent owns 2 dry cleaners, a glass repair and deals in art but somehow he acts and dresses like he makes $3 a week.About 15 minutes into this you'll get antsy. Thee's an extraordinary amount of boring talk that leads nowhere. 30 minutes into it the chicks gets her accent! And a couple scenes later it disappears again. Confusing.The movie is directed like Casino but it's not so good.I really didn't like it much.",3,3,6,6 March 2014

But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes-Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash-it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.It's just the dregs.When did the Flash become gay beyond belief?When did Wonder Woman get a Russian accent?When did Aquaman go brown hair instead of blond?And who's the black guy?Talk about political correctness and re-writing history!The movie sucks.",2,3,7,15 January 2018
Yesterday," Very English

Avengers: Endgame," Two Endings and About a Half Hour Too Long
","I won't include any spoliers in this review.The movie is good and worth the six bucks I paid to see it. To be honest, there were a ton of super heroes in it that I could not even identify. And I'm pretty sure a couple of actors who come up in the end credits weren't even this movie at all!For the most part, the movie keeps your attention with pretty much non-stop action and a decent storyline that follows up on the half-end of Earth ending from the last installment. It's a BIG movie with huge special effects and I imagine the entire roster of Marvel characters.For me, the Black Panter group appearance was rather unintentionally laughable. I think it's the wakest of all Marvel super heros. And that brings up another point -- when all the super heroes work together you realize how dumb some of their super powers are.There were not as many off hand comic remarks as seen in previous Marvel movies and I think that was to the detrement of the film. The new Thor is pretty funny, however.As you might expect, the finale is a really big one and all the big guns are brought out for the ending. And when it's all done, you have to sit through a rather unnecessessary 30 minute coda. It reminded me of the third Lord of the Rings installment that just kept ending as well.So the net net is, the movie is good, not great and a half hour can easily have been cut without a problem.",7,1,5,30 April 2019

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Completely Over-hyped Garbage
","The Plot. Taking place in the American Northwest in the early 1880s, the film dramatizes the last seven months in the life of famed outlaw Jesse James, beginning with the Blue Cut train robbery of 1881 and culminating in his assassination at the hands of Robert Ford the following April. In the time between these two fateful events, the young and jealous Ford befriends the increasingly mistrustful outlaw, even as he plots his demise. This pretentious title will tell you what you are in for. It's a nearly three hour slow moving borefest that takes forever to go anywhere.Could have been a truly great western but instead it plods along and puts you to sleep at frame one.",1,3,13,19 November 2017

",This is a train wreck.A bunch of exceedingly ugly so called dancers who can't dance get together and do nothing but run around like maniacs on crack and about 3/4's into the movie things turn badly.There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The actors cant act and if they are really dancers they need practice and a 15 pound diet.I honestly don't get the 7+ star review!

Each has a different military background in tactics and they are immediately in conflict on how to prepare for the attack. Nearly a third of the men are in the infirmary, as the welsh company tries to somehow survive with no help in sight. Based on a true story.The first half of this film is boring beyond belief. Then there's a brief fight scene. Then it gets really boring again. Then there's a really boring fight scene with lots of talking.Getting the picture?

An assorted group of defenders attempt to make the coast defensible against an imagined Japanese invasion, in this big budget, big cast comedy. Members of a Japanese submarine crew scout out the madness, along with a Captain in Germany's Kreigsmarine (Navy).Think Independence Day but unwatchable.This is one of the worst big budget movies I've ever seen. I'll be honest.I'm not a huge fan of Spielberg. I think he makes technically good looking movies that lack heart and soul.But this drug fueled bomb is all over the place. It lacks real direction.It tanked at the Box office too.",2,4,7,3 May 2014
Foxcatcher," Over-hyped
","Based on true events, Foxcatcher tells the dark and fascinating story of the unlikely and ultimately tragic relationship between an eccentric multi-millionaire and two champion wrestlers. When Olympic Gold Medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is invited by wealthy heir John du Pont (Steve Carell) to move on to the du Pont estate and help form a team to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his new state-of-the-art training facility, Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his training and finally step out of the shadow of his revered brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). Driven by hidden needs, du Pont sees backing Schultz's bid for Gold and the chance to 'coach' a world-class wrestling team as an opportunity to gain the elusive respect of his peers and, more importantly, his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave).This movie is a bore fest. And if you already know how it ends because you are familiar with the story, it's pointless to watch.The wrestlers seem to be retarded. I'm not joking. It was hard to watch them. Plus the relentless wrestling scenes will put you to sleep.It's really an over-hyped movie. I will say this -- Carell is nearly unrecognizable. But then he's wearing a fake nose and some Chiclet front teeth.Unfortunately the painfully slow pace of this movie and poor payoff does it in.",2,7,20,16 January 2015

He soon learns this is easier said than done.Interesting concept that is relatively well directed with this caveat -- there are long stretches that are just plain boring.It's almost as if they had a very short story that they needed to add lots and lots of filler to lengthen this film out.Unfortunate because it takes it's toll on interest level.By the time the movie gets to the good part and the twist ending, you already lost interest and it takes an effort to come back around.Unfortunate.",5,14,30,8 March 2017

And not in a good way.The earlier Jurrasics at least had interesting actors like Goldblum to punch up the dumb dialog. This movie has none of that. There's an Indian guy who you can't even understand half the time! The 'bad' guy is right out of a homeless shelter.

The directing is fine and the setting is lush but man that bad acting brings the film down.The black guy and the husband or boyfriend or whatever he was are OK, but man that girl sucks.The movie could also benefit for a running tim that is half its length.",2,13,20,17 May 2020
Selma," A TV movie that will put you to sleep
","The unforgettable true story chronicles the tumultuous three-month period in 1965, when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. The epic march from Selma to Montgomery culminated in President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most significant victories for the civil rights movement.Director Ava DuVernay's 'Selma' tells the story of how the revered leader and visionary Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his brothers and sisters in the movement prompted change that forever altered history.Yeah. Only this is a history re-write.And it's not a very good movie. Nor is it main stream. It caters to the far left and black audience which means it won't make any money. And the fact that this movie was made despite it's eventual monetary loss to the studio. Isn't enough for the likes of Al Sharpton. This movies screens like a TV film.",2,40,85,16 January 2015
La La Land," Absolute Trite Embarrassing Garbage
","The Plot.Mia, an aspiring actress, serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and Sebastian, a jazz musician, scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars, but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.Hands down, this garbage was the worst movie i have seen in a decade. From the first frame to the last I was bored to Hell.Why?Well first off the musical numbers actually suck a big one. They are unoriginal and silly and not entertaining. The music is a bore.The story is so thin you can slide it in a locked freezer door.Don't believe the hype. Hollywood lost it's ability to make good musicals decades ago. And this one is the bottom of the barrel.",1,24,54,16 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," The Pandering of Identity Politics
","The Plot. If you don't know the plot, you have been living under a rock for 40 years. So the direction is good. The look of the movie is good. The exposition is good. The special effects are good. The acting is decent. But there is something missing. You'll leave the movie feeling empty. There is no heart to this movie.It's mechanical.And then there is the pandering like I've never seen. Over the top flaming gay characters abound and every person of color is partnered with a white person. What? They couldn't find one set of blacks to be partnered?It's really offensive to our sensibilities because movies now have been reduced to identity politics and quotas instead of making good movies.",2,19,39,3 April 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," Dated and Unworthy of the Praise
","Proof that Hollywood was making left wing anti war propaganda since it's birth.The movie has gotten stellar reviews but rankly, it's dated. The exposition is overly dramatic and heavy handed as is the direction.Plus the young soldiers all have freaking Brooklyn accents! They are supposed to be German! A movie like this would never make money today and it would get summarily panned.If you want to see a great war film, try Hacksaw Ridge or Saving Private Ryan.",4,2,21,22 October 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Another Over Hyped Borefest
","Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.Wow. If you like cartoons with thinly drawn characters and absurdly unbelievable plot lines that purport to be based on fact maybe you'll like this film.DiCaprio hit the wall and looks over the hill.Mcconaughy wears a big fluffy wig and delivers is lines like Gary Busy.Jonah Hill wears buck teeth. Seriously. The entire movie is like a Warner Bros cartoon.Directed like goodfellas or casino but without an interesting or compelling believable story to hold on.And it's three boring hours.",3,4,8,13 March 2014
It Chapter Two," Not Even Close to as Good as Chapter One
","The suspense and thrills of Chapter One are virtually all gone in Chapter Two. The gang doesnt interact in the same seamless way they did as children in the first movie.Lot's of holes in the story telling. For example none of them has seen each other for twenty some years and yet the black guy who re-assembles them has all their cell phone numbers (and they have no idea who he is when he calls so how did he get the numbers? You can't look up cell numbers).Further the clown is back for some time before the gang comes back and yet he seems to be eating people, not floating them like in the first movie. Why is that?When they get to the lair from the first flick it's devoid of floaters even tho the black guy tells them the clown has been active for some time.And then there's a really stoopid ending to the clown. It actually ruins the movie completely because it's laughable.And then there's the gay agenda from frame one to the ending with Ritchie's little secret. Why do we need this? Does this crap really have to be shoved in our face in every freaking movie? Does it? I for one, am tired of it.On the plus side, the film moves quickly with little down time, except that it's about a half hour too long. It reminded me of LOTR Part Three when it kept ending and then there was more ending and then there was more until you just wanted to leave the movie theatre already.",4,6,10,7 September 2019
Sherlock Holmes," Oy simply the worst film ever
","This movie made a lot of money and is in the midst of a sequel....only, it stinks! Unequivocally one of the worst films I've ever seen. Boring beyond belief. Unexciting. Trite. Unoriginal.In short -- stink bomb.Waterworld is Citizen Kane compared to this flick!There is not one redeeming moment, and I still don't know what the plot it!Guy Ritchie is one of the worst directors ever. How does he still get work when none of his films before this made money?Swept Away -- $10 million budget. ROI? half a million. The guy is a hack Stay away!",1,3,9,17 July 2010

As mankind teeters on the verge of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers - and to find them, she will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.Wow. No t sure what the fuss is about. This movie is contrived and an insult to intelligence.It's slow as can be, cheaply made and really silly. Octopus aliens come to earth. Oh! So cutting edge. The acting is so overly dramatic you will want to throw up. The sets look like they were developed for an off off Broadway show. I am totally shocked at the good reviews. It's not a good movie in the slightest.",1,35,77,18 November 2016
Parasite," This is Decidedly NOT a Best Picture
",Best foreign film -- I can't say. But best picture overall? No way. It's excruciatingly slow and the story has been done before. It's not particularly funny either (like that other Korean film from a year ago was).I never connected with any of the characters or cared one bit about anyone.Just another example of identity politics and Hollywood giving undeserved awards.How did Joker get overlooked?,2,9,35,16 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," All Hype...No Substance
","Plot.Riggan Thomas, once known quite well to movie theater goers as an iconic super hero called 'The Birdman' had recently turned down a fourth installment of the franchise. Now washed up, he attempts to reinvent himself as a director by staging a new adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story called 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. The events leading up to the Saturday night premiere prove to be one disaster after another as the original lead actor is injured while on set and Riggan scrambles to find a replacement, but the replacement proves to be exactly who he needs - a method actor who takes the job way too seriously. But Riggan has a hard time juggling between the set, his replacement actor, his equally washed up daughter, and a host of other disasters that prevent a proper staging of the play.Yeah. this movie sucks. It's all hype. No substance. It's the NEW Hollywood version of what a movie should be.In other words boring and dumbed down",2,33,74,19 January 2015
Wonder Woman," Don't Believe the Hype -- It Sucks
","The Plot. Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when a pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powers and her true destiny. Don't believe the hype. This movie truly sucks. Women are bad directors -- especially for action films.The acting is mediocre and the story is a borefest. Plus parts make no sense. As a kid WW speaks English perfectly but as an adult she has a thick accent. REALLY?I was really bored out of my mind for more than 2 hours.",1,72,159,7 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The Worst Superhero Movie Ever Made
","The PlotFollowing his titanic struggle against General Zod, Metropolis has been razed to the ground and Superman is the most controversial figure in the world. While for many he is still an emblem of hope, a growing number of people consider him a threat to humanity, seeking justice for the chaos he has brought to Earth. As far as Bruce Wayne is concerned, Superman is clearly a danger to society. He fears for the future of the world with such a reckless power left ungoverned, and so he dons his mask and cape to right Superman's wrongs. The rivalry between them is furious, fueled by bitterness and vengeance, and nothing can dissuade them from waging this war. However, a dark new threat arises in the form of a third man: one who has a power greater than either of them to endanger the world and cause total destruction!What a stupid plot. And why do we have to re-live Batman's origin with a terrible find actor who should be in school and who will never act again, when we've just seen the BEST Batman trilogy ever?Ben Affleck is painfully mis-cast has Wayne/Batman. he really can't act and his screen time is laughable. Plus the dialog is idiotic. Let me give you an example that happens in the first three minutes of the film. Metropolis is being destroyed and Wayne calls someone in a building he presumably owns. The guy picks up the phone and we can see through the window behind him the entire city of Metropolis coming down. Building are falling, fire everywhere and Wayne says 'I want you to get everyone out of the building now.' Really? On the first fireball I'd be running. It's stupid.Who Affleck blew to get this role would be something to discover.The movie drones on and on and feels like it's 12 hours long. It's boring beyond belief. And did i say Affleck can't act?Alfred looks younger than him. And is totally miscast as well (Jeremy Irons).And who cast Lex Luthor? OMG. It's like they just wanted to throw sh!t to the fan.The movie sucks.And did i say Affleck cannot act?Please. I implore you. Go out in the fresh air. Don't waste your money or time on this garbage.",1,9,21,31 March 2016

Jojo Rabbit," Making Nazis Kewl

Lucy," Worse movie of the decade!
","The PlotIt was supposed to be a simple job. All Lucy had to do was deliver a mysterious briefcase to Mr. Jang. But immediately Lucy is caught up in a nightmarish deal where she is captured and turned into a drug mule for a new and powerful synthetic drug. When the bag she is carrying inside of her stomach leaks, Lucy's body undergoes unimaginable changes that unlocks her mind's full potential 100%. With her new-found powers, Lucy turns into a merciless warrior intent on getting back at her captors. She receives invaluable help from Professor Norman, the leading authority on the human mind, and French police captain Pierre Del Rio.Hands down, one of the dumbest and most poorly made movies I've seen in a decade.Johanson can't act and the movie suffers from over the top music, poor direction and erratic editing.Morgan Freeman is severely walking thru his role and comes across as an slacker.It doesn't really get going until about a third of the film is over and by that time you'll be running for the door!If you stick it out you'll soon realize that it doesn't any better.It's really idiotic.",1,3,12,3 October 2014
Midway," More Propaganda from China
",There's been a lot of movies made from Chinese investor money coming out lately. And quite a number of those movies have to do with WW2 for some reason.The unfortunate thing is that these movies all have the same exact look and feel and it doesn't work for Americans. That's why this film didnt make money.They seem to want things directed in a certain way that's a bit off and a bit creepy.I have a hard time putting my finger on it but compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. Or any American made WW2 movie and you'll know what i mean. Part of it is the CGI is epic and way over the top.Anyway this isnt a particularly good film.,2,4,23,16 February 2020

The crew determines that the sample contains a large, single-celled organism - the first example of life beyond Earth. But..things aren't always what they seem. As the crew begins to conduct research, and their methods end up having unintended consequences, the life form proves more intelligent than anyone ever expected. Unless you saw Alien. This is an extraordinarily talkie absurdly pretentious piece of slow moving garbage. Even when there are dramatic scenes the characters are dead wood. What a bore.",2,9,21,1 April 2017

Doesn't work. Samuel Jackson is sooooo over exposed. He's in everything.Tired of him.Colin Firth is WAY out of his element.And then there are all the idiotic save the world from global warming rhetoric.

","Tom Cruise is WAYYYYYY over his head in this one. He's horrible. Not believable in the slightest. Let's be honest, the movie did very poorly at the box office and the reason is gets good reviews here is the subject matter.

To this end, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, an Army officer convinced he must save Germany from Hitler, is recruited to mastermind a real plan. To do so, he arranges for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie, to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer.

Up in the Air," Danger! We are approaching the left wing agenda
","Oh my loving God. This movie starts out fine. Clooney is a vapid head chopper working for a company that outsources its service to fire people at big companies.We can debate this as reality. In my 30 years of working and going through downsizing in every company, I have never experienced this. But, alright, maybe it's out there. Anyway, the movie moves on and crazy far left Clooney falls for a chick he finds out is married. Wooooooooo. Should we be sad for you that you got your comeuppance? Puh-leeeeeze. The we are met with a bunch of staged vignettes that depict an array of unemployed people who through no fault of their own are on the dole!Waaaaaaaaa.I've been let go due to downsizing multiple times and guess what? I get my butt off the couch and find something else lickity split. Why? Cuz I don't like being beholden to Big Brother. Aren't we sick of this crazy far left view of the US?
