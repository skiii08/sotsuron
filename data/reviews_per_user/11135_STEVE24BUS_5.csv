Blade Runner 2049," Bleak and beautiful.
","Sometimes you just have to sit back and listen, I've heard this film described as dull and boring, I prefer to think of it as thoughtful and moving. Stunning to look at, bleak yet beautiful, all story so you need to be alert. Even in it's grimness it's style shines through, minimum action, just one well made scene after another leading to a bit of a crescendo finale. Maybe to slow and long for some, but it's worth it, and for me at least, the greatest red herring I've seen in years.",8,0,6,11 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A long time ago in a galaxy far away, Star Wars ruled.
","I remember the excitement of the original Star Wars films and the anticipation of of the original sequels, not any more, just another money spinning release living off the legend. Not that this particular film is a bad film, it's just the same as the rest of them, pretty much the same story, same action, same outcome, just the names have changed. Obviously well made and special effects are great, as they have been for over 40 years. Still I watched and enjoyed it, even though you know the very predictable outcome. But to be fair, they are never going to recreate the excitement of the original trio of films. Still, no doubt fans will flock to see it, and if there is anyone left alive who hasn't seen the original films then you'll love it.",6,2,7,18 January 2020
Children of Men," A scary vision of the near future.
","I have never read the novel on which this film is based,but living in the north of england with a large immigrant population some aspects of this compelling film frightened the life out of me.The story is not new,but the vision of this future is scary, maybe because it is a little to close for comfort.I could go on about the performance of the actors but when you have Micheal Caine,Clive Owen,and Julianne Moore you know its not going to be a duff movie.Full marks to the style in this film was shot ,which adds to the feel ,almost like a news crew filming at times,(leaving the blood on the lens was a masterstroke,this was real shock value.)A very disturbing film ,but it still managed to keep me on the edge of my seat.",8,2,2,2 February 2007
The Great Raid," A story of true heroism.
","I watch a lot of films but have never felt the need to contribute a review of any kind before.Many films can show the brutality of war but i was moved to tears by the treatment of the prisoners and the barbarity of the Japanese in this factual story.The cast of relatively unknown actors (to me anyway)pulled me into this account of America's most succsesful p.o.w.retrieval in history,Don't get me wrong ,this is far from a gung ho movie but a very well made account of these events. Full marks must go to the location shooting and the direction for the splendid work on this film. I would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in history,or anyone who enjoys a true story well made.",9,2,5,6 May 2006
Law Abiding Citizen," If you think you are right
","If you are looking for a thought provoking movie,although not to thought provoking this is for you,Who is the villain,who is the hero?This is the real subject of the film,thats the thought provoking bit.You will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish the acting is good,the story is good and the moral,well what would you do?Don't write many reviews but this film makes me think,if a film makes me think and entertains me then its pretty well done its job,See it ,think about it enjoy it,above all don't take it too seriously or you could need therapy, when you think about the morals of this movie,who is right ,who is wrong,what would you do?I know my answer.",8,2,4,26 October 2009
