Antz," Awesome CG with a Plot.
","I just wanted to say that the computer graphics in this movie are beyond spectacular.  The life-like movements of the characters deserves an applause.  What's surprising is that the movie had an enjoyable plot, and best of all, it wasn't another 80 min. animation -- full length is good. : -)",Null,0,0,29 October 1998
