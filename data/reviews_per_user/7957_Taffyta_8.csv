Casablanca," Pretty good!!
","By the end of Casablanca, I was well aware of where certain famous quotes originated from. I was pretty surprised to keep hearing lines that I've heard before in other movies or TV shows. I was excited to see the famous airport scene. One thing that really confused me was the transition to the time Rick and Ilsa spent in Paris. I must have zoned out or was thinking of something else, because I could have SWORN that it was a flashback into it, but then it never seemed to get out of it. Like there was a flashback, but it continued on to the rest of the story. I'm not sure what happened there. The characters were interesting enough, though. The romantic aspect of it was enjoyable and the twists at the end. It wasn't really my kind of story, but I liked it regardless.",7,1,4,10 March 2013
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Enjoyable
","I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The 'old' photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.",7,0,0,20 April 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Realistic and relatable!
","I've always heard of 'The Grapes of Wrath' but I had never known anything about it. So it was nice to get the chance to view it and see what it was about.I enjoyed how 'simple' it was. Sometimes I get lost in story lines when there's talk of financial matters and law. It just looses me. This was simple in that were wasn't too much babble about things like that. The characters carried on with life and had real experiences that I could emotionally follow.I did seem to miss out on characters leaving the original party, besides the one that was pointed out by the characters. I did sit here wondering why certain faces weren't around anymore. I was paying attention, but I think it's because black and white movies are hard for me to follow, since I grew up with color. If a character isn't distinct enough, I'll forget who they are and mix them up with others. That would happen in such a story as this, with so many people in it and moving around such a large group.Those are the only two discrepancies I had with it. Other than that I did enjoy it!",8,0,1,22 February 2013
Annie Hall," Very entertaining!
","Scrolling down the main page for this film, I noticed under 'taglines' the movie is described as 'A nervous romance.' I think that is just the PERFECT way to sum up this film. Because I was definitely going to bring how nervously the two main characters, Alvy and Annie, acted the whole time. They just spoke awkwardly to each other. This was an oddly funny film, directed in weird ways. I really liked how Alvy would talk to the audience or to strangers on the street. The people on the street would give him answers like they knew his situation, but they were only strangers who would actually have no clue. The humor was sarcastic and observational. It made fun of real life; for example a stranger talking loudly behind you about something they think they know about, but don't. Or even what really goes through peoples minds when they are having a conversation. This movie poked fun at reality using unrealistic methods. It was really interesting.",8,0,0,26 April 2013
The Graduate," More understandable now that I'm older.
","I first saw this movie for a Film as Literature class in high school, years ago, but had since forgotten anything that had been pointed out to me at the time. So it was still exciting to watch it again. I knew what to expect overall, but now I was able to analyze everything in between. I just had an overall better understanding of it, being older and having almost finished college myself. So now I can appreciate Ben's thoughts and feelings as a character. Personality wise, Ben is just really awkward. Which I find is frustratingly hilarious. At certain parts I just felt he was being stupid and that someone needed to really tell him so, but he lacked friends. He was very detached from his parents, so he really had no guidance from anyone. He was just by himself in all of his rather bad decisions. I found the movie to be a little cryptic at times, but it was horribly bad. I liked how some scenes went in and out of each other, probably to make the viewer feel like Ben. Drifting through a routine with not much thought, then being disturbed by an outsider. The music went along great with everything as well.",9,0,0,20 April 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Great performances and songs!
","This was a really enjoyable movie, funny and with good characters. It wasn't at all what I imagined the plot to be. It was actually a lot more interesting. In Disney or Universal when I was probably 5, I have a picture of me taken under an umbrella next to a streetlight, with a background like in this movie. So I've always known that the movie contained a scene like that were they sang a song called, 'Singin' In The Rain'. I figured that would be the most memorable scene, but actually for me, it was the 'Make Them Laugh' sequence performed by Donald O'Connor. I really liked how it was choreographed. Donald and Jean Hagen were my favorite actors in this film. The only part of this movie that confused me and I think it could have done without was the whole 'Gotta Dance' sequence. It was really out of place and unnecessary. Or at the very least, too long. Maybe if they shortened it by like 5 minutes it would have been better. But that's the only thing I didn't like about it.",8,0,1,1 April 2013
Pulp Fiction," Amusingly Dark
","Normally a movie with as much violence as this is not something I'd like to watch. But there was something about it that was great, I believe it was the humor. The movie is pretty serious and something will go wrong or they are confronting someone, but the acting and the dialog just make it funny. How upset can you be when Vincent and Jules are bickering over a major deal, as if it were a common annoyance? The flashbacks and forwards were only briefly confusing for me, but I was able to catch on quickly enough. I was trying to come up with the main point of a movie like this and had trouble. But I did recognize that Jules repeats a Bible quote a couple times. What I gather from it is that Jules says it to people thinking that he is the good man, getting rid of the evil men for the good of mankind. But that couldn't be right, because of how he executes that. If anything, he's just as much of an evil person. The movie ends with the beginning, so then you can think back to if Jules really did take that into consideration before he acted out.",7,1,3,9 May 2013
The Birds," Classic Story
","I saw this movie a couple times as a child and for some reason was not frightened by it. But I have revisited it as an adult and I can now understand it much better. To me now, this movie is a lot more frightening than other 'scary' movies I've seen. I think what makes it more terrifying than a monster flick, is because we all know that monsters aren't real. At least the traditional ones. But birds ARE real. The birds that were used in this movie still exist and are everywhere. What could be more frightening than something that is so ordinary, in nature, suddenly turning its back on us? It's really very unsettling.I think they did a great job casting this movie, every actor fit their part. No one seemed or looked oddly misplaced. A couple scenes seemed oddly edited for me, though. Almost like they suddenly skipped over or the sound would happen before a scene. But that could have been the copy that I have.I'll end this review by saying that my mother is actually afraid of birds because of this film.",8,1,3,1 April 2013
