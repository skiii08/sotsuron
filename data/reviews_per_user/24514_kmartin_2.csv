The Blair Witch Project," This movie is SCARY!
","I have to give this movie five stars, two thumbs up, and a standing ovation! This movie was one of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time.  And the thing that makes it scary is the fact that all this stuff could have happened.  You really get the feeling like you are hiking the woods with them.  You are surprised to come across all the weird events that they come across just as they are.  I couldn't watch it alone, and I was afraid to walk to my car alone after it was over.  EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!",Null,1,2,1 June 1999
Final Destination," Great movie
","I was very impressed with this movie.  I like the idea behind the story. This wasn't some corny slasher movie.  I remember a friend of mine saying that he didn't want to see this movie because it was going to be just like every Friday the 13th movie he'd ever seen.  I completely disagree.This was a great movie that actually scared me a little.  Of course, this being the year 2000, there were very graphic scenes, aka the girl getting hit by the bus and Stifler, er, Billy getting his head chopped off.  But, it really added to the suspense of the movie.I would highly recommend this movie to people who really want to be scared.Oh, and one last note, Ali Larter (Clear Rivers) is HOT! :)",Null,0,2,2 October 2000
