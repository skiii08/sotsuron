Blade Runner 2049," Best movie i have seen in a few years
","This movie is by far the best movie of 2017, and one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.I love the slow build up, the story and plot takes its time, the visuals were stunning, the music created a great atmosphere. Ryan Gosling is a living proof that less is more when it comes to acting, he has charisma which enables him to emote without overacting, and it comes off as natural. I have never seen the original Blade Runner. But the story in this movie is beautiful. It touches the subject of what makes us human, the desire for human interaction, loneliness, equality, the concept of being part of something, the desire to be loved and wanted. I was expecting to see an action packed sci-fi thriller. What i saw was way more than i expected or paid for. The movie took its time, but it was worth it. With all the action packed, non-stop aggressive in your face movies that Hollywood is spewing lately, seeing this was like breath of fresh air. The movie didn't feel long to me, and never in a million years did i think a sci-fi movie called Blade Runner would move me and evoke such emotions when watching it.If you are going to pay for a movie ticket this year, this is the one, it is worth every penny.",10,2,14,6 October 2017
Dunkirk," Nolan's weakest work
","This movie is just not that good.It starts out very promising, the first 15min of the movie make you excited for what is about to come next. But as the movies goes on, you realize that the dialogue (the little that was in this movies) is not good. The plot is scattered all around the place. The characters have no story, some of them don't even have names. The timeline trick was really not that clever. And the emotional connection was non existent due to all of the aforementioned reasons.Never once did i feel, while watching this movie, the epic magnitude of the situation. When Branagh's character stated how many soldiers where saved i almost choked on my popcorn, because the beach looked like it had max. a few hundred men waiting in line. Nolan should have used cgi, at least on the beach scenes.There were few things that were silly and felt rushed. A young boy accidentally suffers a fatal wound, and the old man responsible for him doesn't even bat an eye. The boy ends up being dead, and the old man still couldn't care less. Tom hardy's character flies on an aircraft out of gas for what seems to be an eternity. Then lands the plane nice and neat on the enemy shore, when he could have landed it anywhere safe. Nolan should get help when writing scripts. Action alone do not make a movie.",5,6,8,19 September 2017
A Quiet Place," Great concept, Very poor execution
","I thought the concept was great, a horror movie that is practically silent, Fantastic. I thought the child actors were phenomenal, i haven't seen this credible and honest child actor performances in a while. Emily Blunt delivered, and as much as i like John Krasinski he was the weakest link acting wise. Where the movie fell apart was the lack of consistency in the plot, and the lack of credibility in the actions of the characters. The creature can only hear and not see, that was established early on. BUT when the father gets killed, he did not make a sound, he was just standing there with an axe on his hand when the camera cuts to the creature on the roof. So the creature can see after all? The family use sign language in the beginning of the movie to communicate, as the movie progresses there is Mom and Dad talking in a normal voice after the child is born, and the creature can't hear that? On some scenes the creature hears the smallest things and is in the house within seconds, but when the baby is crying after birth, there was about 10 min. time for the Dad to get to safety. There is zero consistency on the creatures actions, can it see or not?The parents lose a child early on and they decide it is a good idea to bring another baby to that kind of world where being silent is everything? The Mom uses a an alarm sound at one point at the movie to create diversion. Why didn't they create sound affects around the field to use as diversion when needed? That would have been the most sensible thing to do. They rather used fireworks, which could have harmed them instead. There is a waterfall which blocks sound, then why don't they more there?I am not even going to go in on the newspaper articles, because that is just utter nonsense. For publications to even exist and print papers after this kind of danger is ridiculous. And the fact that a pre-teen realized the creatures weakness on her own at a very convenient time, just no. But points on creativity in the terms of the concept and the great casting.",6,1,1,14 April 2018
Mother!," What in the Jennifer Lawrence's wig did i just watch?
","This has to be one of the most disgusting, disturbing and vile movies i have ever seen. No wonder the director kept the content of the movie quiet, and made the trailer look like this movie was a psychological thriller. If people knew what the movie contained, no one would see it.Even in the world of cinema there is a line that should't be crossed, and Aronofsky really crossed the line with this sick movie. There are a few scenes in this movie that are done just for shock value, just for the sake of shock. I wish i could unsee the horrific images that i had to endure while watching this movie.Obviously the movie's budget was used on CGI, because they couldn't even afford a decent looking wig for Jennifer. And all the pretentious BS about how mother nature is sooooo down to earth that she walks about the house with no bra on. Aranofsky's sick agenda is very clear when watching this movie. Save your money and go see something worth your time.",1,19,30,19 September 2017
