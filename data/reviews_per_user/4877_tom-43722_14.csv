Blade Runner 2049," A strong film
","If there's one thing The Force Awakens has taught me, it's that critics are not always reliable. Also shortly before I saw this movie, I saw it advertised on YouTube with the incredibly pretentious line 'The critics have spoken'. Considering most of them couldn't recognize a piece of crap like TFA when it smacked them in the face, I would take most of their reviews with a healthy pinch of salt.But does my lack of faith in critics mean they were wrong about this movie? Not necessarily. Having never seen the first Blade Runner, I can't comment on this as a sequel, only as a standalone film. And as a standalone film, I'd give it at least 8 out of 10. It didn't blow me away but at the same time, I couldn't find many problems with it. There were a lot of unanswered questions so it kind of feels like it's setting up a sequel - something that most Hollywood movies do this days which can be seen as a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the film and franchise - but it can also work on its own if you just take it as K's story rather than thinking about how it affects the overall franchise. Fortunately, this is easy to do since he's the lead.Ryan Gosling delivered a strong performance but there were times where I felt he was being a little too subdued. I understand that was part of the character as K, or Joe as he was later called, wasn't a very emotional man but it also made his burst of emotion when he was with Dr Stelline feel a little out of place. Not bad but I felt like it didn't have the necessary build-up of repressed emotion to result in that reaction. Ironically, the opposite occurred when his holographic wife/girlfriend died. If he was ever going to have a burst of emotion, it should have been in that scene which could have been the most heart-breaking scene in the movie. Unfortunately, it was glanced over too quickly and Gosling didn't look nearly as pained by it as Harrison Ford looked when Rick Deckard was talking with Nianda Wallace, played by Jared Leto (who didn't have much screen-time but is very different in this movie than he was in Suicide Squad so the guy can act with the right direction), about his dead lover.Speaking of Harrison Ford, he was in less than half the movie so I spent a good chunk of it waiting for him to show up. When he finally did, he quickly overshadowed Gosling for the rest of the film. My favourite scene was Deckard's talk with Wallace. Deckard only had a handful of lines in that scene but I just had to look at his face to know how much the death of his lover and loss of his children pained him. He also had one of the greatest lines in the film 'Sometimes, in order to love someone, you have to be a stranger' explaining why he hid his children rather than raising them himself. Finally, I liked his final scene where he simply put his hand on the glass as his long lost daughter approached him. No words were needed. They just let the moment speak for itself.I also liked Robin Wright's character, Lt Joshi. I don't think I've ever seen Wright in a movie before and if I have, she didn't leave much of an impression but she was likable enough to make me wish that she hadn't been killed off.Overall this is a strong movie. It's well written, directed and acted, particularly by Harrison Ford despite him not having as much screen-time as you might expect, but not quite good enough to make me a Blade Runner fan. However, I expect those of you who are fans will love it.",8,1,5,14 October 2017
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman resurrects Winston Churchill
","Gary Oldman lived and breathed Winston Churchill and his charisma carried the entire movie. This was such a monumental time in Churchill's life, yet it took place over less than two weeks. At first glance, one might think that the title was referring to England's darkest hour, but the subtext of the film is that it was actually showing Churchill's darkest hour, where he was riddled with self-doubt as well as opposition from people who should have been his allies. Despite his belief that surrendering to Hitler would only make things worse, people were dying day after day and it seemed that the only option that wouldn't result in annihilation was to negotiate with the tyrant. In the end though, it wasn't the pressure of politicians or concern over his reputation that caused Churchill to choose to keep fighting against overwhelming odds. It was the opinions of ordinary people. Which brings me to my favourite scene in the movie. I don't know if it's historically accurate or not, but the scene on the train shows us what a kind-hearted, funny, likeable and humble guy Churchill was. He joked around with normal people whilst also asking for their advice, even to the point where he treated a little girl as though her opinion held weight. As Sirius Black once said (not in the Harry Potter movies unfortunately, only the books, but this is a nod to another of Gary Oldman's characters) 'If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals'. Churchill treated his inferiors with just as much respect as he would treat the King of England. He had his flaws, such as his habit of mumbling and short temper, but he had the spirit of a man who believed not only in freedom, but in equality. Churchill's speech at the end of the movie, though I can't quote it line for line, was incredibly passionate as he let go of his insecurities and forged ahead in his quest to defeat Hitler and establish himself as one of the greatest leaders England has ever seen. Not for himself, not for his reputation - hell if England lost the war, his reputation (which already had some stains) would be destroyed and Churchill knew that - but for the freedom of his country.",9,1,5,18 January 2018
The Hunger Games," What's wrong with you miserable people?
","I can't believe so many people have such a negative opinion of this movie! I've read the entire Hunger Games series and despite the differences between the book and the film, I was not disappointed.I'm not saying it's a perfect film. I would have preferred it if they had used the dead tributes as the mutants near the end like they did in the book, instead of just creating them out of nowhere. In the book that really helped demonstrate the monstrosity of President Snow and the Capitol. However despite its flaws, seeing so much negativity for this film is rather upsetting.Jennifer Lawrence is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, and one of the few who can back up her striking good looks with real acting skill. The irony is that Katniss Everdeen is a lousy actress. Jennifer Lawrence is a wonderful actress playing a bad one. Off the top of my head, I can think of only three other actresses in Jennifer's generation who are both exceptionally beautiful and incredibly talented and they are Jenna Coleman, Anna Passey and Emily VanCamp. Saoirse Ronan could also be included but I don't find her as physically attractive as the others.Josh Hutcherson, Willow Shields and Woody Harrelson did great jobs as Peeta, Prim and Haymitch. Donald Sutherland was also horribly evil as President Snow, but in this film he was more of a side character than a main antagonist, so you can't really appreciate and despise him as much as you can in the sequels. If anything it was Cato, played by Alexanda Ludwig, who filled the role as main antagonist and his little speech just before his death made him more interesting than the mindless brute he was portrayed as in the book. Despite some great performances from the majority of the cast, it was Jennifer Lawrence who stole the show.Overall this was a great start to the Hunger Games movie franchise and people who don't like it can... I won't finish that sentence but I think you get the idea.",8,1,6,13 September 2015
Bridge of Spies," Not bad but a bit boring
","I'm not really a fan of Tom Hanks but in this film, he gave a good, albeit not brilliant, performance as Donovan, who suffered public scorn to do what he thought was right. I went into this film unaware that it was based on real live events but at the end, it showed some of Donovan's accomplishments after these events and I was impressed by the number of people he saved; 9703. However in the film, I wasn't hugely impressed by Tom Hanks, although he's by no means a bad actor. Supporting actor Mark Rylance was good, perhaps better than Hanks, and had some funny moments particularly with his main phrase 'Would it help?' I'm not entirely sure if this was meant to be a funny film but it got a laugh out of the audience a fair few times. There were scenes showing Abel's indifference to his situation and Donovan had some amusing lines here and there, but it seemed that the films tone was supposed to be a bit more serious and the humorous parts ruined that slightly. That said, the funny scenes weren't bad, but would probably have been better suited to a more humorous film.There were some things I liked such as the friendship that developed between Abel and Donovan over the course of the film. Their relationship was the films strong point in my opinion. Another part that I liked was at the end, when Donovan was on the train and saw some people climbing over a fence. This links back to an earlier scene in Berlin, where some people were trying to scale a wall and got shot down, which is a good contrast between Berlin and New York.I thought the judge was a jerk and it seemed to me that he was letting his prejudice against Abel influence his decision in the courtroom, so I was glad when Donovan managed to talk him out of giving Abel the death sentence. To me, the judges behavior showed that some people can't be trusted with power, but it was nice to see that he wasn't totally corrupt, so perhaps I misjudged him. This film had a lot of talk about negotiation and politics and since I have little interest in either - largely because I don't trust politicians - it wasn't really my kind of movie. However, I wouldn't call it a bad film. Tom Hanks has some good speeches and there's a funny line here and there, so if you like movies about what goes on behind the scenes in a war, instead of focusing on shooting and explosions, you'll probably like this film. There is a bit of shooting and blowing things up - specifically a plane used to spy on the enemy - but it's kept to a minimum, focusing mainly on Donovan's struggle to help Abel.",5,1,2,13 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Okay
","As someone who watches films more to review them than enjoy them - which is more of a curse than a blessing, I might add - I think this was okay. Not as good as the main Harry Potter series but decent. I liked the throw-backs - or throw-forwards, since it's a prequel - to the other movies and, as befitting for such a film, there was a good variety of magical creatures. Yeah, I could tell they were CGI as were most, if not all of the other effects, but I didn't mind.However, none of the characters really interested me, aside from perhaps Credence and Gellert Grindlewald but in the latter's case, that's only because of what I know about him from the books. I don't really remember much about the other characters and sort of wish Dumbledore had appeared, especially since in the books, it was said that he personally defeated Grindlewald. However the greatest duel in the history of the wizarding world is probably better left to the imagination and on top of that, Grindlewald was confident that the authorities wouldn't be able to hold him for long. No doubt, he escaped later. I also like that he fought several Aurors simultaneously and was winning easily until one of Newt's Magical Creatures attacked him from behind. He's not as powerful as Voldemort but I actually wouldn't have been surprised if he defeated the entire group of Aurors single-handed if he wasn't hit by that sneak attack.Eddie Redmayne was good but I wasn't very interested in Newt's character. The only thing about him that stood out to me was when he commented 'I find that worrying means you suffer twice'. Say what you will about the rest of the dialogue, but that was a good line. Maybe they should have put Hagrid in the leading role since not only is he more interesting but finding and befriending Magical Beasts, especially dangerous ones, was something he was very good at and he would give us a stronger link back to the main series. However it's clear that this film was trying to be its own thing and expand the magical world and it does a decent job at that, despite it's flaws in many other areas, particularly characterization. The performers were okay but none of the characters were written with interesting personalities, except perhaps Credence.I thought the little girl was going to be the Obscurus so it was a bit surprising to find out it was her brother instead. I see Credence's suppression of magic as a warning about suppressing your thoughts and feelings. You have to find some kind of outlet for them or else the consequences could be devastating. My outlet for thoughts and feelings is writing them down. Credence wasn't really evil, he was a product of his environment and the Obscurus developed because he had to constantly suppress his powers, to the point where even Grindlewald thought he was a Squib. After years of abuse and suppressing his abilities, it's no wonder the guy went on a rampage. Even so, he didn't deserve to die.I also liked that it was kind of left to interpretation about whether the 'non-mag' really lost his memory. When the woman kissed him, she was holding her wand and it might have been my imagination, but I'm pretty sure there was a barrier over them to block the memory-erasing rain. It's also possible that the kiss included a subtle spell to give him his memories back. Whether he remembered her or fell in love with her all over again when she visits him at the end is also left to interpretation. I like films that don't spell things out for the audience and leave us to make up our own minds.Overall, this is not a great movie but it's not bad either. It pretty much just gives us what it promised so at least it's not false marketing (unlike the Star Wars 'sequel' The Force Awakens) There's a few throw-backs/throw-forwards to the Harry Potter films, a message about preserving the lives of animals and the magical creatures, while obviously CGI, still include some decent designs and at least one of them even had some personality. I especially liked design of the four winged eagle that created the memory erasing rain and the affectionate little plant-like creature who was constantly clinging to Newt.",6,3,5,22 December 2016
Frozen," Fantastic film
","Frozen's quite possibly my favourite Disney movie, rivaled only by The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's emotional, has a great storyline, fantastic characters, important lessons and is overall excellent.I like how Frozen subtly touches on issues such as child abuse. Elsa and Anna's back story may have been a bit rushed but by doing it quickly, the film prevents the little kids from realizing that Elsa and Anna are suffering from child abuse. Heck it's done so subtly that even Anna and Elsa themselves never show any indication of realizing that their parents abused them. However locking away your children for over a decade, teaching one of them to fear and perhaps even hate herself for who she is as well as separating her from the person she loves most in the world is bad parenting. And the thing is, the king and queen weren't even intentionally being abusive, which is what makes it such an ingenious part of the story. They were bad parents not because they were bad people but because they literally didn't know how to raise their daughters properly, which is why Elsa became so terrified of herself and Anna became so desperate for love that she threw herself at the first man she met. Overall the deaths of Anna and Elsa's parents was actually for the best in terms of both Elsa and Anna's character development and the overall story.Another thing it touches on very briefly is homosexuality, as implied by Oaken's family, which is something I don't think I've ever seen in a Disney movie before. Much like the child abuse it's done subtly so that many might not even notice it.And of course arguably the most important lesson in the story is that love at first sight, while it may exist (I think my parents fell in love at first sight) is not nearly as simple or wonderful as previous Disney movies make it out to be. In fact, Anna's 'love at first sight' relationship with Hans is what nearly dooms her and Elsa. If Olaf hadn't busted Anna out of the locked room, both she and Elsa would have died. Take that anyone who says Olaf's a pointless character!Elsa is easily my favourite character in the entire film. Idina Menzel was fantastic in her portrayal of Elsa and proved herself to be an excellent singer too! Idina's voice brings a maturity to Elsa that shows a woman whose been forced to grow up far too quickly and missed out a lot of her childhood, but there are scenes where Elsa still seems very youthful, especially at the end when she finally accepts who she is and starts skating around like a child with her sister. Speaking of which, the relationship between Elsa and Anna was, and this is coming from a guy with three siblings, the most beautiful sibling bond I've ever seen. They literally loved each other more than life itself and it's both heartwarming and heartbreaking to see them to struggle to reconnect after their ruined childhood. Also I don't mind that Elsa had no love interest; in fact I think she doesn't need one because all the love she needs comes from Anna. That said, I will say that Elsa's one of the hottest Disney females in history, which is ironic considering she controls ice and snow. Normally I prefer brunettes over blonde's but Elsa's one of the few exceptions.Anna was a great character too, although I personally think that Elsa is more interesting and complex. Anna's charm comes from her being very different from the stereotypical princess. She's hyperactive, she's clumsy, she rambles but all that makes her seem like a very real person. And what makes her remarkable is that she still holds onto her optimism and innocence even after a miserable and lonely childhood. Of course she loses some of her innocence after Hans' betrayal but that's part of her character development and she learns something from it. The scene where Anna sacrifices herself for Elsa on the fjord had me in tears, even though I knew she would come back to life, because you can tell that Anna really did think she was going to die (heck arguably she DID die but was resurrected) but she would rather that than live without Elsa. Kristen Bell did a great job at portraying Anna.Olaf was a funny character and as I've mentioned before, he was actually extremely important because without him, Frozen would not have had a happy ending. Olaf also embodies the happiness and innocence Elsa and Anna had before the accident and Elsa's longing to be reunited with her sister.Kristoff and Sven were okay and their little 'conversations' were quite amusing but overall, I wasn't too interested in them as characters. Hans' betrayal came out of nowhere but it worked because it can give people a reality check; too much trust can be dangerous. The Duke of Westleton was an okay character and I like that they didn't portray him as just a villain. He's greedy, paranoid and prejudiced against magic but unlike Hans, he's not evil. He showed genuine sadness when he thought Anna was dead.I hope the sequel is as brilliant as this movie.",9,4,9,27 August 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Funny and touching but very flawed
","This film has a lot of problems but it still managed to make me shed a couple of tears. Let's get the problems out of the way first. The script was a mess. Some scenes were pointless, such as when Jack spoke to that pirate in prison as he was being dragged to the gallows, others were rushed or had no satisfactory build-up, such as when Barbosa realized Carina was his daughter and they stuffed all the build-up, aside from Carina mentioning that her father left her the diary and ruby, into that one scene, and overall the writers didn't seem to know how to make the story flow properly. Also I didn't like Salazar and right from his first line 'Death' I knew he wasn't going to be as good as past Pirates of the Caribbean villains. Despite being an important character in the story, he left very little impact on me.Carina could have been a great character - witch, scientist, astronomer - but unfortunately Kaya Scodelario wasn't the right actress to bring her to life. She wasn't bad and some of her banter with Jack Sparrow was pretty entertaining, especially in the scene where they were about to be executed, but she didn't stand out much. I did like it when she told Salazar's crew to 'piss off' though. Scodelario got the feisty part of Carina's character down well but aside from that, there wasn't much to her. Henry Turner was a pretty dull character as he was basically just Will Turner all over again, having very little to distinguish him from his father. Also I've noticed that Brenton Thwaites isn't good at creating chemistry with the actresses he works with. This was also a problem in Maleficent where he showed no chemistry with Elle Fanning.Okay now let's get to the great stuff. Johnny Depp never disappoints as the eccentric Jack Sparrow and just like the past Pirates of the Caribbean movies, his comedic timing and delivery provided a lot of humour. However, I am going to have to bring up the sloppy writing again because Jack would never give up his compass. I did like learning how he got his name though. Also I liked the scene when he threw his sword to Hector Barbosa while they were clinging on to the anchor. That part told me that despite their very turbulent relationship, Jack considered Barbosa to be his friend in a strange kind of way.As great as Johnny was however, it was Geoffrey Rush who stole the show in this movie, conveying facets of Barbosa's character that we never saw in the other films. For one thing, this is the first time I can remember Barbosa showing fear. When Salazar's ship crushed the English ship and Barbosa ordered his crew to prepare for battle, there was something in his voice that told me Barbosa was actually frightened at that point. I was also touched when he called Carina 'Treasure' and upset when he sacrificed his life for her. Barbosa had finally found someone worth dying for and I was sad to see him go but it was a beautiful and touching swansong which made me shed a tear as Jack, Carina and the others mourned his passing.They also brought back Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley but their roles in this movie were only cameos and Kiera didn't even get a line. However, I'm actually fine with that. Will and Elizabeth's story was all but finished in At Worlds End so all they really needed was their happily ever after and that's exactly what they got. I shed my second tear during their reunion before laughing at Jack's disgusted reaction as he watched them through his telescope. That one scene lives up to the 'funny and touching' part of my title perfectly.The movie as a whole isn't great, despite Geoffrey Rush's brilliant performance, but it had enough going for it to make it enjoyable. It was carried by Geoffrey, Johnny and a healthy dose of nostalgia and unlike other movies that rely on nostalgia (such as The Force Awakens) it didn't betray or tarnish the legacy of the previous movies. Despite it's flaws, this was a decent film.",6,1,4,10 June 2017
Avatar," A masterpiece
","I haven't watched Avatar for a while, but I used to watch it frequently and until Disney's Frozen came out, it was my favourite movie. I loved the original version but personally I think you should watch the extended edition to truly appreciate this extraordinary movie.James Cameron certainly knew what he was doing when he created this film and put his all into the project. All the performers did great work, with fantastic performances from Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana, Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Stephan Lang and Giovanni Ribishi.Sigourney Weaver, who in my eyes is one of the greatest actresses I've ever seen - she's definitely in the top ten, perhaps even top five - made Grace Augustine a snarky, feisty and rather rude woman who was hiding a loving, maternal side as well as a great deal of emotional pain, particularly in regards to the destruction of her school. By the way, if you want to fully appreciate Sigourney's performance in this movie, you need to see Grace's discussion with Jake about the school and that is only shown in the special edition.I've seen Sam Worthington in Clash of the Titans and Wrath of the Titans, but he was at his finest in Avatar, making Jake Sully into a sarcastic and fierce warrior who also had a childish wonder for the world around him. You also see Jake develop throughout the movie. Initially he seems like a 'dumb grunt' but grows into a charismatic leader. His love for Neytiri felt very genuine, thanks to the excellent chemistry between Sam and Zoey.I wouldn't put Zoey Saldana as high as Sigourney Weaver on my list of most talented actresses, but she still did impressive work as the feisty Neytiri. If I had to criticize her, I'd say she was just a little over-the-top when Neytiri found out that Jake was a spy and when she was crying over her father. However to be fair, Neytiri was devastated in both of those scenes and it's perfectly in character for her to lash out when she's angry or distraught, so it was still a great performance. Despite being slightly over-the-top in those two scenes, Zoey proved that she is still capable of subtlety and I'm a guy who appreciates subtlety in a performance. For example there was Neytiri's little disapproving glance at Tsu'tey when Jake was about to catch his Ikran, her playful smile when Jake deliberately flew too close to her or the vulnerable look in her eyes when Jake acknowledged that Peyral was a good hunter. Regardless of whether Zoey's as good as Sigourney or not, she still made Neytiri my favourite character in the entire movie.Giovanni Ribishi also did a great job by making Parker Selfridge a greedy but conflicted man whose greed was constantly warring with his moral guidelines. He was clearly disturbed by the destruction of the Na'vi's home and despite his assertion that they were 'savages', it's obvious that he didn't really want to go to war with them.The true villain of this story is without doubt Colonel Miles Quaritch. He was little more than an evil psychopath, who literally drank coffee whilst destroying an entire clan's home. Although not a deep character, Stephan Lang's performance was so strong that the simplicity of Quaritch doesn't really matter to me.I haven't seen many movies starring Michelle Rodriguez - actually I'm not sure if I've seen her in any films outside of Avatar - but she was an excellent choice to play Trudy Chacon. From what I know of her, Michelle is most comfortable in the role of tough and feisty women so she fitted Trudy's character very well.Those six were the greatest performances in the movie but I'll also give credit to CCH Pounder, Wes Studi, Laz Alonso and Joel David Moore; all of them did great jobs. Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald were rather forgettable but to be fair, their roles were too small for us to really see how skilled they are. However out of the two of them, Matt put on a better performance with what he had to work with.The storyline is rather simple - my younger brother has described it as basically Pocahontas with blue aliens - but that in no way cheapens the experience. Sometimes a simple storyline is the greatest storyline. It depends on how it's told and this story is told extremely well so the predictability of the plot didn't bother me. Furthermore quite a few likable and/or important characters die in this film, showing that Cameron is not afraid to show the brutal reality of war.Pandora is a beautiful moon - for those of you thinking it's a planet, believe it or not it's actually a moon despite being close to the size of Earth - and is alive with unique wildlife and plants. James Cameron did an excellent job of creating an entire new world. Aside from the Na'vi, my favourite aliens are the Toruk and Ikran.Another thing to mention is that the special effects are magnificent. Admittedly, I'm no expert on special effects but the Na'vi, animals and plants all look incredibly realistic. If I'm not mistaken, Cameron had ideas for this film about a decade before it came out but waited until technology was more advanced in order to make it as realistic as possible. That was a wise decision and another sign of the passion and dedication he had for this movie.This movie is probably James Cameron's greatest work since Titanic, perhaps even the greatest in his entire career. He has confirmed a sequel and I hope he puts as much effort into that as he has into this and creates another masterpiece. Only time will tell.",10,2,7,17 January 2016
Joker," I have a condition
","This movie makes it easy to pity the Joker. I felt sorry for him throughout the whole film but the part that made me pity him the most was when he tried to explain why he's laughing on the train and his two assailants just assaulted him without even trying to understand him. I imagine many people would probably pity him more when he tries to do stand up and his compulsive laughter interferes but for me, the little moment where he was trying to explain that he has a condition and desperately asking for a little compassion before getting his ass kicked was more upsetting. Whenever he laughs, it sounds like he's close to crying and the only time his laugh seems like one of genuine amusement, rather than just a result of his condition, is when he's on the talk show with Murray Franklin. Even his laugh in the asylum at the end seems like a pained kind of laughter like he still knows that his life is a tragedy and he's trying to turn it into a comedy.Is Joaquin Phoenix a better Joker than Heath Ledger? Hard to say. They both have very different approaches and while Heath's Joker will always be iconic, Joaquin's Joker actually makes you feel sorry for him whilst also holding a mirror up to the ugliness in society. Yes, The Dark Knight did the latter but you never pity the Joker in that movie and his commentary on society was conveyed through his dialogue. In this movie, they show it. The assaults on Arthur in the streets and on the trains, Murray making fun of him and then forgetting that he'd done so because of how little he cared about Arthur's feelings, Thomas Wayne pretending he wants to help 'the clowns' whilst also talking down to them and outright punching Arthur in the face when he just wants to form a relationship with him, it all reflects how messed up our society is right now. Switch 'the clowns' with struggling people in real life and it shows that politicians and Hollywood will often talk big but 90% of them don't actually care about helping people less fortunate than themselves.With all that said, Arthur Fleck isn't just a victim of tragic circumstances. It's easy to feel sorry for him but the movie never shies away from the fact that he's a dangerous man. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is very human, showing a man who's been beaten down constantly whilst also struggling to deal with a condition he can't control, but it also shows a man who casually carries a gun around, shoots Murray on live television, and finds murdering his own mother to just be part of the 'comedy' that is his life. Speaking of his mother, I love the indication that she might have slept with Thomas Wayne and the Joker could be Batman's half-brother. It's never outright confirmed in the movie and it's entirely possible that it's just one of Joker's delusions but that's a take on their relationship I've never seen or even heard of before.Robert De Niro turns on the charm as Murray Franklin and, of course, Joker sees right through him at the end of the film. When Murray comes to Arthur's dressing room and Arthur asks him to call him Joker because he had called him that in the past, Murray genuinely didn't remember the fact that he's made fun of him. De Niro plays a shallow celebrity in this movie who knows how to play to a crowd but when you get right down to it, he doesn't give a damn about the pain and difficulty that other people are going through. I imagine a fair few people in Hollywood, possibly including De Niro himself, are seeing themselves in his performance and it freaks them out because it forces them to face the fact that all the fame and glamour doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Most celebrities won't go out on a limb to help the less fortunate and this can make people resent them, which results in Murray getting a bullet in his brain.The media is terrified of this movie. You know why? Because it's forcing them to see how ugly most of them are and how they can contribute to the rise of people like Joker. Murray represents all the self-absorbed, virtue signalling celebrities who pretend to care about the less fortunate but ultimately just want to make themselves look good. Celebrities who use their wealth to help people do exist - Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are notable examples and they did it secretly for years before the media found out - but most of them are all talk and this pisses people off. While most aren't crazy enough to shoot their heroes in the head, people who are treated as inferior by celebrities will inevitably build up some resentment. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix had the balls to look Hollywood and the media in the eye and suggest that they might be just as monstrous as The Clown Prince of Crime.Then there's the ending. All I can say is that it reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and, just like that movie, people are going to be talking about it for a long time to come.",10,2,4,20 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Flawed but still great
","ROTS is my favourite of the live action Star Wars movies. Does that make it perfect? No. There's some bad dialogue ('It's only because I'm so in love', 'No, it's because I'm so in love with you'), Sidious killed three Jedi Council Members far too easily and Dooku only had a cameo. However, unlike TFA, which was such a pitiful excuse for a Star Wars film that I think it wounded the franchise, ROTS can stand on its own and deserves its place in Star Wars canon.First of all, the hatred for Hayden Christiansen is very unfair. People keep insulting his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker but I think he actually did a good job with what he had to work with. He spoke in a monotone but he was playing a man who was taught to control his feelings. One of Anakin's character flaws is that he doesn't understand the difference between controlling your feelings and suppressing them. To me, Hayden's monotone showed that Anakin was suppressing his emotions which was partially responsible for his fall. I see it as a warning about how dangerous it can be to suppress your feelings without giving them some kind of outlet. Furthermore, Hayden's actually rather good at acting with his expressions and body language. For example, when he was alone on Mustafar after killing the Separatists he didn't have a single line, but the tear track running down his face showed that part of Vader hated what he'd become.Samuel L Jackson nailed the role of Mace Windu, particularly during his duel with Palpatine. The fight itself wasn't brilliant, particularly when Sidious killed the other three Jedi, but Samuel used some subtle gestures to make it work. For example, the biggest flaw in the fight, apart from the ignominious deaths of Agen Kolar, Saesee Tinn and Kit Fisto, was when Sidious held Mace at blade-point. One might wonder why he didn't strike Windu down then and there but to me, the way Windu spread his arms basically said 'come and have a go', subtly undermining Sidious' confidence and causing him to hesitate. The confidence with which Mace held himself explains why Sidious didn't take advantage of the opening straight away. There's also that tiny gesture Mace gave to Anakin when he held Sidious at blade-point, subtly motioning for him to stand back. Mace also represents all the Jedi Order's flaws, making him an unlikable character despite Samuel's excellent portrayal of him. However, I think George Lucas had the right idea when he created a character who showed how corrupt and arrogant the Jedi had become and how they were partially responsible for their own destruction.Ewan McGregor did an excellent job as Obi-Wan Kenobi. I mean no disrespect to the late Alec Guinness who was great in the Original Trilogy, but I think Ewan surpassed him. He was certainly better at lightsaber duelling and also nailed Obi-Wan's calm, confident presence. For example, when he jumped into the middle of a group of battle droids to confront General Grievous, he just had to say 'Hello there' to show he meant business. He was also great at conveying Obi-Wan's anguish after defeating Vader on Mastafar.Natalie Portman also did a great job as Padme, although the explanation for Padme's death was a bit weak, and Leia shouldn't have been able to remember her since she'd only just been born. Padme's most powerful line in the film was 'So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause'. ROTS, AOTC and TPM taught me not to trust politics and I think that although the political scenes were dull, they were essential for the story. I'm grateful that George Lucas warned me about the dangers of politics. I think the weakest part of the Prequels is Padme's romance with Anakin but Natalie and Hayden both did a very good job in the scene where Anakin found out that Padme was pregnant.Ian McDiarmid seemed to love being Darth Sidious. He could portray Sidious' subtle, calculating, manipulative side but when Sidious was able to use his powers openly, he absolutely loved it, behaving like a complete psycho. He was over-the-top when killing Mace and battling Yoda but he also did well in quieter moments.Christopher Lee only had a cameo, but in the short time he had, he BECAME Count Dooku. He nailed Dooku's arrogance but when he was on his knees in front of Anakin, you can see the fear in his eyes. General Grievous was a much weaker villain. In addition to being a coward, Grievous didn't stand a chance against Obi-Wan in lightsaber combat, although he did nearly kill him in hand to hand combat, albeit only because of his mechanical body.George Lucas isn't a great script writer but he possesses intelligence, creativity and passion and it clearly shows in this film. ROTS isn't a perfect film but I think the good things about it make up for its flaws.",8,16,17,1 June 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," A perfectionist dealing with imperfection
","I'm referring to both myself and Kenneth Branagh's character, Hercule Poirot, in the title. This isn't a perfect movie - then again very few, if any movies are - but it's far, FAR better than The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi combined. I'll get into why I'm comparing it to those train-wrecks later. First, I should say that I haven't read Agatha Christie's novel so I don't know how faithful this is. The only version of this story I've seen was from Doctor Who, and that version took place in the future, in space, and had a Mummy who lets you live for 66 seconds when you see it.With my ignorance of source material out of the way, let's get to the actual review. The most interesting character in the movie is Hercule Poirot, which works fine since he's the lead. A brilliant detective (albeit a somewhat egotistical one, as he proclaims himself 'the best detective in the world') and a perfectionist through and through, right down to requesting that people straighten their ties, his character arc is about realizing that justice and injustice can depend on people's points of view, and that not everybody can be separated into the categories of good and bad. There are shades of grey, which throws his view of perfection, be it perfect innocence or perfect villainy, into question. Kenneth Branagh did a good job at directing the movie, but it might have been better if he'd let someone else do that, because he stood out more as an actor than a director. His ridiculous mustache and strange accent were somewhere between charming and annoying but what made him likable to me were his perfectionist tendencies, as I'm a perfectionist myself.Unfortunately, since the movie has to juggle so many characters, some performers don't get the amount of screen-time that they deserve. Branagh seemed so focused on crafting the film around his own performance that he forgot to give his co-stars time to shine. For example, the legendary actress Judi Dench has played many different roles such as Queen Victoria and Lady MacBeth and holds a special place in my memory as M from James Bond, but she wasn't given much to do in this movie. Penelope Cruz's character also receives little attention although she has enough time to talk about Lucifer and God. Even Michelle Pfeiffer, who looks incredible for a woman who's rapidly approaching her sixtieth birthday (she's well over twice my age but she's somehow managed to stay attractive), didn't leave much of an impression, for better or worse. With so many characters fighting for screen-time, it's hard to become memorable.However two performers outside of Branagh did manage to be memorable, one in a good way and one in a not-so-good way. Despite looking at the cast before I entered the movie, I didn't recognize Johnny Depp at all whilst he was playing Edward Ratchett. He didn't have much screen-time but in the time that he had, he was sleazy and clearly had a shady past, but fear motivated him to carry a gun wherever he went and request Poirot's help, showing that he was still human. I literally never recognized him as the same man who brought us the eccentric Jack Sparrow, perhaps because he looked presentable instead of a drunken mess. It seems to me that Johnny Depp has a rather forgettable face but that works in his favour because it allows him to get as close to literally disappearing into his characters as a live-action actor can get.Now let's get to why I mentioned The Force Awakens. Daisy Ridley is annoying. Her voice sticks out like a sore thumb and she doesn't seem to be very bright, but the most annoying part... was that she actually wasn't that bad in this film. After her lousy performance in The Force Awakens, I was ready to tear this performance apart, but she toned down the over-the-top expressions and even her irritating voice suited Mary much more than Rey. One can always tell it's her voice and it doesn't blend in, but due to the time period and her character's social class, it doesn't sound nearly as out of place as it did on Rey. Ridley is just a pretty face with little brainpower behind it, but she's better here than she was in both of her Star Wars movies put together, which plays into my understanding of Poirot's story arc. Just as he must come to terms with how good and bad, as well as justice and injustice, are not black and white, I must come to terms with the fact that Daisy Ridley's not a terrible actress and my judgment isn't always perfect. It seems that supporting characters are more suitable for her, which emphasizes how poorly cast and directed she was in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. It also proves that, for all his faults, Kenneth Branagh is a far better director than Jar Jar Abrams or Ruin Johnson (pardon me for the immature name calling but frankly, those two hacks deserve it).",7,0,3,2 December 2017
Finding Dory," Not bad
","I find Dory rather annoying but endearing at the same time. In this film, she often remembers things that happened a long time ago, hence she specifically calls her memory problems SHORT-TERM memory loss. She never said anything, in this movie or the previous one, about long-term memory loss so remembering things that happened long ago makes sense to me.What I like about Dory, despite her being annoying at times, is that she's a unique character. I've never seen another movie, apart from Finding Nemo, that deals with short-term memory loss and she has instincts and a way of getting herself out of trouble that make up for her disability. I may find Dory annoying but I haven't seen another characters like her. It's not that she's particularly complex as her personality revolves around her memory problem but she's different and that's enough to make me like her.Sometimes this film makes fun of Dory's condition, as well as Destiny's sight problems, but it's supposed to be a funny film so it fits the tone. I can't speak for people who actually have these disabilities but personally, I don't think they were being too offensive with their humour. If anything, it's refreshing to see a film that's willing to take risks by using characters with disabilities.With all that said, this falls short of being a great film. It was good but the story line is way too similar to the first film, which is one of the most common weaknesses you can find in a sequel, with a handful of exceptions like Kung Fu Panda 2 or the Toy Story movies. The only plot difference I noticed between this film and the first one is that while Nemo was the one who needed to BE found in the previous movie, Dory was the one DOING the finding in this one. However, I did like the way Dory's past was slowly revealed throughout the movie instead of just being shown at the beginning. It was a way of giving the audience an idea of what was going on in her head and what it's like to have memory problems.Hank the octopus was likable enough, despite being a bit of a jerk but his motivations were never really explained, particularly when he changed his mind about not wanting to return to the sea. His decision to suddenly go back to the sea, despite being so determined to go to the safe place where tagged marine life goes didn't make any sense to me. However, I did like the way he moved around in places where Dory, Marlin, Nemo and the other fish characters couldn't and seeing an octopus drive a car was quite enjoyable. Due to my lack of knowledge about the species, I actually had no idea that octopuses had three hearts or could go invisible so those were interesting little things I learned from watching this film.Marlin and Nemo are likable but neither of them are really interesting characters. I enjoyed the scene where they talked to the clam who was abandoned by his girlfriend though.It was nice to see some of the other characters from the first film like Crush and Mr Ray but I wish Gill and the trio of sharks had appeared too.Finally, they actually got Sigourney Weaver in on this project. Gotta give 'em credit for that. Although did they have to use her actual name? Why not just write a character for her like every other movie?",7,3,10,11 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Second worst Star Wars film
","This was easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made, apart from the Star Wars Holiday Special. This film is an insult to Star Wars and that's mainly because, although I wouldn't have minded just a few nods to the other Star Wars films such as Darth Vader's helmet, the storyline is a rip-off of the Original Trilogy.I like the Prequels. Yes, they have flaws but they have a huge advantage over The Force Awakens because they tried something fresh and original. It didn't pay off as well as George Lucas hoped but at least he wasn't just ripping off one of the other Star Wars movies. Harrison Ford and Max Von-Sydow were good, BB8 was cute and Mark Hamill said everything that needed to be said with a single look, but everything else about the film was crap. I didn't realize how bad it really is when I was watching it but it's clear that Abrams didn't give a damn about making a genuinely good movie, only pandering to the masses. Either that or he's deluded enough to think that this is a good movie and can't see that he's a terrible director.I never liked the idea that Luke Skywalker could defeat Darth Vader with so little training but at least he actually HAD training. Rey had literally NO training whatsoever, at least not as far as we or even she knows, yet she beat the hell out of Kylo Ren. To be fair, Kylo Ren was injured at the time but he's still a trained warrior so the only way I can forgive Abrams for putting Rey's seemingly impossible victory in the film is if the following movies reveal that she actually did receive training but somehow forgot. Kylo Ren started off okay and managed to look pretty bad-ass at the beginning of the film, especially when he held off that blaster bolt for an extended period of time, before allowing it to blow something up before he left. However he was clearly a weaker man than Anakin Skywalker and his relationship with Han was just Luke and Vader with the roles reversed. To Adam Driver's credit, he was okay in his scene with Harrison Ford but that was the only scene where he showed that he has any talent. Overall he wasn't much compared to Darth Vader and I'm not even a fan of Vader. Also Ben's light saber was ridiculous but at least he made use of its unique design when fighting Finn.Rey is the only fictional character I can think of who deserves the title of Mary Sue. I feel like that term is used too freely but Rey wasn't a complicated character and anything interesting about her was because of her mysterious past rather than the character herself. Throughout this entire movie, she could deal with any situation without help or any real difficulty. The very few scenes that give her some depth, such as when she was scared by the Skywalker lightsaber and denied that her family weren't coming back, can be easily forgotten. She had no problems resisting the lure of the Dark side, she could fix anything, fly anything, shoot more accurately than trained soldiers, beat up anyone who messed with her including a trained Dark Jedi and wield both the Force and a lightsaber with an impossible level of skill for someone who, as far as both the audience and character knows, has never been trained.Normally, I love strong female characters but in order to make a character realistic and interesting, you have to make them flawed. Daisy Ridley clearly had no idea of how to play Rey and not all of that can be blamed on JJ Abrams' bad directing since Abrams himself told Ridley that her acting was wooden. There are vastly more talented actresses out there who could have brought more to the role. To be fair, Rey was a badly written character but if speaking like a noblewoman whilst playing a character who lived in the gutter is the best she can do, it's pretty obvious that Ridley sucks at her job.John Boyega was an over-the-top, idiotic mouth-breather in this movie. That's all I have to say about him. Domnhall Gleeson was also over-the-top and Oscar Isaac had so little to work with that he was forgettable. One of the saving graces for me was BB8; he was cute and I liked his design.If TFA was a comedy, it would have been fine but it wasn't intended to be a comedy, hence making it a 'so bad it's good' movie. Aside from Harrison Ford, Max Von-Sydow, Mark Hamill and BB8, everything in this film was so bad that people can laugh at how badly Abrams screwed up. I prefer not to think of it as part of Star Wars canon. ROTJ symbolized a new beginning but the people behind this project spat on that and showed us that defeating the Empire was completely pointless. The Empire destroyed millions of lives and obliterated entire planets and a mere 30 years later, The First Order is doing the exact same thing.The people in charge clearly cared more about money than making a good sequel and used peoples nostalgia to manipulate them into watching this crap. Even before I actually saw the film, I wasn't very enthusiastic about it. The next film MIGHT be able to redeem this movie but I doubt it. If I watch the sequels at all, I won't do so in the cinema. The Prequels are not perfect but they deserve their place in the Star Wars time-line. This film does not.",2,15,22,21 December 2015
Me Before You," I had butterflies in my stomach and Emilia Clarke was not the woman who caused them
","I'm not a fan of Emilia Clarke or Sam Claflin. Don't get me wrong; they are talented performers, but I didn't watch the movie to see them. Jenna Coleman is the only woman, both in the acting world and in my own relatively boring life, who can make me feel scared, excited and nervous all at the same time. I think she had far too little screen time and Katrina's story was only very vaguely hinted at. Apparently, she has a son but they never explained who the father is or how she was coping and judging by how young Jenna looks (she's thirty but I think she looks at least five years younger), I wouldn't be surprised if Treena's son was the result of a teenage pregnancy. Assuming he actually was her son. Treena wanted to go back to college but that's only mentioned in one scene. Despite having too little screen time, Treena and Lou really did seem like sisters. It wasn't as good as Anna and Elsa's beautiful bond in Frozen but that was only because the story didn't give Treena enough attention.The ending was sad but I knew Will was going to die before I even watched the movie. With that said, it does lead to questions about whether one should assist in a suicide and it was brave to tackle this controversial matter. Is it murder when one wants to die? I don't know and while Lou and Treena's mother stated that it basically was, that is just one woman's opinion. The film itself doesn't really say whether it's right or wrong. I also noticed something else, actually from a trailer before I even watched the film. Lou said she became a whole new person after meeting Will and her dad said that you can't change who people are. Some could see that as inconsistent writing, but when I think about it, I think it works because Lou and her dad are two different people with different points of view.As someone who appreciates subtlety, I should also draw attention to the scene where Will's parents are discussing his condition while Lou is listening. Something about the way Charles Dance spoke and held himself told me that Will's dad knew that Lou was listening. Charles himself must have known that Emilia was there but I think he was implying that his character heard Lou approaching and was intentionally giving her information about the situation, hoping that she could change Will's mind. Of course, Lou was eavesdropping but I like that it's left to the viewers interpretation about whether Will's dad knew she was there or not.While it's a good movie, the only reason I wanted to watch it was because Jenna's in it. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have written this review. I've had similar feelings about Doctor Who ever since the casting of the talented but overrated Peter Capaldi. Now that Jenna's left, Doctor Who has lost most of its charm for me. With that said, I mistook Treena for Clara at one point because Jenna can disappear into her character when she's playing Clara to the point where, for a moment, I saw Clara playing Treena instead of Jenna playing her. It was like Jenna was playing two characters simultaneously. The problem is that Treena was only in a handful of scenes, so I never really got to know her. She's supportive, playful, a little inappropriate at times ('Katrina Clarke!') and more intelligent than her sister but due to her lack of screen-time, I couldn't get to know her as intimately as I got to know Clara Oswald or Queen Victoria. I don't know what her quirks and flaws are. With that said, Jenna always has a powerful presence, despite her size. Heck, I think they should have switched her and Emilia's roles around because Jenna's the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. Also she's better at subtlety than Emilia but can still be happy, eccentric and energetic.Despite this movies strengths, it also has weaknesses, the most notable one being that it's predictable and there are no real surprises. With that said, it's also passionate and heartfelt. Many movies are lazily put together these days - the film industry has been corrupted by money and seems more concerned about cash than making art - but this one actually had some effort put into it so it deserves to be acknowledged. Me Before You wasn't really my kind of movie but for what it was, it was good. If Jenna wasn't in it and I still watched it, I'd give it 6 but I'm giving it 7 because I freaking love her. And hate that I love her. And I'm driving myself mad over her.",7,2,5,2 July 2016
