Mission: Impossible III," mission well done
","Only having watched opening and closing bits of MI1 on TV and not MI2 at all, I was unexpectedly drawn to MI3 by trailers. This is a well made film, not meant to be realistic but about impossible superagents doing impossible stuff to fight Really Bad Guys so the action had to keep and was kept going with no let up to spoil the fantasy or unreality. Given that, the action/plot was fun and coherent, yet gritty. There IS a big hole in the logic towards the end and the final scenes were plainly unreal but this IS fantasy after all ! My gripes are that some violence especially re the women were unpleasantly and too graphic while the fate of the Bad Guy in the end was way too kind. The music nicely brought back memories of the TV series too. To sum up: a well made and acted action film with just a bit too much violence for some of us and which works well on large screen",6,0,1,31 May 2006
