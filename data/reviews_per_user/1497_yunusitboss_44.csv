Men in Black 3," Men In Black 3 (U/A) 3D-----------------Rating:3/5
","Thankfully there isn't much mumbo-jumbo about time travel that is thrust upon the audience and the focus - as expected - is much more on the camaraderie between Will and Josh. However, and to one's disappointment, it is this very area where the film fails to hold your attention, especially during the second half where neither the drama works, nor the one liners. Oh yes, both Will as well as the ones behind the dialogues and screenplay try hard to inject some humour quotient but frankly, except for a stray four-five points where you do get a smile on your face, there is not even a single 'bring on the laughter' moment.In such a scenario one would have expected the action to do the talking but even that never rises above the ordinary. Now that's a pity because the film is presented in 3D (seems like a conversion case and not really shot in 3D) but still there aren't any wow moments whatsoever. This means that whether it is the action sequence set in a Chinese restaurant or the one where both agents race on their innovative bike and follow a car, you don't really feel enthralled. Even the climactic sequence set around a rocket launcher station hardly arrests your attention. Men In Black 3 (U/A) 3D-----------------Rating:3/5It is an Sci-fi action flick.... 3D effects and visual effects were great.... Will smith has done a great job.... the monsters and creatures are very dangerous to be viewed.....Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history.Of course the revelation soon after the climax is good and one can join the dots here. Still, the excitement is rather too later in the day because by this time one has actually lost good level of interest in the proceedings. Moreover the culprrit is also some of the repulsive shots in the very first 30 minutes of the film with aliens and their body parts making you look in a different direction.Yes, Will Smith does well but then he too is saddled with the kind of script that hardly allows him to bring on his characteristic histrionics. Tommy Lee Jones is hardly there, Jemaine Clement is always cartoon-ish and never quite threatening while Josh Brolin is decent, not exceptional.All in all, a film that you won't regret skipping this season.",6,1,4,29 May 2012

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (A)----------------Rating: 4/5
","The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (A)----------------Rating: 4/5An action romantic adventure flick.... very beautifully filmed this is an vampire movie.....The Quileutes close in on expecting parents Edward and Bella, whose unborn child poses a threat to the Wolf Pack and the towns people of Forks.There is a melodramatic tone throughout, amplified by the music, whether it was the piano-heavy soft moments, the epic score (often played over non-epic moments), or the emo rock songs. A little melodrama is fine, but it goes on for most of the movie, and when there is little hook of a story, it just becomes a drag. Even people who are fans to the series will admit that dialogue has never been its strong suit. Bill Condon attempts to make the sex scene and honeymoon to be tender, but it came off more sappy and overbearing.'Part 1's' strength is that it is the best-acted of the series. Stewart certainly gives it a good go and Lautner gives what is a half-way decent performance. Pattinson was slumming it, but with some of the cheesy dialogue he has to say, even someone like Laurence Olivier would have struggled.Condon does have a few moments of visual darkness, including the dream sequence in the beginning with its juxtaposition of bright white clothing and blood and Bella and Edward standing on top of a load of corpses. The birth scene was actually intense and gory. But these are counter-balanced with goofy moments, one of the most infamous being a psychic werewolf argument.The whole wedding sequence and honeymoon plays like a young girl's fantasy, sort of idealistic. This is fine, but hardly dramatic and not likely to have wide appeal.Previous 'Twilight' movies have had some interesting side issues that could and should have been explored. This is not the case with 'Part 1.' There are no issues of a man resisting his urges and dark side, a young teen forced into being a vampire, an army of powerful new vampires being formed and the idea of there being a vampire council. There is nothing like that. The few themes there are include a look into Edward's past, a brief debate about abortion and the idea of imprinting, which is basically brainwashing. A better idea could be looking at somebody forcing someone else to love them. That would be a dark story.'Breaking Dawn Part 1' is the weakest movie in the series so far and I speak as someone who is neutral to the overall experience.",8,0,6,16 June 2012

Prometheus," Prometheus (3D) (A)----------------------------Rating: 4/5
","Prometheus (3D) (A)----------------------------Rating: 4/5It is sci-fi action flick from Ridley Scott....... The story line was simple but more was expected..... The Visual effects and 3D effects are really awesome worth it for an 3D experience.... The cast was great and the direction was superb...... Frightening scenes are really good and enjoyable...... It is more advanced than AVATAR the movie takes in 2092.......A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race.Instead, the film gets into the entire debate around evolution of humans though thankfully this aspect stays on to be at the peripheral instead of becoming the sole driving force. So even as the space explorers (Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron - each of them getting it perfectly right) get on the mission and enter space to gain answers to questions that have remained unanswered for past so many centuries, you know that there would be thrills galore.Thankfully you get to be a part of that as the very subject matter (sci- fi) with a director like Scott at the helm of affairs necessitates that there would be quite a few eye popping sequences making you stop munching your popcorn and see the drama unfold on screen. This is (expectedly) enhanced by visuals that are not just cutting edge but also belonging to never-seen-before world that further reiterates the fact that out there in West, the imagination has continued to soar despite many landmark sci-fi and other 'visuals-drive' films being made year after year.This is exactly the case with 'Prometheus' as well where battles are fought, encounters catch your attention and some chilling sequences make you struggle to keep your eyes on screen, only to be left wide eyed in quick time.What stops it from becoming a classic though are the comparisons that are bound to be made with other Hollywood counterparts. Of course this is certainly no 'Avatar' here; in fact it wasn't even designed to be one, but still, despite an 'out of the world' theme, it doesn't quite explore that territory to the fullest.However for those looking for their share of action this week with enticing visuals to catch, 'Prometheus' isn't a bad bet at all. It isn't as much fun as an 'Avengers' but for those couple of hours spent in an auditorium; you would definitely have some good fun, especially when seen with a bunch of friends. Moreover it is a big screen adventure and hence a worthy enough ride to be taken this summer.",8,0,0,9 June 2012
