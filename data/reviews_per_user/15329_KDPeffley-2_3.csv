3:10 to Yuma," Not complex, just lame
","Given the high praise this movie has gotten, I must have really missed something. But really now, the story was not complex, as some would contend; it was just plain lame. Throughout the movie I waited to see whether something interesting would gel and make the whole thing work, but it never really did. Yes, the ending was a complete surprise, so much so that it was completely unbelievable, as was the rest of the movie. I couldn't understand whether this was a spoof on westerns or just really bad writing. Either way, it was pretty much a complete failure. Too bad. I'm a big fan of Russel Crowe, and in this case I would say that even his performance suffered. It just goes to show that without a good screenplay, everything else is certain to fall flat.",2,2,4,15 May 2008
Murder on the Orient Express," One of Branaugh's best
","I've never been a fan of murder mysteries, especially where murder seems to be so contained and their explanations seem to be so rational. Yet, I very much enjoyed the ride here, the absolute attention to historic detail, the train, the time period, Hercule Poirot's French accent, his occasional and natural use of French, his idiosyncratic passion for Dickens, his outrageous mustache, his strict moral code, the extraordinary murder plot, the endless characters, and of course his investigation, which leaves no stone unturned. Many found this movie boring or even unlikeable, but I was captivated from beginning to end with just about everything, especially Branaugh's performance and the fact that he directed and produced the whole thing. Bravo!",9,1,2,26 December 2018
The Water Diviner," Can't stop thinking about this one
","For his first time as a director, Mr Crowe has made a crowning achievement. There is nothing I can find fault with here. The story, based on a novel, is slow to reel you in, but never lets you go. A man buries his wife, who has died broken hearted from the deaths of their sons in the Gallipoli Campaign. At her graveside, he promises her he will bring their remains back home. He travels to Turkey, where a young boy tricks him into staying in his mother's inn.",9,2,3,24 April 2019
