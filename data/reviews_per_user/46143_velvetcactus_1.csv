The Blair Witch Project," Best film ever?
","No. It was appalling. The plot premise was so thin that you could see through it. The likelihood of there being one, let alone three Americans that do not have a mobile phone is laughable. The production values are atrocious and the so-called 'scary' scenes were about as scary as Scooby-Doo. As for Heather Donahue being nominated for an Oscar, that would make a mockery of the awards. She would be being congratulated for acting when all she was doing was portraying herself as she had no idea what was going on anyway. The only people that deserve awards for this film are the directors who were incredibly successful in utilising the Internet to hype a poor product to the extent that the entire American nation and most of the world have been sucked in.",1,2,3,19 November 1999
