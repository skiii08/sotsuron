Requiem for a Dream," one of my all-time favorites!!
","This movie is so well-done from the beginning up to the end. Darren Aronofsky does a great job in this movie. The acting from Ellen Burstyn simply is brilliant, and should of won the Academy Award for best actress. Her character like the other three main characters(Jared Leto Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) have a very hard life that just keeps getting harder. Marlon Wayans brings some comedy into the film, but very little. THE MOVIE IS DEPRESSING. No doubt about that so if you are looking for a laugh don't watch this one. Still the movie does an excellent job in every aspect. I won't say how the plot is because i hate ruining movies but it is very engaging.Bottom line i recommend this movie to everyone and give it 10/10 which i don't do very often. so that means go and see it.Peace",10,0,1,27 August 2005
12 Monkeys," Loved it!
","This movie is very fast paced, you shouldn't miss any of it because it gets kind of confusing. Anyways, by the end of the movie you are in disbelief of how well done it is. The entire movie had me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what was going to happen. Then at the end you feel that everything works out, but still leaves you with some questions about what is next. Either way this is an excellent movie, and if you like movies like Memento or Seven in my opinion this movie is a perfect fit for you. Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance, but Brad Pitt's performance as the insane person is well done and also will make you laugh at the things he does. Anyways great movie, great directing, great acting. 9/10......go and see it you won't regret it.",9,1,1,21 December 2006
