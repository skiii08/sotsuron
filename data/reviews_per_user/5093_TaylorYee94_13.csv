Angels & Demons," God is not flawed, men are.
","I'm born and raised Catholic for a long time even though I do not go to church these days. Dan Brown is considered the man who constantly attacks Catholic Church, so I was a little reluctant to watch it at first, but my friend really wanted to. Overall conclusion, God is not flawed, men are (also the line from the movie). Rather than attacking faith and God, it criticizes the Catholic's secrecy and ambiguity just the right amount. Prof. Langdon still respects the Cardinal's faith and collaborates.Done with my opinion the main theme, I am now gonna talk about this movie in more detail.
Good:1. Setting, music and sound, camera work are all brilliant.
The first thing that comes to my mind after the movie is that I really want to visit Rome and study the relationship of Renaissance art and Catholicism. Camera from the above to view the whole Vatican works phenomenal and makes the journey of Langdon and Vittoria look even sacred. BGM increases the suspense and kudos to Hans Zimmer.2. Clear explanation and interpretation of symbols throughout Langdon and Vittoria's investigation.
The book is even more complicated and thick, really massively thick. It is not easy to compress long book to short movies, but this movie does a great job, storytelling and explaining details with the aid of visuals which book could not provide.3. Twist at the end!! Perfection.
This movie fools me at the end when I am relaxed and waiting for resolution. It was unexpected hit, so the intensity was increased.Bad :The narrative of background history of antimatter is too long at the beginning.
This almost changes the genre of movie to science fiction leaving the audience in the confusion.",10,1,1,20 May 2019
The Hangover," Two Hours of Laughter
","The Essence of the Comedy Movie. Fun throughout the movie.Small talk between the characters - FunMedium-length events such as casino, Asian gang, and Stu's love story - FunThe whole idea of bachelor party gone wild - Typical but Fun",8,1,2,31 March 2020
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Kate and Matthew's line exchanges, tiki-taka, and chemistry were great!
","Theme may be a little cliche. Two characters date to win the bet but find themselves truly falling for each other at the end.
However, Kate and Matthew's lines and chemistry make this move so special.
Rom-com sometimes is too cheesy and corny, but how the writer writes the line and how actors exchange them with so little effort make it natural and fun.
I couldn't stop smiling looking at this couple and brilliant screenwriting.
My favorite tiki-taka of lines in the movie when Andie and Ben meet at the bar for the first time:A : Andie Anderson.
B : l'm Benjamin Barry.
A : Cute.
B : Thank you.
A : l meant your name.
B: Thank you two times.
A : Unattached?
B : Currently.
A : Likewise
B : Surprising.
A : Psycho?
B : Rarely.
A : Hmm.
B : lnterested?
A : Perhaps.
B : Hungry?
A : Starving.",8,2,2,14 May 2019
Lost in Translation," Arrogant and incompetent direction from Coppola
","Two main characters are lonely and find and comfort each other in Japan.
No wonder they are lonely and misunderstood, because they are so conceited. Rather than communicating what's inside of them, they avoid and block their respective partners and assume they are better than the others.
This movie fails to draw sympathy of main narratives from the audience.Coppola set Japan, a mysterious and unique country from AMERICAN point of view, to emphasize their exclusions from others. She is freaking arrogant to portray Asian culture in a ludicrous and absurd way to almost point out their superiority.The director won the prize and this movie is praised just because of her last name and the fact the movie was filmed in Japan.",1,3,11,10 May 2019
"I, Robot"," Somehow capturing the audience
","Typical Robot Plot + Typical Will Smith being a Hero
However, engrossing the audience till the end.1. Plot
Robots start to have feelings. Robots overthrow human race. It all sounds unoriginal but how this movie tells a story is plausible. So, audience buys the whole plot and starts to engage in the story2. Characters
Not Another Will Smith Movie. He once again saves the world. Misunderstood from the world but down-to-earth hero.3. Overall, this movie follows the rule book of the movie. Nothing special, but very entertaining because of good screenplay, nice acting, and futuristic special effects",8,0,0,1 April 2020
American Beauty," Psychotic but Prevalent
","Wow. It was American Psycho rather than Beauty. I'm sure it was oxymoron the director intended and he did an AWESOME job inferring it throughout the movie. For example, the incident in the movie is very psychotic and unique but characters in the movie are ordinary, blurring the line between the movie and the reality, and this intensifies the creepiness.This movie tells audience 'it can happen to you, too', and audience understands the characters' pain, intention, and action. Drawing the empathy is the most important aspect of the movie, and it did its job right.P.S No wonder Kevin Spacey won Oscar for Best Actor. Kevin Spacey didn't even have to ACT in this movie. Looking back, this movie sums up his life.P.S Desperate Housewives story line and theme + Parasite Direction",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Save the Last Dance," Classic Teen Movie
","What do people expect in high teen movie?
The theme throughout is clear; the storyline and development is convincing; the acting is natural. This movie captures the reality and reflects on the problems we face everyday in clever way.
Even though the dance performance and choreography is disappointing, the movie overall is a great quality.",8,1,2,10 May 2019
Jerry Maguire," Heart warming movie. Renee Zellweger is so attractive in this movie.
","I finally watched this movie because people talk about this particular line 'You had me at hello.' It all started from this one quote. First, the screenwriter must have done a good job because he or she left this remarkable and timeless one line. The rest of the story line may seem simple and bland, but the writer manages to absorb the audience till the end without uproar.
Second, many characters possess charm. Jerry, an ambitious sports manager, come to realize the importance of love and the way to express it. We all love this kind of story, right? Dorothy, a pure-at-heart but strong single mom and Ray (Gosh, he is so adorable in this movie.) who is the prototype of cuteness make this move upbeat and warm at the same time.
There are some drawbacks as well.
First, the narrative is too simple. Even though it doesn't feel too simple with charms of characters and good lines, how Jerry come to realization is a little bit abrupt.
Second, Tom Cruise's acting is too much. When I see him act, I can tell him he's acting. A whole facial expression, tone, and how he says the line overall say 'Here I go, I am acting right now. See! I'm serious.'It may be personal opinion because I think great acting makes me see the character not the actor.",7,1,1,16 May 2019
The Dark Knight," Overrated... That's All I Can Say
","I really do not get why this movie was so sensational and why The Joker character was so attractive.
The Joker contradicts himself in many ways. He said he is not a monster, but he is. I understand he is a chaotic evil and anarchist, so people are drawn for that; however, is it really enough justification for Joker to destroy the whole city? His explanation for wrongdoing everytime he does sounds like excuse. Just blow it. Don't explain it. That's way more attractive emphasizing his 'freak'ness and chaos.
He says he's not the one with the plan, just reacting to the ones fallen to him by the good side. Gosh, is it really true? He made the plans so complicated and well-organized that his mission was all success to the level of perfection. Even when the good side thinks they win, Perfect All Mighty Joker comes in and sweeps in.
I think the director deliberately made the Joker look more powerful, shrewd, and omnipotent to blur the line between the good and the evil. However, Batman and Gordon deserve much more because the real good pretending to be evil can be a great storyline as well.
To me, it was high quality movie with director's well-planned scenario but nothing more than that. I cannot call it a masterpiece as many critics do.",7,4,6,14 March 2020
The Da Vinci Code," No better movies than books
","I did not want to say this 'no better movies than books', but I have to. The movie does not fully realize the tension, the graphics, and the fast story of the book. I would cut some slack because I understand the movie had the example hard to live it up to. However, still, it's too disappointing. Also, the Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou's acting is not charismatic at all, failing to capture the audience's mind.",4,1,1,16 March 2020
Hancock," Ordinary Will Smith Hero Movie
","1. Will Smith has seriously mysterious history2. Will Smith is misunderstood3. Will Smith is some form of Superhuman4. Will Smith overcomes every obstacle (unreasonably)5. In the process, Will Smith faces criticism, but they are all wrong!6. It's all about Will Smith saving the worldIn his movie, again, the chemistry between cast is lost because the story is misproportion itself, focusing only on Will Smith's heroism, goodness, power, and ridiculous luck. How Will overcome his weakness and trauma is rarely portrayed, lessening the dynamics of the character.",7,0,0,1 April 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Well planned out with details on camera walk, settings, and mise en scene
","1. Camera walking is very original. For example, the way the camera was set up above the heads of Poirot, Bouc, and the doctor, observing the murder scene without actually showing it is effective to bring out more curiosity from audience and to amplify the violence behind it. One more, I love how the camera captures each suspect's face so it looks like Poirot observes and reads into each one's expression as he walks by.2. The director takes advantages of the fact the murder happened on the train. It's limited, secluded and close-to-each-other space. Audience can only see a part of what's happening because the camera zooms in, implying there are so many other things going on outside of this frame and keeping the suspense. The train, the table, the dining area, and many props are pleasure to look at.3. It is a joy to find hidden message behind mise en scene. At the ending, the train heads into sunset in contrast with the snowing station where Poirot got off. While the station is gray, sunset is warm orange; audience can expect brighter future for the passengers. When Poirot boarded the train, it was one long-take so audience can expect hectic chaos the detective runs into, and the director can tell the audience 'follow him with this journey of mystery'. Last but not least, THE MIRROR!!! It was brilliant idea to show two or more faces using mirrors.4. Deduction point on storytelling. I did not watch older version of the 'Murder on the Orient Express', so I'm not sure how it managed to tell complex story more efficiently. However, newer version incorporated too much of a story, and it was a little bit everywhere",8,0,2,20 June 2020
WALL·E," The most romantic story without lines or human characters
","Storyline, direction, the quality of animation, characters.... Everything is the level of perfection.
I am truly amazed how 'the machine' and 'the robot' can deliver romantic feelings to audience so freely without much line. The storyline flows, and the characters are fun and cute even not using much facial expressions and lines.
It conveys the message of environmental protection without trying too hard and being boring.",10,0,0,7 May 2019
