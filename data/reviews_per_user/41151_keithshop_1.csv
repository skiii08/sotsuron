Alien 3," How could he get it so wrong?
","After Ridley Scots masterpiece and James Camerons action packed sequel, how the hell did this sorry mess ever get made? *possible spoiler* So Hicks and Newt are dead? Then why the hell did we root for them so much in Aliens? So that this cretin could kill them off in the first scene? The whole thing is crap from start to finish. Brian Glover as colony spokesman? I don't think so. Forget this and accept the end of Aliens as 'end of story'.",Null,400,419,31 August 2003
