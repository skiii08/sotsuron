Blade Runner 2049," A modern masterpiece!
","Everything about this film is made as perfect as possible. The acting, the effects, the script and of course the eyegasmic cinematography. This film is beautiful and as flawless as possible. Ryan Gosling delieveres another great performance and so does Harrison Ford who is excellent here. i can praise this movie enough. All I can say is that the images projected on the screen are some of the most gorgeus I have ever seen. I suggest avoiding any spoiler and go in knowing nothing just like I did. There are a bunch of twists and surprises and you should go and exeriance it yourselves.",10,2,6,1 January 2018
Split," Oh good God lord he's back!!!
","I am so glad to say that I loved this movie. It was really, really good. It was actually Shyamalan's best film since Signs. The only movie that I really liked after Signs was the the Village, which is one of his most underrated movies. But this was just great. Where should I start? With James Macavoy's incredible performance(s). He is excellent in portraying multiple personalities in just one movie. But he certainly is not the only capable actor in this flick. Anya Taylor- Joy and Betty Buckley are also terrific. Especially Anya- Taylor Joy really impressed be. Not so impressive where the other two girls that were abducted with her (one of which was in The Edge of Seventeen). If they gave better performances and Shyamalan didn't do some of his old-fashioned shots (that weren't too distracting) I would have given the film a perfect score. Something I should also mention is that as I've heard Shyamalan hired the director of photography from it follows and it shows as this film is hot beautifully. I will not give away the ending as I suggest you check it out yourselves. If this is where Shyamalan is heading , I hope that he will be consider a great director among film-buffs once again.",9,0,2,20 November 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Mediocrity at its best.
","I don't know if I'm disappointed or surprised by this film. In one hand from the trailers it looked really bad and I went in expecting a worse experience that I actually had. In the other fan I'm a huge Pirates fan and I wanted something great to come out of a film where Javier Bardem plays a villain. But the final products is just...mediocre. I had minimal laughs and there were a few things I appreciate (I don't hate the film), but it might be the weakest film in the franchise. Johnny Depp is hurtfully unfunny in this and I was constantly finding myself wondering where the real Jack Sparrow was. The true show stealer (if you can call him that) was Geoffrey Rush, the only one that I actually think is great in all of these films. The newcomers were average, with some being less that that. The only thing except Rush that kept the film enjoyable at the minimum was the action and the cinematography. Sure it wasn't anything terrific, but it seemed as if people tried to make this film look pretty. While you might have some fun if you're a Pirates fan, I'd say to skip on this trip.",4,1,1,23 November 2017
Logan," The best Marvel has ever done
","I though that this movie was going to be good and boy it was. It might be the best film marvel has ever made. From the cinematography, to the acting, the action and the script they are all top notch. This is an emotional ride that will make ever men cry. All the characters are fleshed out, especially the trio. I am of course talking about Logan, Charles Xavier and Laura(X-23). They all have their moments in this rated r flick and thank god it's rated R cause there are some really satisfying brutal scenes her. If this is Hugh Jackman's last portray of the character he surely went out with bang. This is obviously my favorite film in the X-men universe and would surely recommend it to everyone.",10,3,7,24 November 2017
The Dark Knight," The best 'comic-book' film ever made.
","The film is probably the best film based on a comic-book character that we will ever get. But I just do not see this as a 'superhero' movie. It's a crime thriller that just happens to have a protagonist that wears a mask and acts justice to criminals. It is probably flawless and just cannot stand all the people saying that Heath Ledger is the only good thing in this movie. He is good, probably the best actor in the picture, but he is certainly not the only good thing. Every actor is great (even Maggie Gyllenhaal who for some reason has gotten some hate regarding her performance). Christian Bale does an excellent job portraying Bruce Wayne. I cared about him and all of his concerns about Rachel and Harvey, speaking of whom was also excellent and menacing as hell. I do not even have to mention the practical and mind-blowing action in the film. What Christopher Nolan accomplished in this movie is undeniably incredible and only some comic-book based film can be compared.",10,0,0,23 September 2017
