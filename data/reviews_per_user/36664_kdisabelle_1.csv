Alien 3," This installment does not take the series to the 'next level'
","The Alien series has to be one of the most amazing in film history. Each one with the exception of Alien 3 provided groundbreaking visuals, concepts and plot to the series. Alien 3 is really missing the groundbreaking feats achieved by its predecessors along with the latest - Alien Ressurection.  I was looking for Alien 3 to take the series to the 'next level' however, it never arrives.  The only thing you need to see in Alien 3 is the last 15 minutes so you won't be completely lost when watching the 4th installment - Alien Ressurection.  Alien Ressurection then takes the series to the 'next level' in fine fashion.",4,6,9,20 February 2000
