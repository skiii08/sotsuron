10 Cloverfield Lane," Bad Robot takes a thriller movie and tries to market it as a 'Cloverfield' sequel... strange but good
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' has one shot that references its prequel. That shot is 2 seconds of a street sign. The street is called 'Cloverfield Lane.' That's it. Suffice to say, those hoping that '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a movie that answers all the lingering questions from 'Cloverfield' are woefully misguided.'Cloverfield' is a great movie. It's a found footage perspective on an alien monster that destroys New York City. '10 Cloverfield Lane' drops the found footage thing... and the monster thing as well. Instead, this movie follows a woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who gets in a car accident and wakes up chained to a wall in a doomsday bunker. A mysterious man named Howard (John Goodman) tells her that there has been an attack on the USA and they must stay underground to survive. A younger man, Emmett, (John Gallagher, Jr.) complicates the interpersonal dynamic within the bunker. As time passes, questions arise about all the characters' past lives and what, in fact, is going on outside. Has there been an attack at all, or is Howard holding two people in a cell to live out some sick fantasy he has? The tagline 'Monsters come in many forms' is perfect for this movie, because its antagonist is not a 100ft tall monster, it's just a man.I'm not sure if this marketing move is genius or stupid... this is a 15 million dollar movie with almost no effects that made more than 100 million dollars. It achieved this by riding on the coattails of a popular movie from a decade ago. If this movie was called 'The Cellar' (the script's original title) certainly fewer people would have seen it. The good news is people went out and saw a good movie. The bad news is that Bad Robot will probably try to follow up this movie with an out-of-place sequel. At the worst, we end up with a Cloverfield Cinematic Universe. With the name Cloverfield attached to this film, we can also throw any Oscar hopes out the window, as the Academy probably isn't going to take it seriously.Enough with marketing- what makes 10 Cloverfield Lane so good? Well, for starters, the entire movie is tense. Michelle knows nothing when she wakes up from the accident, and neither does the viewer. As Michelle pieces together clues and figures out what is going on in the bunker, the viewer is sleuthing with her every step of the way. The characters in the movie are all smart, and it's fascinating to watch the mind games they play with each other as the mystery unfolds. Nobody, including the viewer, knows who to trust.All the action in the movie is very well set up and executed. Throughout the movie, the purpose of seemingly every item in this small bunker is established to the viewer. When our three characters have an inevitable physical fight, they use their surroundings in very savvy ways that are satisfying to watch.Other than that, the dialogue is written very well. There is a memorable personal scene between Michelle and Emmett in which they talk about their past and their regrets 'pre-apocalypse.' These characters feel human and are fleshed out by the stories they tell.The score is also haunting and the sets are well made and fit with the movie very well. The acting is great from all parties, particularly Goodman, who gives a great performance while the viewer tries to understand his character.Even with the odd marketing, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a must see. It is tense and very well-made from top to bottom. Marketing aside, watch this movie, even if you didn't like Cloverfield.",9,1,2,28 August 2016
Crash," A barely watchable cringe-fest that misrepresents racism as an easily fixable issue
","'Racist people are bad, but I'm not racist, so I'm not part of the problem.' That is the feeling you are supposed to have when you finish watching Crash. I don't know if a movie could possibly have a more harmful message than that.Crash tells the story of many characters of different ethnic backgrounds who live in LA. Their lives all come together at different points and they learn about racism.Each character has a bizarre and undeveloped hatred of a racial group. Sandra Bullock's character hates black men. Ludicrous's character hates Asian people. Don Cheadle hates Latino people (but is inexplicably dating a Latina woman?). Why do these people hate these groups? Hell if I know. The movie just sort of assumes that average people are extremely racist for no reason.The audience cannot connect to any character in the movie because every character is extremely and cartoonishly racist. As soon as you think a character is reasonable, they go and say something outlandishly racist and you have to dislike them. This is by design. If a viewer sees 10 characters in a movie who are all racist, the viewer thinks 'I'm special because I'm not racist like them.' This is meant to make the audience feel good about themselves. With a Best Picture win from the Academy, obviously this strategy worked.Racism is not a black and white phenomenon, there is a lot of gray area. Every person operates with subtle racial biases in their day-to-day lives. A movie like 2017's Get Out depicts this form of 'casual racism.' Some people are more than just casually racist, and that racism usually stems from something about their background- maybe they were raised in a town where racism was accepted, maybe they had a bad experience with a person of a specific racial group and have since projected that onto an entire ethnic group. The point is that the racism depicted in the movie is unrealistic and harmful to show to audiences, since people will believe it.This movie almost serves as a 'field guide' for racist catchphrases. Characters hurl disgustingly racist insults at each other constantly throughout the movie. A person who hopes to use racism to put somebody else down now has this entire movie as an example for funny and clever racist sayings. The actors are given such over-the-top intensely racist dialogue and it is all played in such an overdramatic and serious way that the audience can't help but cringe and feel secondhand embarrassment while watching the movie.The 'cathartic' ending to the movie was actually disgusting. Sandra Bullock like sprains her foot and her black maid drives her to the hospital so she has an epiphany and doesn't hate black people anymore. I'm not even joking that actually happens. All the other characters have similar 'epiphany' moments so none of them are racist anymore. Portraying racism as a simple thing that can be cured just like that is mind-bogglingly stupid. Racial biases don't just go away, and it's shamefully incorrect to imply that. If racism was easily cured, then it wouldn't be an issue.As I struggle to think of positives about the movie, I have to mention that Ludicrous's acting was actually very good in this movie. He's primarily a musician but he elevated the script really well and had a lot of charisma in his few scenes. I don't know much about his acting career, but he certainly impressed me. Another positive is the cinematography. There are a lot of cool-looking shots with a dynamic camera that is always tracking. There are also a lot of stylish transitions which look nice.In total, Crash isn't just unworthy of its Academy Awards, it's actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is smug, overdramatic, and actually more harmful than good in spreading its anti-racist message. Don't watch this movie.",5,2,3,20 July 2017
Snatch," Sharp, stylish, and fun- 'Snatch' is Tarantino-lite
","Somehow, this movie is ranked #93 on IMDb's list of the best movies ever made. I don't quite agree with that, but Snatch is certainly a fun time to be had.Snatch is a movie about two guys who help run an underground boxing circuit. Through a lot of hijinks, they end up getting involved with jewel thieves, dangerous gypsies, and mob bosses.Ritchie's talent is obvious. He writes funny and irreverent dialogue and has a very in-you-face directing style that fits right in with the tone of the movie. The pace of the movie is constantly in overdrive, meaning that the viewer is always engaged.If you take the wit and color of Ocean's 11 and combine it with the excessive violence and fractured story of Pulp Fiction, you end up with Snatch. That's pretty high praise, and the movie deserves that praise.When the credits roll, you haven't learned very much about the world, or about yourself, but you had a good time. Snatch is a light movie, and a fun movie. If that's what you want, this is a movie for you.",8,1,4,6 October 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Kevin Feige makes Spider-Man just another guy, but it's fine I guess
","We all know that Spider-Man's silver screen legacy is extremely controversial. With three incarnations of the character existing in the short span of 15 years, it's impossible not to compare every reboot to the last. How does this one compare? It's a decent effort, but Homecoming isn't as deep or as personal as Spidey's past exploits, largely because of its ties to the great Marvel machine.In the shadow of the other two iterations of Spider-Man, this film makes a sincere attempt to directly address fan issues with prior films. The central fan criticism of 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man is that it spends too much time retelling Spider-Man's backstory. This film subverts that by not showing the backstory at all. Likewise, another common criticism of the first two iterations of the character was the unrealistic age of the lead actors (Maguire was a 27 year old playing a high school student). Homecoming fixes this by casting a boyish-looking 21 year old Tom Holland. The film shies away from retread villains, having Spidey fight Vulture instead of round 3 against the Green Goblin. The film also subverts wider criticisms of the MCU by having Spidey's role be to stop a simple heist by an arms dealer, instead of having another movie in which the total annihilation of Earth is threatened. Fans will be happy that the film addresses all of these common criticisms and 'fixes' them, but that alone doesn't mean that this is the perfect Spider-Man movie.Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its annoying obsession with The Avengers. The film literally has about *fifty* allusions to other Marvel characters. Peter Parker talks about how he's dying to get into the Avengers, other characters ask if he knows the Avengers, the villains express their fear of Iron Man, etc. This movie cannot do its own thing for five minutes without bringing up other Marvel properties. Cameos by Captain America and random references to Thor's belt are distracting to the story that this movie is trying to tell. The more cynical viewers in the audience can easily identify these references for what they are: cross-promotion. The whole charade is just a thinly veiled commercial for the next Marvel movie.Spider-Man: Homecoming also suffers from its presence in the MCU in more ways than just the references. In the logic of Marvel's current universe, superheroes are totally normalized. Every character in the film knows about the Avengers and their battles against alien invaders, so the emergence of a new hero is not mind-blowing to anyone. Since a common New Yorker knows about Iron Man, they don't really care about Spider-Man. The people of New York are very invested in Spider-Man in the Raimi trilogy: they rally behind him as an emblem of their city's identity. He is featured on the front page of the newspaper every day in those films. In Homecoming, the people don't care that much about Spider-Man, and that makes the audience disengaged too. The proliferation of superpowers and superweapons in the universe also makes Spider-Man pretty pedestrian in terms of how well he can fight. In the other films, it is very satisfying to see Spidey easily take down common. In Homecoming, the viewer never gets a good moment in which we are in awe of Peter's powers. He's just shown as a guy who's less powerful than Iron Man, and that really gives audiences a reason to be disengaged.Spider-Man's motivations in this film are much weaker than those in the traditional Spider-Man story. In Homecoming, Spider-Man wants to impress Tony Stark so he can join the Avengers. Contrast this to the traditional Spider-Man mythos, in which Spider-Man has made a vow to avenge the memory of his dead Uncle, whose death he feels partially responsible for. Spidey has to fight for good because it's his duty and there's nobody else to do it, even when his personal life crumbles and it's easy to quit. This poetic struggle is almost entirely absent from Homecoming, and it is the backbone of the character.Despite my gripes, this film certainly does have its fair share of redeeming qualities. It is a comedy through and through, keeping a constant stream of laughs that land more often than not. The script is filled with witty jokes and the acting and editing makes these jokes work nicely. Making this movie a comedy-first was a calculated choice by Marvel so it would be more likable and different from other MCU films (think Ant-Man), and that choice pays off since the comedy beats work well.Tom Holland is a very good casting choice for the role of Spider-Man, hitting the comedic and dramatic notes well while realistically looking like a high school student. A lot of weight and scrutiny is put on the actors who play Spider-Man (probably since they are easily compared to others who have played the same character), and Holland delivers. He embodies the character's charm and youthfulness well and isn't awkwardly old. He may be the most believable and relatable Spider-Man yet.Michael Keaton's villain, Vulture, is another highlight of the film. He is a man with a blue collar background who is just trying to get by, a struggle that the audience can identify with easily. There is some serious irony that Keaton is playing this 'Birdman'-esque character, but he certainly plays it well.In itself, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a good enough, par-for-the-course Marvel movie. Sadly, the character has had incredible recent exploits, and this film doesn't get to the same heights of those movies. It's sad to see Spidey in a movie that just makes him another face in the already overcrowded MCU when the character seems so much more special than that.",7,1,3,20 July 2017
Doctor Strange," 'Doctor Strange' has more spectacle than substance, but it's worth your time
","About halfway through 'Doctor Strange,' I just accepted that the plot made no sense. Usually this is a cardinal sin, but for Doctor Strange, it isn't. This movie has visual spectacle greater than you've seen before, and, in this case, that alone is worth the price of admission.This is the origin story of (somewhat) obscure Marvel hero Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Strange is a neurosurgeon who is in a car crash which gives him severe nerve damage and limited use of his hands. He seeks mystic healing in Nepal and joins up with a cult that uses magic power. A lot of hard-to-follow magic happens, and in the end Dr. Strange needs to save the world.This movie is riddled with logical fallacy, tonal inconsistency, and forgettable characters. There is not nearly enough time spent explaining the movie's mythology, and we're left with a bunch of sorcerers who fight for an unclear reason and use spells/combat maneuvers we really don't understand. Dr. Strange himself is a discount Tony Stark; there is nothing new about his personality we haven't already seen from Marvel's own 'Iron Man' movies. But, despite all its seemingly innumerable flaws, I'm giving 'Doctor Strange' strong positive recommendation.We've all seen big things blow up in movies before... but we've never seen it like this. 'Doctor Strange' uses CGI in ways that are unique and mesmerizing. For example, in the final battle Strange uses a spell that rewinds time. As our heroes fight in the streets, the buildings around are not being destroyed, they are being pieced back together. Simply using words to describe this effect does not do it justice in the slightest. It is breathtaking to watch. This time manipulation is not the only incredible visual in the movie- it is far from it. There are tons of other visually interesting sequences, including multiple psychedelic scenes that borrow visuals heavily from 'Inception' and '2001: A Space Odyssey'This is not a film you should wait to see on Blu-Ray. This is a film you need to see in a theater. Go to an IMAX theater if you can. In a way, it's like James Cameron's 'Avatar.' If you watch Avatar on Blu-Ray today, it's not the same as you remember it in theaters. In fact, it's not a very good movie when you watch it at home on your television. Still, nothing can express the way it captivated audiences when it came out. If you want to feel that magic again, go see Doctor Strange. The visuals will leave you breathless, even if they cover up a very flawed story.",8,3,6,4 November 2016
Bridget Jones's Diary," Cringe-porn that isn't very funny
","Movies are often made with an audience in mind. 'Bridget Jones's Diary' was not made for the American male college students of the world. Us American male college students can enjoy movies like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Animal House', which were both made to play with our greatest dreams. Bridget Jones's Diary had middle-aged UK women in mind, and it's hard to imagine one would like this movie if he or she did not fit that exact profile.Bridget Jones's Diary is the story of a single woman who doesn't want to be single anymore. Two suitors fight for her hand.What really killed this movie was the character of Bridget Jones herself. The woman is not functional. In everything she does, Jones is cartoonishly inept. This ineptitude quickly stops being cute and becomes totally insufferable for the viewer. All of the movie's humor comes from Jones finding a way to embarrass herself. Sometimes she gives an awkward speech at a public event, sometimes she accidentally offends her friends and coworkers, et cetera. This constant use of cringe humor is lazy and unfunny.Why are there two men fighting over this woman? Both men are handsome and very successful in their work. These might even be considered 'dream guys.' Firth's character is handsome, rich, and a pseudo-famous lawyer. What does he see in Jones, a woman who constantly offends him and makes a fool of herself? Who knows. The movie sure as hell didn't give a good reason for it.I came into this movie expecting a lighthearted laugh, but I got a stream of annoying humor and nonsense. My own biases prevented me from liking the movie to some extent, but I would recommend any viewer to skip this one.",6,0,2,6 October 2016
Being John Malkovich," Jonze certainly has talent, but 'Being John Malkovich' is not his best
","This movie has a truly bizarre premise. Let's just get that out of the way off the bat. Before I started watching, I was already excited to see how such a bizarre idea could function on screen. But, a lot of movies don't live up to their premise, and this is one of them.It isn't just the premise that is bizarre: the characters are even more wacky. In a strange and unfamiliar world, I expect a movie to have a strong protagonist with whom I can identify. This movie had no such thing. The protagonist is so strange and illogical that the viewer feels like an outsider looking in for the entirety of the film. When everyone on screen is a weirdo, I'm not too invested in their interpersonal drama.'Weird' and 'deep' are not one in the same. Jonze puts a cast of weird characters on screen but he gives them no depth. Catherine Keener's character is the supreme example of this: she is supposed to be confident, sexy, and complex, but she comes off as random, illogical, and weird. She doesn't act like a real person, she acts like a poorly written character in a film that's trying too hard to be artsy.Nonetheless, the movie packs some laughs. Appearances from celebrities playing themselves is always good for a smile from the audience, and this film does it in an amusing way. There are also two short mockumentaries within the film that are pretty much gold.If you are drawn to the premise like I was, or you like Jonze's other work, you're probably going to watch this movie. I still can't recommend it.",6,2,2,27 August 2016
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A dark and thoughtful film about why people stay in toxic relationships disguised as a positive, romantic film about love
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind understands what relationships are like in a way that is uncanny. While masquerading as a happy movie about a loving couple, Eternal Sunshine shows the darkest and most harmful parts of relationships.The film is about Joel (Jim Carrey) a guy in his thirties who has dated a quirky woman named Clementine (Kate Winslet). Their relationship is difficult and marred with unhappiness. When Clementine stops talking to him inexplicably, he finds that she has had an operation that erased all her memories of their relationship. Joel is distraught and gets the same operation. The film then becomes a narrative within Joel's head as he relives all of his memories with Clementine as they are erased.The narrative is experimental, completely fragmented with some scenes that are bizarre within Joel's head. This leads to some unique, memorable, and just plain weird moments. This uniqueness gives the film its identity and the lack of linearity in the dreams both leaves the viewer the fun job of piecing together a narrative on his own while also giving the filmmakers license to contrast memories directly against each other, even when they are from different time periods.Our characters are very quirky and not entirely likable at first. Joel is reserved and awkward, a combination that initially turned me off to his character. Clementine, on the other hand, is very expressive and emotional- perhaps to a fault. it isn't until you see the best moments these people shared together when you begin to like them. Both the characters and the film itself feel very genuine when we see their happy moments.What is the ultimate point of Eternal Sunshine? (SPOILERS follow) What does it have to say? In the end, Joel and Clementine stay together. They know all of the horrible things that they will do to each other and they stay together anyway. The audience is happy that they stay together.Why do they stay together? An optimist would say that it is because they are meant to be. It seems unlikely that two people would happen to fall in love again if they had no memory of their history. Maybe some people are just soulmates and they will always find each other. In fact, the same phenomenon occurs to the Kirsten Dunst character when her memories are erased- she finds the same man and falls in love with him again.The more pessimistic answer, and in my opinion the real answer to the question is that people tend to ignore obvious red flags when starting a relationship they are excited about. The two leads share one day together, having fun as 'strangers' before they are given documents telling them about their past relationship. Joel and Clementine have hard physical evidence that proves they are incompatible. Their original relationship became unhappy and borderline abusive, and the two of them have documents that detail exactly how much they come to hate each other. This is the biggest red flag that a person could ever receive: hard proof that the relationship won't work. Still, the two of them are excited about their budding relationship and their first day together, so they ignore this giant red flag and date anyway. They don't look at the documents and see how they can better their relationship, they just blindly get back together, doomed to fall into the same traps they did before, because it is the easy choice and the exciting choice. The movie ends on an optimistic note, but a viewer has to wonder about the dark implications of this and the ignorance that it takes for them to stay together.When Joel is going through the memories of his relationship, there is an overwhelming feeling both in him and in the audience that he should stay with Clementine because the two of them have such good memories together. In essence: it doesn't matter that the relationship has grown into something horrible and toxic, they should stay together because they used to be happy and they need to hold on to those happy memories. Any person who has seen a relationship through knows this feeling as the end nears. This movie makes the audience actively cheer for that outcome. It's not until you think back on the movie's message that you realize how delusional this idea is.The main points the film is making are common justifications that people have to stay in broken relationships: it's easy to ignore red flags, no matter how large, and it's hard to break up with someone you have good memories with. It's eerie how easy it is for the audience to cheer for these irrational justifications, and it tells us something about ourselves.In all, Eternal Sunshine is a romantic film that really knows what long-term relationships and toxic relationships are like. The more engaged viewer will leave with an interesting message about the darkness of relationships. I strongly recommend the movie as a study of the irrational behavior people have when in relationships.",9,1,1,21 July 2017
Speed," Speed is light and totally lovable
","Speed is the definition of a film that knows what it is. It finds its tone and it excels.The film tells the story of Jack Traven, an LA SWAT officer. After the film immediately catches the audience's attention with a high-pressure hostage situation in a downtown LA elevator (an exploit that provides smart indirect characterization of our leads), the film deals mostly with a city bus on the highway. A bomb expert has rigged the bus, and if its speed drops below 50 MPH, the explosive will detonate, The narrative takes twists and turns, and as our protagonists decipher clues left behind by the villain, the viewer is always highly engaged. The always-evolving plot is very smartly designed. While the series of difficulties our characters face is numerous, it is never confusing. Plot arcs appear and resolve themselves in such a way that the audience is never lost, in fact the clues are simple enough for the audience to play detective along with the characters.The characters in Speed are all very simple but very strong. We learn about who the characters are by seeing them react in high-pressure situations. This is ideal in making people who seem real and it is executed effectively. By the time the movie ends, it's hard not to feel pride and relief for the characters after seeing the hell that they go through and their courage. This is an action movie, but it constructs its characters with more nuance than most acclaimed dramas.Speed isn't afraid to be what it is, and that is perhaps its biggest triumph. All of the film's action is totally over-the-top. The bus infamously makes a totally unrealistic jump across a giant stretch of uncompleted highway, and the viewer is left laughing at its sheer stupidity. But, the film wears the insanity on its sleeve and isn't embarrassed by the craziness. If you wanted a serious police drama, Speed wasn't the right choice.If you want to crack open a beer and just enjoy a smart, funny, and just plain fun action movie, Speed is the right choice.",9,1,1,13 July 2017
Sully," A forgettable retelling of an unforgettable event
","In 'Sully,' Captain Chesley Sullenberger spends a fair amount of time musing about how his life's legacy is defined by a plane crash that took only 208 seconds. Sully's life was only noteworthy for those 208 seconds. As one might predict, it turns out that this biopic is also exciting for about 208 seconds.Sully's main focus is on Capt. Sullenburger's difficulty handling the media attention following the crash, and the investigation that the airline did into Sullenburger post-crash. If you don't remember hearing much about this investigation in the news, that's because it wasn't newsworthy. The movie makes this investigation to appear bigger than it is, and the threat of a lawsuit lasts for exactly 90 minutes of screen time, only to magically disappear as the movie is about to end. Just before the credits roll, even the villainous plaintiff lawyers seem to concede that they never really had a case against Sully anyway. This threat never seemed credible to the viewer, and it disappears in an incredibly anti-climatic way.While great biopics like Fincher's 'The Social Network' play up real dramas in the lives of notable historical figures, 'Sully' is a 90 minute picture about a three minute event. Luckily, Eastwood handles the crash itself pretty well, showing the viewer windows into the lives of multiple passengers on the plane, so we have people to be concerned for in the heat of the action.The movie suffers from jarring edits and needless jumping in the narrative. Sometimes we see Sully before the crash, and sometimes we see him after- the crash itself is shown about halfway through the film. Before we see the crash, there are a handful of 'gotcha!' moments in which we see the plane almost crash inside of Sully's daydreams. The whole concept of jumping back and forth seems totally random and unnecessary. The 'gotcha!' daydreams also only hurt the film, as they cause nothing but frustration for the viewer.This is a weak film by Eastwood's standards. Even though its runtime is a slim 1h 36m, Sully feels overlong, and that's because there's simply not much to make of the story. This is a competent enough movie, and is a better choice than some other films currently in theaters, but you shouldn't lose too much sleep if you skip this one.",7,1,2,6 October 2016
