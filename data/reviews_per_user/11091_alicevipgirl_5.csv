Casablanca," Classic
","I enjoyed this movie, I honestly did. I liked it. But the romance aspect... Meh. I enjoyed it, definitely. But I didn't believe that this couple actually loved each other, or whatever it is they felt for each other. I realize that the reason that this movie seems so basic to me is because all other movies with this kind of plot have built upon this one, but usually being more fleshed out is a good thing. My mother, both my grandmothers, and my one great grandmother all expected me to cry watching this movie, but the tears didn't even threaten to spill over. I did enjoy this movie though, a lot. It looked amazing! With the lighting, the smoke, and the story overall were all really good!",7,0,1,9 December 2015
Citizen Kane," Dark and Moody
","This was one dark and just unhappy film. The poor man's life seemed just so angry! This was not an enjoyable film at all! Although, I kinda expected dark and moody and angry from the guy behind the sensational radio incident with The War of the Worlds in 1938. I did like the camera-work, though. Lot of smooth editing transitions. I especially liked the intro scene. The story to find out what Rosebud meant was kinda silly to me, on top of finding out all the dark and angsty things this poor man did and went through. Just, ugh. I don't watch movies for angst. Lord knows I have enough of it in my own life. I watch movies for fun diversions from reality and this just didn't hold up.",4,1,5,9 December 2015
The Graduate," This movie feels... icky
","I realize it was SUPPOSED to feel icky, that the whole idea was to show how dirty and wrong this whole thing was, but GODDAMN! A mother should in no way consider it okay to even ATTEMPT to seduce a man less than half her age in HER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM!!!! I understand the symbolism: She's trying to live through her daughter. But just... ugh. It doesn't help that every character seems like a crappy person, except the daughter. Mrs. Robinson is a manipulative old woman who can't control her hormones, Benjamin is a lazy young man who's unhappy with his life, and also can't control his hormones. Benjamin's parents seem like the type who don't truly care about what's going on in their child's life so long as it doesn't reflect badly on them. The only good part seems to be Simon and Garfunkel. This movie was just unbelievably painful for me to watch.",5,0,4,9 December 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Grandmother loves it, but why?
","Wow did I hate this movie. I feel like I need to rewatch it, because this IS supposed to be a good movie right? Like, classic, everyone loves it? I don't for the life of me understand why. I know all the songs, everyone knows all the songs. I recognized the singing in the rain scene. Who doesn't? But goddamn! This movie was a star vehicle if there ever was one! This movie exists just to show how awesome Gene Kelly was, and doesn't get anything else right. I've seen musicals before (who hasn't?), and I know for a fact that they're capable of having good plots and likable characters like any other movie! Then why does this one seem so flat?",3,9,17,9 December 2015
Psycho," This is beginning to look more like what Horror should look like
","I'm not putting a spoiler because I'm talking about the shower scene, and if you don't know that scene, I'm sorry but you must not know anything. THIS is why I was so hard on Frankenstein! This is what horror should look like! It actually gets to you! We still have a ways to go, but this is definitely an improvement. That shower scene? After watching it, I realized just how easy it would be to kill someone in the shower. You're virtually deaf to everything going on outside of the shower! I realized that before, but now, my imagination can run wild with the idea of someone trying to break into my house and kill me in the shower! This is what horror and psychological thrillers are supposed to do! Mess with your head! Oh, and the camera-work and lighting were awesome too! There were some moments that were kinda unrealistic, but that's part of Hitchcock's thing. So, all in all, I really liked this movie.",6,1,3,9 December 2015
