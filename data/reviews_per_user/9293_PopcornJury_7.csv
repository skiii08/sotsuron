Black Swan," Quite possibly my most anticipated of the year, Black Swan let me down with it's dark, difficult, and absurd downward spiral. Am I impressed? Yes. Am I enthralled? No.
","Black Swan is not the movie most people think it is. Whenever the film is brought up in casual conversation, it's often referred to as the movie about ballet or the new Natalie Portman movie about a ballerina. While ballet provides the backdrop for the film, this is not a film about ballet. This is a film about the infinite pursuit of perfection, the intense desire to succeed, and the extremely dark places our mind can go when something becomes an obsession.Black Swan stars Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers, a ballerina in a New York City ballet company. The company is getting ready to stage a new revival of Swan Lake, a contemporary classic in which a girl is turned into a swan by an evil sorcerers curse. Where in the original, the girl is broken from the spell when she finds a prince who will set her free, in this revival, the prince falls in love with the wrong swan, the black swan, ultimately leading to the death of the white. The twist? In this revival, the dancer selected as the Swan Queen needs to play both the white swan and the black swan, a role that on one hand requires purity and perfection, while the other requires sexuality and a sense of intense passion. Does Nina Sayers have both? That's the central theme to this story as the rest of the film progresses.In his review for Black Swan, Roger Ebert writes, 'Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is a full-bore melodrama, told with passionate intensity, gloriously and darkly absurd.' With this statement, I couldn't agree more. This film is all out warfare on its central character of Nina Sayers. It is extremely dark, and often at times, as Ebert States, completely absurd. There were moments when I knew what was coming next and still had to look away. There were moments when I wanted to scream at the screen and say 'Why is this happeningÂ…please pull yourself together!' I don't know whether to praise the film for being so 'out there' or to criticize it for going too far. It's an intriguing film, but I didn't once enjoy it. It's beautiful but completely uncomfortable, and it couldn't be further from what I think every average, everyday film-goer is expecting.If there's one reason to see this film, other than to simply witness the insanity, it's for the performance of Natalie Portman. In this role, she's less of an actress and more of a true performer. She's featured in every scene of the film, every shot. She trained for 10-months to prepare for her role in this film and it shows as she is not simply a stand in in any of the ballet scenes, she is a literal ballerina. She weighs what appears to be under 90 lbs. exhibits the purest of pure and the darkest of dark. She literally transforms from white to black, sane to insane, shining to stark. It is my most sincere prediction that she will win an Oscar for this performance, and regardless of the film itself, I would consider it well deserved.Black Swan is an evil movie, more disturbing than most films I've seen recently. It's a horror film and a thriller, hidden beautifully under the disguise of a contemporary ballet. Is it worthy of the critical acclaim it's garnering nationwide since it's initial limited release? As an art form, I'd say yes. As a source quality entertainment, I'd say no. Black Swan is the equivalent of watching a straight A student turn into a down and out junkie. Just because the film is award-winning, doesn't mean it's enjoyable. Quite possibly my most anticipated of the year, Black Swan let me down with it's dark, difficult, and absurd downward spiral. Am I impressed? Yes. Am I enthralled? No.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",7,1,5,22 December 2010
Ghost," Ghost is a highly romanticized love story that happens to feature elements of crime and suspense. A worthy rental for those interested in the afterlife.
","Ghost is a highly romanticized love story that happens to feature elements of crime and suspense. It's a movie that begs the question 'What happens after you die' and offers a spin not often thought about in regards to the afterlife. The film, starring Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze, and Whoopi Goldberg has been praised by some and criticized by others. It got nominated for Best Picture when it was released in 1990 and received a variety of other nominations. I tend to walk with those who praise the film, regarding it as a authentic love story that, although super cheesy, really does provide a sense of wonder as to what one may be able to do after they die.Ghost starts out like a very traditional love story. We're introduced to Sam and Molly (Swayze and Moore), a young and in love couple that just moved in together in an old New York loft. After a few romantic interactions, one being one of the most arguable romantic ever caught on film (the pottery scene set to the tune of Unchained Melody), we realize that this couple couldn't exist without one another. Their love is such that it could quite possibly only exist in movies. Regardless, we believe in it, we appreciate it, and we remember it throughout the rest of the film.What happens next shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with the story. Sam is killed in the streets while walking home with Molly. He sees the light, but decides he isn't quite ready to go just yet. Instead, he stays on Earth, to be with Molly, only to come to the realization that no one can hear him, see him, feel him, or talk to him. He's simply a fly on the wall, someone who's able to look over the ones he loves, but provide no assistance in how things play out. That is, until he meets Oda Mae Brown, a local psychic, who's able to hear his voice and play a crucial role in saving Molly from the men who Sam believes murdered him for money.Ghost is more successful at being a love story than a crime drama, but it does make sense as a background to the story. Sam is not only able to track his killers (without them knowing), but he's also able to warn his wife of the incoming danger and give her the clues necessary to solve the crime. The most interesting part of the film is seeing Sam and Molly interact through Oda Mae Brown. At first, Molly doesn't want to accept the fact that her dead boyfriend is literally standing right next to her. It takes a number of personal insights (the color of her underwear, the location of their first date, and a reference to 'ditto') to make her a believer, but once she accepts that Sam is present in the afterlife, the story starts to transform into a romantic thriller that hits all the right notes in both of its respective genres.If there's one thing that doesn't really work in Ghost, it's the final twenty to thirty minutes when Sam learns how to move things, punch people, type on keyboards, etc. To me, it feels a little fake, and loses out on the premise that made the film so promising in the beginning. He can essentially do things that a ghost shouldn't be able to do, and to me, it takes things a little too far in terms of believability. Some people would argue that the whole film is too far of a stretch, no one can hear dead people. I for one, accept that piece of the puzzle, but as far as an actual physical presence that can interact with psychical surroundings, I don't feel like going that far.Regardless, Ghost offers a romantic love story that will make your heart melt. Whether or not you appreciate the crime backdrop will depend vastly on the person, but the love story should be quite universal. See this movie, realize the hype, download Unchain Melody, and think about those you love. Could you live without them? Would you stick around to see them through? Ghost asks a lot of questions, but provides clarity on one: Does true love exist? Yes. Just let Sam show you.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",7,1,1,29 November 2010
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2: A Few More Suits, No Additional Substance
","Iron Man 2, much like the original, does a lot of things right. The special effects, the charisma, the characters, and the technology are all top notch. Watching Tony Stark play around in his massive, billion-dollar man cave makes every man/boy reconsider what he's doing with his life and why he didn't get into weaponry. So what's the problem? All the good stuff happens in the first 60-minutes, with the following 60 leaving not just a little, but a lot to be desired.This film opens up with the it's new villain, Ivan Vanko, played by Mickey Rourke, a Russian physicist hell bent on not only destroying Tony Stark, but also his reputation and his enterprise. By creating a device that sends electric volts through cable whips attached to his back and arms, he not only gives this film a boost of fresh air, but he also creates one of the most unique villains to date. CGI aside, this dude looks completely crazy, completely frightening, and the most impressive part: completely real.The rest of the story contains all the key characteristics of the original Iron Man, but makes them bigger, more exciting, and more out of control. The cars, the women, the style, the suits; it's all there. It doesn't feel old, per say, but it does feel a little outdated. My biggest concern, lies not in the fact that the film isn't innovative, it's that the film doesn't quite innovate enough. They start with an interesting villain, and turn him into something that's been done previously in Iron Man before; a man who creates another suit. They create Iron Man clones that don't do anything other than die at the push of a button or the shot of a gun. Iron Man and Tony Stark are still pushing boundaries, but everything around them is stuck in place. Where can the series go next? That's the exciting part.There's a lot of talk in this film about the Avengers, the future installment of the Marvel franchise that features Ant Man, Wasp, Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. Now whether or not these characters make it into the film of the same name is TBD, but it's safe to say that Iron Man is definitely going to play some part in piecing this film together and it might be exactly what this franchise needs to bring back the action and the energy we once thought that it had.If you're a guy, you're going to check out Iron Man 2 no matter what I say. To that, I say go ahead, see it for yourself. It's a high budget action adventure film about a man in an iron suit. It can't be that bad right? Correct. It's not that bad, it's just not quite what it could be for the feature length, only about one half.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",6,0,3,22 October 2010
127 Hours," 127 Hours is one of the most exhausting and exhilarating movies of the year. A must-see for those who can handle it.
","Rarely am I compelled to review a movie immediately after seeing it on film. More often than not, it leads to me drawling a far too subjective conclusion on something too fresh to have fully settled in. With 127 Hours, I have decided to make an exception because I think the way I feel about the film immediately after viewing it adds an element to the review that can't be conveyed in words. What's the element- complete and utter exhilaration and total mental exhaustion.I've been involved in two big accidents since the day I started driving. Both resulted in two totaled cars (mine and the others), a serious hike in insurance, and a healthy reminder to continually wear a seat belt no matter how far I'm going. I remember vividly the moment directly after each accident. I gathered myself, looked around, felt my legs to make sure they were working, and then said to myself, 'there's no way that just happened.' In 127 Hours, Aron Ralston is put in a similar situation, except instead of getting in an accident, he falls down a cliff and instead of feeling around and realizing his legs are still working, he looks down to see his arm smashed and pinned directly under a huge rock. Regardless of the change in scenarios, both stories end with the same quote, 'there's no way that just happened.'127 Hours is based on the true story of Aron Ralston, a rebel, a rock climber, and a fully independent adult ready to take on the cliffs in Moab, Utah for a routine weekend excursion. He packs his things, hits the trails, and embarks on a beautiful journey by bike, but he makes one serious mistake- he tells no one where he's going before he leaves. Much of this is indicative of Aron's lifestyle which could be considered fly solo and by the seat of your pants. In his defense however, the story that's about to unfold is one of almost impossible calculations. He couldn't have seen it coming, but maybe it was just written in the stars.90% of the film takes place one on one with Aron, played by James Franco, as he's trapped inside the canyon walls. There's no special effects or camera trickery, just Franco, a camera, a slew of supplies which he happened to have on him during the accident, and of course us, the audience, watching every move the actor makes on screen. For Franco, this is an extremely personal film. We're on him for an hour and a half, close ups of his face, his eyes, his arm, his body, watching and writhing as he tries everything he can to survive. He plays the part extremely well, with every emotion striking through the rocks like a sharp nail. There's no way he will be denied a nomination for this performance at this year's Academy Awards.When I started reviewing this film, I wanted to open with the line, 'There's only one way to describe 127 Hours, and that word is awesome.' Then I got to thinking. There isn't just one way to describe this film, there's tons, and trust me, every way you turn it, the outcome is positive. This film is awesome, exhilarating, breathtaking, brutal, exhausting, and at times, almost impossible to watch. There's literally no way not to respond to this film, as there is no one in this world who could not sympathize for someone literally stuck under a rock, fully aware of their untimely predicament and the fact that they literally have no chance of getting saved or better yet, unstuck. It's like being fully aware in a vegetative state, but worse, because you can actually move, you're in 44 degree weather, and you're drinking your own urine to survive. It makes my stomach cringe just thinking about it.As other critics have already eluded to and anyone at least somewhat familiar with the film's story line already knows about, the final scenes in the film are almost impossible to watch without either A. fainting, B. leaving the theater, or C. having to turn your head. My father and I both opted for the turn of the head, but I saw multiple individuals (specifically females) who had to opt for option B for the lengthy 6 minute scene. It's shown in brutal detail, leaving nothing to the imagination, which in my opinion, wasn't totally necessary, but does add a sense of authenticity and accomplishment when it comes to what Aron has to do to get free.127 Hours is an amazing film. I've never felt so exhausted after leaving a theater. The very final moments of the film felt better than any film I've seen recently. I look up to Aron, not for being some sort of hero or even for being a genuinely good person, but for the fact that he went through the worst 5 days I could ever imagine, and survived.. It's one of the most amazing achievements I've ever heard a human make, and the way it was captured and brought to the screen can't receive any higher praise from me.127 Hours is a tough film to watch, but one that shouldn't be missed. It will be on my top 10 of the year, it's just a matter of what number.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",8,1,4,29 November 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Nerds unite...Scott Pilgrim is one of the most fun movies of the year, barring you're a 16-26 year old male who likes video games and Asian Catholic school girls.
","Scott Pilgrim is one of the most fun movies I've seen all year. Sure, it's marketed towards nerds, gamers, and comic book geeks, but that doesn't mean it's not accessible to the average movie goer, or at least the average male movie goer ages 16-26. It's cute, energizing, and entertaining with good music, hot chicks, and some hardcore, sword fighting, skateboard slinging, karate chop chopping battle scenes that look like they were ripped out a Street Fighter vs. Speed Racer online battle. Enough with the nerd lingo though, let's get to the plot.Scott Pilgrim got his heart broken. His rebound is a 17 year old Asian Catholic high school girl. It doesn't get anymore clichÃ© than that. She's cute, but annoying, and when he meets the new girl, with enough pink hair and indie outerwear to make an emo boy drool, he undoubtedly falls in love. The problem? For some reason, the new girl has seven evil exes, all bound to make an appearance on the battle field when Scott least expects it. What follows is hot, hilarious, and, at times, outrageous with scenes that give any recent action flick a run for it's money when it comes to entertainment.Regardless of the high energy adrenaline that runs through Scott Pilgrim, you've got to wonder, is it funny? I can say wholeheartedly that I laughed, at times, out loud. It's little nuances that Michael Cera has down to a T, that truly make the movie. I can't necessarily say why he's so funny in this film (and I didn't particularly like him in Juno), but he is. Rather than model the character after the comic book, it seems like the character was almost carved out of Cera himself. What results is very frequently funny.So what are the negatives? For one, the film is a little bit long. Not only are there seven battle scenes, but some of them are drawn out way too long (especially the final scene). There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and in Scott Pilgrim, we see it. Also, there isn't always enough differentiation between battles. By the end of the movie, things feel a bit stale and fall a bit flat as opposed to the opening scenes that set the stage. Lastly, as much as I praise Cera for his spot on performance in the film, I also have to give him a slightly negative critique when looking at his character because he is such a loser, yet he manages to score some really sexy chicks. I know it's a movie and anything is possible, but seriously, Scott Pilgrim wouldn't be in the running for any of these girls regardless of what band he's in.All in all, Scott Pilgrim offers some good, fun, mindless entertainment. It's smart, funny, cute, and cuddly, and I'd especially recommend it for teenagers and males ages 16-26. Would I recommend it to my parents? No. The indie guy down the hall that watches foreign films? No. The film student who prefers documentaries? No. Anyone looking for a fun tribute to video games, heartache, and progressive rock music? Spot onÂ…spot on.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",7,6,15,29 November 2010
Despicable Me," Despicable Me is a wonderfully enjoyable yet totally forgettable animated feature from Universal Pictures.
","Despicable Me is a wonderfully enjoyable yet totally forgettable animated feature from Universal Pictures that follows an eerie criminal mastermind as he works to become the greatest, most despicable villain in the world. The film, starring the voice of Steve Carell as Gru, a criminal intent on executing the largest heist in the history of the world, is often funny, always entertaining, but unfortunately much more forgettable than the animated films it goes against (see Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon). Regardless, for young kids or an adult audience alike, it provides enough wonderful visuals and comedy to keep you fully competent for it's fast paced 95-minute run time.Despicable Me opens and ends with Gru, an awkward individual dressed in all black with a pointy nose, bald head, skinny legs, and fat body. He, much like the other characters in the film, features characteristics that we don't often see in animated features. No one necessarily looks human, but in the age when apparently we're able to build shrink rays, spaceships, and squid launchers, who knows what mankind will look in the making.When Gru meets Vector, the criminal most famous for stealing a pyramid in Egypt, the film immediately becomes a competition of criminal minds, a battle for the bigger idea, and a race to outwit the other individual. It's only when Gru adopts three young girls, originally planned as bait to outwit is sympathetic suitor, that the film goes from funny and action oriented to sappy and heartwarming.There's absolutely nothing bad about Despicable Me from a film-making standpoint. I was very much impressed by the visuals, the design, and the overall flow of the script. I guess the reason the film was somewhat forgettable for me, is the fact that it was such a lighthearted piece of entertainment, with characters that exited my head just as easy as they entered into it. With films like Toy Story 3, we're brought back to our childhood with toys, muppets, and mascots that we remember from our yesteryears. With How to Train Your Dragon, we're transferred into a world of magical, mystical dragons. With Despicable Me, we're still in the States, but the inventions we're capable of coming up with are just a bit more complex.Overall, I recommend Despicable Me for what it is, a lighthearted, funny, fantastic looking animated feature. Is it the best animated feature I've seen? No. But in the age of the Alpha & Omega's and the Alvin and the Chipmunks, trust me, you could do a whole lot worse.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",6,5,8,12 January 2011
The Fighter," The Fighter is one of the best films of 2010, and one of the more inspiring comeback films in sports history.
","The Fighter is a riveting film that I can fully recommend. It isn't a film about the insane, innate nature of a perfectionist ballerina, a troubling tale of a man crushed beneath a rock, or a story of a man who falls in love with a woman with a life-threatening disease. It's the story of Mickey (played by Mark Whalberg) and Dickie (played by Christian Bale) a based-on-a-true-story tale of two brothers, both boxers, one on his way up, and one trying to keep from hitting rock bottom.The Fighter chronicles the rise and fall of the Mickey and Dickie Ward, two brothers, and two boxers from Lowell Massachusetts. The spotlight should be on Mickey, the up and comer, but instead, all the attention is on Dickie, the star who once knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard, the one claiming to make a comeback, when in reality he's on his way down a path of drugs, danger and destruction. Dickie is a crack addict, a meth head, a barrier to entry. Mickey however, is intent on keeping him around. In the end, he's still his brother right?Much of The Fighter revolves around the Ward family drama- a family with nine kids, two fathers, a money grubbing mother who doubles as a mess of a manager, and a brother who consistently brings the family down. Everything comes to a head when Dickie gets himself arrested and brings Mickey in a situation that nearly ends his boxing career. It's these moments that set the stage for one of the most inspiring comeback films in sports history. Everyone in the theater will be rooting for Mickey, not only during the scenes inside the ring, but even in the scenes outside of it.Don't let the most recent trailers fool you. The Fighter doesn't offer anything that you'd find in a Disney sports film. While the movie does have moments that are extremely uplifting, the bulk of what you'll see here is pretty dark and disturbing. There's a ton of foul language, drug use, sex and violence. It's not an adult film, but it's not a feel-good film either. It borders the line perfectly between drama, action, and awe-inspiring. Plus it's pretty funny at times too.Much like Natalie Portman in Black Swan, if there's one reason to see this film, it's to witness the truly unbelievable acting skills of Christian Bale. In his review, Capone of Ain't It Cool News writes, 'It's no secret that Bale is a terrific actor, but his performance as Dickie could not have been achieved by any other actorâ€“pure and simple.' Thomas Leupp of Hollywood.com states, 'The Fighter is a gritty triumph, much more than just the 'Christian Bale Crackhead Movie.' The fact that people are even labeling it as the Christian Bale Crackhead Movie is a testament to his acting. The guy is completely dead-on as Dickie, the down and out drug addict, ex-boxer, big brother extraordinaire. We see the real Dickie at the end of the movie, and it only further establishes how successful Bale was in portraying his character on screen.I can't recommend The Fighter enough. There's a ton of subplots, scenes, stories and characters that I didn't even touch on that are guaranteed to increase your appreciation and should most definitely increase your excitement for this film. There's only a handful of films that I would rank higher this year than The Fighter, and I don't think any of them are as accessible of a film. Take your friend, your family, your grandpa, or your girlfriend. This is a film that will knock you down, tear you apart, and bring you right back together again in the end.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",Null,3,5,22 December 2010
