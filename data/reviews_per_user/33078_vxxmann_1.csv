Hereditary," Stupidest movie of the year
","Although the acting was fabulous and the setting wonderfully done, the story line made no sense and the ending was hilariously ridiculous. Toni Collette, the mother, was an artist who created miniature theatre-like sets, was compelling, and the daughter, Charlie, was deliciously creepy. The pacing and music score added to the attempts to be edgy, but in the end, it was almost funny. Both my friend and I laughed as we exited the theatre. P.S. I don't know if 1 star is the best or the worst, but in my book,1 star is the equivalent of a one star hotel. You don't want to go there.",1,113,230,21 June 2018
