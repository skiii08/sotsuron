Source Code," very interesting and unique as far as i know
","Wow, this movie just blew me up! The pace is smooth and i find it perfectly to my viewing comfort. The plot itself reminded me of classic 'time loop' stories. It's when you found yourself on an infinite loop of life and Reliving its events Usually it's a day, but on this movie it's like 8 minutes long. Gylenhall's character is connected with 8 minute last experience of a Sean, one of train bomb victims. That experience is called 'source code', some kind of virtual reality stuff that allowed him to relive Sean's life. Interestingly, he could also acts by his own will, and that's when the inventor of source code said that all events caused by him is only occurred on source code itself.Actually i wanna give it a ten. But a particular acting from one of the actors is kinda made my viewing experience becomes unpleasant.I'm not gonna spoil more than this. Just enjoy watching it. It wouldn't make you think hard.
