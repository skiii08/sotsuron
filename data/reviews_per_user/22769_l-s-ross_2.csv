Black Swan," We were shaking when we left the theater!
","I took my 21 year old daughter to see this movie.We were shaking when we left the theater.Ultimately, any movie worth it's price, must make you feel something and this movie....well, you either love it or hate it, I don't think there is any in between.We absolutely loved it. We were stunned! It has been a long time since a movie has made me feel anything new and this one really fit the bill. It was such a roller coaster ride. Riveting! You really have to become involved with the movie in order to appreciate it. Go into it with a attitude that you just want to see a good movie and are willing to keep an open mind.I am 58 and have seen thousands of movies. Sometimes I wish I had that time back! Still it has been so exciting.One of the negative comments I have seen about Natalie Portman's acting in this film is that she seemed so one dimensional. Not much facial changes. This movie called for just that quality. It NEEDED it to make it work. She was wonderful. When she comes out as the Black Swan, I thought she just jumped through the screen at me. That's incredible hard to do as an actor. She nailed it! The triumph and possibly insanity in her eyes as the Black Swan...I mean, WOW!!! She deserves an Oscar for sure!",10,3,6,3 February 2011
The Greatest Showman," A Rare Feel Good Movie You Shouldn't Miss
","Please don't let any reviews stop you from seeing this wonderful movie! It is a musical, but even if you are not a fan of musicals the terrific acting, music, singing, and great screenplay will keep you entertained. 
Hugh Jackman was fabulous! I left the theater feeling like I had attended a Broadway show. Sorry, no car chases, no evil wizards, no deadly space aliens, not a lot of CGI, but ,YES, you feel good when you leave the theater. Lately it has been rare to walk out of a theater after a movie and truly feel happy, even joyful. Don't miss this chance for that enjoyment, see this movie!",10,1,4,26 December 2017
