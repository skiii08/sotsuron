Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Movie For the Ages
","Although volume 2 of this extravagantly excessive, indulgently fun endeavor is quite different than the first installment, it works undeniably well. Where volume 1 is a ridiculously gory thrillride paying homage to several of Tarantino's favorite movie subgenres (grindhouse martial arts flicks, 70s exploitation flicks, etc.) Volume 2, although containing some of these elements as well (including a spaghetti western type feel throughout) differs in that it is more plot driven and story focused.  Although some critics may suggest that Tarantino is too stubborn and excessive because of the incredibly elaborate plot elements that lie within volume 2 (the fifteen minute segment with The Bride training with martial arts master Pai Mei, and the unusually long intro) however, I dismiss the ramblings of these types of critics because every second of both movies are absolutely necessary as we see the plot come full circle.In volume 1 we get to witness Tarantino's visionary genius machismo at work and it is truly awe-inspiring, however, in Volume 2 Tarantino shows us that he is not simply a visual genius behind the camera, but that he can also weave quite a tale of intrigue as well.  Individually, each movie is stunning with that unforgettable feeling of 'coolness' that have accompanied every other one of his films.  However, together, 'Kill Bill' is a masterpiece.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
