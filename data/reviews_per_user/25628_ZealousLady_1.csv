Black Swan," Tutu
","I had avoided this movie as I am not the biggest fan of ballet, though I did ballet as a youngster. Not my type of movie but very well written and covered a good subject or two (mental health and stress). Its definitely a movie that is carried by Natalie, who's acting abilities were put to the test and she comes out as an A lister in this movie. Listened to all the hype and build up for the movie and read many reviews. I'm not to sure if this movie captures the male audience but its sure to get good brownie points from the majority of woman viewers. Worth picking up if you are curious however if like me you have no real interest in ballet it may be better to let this one slide.",6,0,1,26 June 2011
