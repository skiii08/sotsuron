Requiem for a Dream," hip and very, very depressing
","If you don't want your kids to do drugs, show them this movie.  Every time you think that they might be experimenting with dope, just gently remind them, 'ass to ass.'This movie really brings you down.  This is because it is a very unhappy tail of four people's lives being rotted through thanks to their addictions.
There is a lot of hip editing involved.  Overall, it serves the surreal nature of the film, but sometimes it is annoying.  Maybe this is because I've seen similar tricks in Run Lola Run and Amelie.I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone unless I thought they needed to be convinced that heroin is dangerous.  But I'm sure curiosity will lead plenty to see it, as it did me.",Null,0,1,27 February 2002
