It," Not Impressed at all
","I haven't watched the original movie but if this is an absolute remake of the older version then that movie was also ridiculous. Not for one second I felt like the movie was horror at all. The different parts of movie were not connecting to each other. The movie clearly fails to make the viewer understand that what is happening and why it is happening.There hasn't been a lot of acting on part of pennywise but his getup was good.The only two positives from the movie were the acting skills of Jaiden Lieberher (Bill Denbrough) and Sophia Lillis (Beverly Marsh). That stranger things kid didn't met my expectations.This movie is not worth the hype its getting.Its a waste of your 2 Hours , better sleep em out or do something useful.",4,1,2,12 October 2017
A Quiet Place," Cannot trust IMDB rating anymore!
","Movie starts off from middle of the story, no explanation of why? How? When? The plot is so much shallow, the family doesn't even look like one. Anyone who has seen a Horror/Thriller movie before cannot rate this movie more than 3 stars. Absolute nonsense, Movie leaves viewer in a state of constant question and no answer is presented, it is not dark at all. The only 2 stars are for acting that's it. Please do not waste 90 minutes of your time on this movie.",2,7,14,20 June 2018
