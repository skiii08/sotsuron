Source Code," Predictable but very enjoyable
","Twightlight Zone meets Quantum Leap meets The Outer Limits. This movie could almost be a pilot for a series 'Source Code'. I think Gyllenhaal makes this a better movie than it actually is and I'm not particularly a fan of his. Good tense thriller, but it doesn't really take a genius to work out who it was!! Would recommend to all and probably watch again quite soon. Gyllenhaal is probably the only actor in the movie however that actually keeps the score moving along at an interesting pace and is also the only actor with any real talent that is believable. I feel that a stronger supporting cast along with another half hour or so added to the length and we would have a real strong film that merits a lot more. As I said before, I wouldn't be surprised to see this turned into some new-age Quantum Leap type series and I do feel it would take off with the right cast.",7,0,1,23 July 2011
Goon," Slap Shot meets Youngblood
","As my title states I think this movie does a pretty good job of bringing 70's & 80's hockey passion into the Millennium.Never been much of a Sean William Scott fan but he's passable as Doug 'The Thug' Glatt. Liev Scrieber's character of Ross 'The Boss' Rhea is more palatable and if your a hockey player or enthusiast then you'll relate to his role a lot more.For me Slap Shot was and always will be the #1 hockey movie ever, but this won't be out of place as my #2, just pipping Youngblood.Would've liked to have seen a bit more involvement from Eugene Levy as Doug's Dad, didn't really see what point he played in the film to be honest. Also Doug's 'love interest' wasn't much cop either. If they'd steered away from the silly sub-plots of hometown bot does good or nice guys CAN finish first etc then you'd have more of a 'balls to the wall' hockey flick for the hardcore viewer. That said, 7/10 for a subject that will always struggle to get bums on seats, whether it's the comedy of the year or a docu-drama that pulls on the heart strings.I'd personally like to see the equivalent of Any Given Sunday (NFL Football) with an NHL hockey theme, making use of a high profile cast also.",7,1,2,13 March 2012
Any Given Sunday," Leads the way for US Football movies
","With an all-star cast it's very difficult to pick fault with this movie. My only gripe was the odd 'pat on the back' style lines that slipped in here and there, motivational war speeches after seeing the light etc but they certainly don't detract from what is an epic movie. The odd corny line here and there is almost unmeasurable in this 2hr40min marathon of high octane action and passionately acted masterpiece.Still find it hard to believe it was filmed in 1999!! Seems like it was just released this year every time I watch it (5 times now). Each character is integral to his or her own part and you're never left wondering why they had a part in the first place. Whether it's Pacino's lead role on film or Lauren Holly's minor character of Quaid's 'Cap Rooney' wife.....they all have fantastic screen presence and have you relating to them straight away. Life and death struggles was a bit of an overstated tag line, but certainly you start to bond and feel every painful emotion and physical blow the team (Miami Sharks) endure.I personally haven't felt an emotional football or even sports movie like this since All The Right Moves back in the early 80's with Tom Cruise. From Pacino and Foxx down to minor coaching cameo actors, they all have 3 dimensional roles. This movie could've easily have been over 3 hours long and it would still be over too quick. I only wish that Oliver Stone would direct a hockey epic like this instead of the comedy mishaps we always get like Slap Shot, Youngblood and Goon!! A solid 8/10 for a film that brings out some of the best performances from Pacino, Quaid & James Woods. Foxx is brilliant in making you feel compassion early on for his character to feeling utter disdain and contempt as his alter-ego grows and grows and loses touch with why he started playing football in the first place.",8,0,1,8 April 2012
