The New World," Beautifully filmed torpor
","I kept quiet throughout the movie, as I thought my wife - who likes films with period pieces,Indians and romance - was enjoying it. She told me afterwards that all the ladies in the loo hated the movie because it was sooo slow, and she agreed with them. The movie is terribly self indulgent and languid, oh did I forget to mention it is quite beautifully filmed (I think everyone who wants desperately to find something good will say that.) More is said by John Smith and Pocahontas (whose name is never mentioned)in commentary than in actual dialogue, and I found both difficult to understand. He, because of a guttural English accent, and she because of her softness. I was happy when Bale came on the scene, if only because he spoke clearly.This movie reminded me of 'Days of Heaven' with it's endless scenes of scenery and scant dialogue, and lo and behold, I did not even know, until just now, after googling it, that it's the same director. That's worrisome, I think, to have a style that is so recognizable, yet only known by cognoscente. It speaks of the smug joy of esoteria. Oh did I mention it had a nice haunting score.",6,1,3,28 January 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Mission implausible III
","Lots of action, little sense! Good summer flick for those wanting to watch a '24' mentality movie with the usual 'too fast and jerky to enjoy' action scenes. As usual: suspend all disbelief who enter here. Intrepid super IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is called back from his 'training only' life to rescue erstwhile trainee of his, who is the mandatory female 'who kicks butt as good as the men' agent. In order to do so he has to leave his 'out of the loop' fianc√©e ( a Doctor, of course! All agents wives have to be Doctors!), and hurry to Germany to extradite the agent. The action scene that follows is the usual herky jerky, MTV slamma jamma, 'wha's happenin here' rush that I couldn't wait to be over, so we could get on with the story involving Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has some wonderful lines as the ultimate Bond type baddie, but whose presence is sadly under used.There is a scene on a long causeway (Chesapeake?), cloned from 'True Lies' in which Hoffman is rescued, with resources only available to the US military, and as far as we can tell the newspapers don't pick up on this - and if they do what the hell is the explanation going to be? 'Eh, well there were these terrorists on the bridge and we had to blow up half the D.C. commuters, and, no we don't know why we used a drone to over kill them, but trust us the US Govt. stopped a major threat to our country!'Then it's off to China to run rampant in the streets of the largest police state in the World with nary a sign of any police or military. Wow, a real sleeping giant!Hoffman, when we get to see him, is great. Cruise gets to sprint a lot. Soon enough he will be ambling along like Mike Douglas and Harrison Ford, so make hay.....I don't see this as a blockbuster, but it will do well enough with the summer crowd. Until Poseidon comes along, which, if it's done right, will at least have some: 'who is going to die, and who isn't,' tension.Finally I know this is picky, but why does the hero always rush to rescue the damsel in distress, when he's miles away, and yet he never thinks to call ahead and have security on scene, or police, do it? I know, no dramatic tension!",6,4,12,7 May 2006
3:10 to Yuma," A good movie ruined by a ludicrous ending.
","Reading many of the comments it seems obvious these days that all a movie needs is: good cinematography; good acting; interesting plot; plenty of action. That hooks most people nowadays. The fact that it lacks intelligent plotting, doesn't allow for any semblance of rational belief, and treats the audience as if it's stuck in dreamy adolescence, doesn't seem to matter.Granted it's great acting by Crowe, Bale, and Peter Fonda. Great evil theatric posturing by Ben Foster. The cinematography is great, and it's based on one of the great 'thinking man's' cowboy movies ever made. So how could they screw this up. Simple: by deciding, at the end, to pander to the audience that likes action, and is either too lazy too think, or finds attention to concentration bothersome to the base pleasure of being led by the nose.*****************SPOILER*********** Up until the last twenty minutes the movie does fair homage to the original, and in some ways fleshes it out satisfactorily. To keep up interest there is way too much escaping/recapturing going on. Crowe gets captured initially not by some fluke, but by his own stupidity, which puts a crimp in the notion that he is a fiendishly clever sociopath. Then he escapes way too many times from supposedly hardened men, who never seem to get it that the best way to transport a sociopath is heavily bound. The fact that he gets recaptured again simply diminishes the 'invincible' reputation he has as a badman.But this is all signaling us for the end when Bale is left as the only one standing to take Crowe to the train station. The gang of seven sits atop their horses outside the hotel in which they are holed up. They sit bunched up - sitting targets - but no that would be too easy. Bale must take Crowe not only past them but half the town that has been offered bounty money. So how does he do it? The Director decides to turn the movie completely upside down and have Crowe aid and abet Bale in running the gauntlet. Not only aid and abet but kill off every last one of his own gang for pissing him off and shooting Bale. I am so tired of having to sit through movies and suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the movie. I'm willing to do it when the movie doesn't take itself serious, but this one tries to pass itself off as a morality play, and Crowe's latter day conversion to Robin Hood simply insults probability.",7,31,51,29 September 2007
Deja Vu," Suspend disbelief all ye who enter here
","The premise is well known by now. Denzel Washington is approached by FBI agents with neat new gadgetry that records events from space in Google Earth Maximus so that he can solve a terrorist bombing. Then they reluctantly admit they actually can bend time and see into the past, but only for 4 days worth and it can't be Tivo'd.Agent Denzel works for the ATF, but as this is a Bruckheimer vehicle we all know what that means. All Bruckheimer heroes get to do everybody else's job without OJT. The FBI takes a back seat. The Police take a back seat. Homeland Security lets agent Denzel run the show! All Bruckheimer vehicles exist in a scrunched World. The Press cease to exist. Lawyers are almost always non existent. When agent Denzel almost certainly kills off a few unlucky commuters in his zeal to follow the baddie, no Police ever show up to inquire whether said zeal has compromised the purpose of chasing down baddies!***********SPOILER******************* Denzel usually chooses his vehicles well. This time not so much! The movie works fairly well until Denzel, as we know he must, goes back in time. To stop the carnage of 500+ plus people from dying? Well yes but really, No! To rescue a damsel in distress. A very cute DID to be sure, but still our hero takes an hour and a half of his allotted 2 hours to rescue her, take her home, let her bandage him up, and most ridiculously to take time to make sure that the the things in her house are not rearranged (because as we all know if you go back in time, you can't rearrange anything). This proves ridiculous because he's already rescued DID from being killed by baddie again! Suffice it to say this movie has plot holes you can fly a 747 through, but it might not have mattered if the writers had decided to cut out the whole traveling back in time to rescue DID, and had instead treated us to the much more interesting initial story line story of sending a clue back to the past so that they could have followed the clue to stop the crimes.",6,4,8,25 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Bearable summer swill
","This is a 'good fun for the family' movie, if you prefer your adventure soft boiled. I can't quite decide whether Johhny Depp makes the movie better or worse. Without him it would certainly have been drearier, but with him it takes the movie from adventure to amusement park ride. He plays a scalawag pirate who is more of a swish, than swash, buckler. He teeters rather than swaggers, bombs out with the ladies, and never shows us any of the skills of a former Pirate Captain. He's the modern androgynous anti hero we've had to put up with since 'real men' departed the movies.Geoffery Rush on the other hand is the anchor that holds this flimsy vehicle down. He is plays evil properly: with cold amusement, and a solid sense of his own superiority. He adds just the right trace of despair at his condition, and avoids all of Depp's silly stereotypical 'Pirate' babble. A more ironic Director would have allowed him to escape his formulaic ending.Unfortunately the movie doesn't know how to take itself seriously, when that is required, preferring to trot in a comedy relief duo when no such relief is required, and to insist on allowing Depp's character to stay dizzily in character, when I, for one, desperately wanted him to show some passion.",6,0,1,13 July 2003
Brokeback Mountain," It wears it's heart up it's sleeve.
","As a guy I had to ask my unconscious if my hesitation in liking this movie was homophobic. My unconscious said no. But then what do I really know about those depths? How people view the meanings of this movie is through projection. You see what you want to see. This is true of all art forms of course, but the good ones drop clues along the way to point you in the right direction, but the great ones leave you struggling with paradox. My wife saw a tragic romance between two guys who could never admit their love openly. I saw two losers stuck in a dilemma without the wits to resolve it.The plot is too well known for much to be revealed as a spoiler. Two cowboys spend a summer alone together, high in the mountains of Wyoming, and have an affair. Then they spend the rest of the movie not knowing what to do with their feelings for each other. They come together much like the sheep they herd, roughly and lustfully, and they part with no stated intention to see each other again. One (Ledger) marries and becomes a father and seems determined to live out the life appointed to him. The other (Gyllenhall) drifts around the Rodeo circuit, secretly gay, but stranded in a land where such proclivities can get you beaten up or killed.When they hook up again 4 years later they fall upon each other with such abandon and indiscretion that Ledger's wife sees her husband engaged in unbridled passion not even a stone's throw from their home. This is where I lost the guys for the better part of the movie. Having a gay fling one summer is one thing, committing adultery without the blink of an eye, is another. Now I was left feeling more sympathy for Ledger's wife and children than I did for the lustful duo, the more so because I never saw much love between them. Plenty of lust and good old boy friendship, but little love. Committing adultery for lust put Ledger's character on shaky moral grounds, so I wanted to see it done for love. This is where projection comes in. My wife saw a love affair and what I saw was two guys putting their libidos ahead of their responsibilities. When Ledger goes on to neglect his doting daughter I cared even less about his dilemma.It's obvious that the story is not destined for a happy ending. It is, after all a cautionary tale about forbidden love in the land of a 'man's got to do what a man's got to do!' But in the end thanks to the screenwriters finally getting Gyllenhall to open up about his intrinsic gayness, we also get to see Ledger's character realize that infidelity rips out the heart.Ledger will be nominated for an Oscar, and if Straithairn doesn't win it, then he should. His portrayal of a man strangling on his own pent up emotions is the centerpiece of the movie.",7,10,16,15 January 2006
Match Point," A place in the sun across the channel.
","Woody Allen is treading down a familiar path. Lower class boy meets rich girl, and uses her to get ahead, but is sidetracked along the way by his libido. The question is can Allen do the subject as well, or better than it's forebears. Two movies come to mind: 'A place in the Sun,' and 'Room at the top.' Both are classics, the first an American version of Dreiser's: 'An American tragedy,' starring Montgomery Clift. The second a gritty British version starring Laurence Harvey as the unforgettable Joe Lampton. The answer is: no, not by a long shot!A tennis pro (Myers), at a posh British Country club, gets invited by one of his clients to the Opera with his rich family. Our hero meets the client's sister, and she takes a romantic interest in him. Our hero sees his opportunity and let's it take him where it can do him the most good, which is out of Tennis and into the boardroom.Allen chooses to go softly and slowly into this story, and it takes awhile for the story to get under one's skin. That moment is the arrival of Scarlett Johansen, his girlfriend's, brother's, fianc√©e; and our hero's immediate beeline towards her. Now we know that he isn't simply trying to get ahead, he is trying to have it all, and in so doing the only question left unanswered is how self destructive are his demons? Allen wrote the screenplay as well as directed, often a difficult combination to pull off. But then, that is his m√©tier! The problem I had with the script is that too often we can see the actor's struggling to make the words come out naturally. Johansen struggles the most, perhaps because she is not a great actress, or perhaps because Allen gives her lines that are more in place on stage.Meyers struggles as well, in part because he is surrounded by more accomplished British professionals, and in part because he is not really up for the kind of nuanced performance required of him. But ultimately the main fault is Allen's, because he wants to give us a movie about the pit falls of ambition, and all we get is a rather mediocre morality play. In the end Meyer's character is not nearly as dangerous as Joe Lampton, nor as tragic as Clift's. So what he leaves us with is a nice little twist at the end, that somehow manages to come off too easily and too patly.",7,0,0,3 February 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Visually and emotionally stunning
","A mother and daughter arrive at a mountain army camp in Civil War Spain. The Woman is married to it's commandant. The daughter is a reluctant visitor. Her father is dead and she has no liking for her new Step Father. We are made aware early on that the young girl either has a fanciful imagination or is in touch with an alternate reality.While her sick mother stays in bed the girl is visited by an insect she saw in the woods, and this soon morphs into a fairy who beckons her to follow it. She is led to some ruins near by and there meets a Pan like creature, who tells her she is a long awaited Princess, and that she must perform three tasks to be able to become the Princess of the other world. Now we realize that the girl's imagination is hard at work.The movie continues in these two layers: reality and fantastical imagination. Her Step Father turns out to be a fascist brute, whose only interest in the girl's mother is for her to deliver him a son. He is pursuing a gang of rebels hiding in the mountains and forests surrounding the camp. The camp has a mole who is the sister of the gang's leader.The daughter's fantasy grows more and more elaborate as she uses it to escape from the loss of her father, and the mixed loyalties of her mother. Both stories grip one's attention. Brutality and heroism exist in both; sacrifices are made; and potentially fatal errors occur. There are monsters in both worlds! The cinematography is brilliant. The CGI superb. The makeup and costumes are flawless. Best of all it all comes together without jarring or disturbing juxtapositions.While a child is the center piece of the movie, it is definitely not a movie for children. It is a violent and frightful world in both places, but it is also a place of heroic struggle between good and evil.The ending surprised me and left me in tears. It was at the same time tragic and inspiring; depressing and uplifting.The metaphors abound but are so well weaved that one can experience them without having to dissect them, until much later.",9,2,4,20 January 2007
Knocked Up," Hey IZZIE you got some splainin to do!
","I'm not a fan of most comedies. I love to laugh and I have a good subversive sense of humor, but most American comedies leave me especially cold. So I decided to read up on what the critics had to say about 'Knocked up.' They all loved it ¬ñ overwhelmingly so! I was very disappointed! Not just in the movie but in the critics! Usually I can go to Rotten Tomatoes and agree with the average rating given by the dozens of America's critics. Maybe it's just a generational issue. I'm geriatric; old but not yet ancient. Maybe if I'd seen this when I was twenty or thirty I would have found it hilarious. Maybe most of the critics are young too; actually I'm sure they are. I really don't want to have to read AARP's movie reviews, because I know lots of old fogies who wouldn't be seen dead in movies I like. What I discovered ¬ñ too late ¬ñ was that people over 45 gave this movie thumbs down. So I was right, it is a generational thing. Young people like to watch themselves and humanity portrayed as shallow; feckless; and amoral. Us older farts are bored to death by it. Watching a movie about men permanently stuck in adolescence leaves me cold. It's the same with watching movies about drunks or drug addicts. What's funny about emotional retards? There's no pathos about pathetic people! The one organ that can get us to evolve is the Brain! Watching people abuse theirs sobers me right up, and that makes laughing hard! Watching a movie about a vibrant, gorgeous woman apparently not intelligent enough to know what her zillion other options were, other than to have sex with a Neanderthal ¬ñ even when she's not seriously sh*t faced ¬ñ and then to try and make it work with the moron set my teeth on edge! What's funny about stupidity?But then this is the woman who plays 'Izzy' on Greys anatomy, the one who fell in love with a terminally ill patient of hers, killed him off while trying to save him, and is now in the arms of the only married friend of hers! Not the sharpest morality wise!Watching Kathy Heigl diminish her star quality in this way saddens me. It reminded me of Jane Seymour's embarrassing fling in 'Wedding Crashers.' She's young and she'll go on to better things ¬ñ I hope.",6,14,61,2 June 2007
Nacho Libre," Sweet hearted but slow and barely droll.
","I went to see this hoping to get a good laugh. Mostly I smiled instead. What could have been an interesting fable turns out instead to have squandered much of it's opportunities. It's the first Jack Black movie for me - I don't count King Kong - and I found his humor, of mostly sight gags, to be soft and airless. He may be one of the top comedians in American movies today, but I find most of those people to be very weak replacements to the comic geniuses of the past. Tom Hanks is the last comedian I found to be genuinely creative and intrinsically funny.What did interest me was the total use (or was it misuse?) of a foreign culture as the comedic environment. I guess it's up to the Mexicans to decide whether Black is lovingly teasing them for gentle or harder purpose. When they make fun of themselves, that's one thing. When we make fun of them, we are walking a tightrope.",6,0,7,17 June 2006
Closer," a good primer on why telling the truth is not a sign of maturity.
","The more this movie progressed the less I liked it and the characters that inhabit it. Well.. except for Natalie Portman, who's still adorable as a self loathing waif. The language gets to be quite brutal and crude, and is reminiscent of Nichols' earlier grittier 'Carnal Knowledge'. This is the way writers want people to talk when they're more concerned with being genuine than with being evolved.Clive Owen puts a big dent in his 'new heart throb' rating with a really vicious turn as a sleazy Doctor whose only emotional range seems to be egotistic rage vented on anyone who he can't control or who bests him. His lines are the most profane in the movie, mixing every common sexual expletive with his vitriol. But he thinks he's being wonderfully genuine!Julia Roberts plays a co-dependent who goes with whichever of the male leads who wants her the most at the time. She's playing against her star quality and she does fine in this ratcheted down persona. Jude Law on the other hand struggles as a feckless loser who feels secure with Natalie's one down role but is over his head with the stronger Julia. The movie has many problems. The lines work better on stage, and the characters would be better played by actors not movie stars - again I would exclude darling Natalie who is still enjoying quirky character roles. The dialogue is clever but as it comes from the mouths of shallow people trying to tell the truth it just comes out as self evident dialogue. Finally it fails because uninteresting hollow people just aren't interesting√Ç‚Ä¶except for sweet little Natalie, of course.",6,1,3,4 December 2004
Shutter Island," Never really delivers
","***********************SPOILERS++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The movie starts off seeming to be a 'creepy' thriller about the escape of an insane killer from an island fortress, somewhere off the shores of Boston. It's standard stuff for the first 45 minutes or so, with the usual attempt to make the criminally insane look scary. Mood is everything here, but as the movies have been down this path so many times, and as-in my case-I know that the insane are not particularly scary, it's a question of wondering why Scorsese is going down this trite path.When he shifts the plot to a 'conspiracy' plot it gets even triter. And then it shifts ponderously to a 'fooled you' ending. The story tries to confuse with it's shifts, but underneath it all it's all sturm and very little drang. When the ultimate plot line is revealed it's a big let down. It's 'spellbound' rehashed.The big problems for me were that it continues to trot out the usual myths about mental illness; it's symptoms, it's causes, and it's cures.",6,30,57,27 February 2010
Capote," Hoffman is brilliant!
","I came to this movie with only one intent: to watch Seymour Hoffman's performance. Truman Capote, the man, does not appeal to me. I found him to be a vainglorious, self aggrandizing prig! Would Hoffman's portrayal, which I knew from previews to be uncannily accurate about Capote's famously fey mannerisms, go into character, or stay in caricature? Could Hoffman escape his stolid, teutonic, appearance and become a mincing, literary mountebank? The plot goes as follows: Capote reads an article in the New York Times about a Kansas farming family of four found brutally murdered in their isolated farmhouse. Intrigued, for reasons unexplained, he gets the New Yorker magazine to send him to Kansas in search of an article. He is accompanied by Harper Lee, the author of the, yet to be acclaimed, novel 'To kill a Mockingbird,' who acts as his point man. Capote knows full well how middle America is going to react to an eastern 'fairy,' and he has Lee soften up the people he needs to interview. Once inside he takes over, winning people with his gift of story telling ¬ñ mostly quite revealing stories about himself ¬ñ and inveigles them to reveal details about the crimes.His aggressive, and insertive, tactics are no different than any other of the paparazzi, but he does it with such panache and, due to his fame as an author, he gets away with it. He steals into the funeral home to take a morbid peek at the dead bodies ¬ñ bizarrely cocooned by cotton face masks, to hide the shotgun damage ¬ñ he bribes a Sheriff's office manager with books so he can have access to one of the murderers, who is imprisoned in a cell in an ante room. Expecting a monster, he finds instead a literate, soft spoken, artistic, half breed, who asks him politely for aspirin to ease the pain in his legs.**SPOILER*** Hooked, he decides to abandon the article, and go for a book, the first non fiction novel. Aware that, if the men are executed, time will run out on his project, he hires a lawyer to mount an appeal, and manages to keep them alive long enough to milk the story. Using self revealing stories he gets Perry Smith, the articulate one, to open up about everything except the one thing Capote needs to finish his story: the description of the murders! We are so taken in by these conversations that we forget that it is between a writer, whose main aim is a story, and a sociopath, whose main aim is to stay alive. Both men are consummate con artists, so subtle in their skills that they only reveal enough to keep the game cloaked and ongoing. Perry Smith keeps mum about the murders, while Capote lies about his book's progress. Perry demonizes his partner, and Capote dutifully plays along, spending all of his time with Perry. Perry wants to know the title of the book, Capote lies and says he hasn't come up with one, knowing full well that: 'In cold blood' will show his hand.P.S. Hoffman's portrayal of Capote is an incredible melange of great impersonation and great acting! He is, in my opinion, a shoe in for the Oscar. While I was moved by Ledger's haunting work in Brokeback, I was awestruck by Hoffman. He wasn't just required to impersonate the pompous little gnome, he was required to make us wonder which Capote was the real Capote, or whether Capote changed personas with the context required of him! Does he care about Perry, or is he simply using him. When he cries on the eve of their execution, is he crying for them, or for himself? Then we add the interplay between him and Perry, and we have two actors playing actors. Both keep their true selves hidden in an intricate game of mutual manipulation. It is only in their final conversation that Perry confesses to the murders in a brief and brutal fashion, so brief that it never really shocks us out of the delusion that he, as his sister so tellingly says: 'would as soon kill you as shake your hand.' We never see a warm side of Capote, and from his retelling of his childhood, as a frequently abandoned, terrified child, we are left to wonder about how his persona is hidden away under the layers of melodrama. As Capote states to Harper Lee, when she asks him if he has fallen in love with Smith: 'I feel we grew up together, and he left out of the back door and I left out of the front door.'",8,1,1,11 February 2006
Gone Baby Gone," A great gritty movie with a deeply unsatisfying ending
","It's in all the magazines. Ben Affleck has returned as a force to be reckoned with; as a screenwriter and a director. After 'Good will hunting' I knew he'd be back, but he really surprised me with this gritty, no nonsense, what the F... morality tale. Affleck goes back to his roots in Boston; the hard scrabble existence lived by too many of the urban working class. But he goes deeper into it's rotting underbelly, and it's a sobering ride.A little girl goes missing; purportedly kidnapped; and for God knows what! Private eye Casey Affleck and his partner (Monahan) are asked by the grandmother to help uncover leads in the neighborhood that they are more familiar with than the cops. This doesn't sit well with anyone; not the cops; not the rest of the family; and not with his partner. But Casey is a straight arrow and he plunges ahead, and soon uncovers some pertinent evidence that throws them together with two hard bitten old cops (Ed Harris and John Ashton) who attempt to set up an uneasy alliance. Things go bad and the story seems to be hanging in limbo when along comes another child kidnapping, which goes off even worse. But it sets off alarm bells in Affleck as he realizes that Harris hasn't been straight with him about the earlier kidnapping.Once again he plunges ahead against the pleas of his more cautious partner, and slowly he comes face to face with the truth about the first kidnapping. To me, and probably the majority of the audience who view criminals as scum, the end has an acceptable solution. Until Casey Affleck pushes his straight arrow morality, and then the movie goes flat, so horribly flat, leaving me (and probably 95% of the 'when it comes to doing what's best for the child morality is Black and White brigade')totally deflated, angry and cursing Ben for following what was probably the book's ending instead of a more satisfying one.The movie is way to good to be ruined by the ending, and for those who view hard realities as moral challenges, then this ending's for you. For those who like to be thrown curve balls that raise profound questions about what is the right thing to do, then this is for you too. But I bet that the ending will dampen the 'you must see this movie' word of mouth that makes for a golden day at the Box Office. I wonder if the suits told Ben this, and I wonder if he told them to take a hike?",8,2,4,28 October 2007
The Italian Job," Bland acting and plot interspersed with heist scenes.
","They borrowed the minis and the traffic jams and that's all that's left of the original. They even stayed clear of the tightwire ending. So why not just call it the 'Hollywood Heist'?The scenery in Italy is nice and keeps one interested for that part of the movie. Once it moves to L.A., it becomes just another heist movie, with none of the characters holding one's interest. Ed Norton is losing his initially interesting 'bad guy looks like a wimp' persona. Mark Wahlberg is flat. Charlize is as usual adorable to look at but unexciting.
The holes in the plot are elephantine, so leave your brain at the door if you want to relax and be entertained. For example how does Ed Norton afford a house that costs more than the gold he stole while he still holds on to 3/4 of it? Or, why would the Italian police think that a 7 ton safe could be carted off on a 1 ton speed boat doing 90 degree turns.",6,0,0,7 June 2003
The Men Who Stare at Goats," goes from promising to oh so boring.
","Any movie with Clooney, Bridges (jr), Spacey, can't be all wrong, right? Not so fast. While the guys themselves are great, the material, which is amusing at the start, becomes repetitive and lame within the first 40 minutes. Then it's hang on and hope for redemption, which never comes.That it's a satire I get, but since this is based on probably mostly true scenarios they ring false, and that kills it. Clooney has done controlled manic before, and Spacey is doing his serious 'bad' guy routine. McEwan is along for the 'not comedy' angle, and he gets to pick up his pay check and move on.As the Army seriously went down this path we should leave the movie, sadder, but wiser. Instead we're sadder and need a Budweiser....or two or three.",5,11,27,6 November 2009
No Country for Old Men," The Coen's score another Americana masterpiece
","Sit back and follow various and sundry characters from the Coen story book as they careen and meander through Texas. There's Josh Brolin, flush with millions after coming across a drug deal gone bad - leaving him holding the bag - and as not the sharpest tool in the Coen wood shed he is soon chased after by Mexicans, a corporate hit man (Woody Harrelson), and a burnt out Texas Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones; with a ten miles of bad road facial landscape), but most of all by the coolest, craziest, baddest sociopath to tread the Coen fantastic: Javier Bardem, sporting a nice Hispanic American accent, and an Oliverian Richard III hairstyle. Apt.Many Directors have been down this worn path before. Peckinpah in 'The Getaway'; John Flynn in 'Rolling Thunder' (with a younger, less loquacious Tommy Lee); Jay Lee Thompson in 'Cape Fear.' And countless westerns. This movie is also a western; a modern one. Gone are the Cattle rustlers, the Bank robbers and in their stead the Drug runners. But this time there is no heroic Marshall to track them down. Just tired old Tommy Lee Jones who seems to see the end long before Josh Brolin does. He doesn't do much tracking, just coming on the scene of too many killings, and getting more and more philosophically confused by what he sees.He waxes philosophical, and his metaphors are as subtle as Mickey Spillane's, just couched in a Texan drawl. Javier Bardem also waxes philosophical, only his are borrowed from the grim reaper, and grim he is. As Woody Harrelson's character says: 'he lacks a sense of humor.' His weapon of choice is an air drill, perhaps borrowed from an abattoir. He uses it to open doors and men's souls.To watch the Coen's is to watch Americana crafted at it's finest. The dialog is the hub of the wheel. They use it to bring in characters straight from a Bruegelian America that we all have come in contact with when we wander away from our home turf of normalcy. No character in a Coen movie is allowed too much silence. Many of them seem to be people they met along the way and invited in for a spot in the movie, and they make the movies ring true, if quirky.The only complaint I have is that the movie has all the air sucked out of it near the end, as the Coen's deliberately beg off the requisite mano a mano ending.Tommy Lee is fantastic and yet he's a minor player to Brolin and Bardem who get the biggest scenes. Brolin as a trailer denizen, who seems smarter than he acts, is destined for minor stardom. Bardem is already there for those of us who have watched him cut his teeth with Almodovar and moved from character to character like a chameleon.",9,1,7,24 November 2007
Gran Torino," One dimensional, condescending, and chauvinistic.
","Clint Eastwood growls and huffs and puffs through this oh too predictable-derivative of the old west-American fable. Grizzled white guy saves poor neighborhood immigrants from the neighborhood punks. Clint gets to reprise his Dirty Harry routine, with the difference that this time he's almost 80, a racist, and bitter. His character is embarrassingly open about his narrow mindedness, an openness that would last one New York minute used on Blacks or Hispanics, but seems to bounce off the Hmong neighbors, who are probably equally bigoted but have the manners to keep it to themselves.Clint reluctantly takes on the neighbor's son-who he had to drive out of his garage at gun point, after he tried to ineptly steal his Gran Torino-as a token of shame remuneration. In a week or so he's shaped him up from a diffident nerd into a more acceptable American: one who's willing to think about standing up for himself, and his family, against the neighborhood punks.He also befriends the boy's sister, after saving her, in an embarrassingly retro scene, from the stereotypical black guys behaving badly. She educates him, against his protestations, in the more civilized ways of her people.Unfortunately the screenplay relies on stilted, unrealistic dialog, almost as bad as if Dirty Harry had written it himself. The characters are one dimensional, and the relationships are drawn like a comic book.In the end, inevitably, Clint rides off to do battle, after the punks take revenge on his neighbors for his own attempt to exact justice. His method, however, is definitely Christ like, even though it also is self serving. Clint is dying of cancer.I've come to admire Eastwood's directorial work over the years, but from time to time he stumbles away from his simple, honest, style back into the artlessness of much of his earlier acting work.",5,9,18,28 February 2009
The Illusionist," A deft period piece that draws you under it's spell.
","It is Vienna, circa late 1800's. A magician, known as Eisenheim is plying his trade to an enraptured audience. He is no ordinary magician, content to pull rabbits out of his hat, he offers illusions that appear real. One night the Crown Prince Leopold decides to attend with an entourage and his soon to be betrothed. When Eisenheim asks for a volunteer, Leopold offers her.On stage we see that Eisenheim recognizes her as the girl he loved as a teen, and whose family separated them, because he was of the wrong class: Common. She does not recognize him until after the act is over. Leopold, played with great icy arrogance by Rufus Sewell - a younger look alike to Ian McShane - and probably most recognizable to American audiences as the bad Knight of 'Knight's tales', invites Eisenheim to his palace for a private performance.In the mean time, Eisenheim (Norton) meets secretly with his erstwhile love, and the flame is rekindled.At the Palace Eisenheim finds that Leopold plans to have his 'illusions' unmasked, so that he can bask in the public humiliation of a man whose talents he finds threatening, but instead Eisenheim makes the mistake of publicly humiliating Leopold and dooms his career.Paul Giamatti is the Chief of Police, and in the pocket of Leopold, and is sent to discover Eisenheim as a fraud, and thus ruin him, but before he can do so Eisenheim's humiliation of Leopold does it anyway.Eisenheim and his love plan to elope but tragedy intervenes and the movie takes on a darker tone. Eisenheim know seems to be on the path of vengeance, and in the process seems to have joined hands with the dead. He conjures up spirits and his fame returns even more strongly.Leopold presses the police chief to do his bidding, and the movie rises to it's conclusion with a final trick of illusion.... or does it? Norton is wonderful in a tightly controlled role, and uses his mesmerizing gaze to great affect. He seems to fit into this role much better because he underplays it. Giamatti continues to amaze by ditching his trademark grin and smirk for a straight face. Sewell plays the villain to the hilt, and is probably going to be stuck in these kinds of roles unless he avoids the lure of Hollywood.As a period piece the movie delivers a realistic and beautifully colored frame, that helps to enrapture the audience in the story, and even though the ending can be predicted by those looking for the 'sting,' I was pleased to be caught unawares.",8,0,2,2 September 2006
Children of Men," 'And a child shall be born unto them.'
","If you like futuristic apocalyptical themes, you'll like this. If you're like me, and don't find them appealing, then you might like watching the vision of the Director spread out on screen.We've been here before. It is a genre that always seems to be played out in dark, violent, frightening, hues of man reduced to a barely civilized mass of humanity. Something has gone awry and we are left to wonder what. Immigrants seem to be the main problem. Thousands of them rounded up in cages and shipped to holding camps on the coast.Clive Owen, our anti hero lower echelon bureaucrat, walks in a London reduced to something from '1984' or 'Blade Runner.' The government has turned fascist (1984), and the big new of the day is that the youngest man on Earth has died at 18. The planet is not reproducing! Then his ex- wife shows up with a request for papers to allow a woman immigrant she knows passage out this hell of a U.K. He reluctantly agrees and soon enough finds himself as the sole protector of the only pregnant woman on Earth. Due to her value to any and all factions the only safe place for her is something called the 'project.' The plot line has a million ways to develop but the Director and writers choose to go the old route of a tour through a Breugelian circles of hell. It's all well done but the theme is regurgitated and old. It seemed like Clive was walking through set pieces in a human zoo, a flotsam and jetsam of humanity waiting it's demise. The message is clear: Shape up Earth or this awaits you.My problem with anything futuristic lies in my need for people to behave realistically within that future, and that just doesn't come across here. Within the plot the people come across as actors cued to act and react. In the end the biggest probability of all lies unanswered.In reality the real gold mine is the woman, not the child. The child is the future, the woman is the producer of it. As the only fecund female on Earth she'd be doomed to become a fertility cow, a Queen Bee of the future, popping out little future-lings for an incestuous rebirth!",7,4,7,7 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Manipulative? Yes. Great? Yes.
","The critics who haven't liked this movie have called it manipulative. Well, they're right! But who cares! Eastwood sucked me in so beautifully that I'm willing to let it pass. As has been said before there is a major shift in this movie that really changes it's message and, excuse the pun, is it ever a sucker punch! Hillary is great, as are Clint and Morgan. Clint even shows some chops as an actor. Sure he's still doing himself, but he really takes on the character. The movie doesn't come close to the depth or sophistication of 'Mystic River'. The story, or rather the two stories, are predictable. Will our spunky heroine win over the old grouch? Will she make good? Will we root her on? You betcha! It's corny but there's good corn and bad corn, and Clint pulls his punches enough ( I'm sorry!) for it to work as solidly good entertainment.******SPOILER****** Now to those self righteous conservatives who derided Clint's ending. People this is a morality tale! That means the morals aren't cut and dried. Clint makes a decision that is not going to be accepted by those who want people in movies to act in accordance with the rule: only God can take life. Oops, I forgot, those kind of people are usually for capital punishment. Darn! Morality sure is complicated isn't it! O.K. only God can take life except for those people who deserve to die. Why do I keep thinking that Christianity is anti violence. It's just anti bad people.",8,2,3,12 February 2005
Into the Wild," Penn almost comes up with a home run
","Sean Penn delivers his best film, and in watching the film it's obvious why he wanted to do this one. One renegade celebrating another. Hirsh is great - he would be a great Steve Prefontaine, if that hadn't been done 2x already - and he's backed up by great performances from Vaughan, Keener, and especially Holbrook (who gets my nod for best supporting actor award.) The picture is part 'On the Road' part 'Wild Fang' part 'Don Quixote.' What interested me the most was the view of the soft underbelly of America that McCandless inhabited. Penn seems to hold that population in special regard, but it's easy to see why McCandless turned away from them as well: dropped out but aimless. McCandless was on a mission. Test himself to the limit and compete with Mr. Grim Reaper in the wild on a personal basis. Such arrogance has it's appeal.Penn has to make a choice about how to explain McCandless. 1. Don't explain, just show. 2. Explain too much and ruin it. 3. Do a bit of both. He chooses to do no.3, but doesn't quite pull it off. Not that there can be a definitive explanation, we all know this guy's been psycho babbled to death by bloggers, it's just that he chooses to go the 'family environment' path, when that seems to pat for my taste. Granted he got the family's permission to go this route, but do families really understand themselves? I found the sister's voice over intrusive after awhile and wanted Penn just to get on with it.Penn does drum gently on McCandless' insistence on abandoning his family completely, possibly out of respect for the family, possibly out of fear of showing judgment, and in doing so too mildly I think he misses the opportunity to set a harder moral tone. Is there really anything wonderful about total self absorption? But I'm glad that Penn insists on telling us that McCandless wrote he was 'lonely', and that the brilliance of creation is wasted if you can't share it with someone human.",8,2,5,21 October 2007
Midsommar," I can't believe I saw the whole thing
","As shallow a movie as I've voluntarily sat through in decades. You pay your money you pay the price. It's like watching someone on LSD while you're cold sober. Why are these people being such morons?? If one cared for any of these Gen Y'ers their demise might register, but one doesn't and it doesn't. It's like watching a far right convention. I hope they all voted for Trump.",2,56,103,10 July 2019
Inside Man," One of the best in it's genre.
","From the opening sound track (Indian?) to the satisfying ending, this is a most entertaining and engrossing movie. I hated having to go to the loo half way through! Bank robbery movies are great for tension and, these days, high tech gadgetry. They also let us try and decide how/if the bad guys are going to escape. This one skips around the gadgetry and goes for sleight of hand, but it has tension in spades and an escape scenario that is brilliantly conceived, and almost believable.Most of all it has great actors, with great lines, and a great Director - Spike Lee. Not only three super stars (Foster, Denzel, and the mesmerizing Owen), but other greats like Dafoe, and Plummer. and a slew of choice little cameo parts for the acting studios latest graduates. It's so well crafted that one can forgive it the inevitable 'I don't think so' moments.Clive Owen and three ( or are there more?) accomplices walk into a Bank dressed as painters. They terrorize everybody in to ridding themselves of their cell phones - a post 911 must - and then dress them in the same outfits they change into: Jump suits, with hoods, and face masks, and sun glasses. Then they set to work...not robbing the Bank. They rip up the floor in a storage room; but why? They leave the money sitting in it's plastic wrapped blocks. They demand buses and a plane but seem to be in no hurry.Jodie Foster is hired by the owner of the Bank (Plummer) to negotiate with the robbers for the contents of a safe deposit box that he insist must not see the light of day. Jodie gets to play Ann Coulter on amphetamines. Blond, smart, take no prisoners attitude, and the best legs of any CEO. She's a 'fixer', and though she insists she doesn't need to know Plummer's secret, we all know she has to have it, because that's how she got to be so damned irreplaceable and powerful - by knowing everybody's dirty little secrets. A bitch with J. Edgar's talent and expertise.Denzel Washington is fleshing out his 'cop with a problem in his past' role from 'out of time', only this time he's in New York and he's nobody's patsy. We know he's going to get his man, but who is that 'man' exactly? Everybody under estimates him, and when he makes his biggest mistake, we are surprised and feel sorry for him.Clive Owen gets the best lines, many of them said dead pan into the camera, or into the face of Jodie or Denzel. He's tough and smart, and has figured out every detail of the robbery, but he's no sociopath, and at times we wonder if he's a vigilante criminal, out to right some wrong.Spike Lee makes this movie hum with tension and great scenes, many of them small little gems, such as the racist cop trying to tell Denzel about being shot without using racial epithets, which slip out any way; or the knock out Albanian lady who can translate the robbers taped conversation; or her ex husband, a New York Construction worker who is loathe to let her get any glory.Lee, throughout the movie, also lets us in on the investigation interview scenes that take place after the robbery, teasing us with some of the answers but too few to make a difference. He never lets the action lag, nor swings off into unnecessary cul de sacs for character development, and lets the intelligent screen writing show us the characters, and lead us through the plot with terse, meaty dialog. Spike, you've done the genre proud!",8,2,3,25 March 2006
The Happening," If at second and third and fourth you fail: fail, fail, again.
","The premise of the movie is well worth pursuing: 'It's not nice to fool with with mother nature!' Unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan is not up to it.Something is affecting the human race, or at least in the North East section, and it makes them kill themselves. We get to see gore and shock and awe (MNS has decided to get with our need for explicit violence), and for a while it looks like a WMD attack. Then it becomes something more difficult to grasp: it's nature, and she's p.o'd at us for global warming.Mark Wahlberg plays a nerdy school teacher, and it's difficult to watch him struggle to get into the skin of the character. As an actor he's best at showing us pent up anger, frustrated rage, and sociopathy. As a dweeb he just seems lost. In fact all the characters in this soap opera seem lost. I get why the Director wants to show 'average people,' but 'boring' people? He's married to a borderline, who's self involved and immature, and his friend (John Leguizamo) decides to let him know this at the outset of the movie. Why? Who knows! The end of the world seems a little more pressing than marital dynamics.Everybody heads to the countryside, because someone deems it's safer, and yet nature seems to track them down and get them in bunches. Naturally we end up with just Mark, his wife and Leguizamo's daughter, holed up in an old lady recluses home. MNS decides to unleash Betty Buckley as a Norma Bates clone on the trio, but luckily she's felled by the suicide spores and has the funniest suicide scene in recent memory.This is not a horror movie, but it is pretty horrible to watch MNS descend once again into adolescent movie making. He's absorbed Hitchcock and King and resurrected himself as Wes Craven with a bigger budget.Shyamalan has had his shot at this subject matter and now hopefully someone with a better gift for making it look realistic and worth watching will get a chance.",5,1,4,15 June 2008
There Will Be Blood," A tour de force for Day Lewis
","I remember well the dark and gritty novels of Upton Sinclair and Sinclair Lewis that explored the belly of the American beast in the early 1900's. This movie reawakens the mood of those novels with it's unflinching look at the hard scrabble heart of the capitalist manifesto: 'buy, produce, and sell, and to hell with whoever gets in your way.' Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing and truly awesome. I cannot think of another actor who could have done this role in quite this way. As usual he inhabits the character so that immediately one forgets the actor and becomes immersed in the man and his being. In a voice and cadence reminiscent of, if not an outright imitation of, John Huston's, Lewis's presence expands on screen into a Dickensian/Shakespearean grand guignol for the ages. Lewis specializes in recreating these humans who are forces of nature; unstoppable, unrepentant, builders and destroyers, and ultimately the seed that sprouted into America, like it or not.Just as 'No country for old men' the movie is clearly the work of genius. One can see the staging and thought behind every scene, and the blessed pauses to let it all sink in. The dialog is key, and Lewis a master of enunciating every line for affect. The landscape is California bleak, wind swept and desolate, and even at the end in Daniel Plainview's mansion the imagery is of emptiness and soulessness.Also to be commended is Paul Dano as both twins; the boy who sicks Plainview onto his father's oil and his brother the preacher who strives to tame the beast in Plainview but ends up unable to tame the beast in himself, whose character, while as ambitious and amoral as Plainview's is no match for his antagonist, in spite of besting him in one of the movie's few comedic moments.",9,1,5,21 January 2008
The Last King of Scotland," A fascinating blending of fiction with history
","A young Scottish Doctor flees his repressive home to go to Uganda. Now that's an oxymoron if ever I've heard one! Once there he joins a mission and ministers to the locals. He tries to fit in to the Christian role but temptation has thrown him a curve. The missionary's wife is a blond tressed, and quite sumptuous Gillian Anderson - with a bang on British accent and demeanor. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for my fantasy life, she hesitatingly demurs. At this point Idi Amin happens to be in the neighborhood and takes a fancy to our young Doctor (completely ignoring Gillian, which tells us right off the bat that the man's not normal), for having the chutzpah to brazenly use Amin's pistol to kill a cow, mortally wounded by Amin's limousine.Our young naive, hedonist decides to take up Amin's offer to be his personal Doctor, and soon finds himself up to his elbows in African Alligators, namely your usual Dictatorial musical chairs.The character of the young Scot is pure fiction, but in the Uganda of that day, a quite likely one. He slowly realizes that his boss is a sociopath, but he is also a prisoner, knowing that to displease him is a tad risky. Still he is a headstrong youth, and continues to confront Amin when he sees fit to. Then he steps over the edge and does something totally suicidal: he sleeps with one of Amin's wives.The movie ends with the Entebbe hijacking of an Air France Plane full of Jews coming from Israel. Our hero uses the moment to escape - Uganda and certain death.Whittaker is great. Playing sociopaths is every actors dream, as you get to be so mercurially evil, and he milks it for all it's worth. But he's never over the top, or campy, or unbelievable. He plays Amin as the jolly genocidal maniac that he was, and, thank God, keeps away from more than a nod at his being a Muslim. Whittaker will win the Oscar. I also predict that if they ever have a movie about Saddam Hussein, that actor will also win an Oscar",8,6,7,3 February 2007
The Reader," A nice tale which let's the viewer come to his own conclusions
","The story is a simple one, with a twist. A boy has an affair with an older woman, who one day abandons him without a word. A quiet, sensitive boy, in post WW2 Germany. Finding him retching outside her house she takes him in and cleans him up. When he recuperates and comes to thank her, the relationship becomes kinetic.He is educated, she is not. He is innocent, she is not. They make a trade. If he'll read his books of literature to her, she'll please him sexually. He learns little of her, and she doesn't offer much to him, except her body. When he pleads for more, she berates him with: 'you mean nothing to me.' It is a prophetic remark that shows us more of her, but little else is forthcoming, and when he hesitantly asks her if she means it, she seems to grudgingly back down. As it turns out this exchange may be crucial for the boy's, and our understanding of her character.A few years later, when attending a war crimes trial for a class, he is stunned to see his former lover as one of those accused. She was a guard at Auschwitz. The young man is devastated, but holds his silence to his friends. He decides to visit her in jail but backs out. Then he realizes that he has evidence that can change the course of her trial, but continues to keep silent.It is his silence that makes up the core of this movie, and it is it's unraveling that is left to the audience. Is his reason simple or complex? Is he acting out of cowardice, malice, or a sense of justice? As a man (Ralph Fiennes) he one day decides to send her one of the books he used to read to her. But not the book, rather a tape he has made of himself reading the book. He had realized in the trial that the one thing he knew about her, was the one thing that might have given her a more lenient sentence: she is illiterate. How this could have been a mitigating factor I won't divulge.Using his tapes and looking at the books she teaches herself to read, and starts to write to him, but he never responds, continuing his silence, and yet continuing to correspond to her as a 'Reader.' What are we to make of him? Or her? My take on it, is that she was a simple, concrete soul, used to taking orders, and able to separate herself emotionally from her job, yet remaining shallow in spite of all the fine literature she is exposed to. She ends up being able to read, but never able to fathom. She comes across not as callous, but as vapid.He on the other hand comes across as a weak man, unable to grapple with the paradox of loving a 'monster,' who he never knew as a monster. Unable to offer much except that which he can do at a distance. He is not callous, but is, like his erstwhile lover, emotionally hollow.Winslett is haunting, and emanates pathos. The boy David Kross is winning as a winsome lad. All in all the movie held up well and was engrossing, but I could have done without the final scene with Lena Olin, who plays a victim of the holocaust, imperiously, and unsympathetically, and the scene seems to have had only one purpose: to allow her to get in the pregnant line: 'you can learn nothing from the camps.'",8,18,25,3 January 2009
Inception," The older you are the less you'll think it's so brilliant.
","Look at the Polls on this site. Liking the movie is age based. I'm retired and while I liked it, I wasn't enthralled by it. After awhile CGI is CGI.It is a movie in which one has to surrender disbelief about disbelief about disbelief. While the layers are fascinating on a quick intellectual basis, they soon become ludicrous to believe in.The real problem I had is that there is way to much linear action for it to resemble any dream sequence of mine, but I understand that having a rapidly morphing and unworldly scenario would simply befuddle and irritate. I did like the 'is he or isn't he' twist at the end.Sort of a mission impossible on LSD.",7,7,16,18 July 2010
The Queen," Enthralls while it appalls.
","The movie chooses a short span in time; the days following the death of Diana. This tilts the whole enterprise in favor of the fans of Diana the wronged, and against those who believe, as I do, that Diana, while put into an impossible situation, milked the media for as much sympathy as she could manage. She did not behave 'Royally' and, because of this, was loved by those who saw the crown as either an anachronism or an aloof presence, and decried by those who saw her as not living up to her role as a public royal persona.The centerpiece of course, and the hub around which the movie rotates, is Helen Mirren as Elizabeth. Coiffed to perfection in the famous matronly curls, she morphs effortlessly into the famous disciplined and bland grand matron. A Queen who is staunchly independent and rock sure of herself until she is faced with the prime crisis of her rule; when it slowly dawns on her that her subjects require of her a humanity and a sensitivity that she thought would undermine her role as stoic in chief.Mirren is superb and will get nominated for this role. She has now managed to play both Queen Elizabeth's in the span of a year, and has done it oh so convincingly. Those who love her work should not miss her reprise of Inspector Tennyson on PBS this week, where she disappears again into a role that is so opposite of the Elizabeths in style, and yet so similar in strength.Everyone else around her either sinks into caricature, or falters because of their dissimilarity to the real people. John Cromwell, while a strong actor, is wrong as the Duke: he's too craggy, too crabby, and too American. The Duke is chisel handsome, haughty, and speaks crisply. The woman chosen for the Queen Mum is also totally wrong. She's too big - rather than petite - and too slavic. The man playing Blair (Sheen?) certainly resembles him, but smiles to much and exaggerates the famous Blair exuberance to the point of seeming to be on speed. Even worse he reminded me of 'Speedy' of Alka Seltzer fame.While effort is made to make Charles appear sympathetic, the man chosen to play him never manages to capture his controlled, yet casual, hauteur, and whose face looks so unlike the long, oval, large featured, one of Charles, that I found myself having to remind myself of whom he was playing.The problem of the movie is that it seldom rings true. The Blairs chatter to each other as if they have only just learned to explain themselves, while in fact they are being asked to do so for the audience. It is this insistence on continuously explaining the events to the audience that takes it from a drama to be observed and pondered over, to a soap opera, albeit a grand one at times, of 'a week in the life of a Queen.'",7,1,2,17 November 2006
Iron Man," Same old same old
","This has been billed as a smarter, tighter super hero movie. It's not. It's entertaining, and has all the special effects one takes for granted, but it is still riddled with the same old clich√©s expected from the genre. I had hoped that the movie would stay more in Afghanistan - anywhere but Calipornia - but it gets bogged down as soon as Iron Man does his one piece of obligatory super hero rescuing the average guys from evildoers, and returns to the usual (yawn) struggle with evil corporate magnates determined to make more money and stoke the ego incarnate.The audience I saw it with clapped and cheered and laughed, and I take it that the average movie goer joe is happy with being treated once again to mindless escapism for the summer. My grandkids liked it, and what else can one ask from Hollywood.",7,11,24,4 May 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Suspend disbelief and enjoy the show
","Of the 4 Die Hards I'd rate this no:3, after 1&3. While it's not as good as 1&3 it's way ahead of 2. So much for ranking it! In this latest version John Mclane is older, balder, but still a bad ass! The movie doesn't attempt to fill us in on anything about his last 12 years, other than the fact that he's trying to reconcile with his estranged daughter...by ruining her love life. The action starts right up and off we go. The movie is a delicious ludicrous joy ride, that borrows heavily from every other major CGI blockbuster: True lies; MI 1,2 &3, Terminator3 etc. The plot is paper thin, and the holes in it are effortless to punch, but Willis holds it all together with his wry presence.They've decided to go with nobody's in secondary roles, or at least nobody's to an older aficionado. The worst casting is of the bad guy, who does not have the acting muscle to compete with Rickman and Irons. He looks like Liotta with better skin, but is as menacing as a California surfer! The lack of a decent protagonist for Willis is a major weakness; and I miss Bedelia. The star is of course the CGI's. Nothing new here; lots of car and truck crashes; the obligatory helicopter crash; and of course the collapse of an overpass; and apparently we now have a fighter plane that can maneuver like a helicopter (the F-35B, which is to replace the Harrier).",7,1,3,29 June 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," A decent attempt for Bollywood to go Hollywood.
","Even though the movie is directed by a Brit, the movie still has it's roots set firmly in Bollywood. I don't know if it was intended for a wider western audience, but it was certainly intended to appeal primarily to it's base: the Indians. All of the usual Bollywood touches are there; the soap operatic drama, the manufactured tension, the boy gets/loses/searches for girl, and of course the dramatic ending, where hero wins both fame, fortune, and the girl. Unfortunately what is also there is the unsophisticated/adolescent populist tone of most Bollywood movies. But fortunately we get spared the dragged out musical number. Or perhaps, for western audiences it was expunged!The idea is fascinating. Put a boy from Mumbai's slums and have him become an overnight sensation on the Indian version of 'who wants to be a millionaire.' How does he know so much trivia? For every question we see something in his harder than hard scrabble life that has given him the answer, and which he has retained. The death of his mother to anti Muslim mobs; the stint in a beggars prep school run by asocial thugs - shades of Fagan and Twist; the growth of his brother from street gamin to mobster gunsel.The view of life in the slums goes from depressing to horrific, and while one brother Jamal stays centered to a basic morality, his brother, more unstable from the start, sheds his street punk facade for the big time, and sheds his brother (and steals his girl) in the process.What doesn't work is the host of the TV show. A self serving, preening, ambitious, hollow character, who acts more as a cattle prod than an MC. What definitely doesn't work is the way he decides to find out how the boy knows the answers. This may play in Mumbai but it ain't going to play in the west, where TV hosts who project their insecurities out on the contestants sadistically don't survive. Arrogant pricks, sure, but sociopaths? Will he answer the final question? That one question we know will be asked, because they give us several hints early on. Who will he call as his 'phone a friend?' Here the movie separates itself from the well known rules of the show. Those who are 'friends' are holed up somewhere next to a phone, and a computer, and probably a gaggle of helpers, not, as in this movie, at the end of a cell phone whose owner doesn't even know she/he's being called. And the final question? In the US or Europe it would go for a third of the price.",7,0,2,26 December 2008
Valkyrie," Valiant but a tad square.
","The plot to kill Hitler is certainly worth a good film. They slipped it into the 'Night of the Generals,' as a sub plot, but now it gets full focus. While it is a watchable film, and it follows the history quite accurately, it ends up being a docudrama with not much creativity or tension.What could have added meat to the plot could have been to have given the growth of anti Hitler sentiment more attention, as well as the cultural clash between the officer class and the Nazis.Many critics are down on Cruise. I think he's a capable actor, but to have him as the sole guy with an American accent - surrounded by mostly Brits - is rather ludicrous, but it didn't distract me too much.It would have been nice if they had used some of the many capable German/Austrian actors. Speaking English, of course. Can't have subtitles for an American film! By now we should be well past the tradition of having Brits only playing Nazis. Actors are so good at accents these days, so if your going to use English speaking actors why not use German accents? The other problem I have with the film is the focus on the guys who wanted to bet rid of Hitler as 'good guys.' Von Stauffenberg was known to have made anti semitic comments in his letters to his wife, and I'm sure many in the officer class were anti Semites as well. Their effort to rid themselves of Hitler was not simply a noble cause, it was a plot by one class to get back some of their tarnished honor. Honor tarnished by the Nazis and the SS. Honor which certainly pushed Germany into it's attempt to create an empire. The movie completely side stepped this paradox, and it is the movies insistence on showing history in simplistic terms that lessens it's impact.",7,4,7,29 December 2008
