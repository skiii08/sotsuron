The Ring," You might love it if you've never seen a scary movie
","I think this movie has been over-hyped.  I guess to a generation used to slasher teenie movies, this appears to be a deep, dark, forbidding, psychological thriller.   Personally, I found it very contrived, and while some of the images were disturbing, some of them were so badly done as to be near comical.  I don't think I'll have any problem sleeping tonight, unlike most of the reviewers here, for whatever reason they have for not sleeping.I suggest waiting for the DVD and saving your 8 bucks, unless you just have to jump on the 'latest movie' bandwagon.",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
