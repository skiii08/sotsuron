The Avengers," Summer's approaching, here's the season's first real blockbuster
","So, every few years we get an obligatory Hollywood presentation of a comic book story. These films can be either really really good (films like The Dark Knight, Iron Man,) or really really bad (films like last year's Captain America). Personally, I'm a fan of movies in general. I'm no comic book freak, and before seeing this film I really couldn't tell you the first thing about the Avengers. But I was told this was gonna be the one, the superhero movie that I would love more than any of them. This was hyped up to be the best yet. It has all our favorite heroes, plenty of crazy action and breathtaking special effects, and a star- studded cast. So, I had high hopes and was excited to see this movie, which is rare for me when a new superhero movie comes out.From beginning to end there is no denying that this is the year's first blockbuster. I'm not going to waste time describing the movie though, as honestly, we have seen it all before. Basic save the world plot, but with a medley of all the most famous and powerful superheros. What this movie does do is take special effects to new heights. This is by no means a thinking mans film, but it is not supposed to be. This ones about getting the bad guy, and causing a whole lot of explosions and plenty of adrenaline-pumping battles. Robert Downey Jr. shines as usual as Tony Stark, and his performance is the showstopper and shining moment of this movie. All in all, there is something for every kind of movie fan here. It does what a blockbuster should do, entertain us and captivate us for a few hours with it's big-budget effects and simple story line. This is nothing we haven't seen before though, and while it is worth a second viewing (especially for the die-hards), it is nothing that I will spend my time raving on and on about.Overall: 7/10",7,0,5,6 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Epic adrenaline rush of a film
","I'll start this off by letting everyone know that I've never so much as picked the Suzanne Collins book up. I had no idea there was a book called 'The Hunger Games' until I saw the trailer for this film. I don't know why, but something about this movie stuck out to me upon my viewing of the trailer. Maybe it was the premise of teenagers brutally fighting to the death as a game and tradition, or maybe it was how the movie clearly demonstrates the unbreakable love between siblings. But for whatever reason, I knew I needed to see this film.I went with a friend of mine who had read the book. She assured me the book was fantastic, and she was sure I'd love the movie as long as it followed the book. After it was over and I asked her how closely it followed it, she seemed a bit disappointed. But, having no previous knowledge, I didn't find many major flaws in this film.Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic young actress. Her performance in the great Winter's Bone was remarkable, and she doesn't disappoint here either. She plays our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, who takes her young sister's place in The Hunger Games, a brutal but traditional game where 24 teenagers battle to the death while the entire country watches. The action scenes are tense and awesome, and Katniss proves herself to be an extremely intelligent player as the games go on, finding clever ways to pick off opponents. Lawrence's portrayal is really a joy to watch, as is the film itself.Look out for a decent acting turn from Lenny Kravitz as well, as well as a strong performance from Josh Hutcherson. It is these performances that make the movie special, and make it such a thrilling and enjoyable film. I cannot speak as a fan of the book, but as someone who loves to watch a good movie, I was very pleased with this one. And if you are a fan of smart, clever action-fantasies, you shouldn't feel any differently.Overall: 7/10",7,1,8,4 April 2012
21 Jump Street," Silly comedy, not as funny as you think
","I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in this movie right here. I went to the theater with hopes high ready to laugh myself silly, figuring that I was sure to judging by the look of the trailers I had seen. However, instead of a gut-busting comedy, what I got was a silly little movie that got old relatively quickly, and wore out it's welcome sooner than I thought it would.Don't get me wrong, 21 Jump Street delivers a few hilarious sequences. The Peter Pan play sequence, for instance, had me laughing harder than I've laughed during a movie since last years 50/50. And the party that the two bumbling cops throw is a pretty funny, entertaining part. But really, aside from a few one-liners and quips here and there, this movie offers up nothing original and is overloaded with clichés. For example, a loud, angry black cop. A scary, villainous motorcycle gang. An overbearing and slightly gay-tinged gym teacher. Yep, just about every comedy cliché can be found in this one.What this movie does have going for it is Jonah Hill. The funny man never seems to disappoint, and in this one plays the dweebie Morton Schmidt to perfection. Channing Tatum isn't bad as his counterpart, and the two show decent chemistry on screen. Also, watch out for a movie-stealing cameo towards the end from someone we all know and love (myself especially).All in all, this film does not live up to the hype. It is a funny ride through a decent storyline, but not much more. Don't go in expecting your gut to bust, as you will be very disappointed. Go in with an open mind and you will be entertained, as this is an entertaining film with some genuinely hilarious moments.",6,3,5,7 April 2012
The Woman in Black," Dimmly lit snooze fest, literally almost fell asleep multiple times
","First off, this movie probably would've been more entertaining if Harry Potter was the main character. It's not like we weren't all picturing it already as we watched this, and honestly I would have rather watched the boy wizard romp around looking for clues to the ghostly mystery than watch boring Arthur Kipps try to. I was so excited to see this movie, as the trailers looked genuinely creepy, the set design looked spot-on, and I was intrigued by Daniel Radcliffe playing anyone but Harry. What I thought would be a dark throwback to the classic haunted house ghost stories of old indeed was just that, only a very poorly executed one. This movie really is just one big waste of a plot, a waste of the cast and crews effort, and a waste of my (and everyone else who went to see this snooze fest)time.The plot is an awesome classic horror movie plot. A young businessman travels to do business, and in the process discovers strange occurrences in and around the house in which he is saying. He soon learns of the history of the town, and sets out to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Yep, I thought it sounded entertaining too. It first hit me about 20 minutes in, when I began to realize I had been watching Radcliffe walk around since I sat down. Yes, it really does take a good 30 minutes before anything remotely interesting happens. And from there, it only continues to drag along at a snails pace. The scares are effective at points, weak at others. I was genuinely startled only twice the entire movie, and had trouble staying awake for the duration of it. This was the result of a combination of the near pitch-black lighting of the film and the crawling, dragging, stagnant pace of it. Also, stick-in-the-mud Kipps might possibly be the most uninteresting protagonist in horror movie history.All in all, this movie is a waste. There is nothing positive that I can find to be said about this film. The only bright spot is the beautifully creepy house, the set design really as a whole is exceptional. Also, the movie shows that it is capable of inducing fear, but chooses not too in favor of jump-scares and quick disturbing images. The horror genre has reached a new era. The era is dominated by the found-footage sub-genre, and there has been a found-footage flick for just about every plot. I thought The Woman in Black would be the film that revamped the classic era, the era of straight up creepy ghost stories/haunted house thrillers. In reality, it was the film that made me lose almost all hope in the current state of the horror genre. The ideas are clearly running out, and I'm afraid that the genre might be on it's last legs. I hope I'm wrong, and that this film is simply a mishandled mistake and not an omen for whats to come for the genre. One things for sure though, The Woman in Black is a poor,poor film, and will soon be forgotten about and disregarded.Overall: 2.5/10",2,9,13,12 April 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Takes a basic horror movie plot and makes it completely original, this could be the one that saves the dying genre
","Wow! I'm surprised. Genuinely surprised. I watched the trailer for this film and wrote it off as another cliché slasher flick meant for 16 year old kids to make out to on a Friday night. I told myself I wouldn't go see it, as it would be a waste of money and I'd leave the theater disappointed in yet another failed attempt at a horror film. But, after a few more viewings of the trailer, and after a few friends raved about it, I decided to hit the late showing one night when I was wired with nothing else to do. From the near-perfect opening scene, I knew this movie would be more than I expected. And it proved to be just that. From start to finish, this is a pulse-pounding, terrificly acted, well-written and ultimately great film. Not just a great horror film, but a great film in general. There are so many twists, turns, and curve balls thrown at us that you can't keep track. The special effects and makeup is top- notch work, and this is the first movie I've seen in I don't know how long that actually had an effective jump scare! I know, I couldn't believe it either. This film is truly great because it takes every tired, played out genre cliché and breathes new life into it, making for an entirely original and thrilling movie. This one is highly recommended. If you're a fan of horror films but have been disappointed by every single one since last year's Insidious like me, then you will be floored by this flick just as I was. If you're not really a horror fan, you will still find yourself falling in love with it because of it's sheer originality and brilliant screenplay and performances. Don't miss this one folks.
