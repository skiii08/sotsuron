The Incredible Hulk," Simply Awful
","I went to the cinema with 2 of my friends excited to see this movie. One of my friends loved it, was intrigued from the beginning, oohed and aahed at the right places. But me and my other friend walked out of the cinema twice simply to get a break from it. How my friend enjoyed it, I have no idea! From the word 'Go!' I was sitting bored and uninterested. These movies are usually my thing and I walked out of the cinema hugely disappointed. I am actually incredibly surprised how many good reviews this movie is getting on this website, because I found it simply awful. There was alright parts. The fighting scenes were good. And I admit, the special effects were fantastic but other than that I found the movie a complete letdown. I thought Liv Tyler did a good job. Gave the movie some life. But seriously, apart from Ms Tyler and the special effects, this movie would not even have been worth rating 1 star for. Please don't make the same mistake I did, thinking this would be a good movie.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Wow!!
","Pirates Of The Caribbean 2 (for short) is a brilliant film.I have read what some of the critics say in the newspaper, and you know, some of it is a lot of crap! Critics are up to their own opinion, but saying this film is bad or not up to standard is just nonsense. Its a great movie !Johnny Depp deserves praise for his great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. He is the only actor capable of playing that part!! Orlando Bloom plays Will Smith superbly.All the actors suit their characters. Special effects are absolutely fantastic. A definite 10/10 and a must see movie I am looking forward to the 3rd already!",10,2,3,10 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," I love it
","I really enjoy all the harry potter films (and books) and i think that this one is by far the most interesting.THe special effects in the movie are brilliant and so is the music. the characters have really developed . The older cast give another outstanding performance, as do the younger cast. But i think Hermione Granger played by Emma Watcson is for dramatic in some of the scenes. Which annoys me.I really wish they put more of books story in thought . I understand it would be the worst job ever to try and cut out some of the book but some of the bits they left out are very important to the next books and will need to be explained in the next films.I still think this is a very very enjoyable film and much more grown up than the rest. Scary but good.",9,0,1,3 December 2006
The Happening," Don't show this movie to EMOs.
","I went to see this movie with my friend (we are both stereotyped as Emo, even though we aren't!)and we had a great time. This is coming from 2 teenage girls though, so it probably won't be YOUR opinion. I am a massive movie fan, and although I cant say this is one of my favourite movies, I honestly don't think its one of the worst I've seen. The characters are all rather boring, apart from Mrs Jones, who I think was one of the only interesting characters to watch and one of the only characters that kept the audience guessing. I found some of the scenes scary. Afterall, it is supposed to be a frightening movie. Its at least disturbing. My advice though is, please don't show this movie to emos. It will give them too many ideas. :) ROFLCOPTER XD",6,1,5,25 June 2008
Dodgeball," Good Movie
","Dodgeball is a good film Vince Vaughn puts on brilliant performance, as does Ben Stiller, who plays the evil White Goodman. Ben plays the part so well that he actually makes you want to hate him.The storyline is good and the actors play their parts well.This movie has an allstar cast, so you cant expect it to be bad! Can you? When it came out in the cinemas i didn't want to watch it, i thought it looked terrible. A bunch of grown men playing dodgeball for an hour and a half wasn't really going to get me laughing. But it was on Sky, one night and i thought, we'll so how it is .. and the next day i bought it on DVD. It is a great performance by all cast and it definitely is a must see movie!",8,0,1,10 July 2006
