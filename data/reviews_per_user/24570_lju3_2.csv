The Sound of Music," Surprisingly, a Very Good Movie
","I must first say that I went into my game-room to watch this movie expecting to be bored out of my mind. However, I was wrong. Not being gay or Austrian, I don't know much about musicals or Vienna, so I didn't really expect to find much in this movie for me. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much. In fact, I would be willing to say that this is Christopher Plummer's best performance, and I liked Julie Andrews more here than in Mary Poppins or 10, which are the only other movies I've seen her in. I recommend this movie to just about everyone, especially gay Austrians.",10,1,7,23 November 2000
The Insider," Wrong Message, Right Movie
","The acting, directing, and writing in this film are superb. Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer especially do noteworthy jobs. The story is also told very well, and it avoids getting too preachy, which many of today's PC anti-whatever movies do. One thing which proves this movie's quality is the fact that I totally disagree with its underlying message and still found it very good. Anyone who smokes does it at their own risk and shouldn't whine when their lungs turn black and they have to breathe through a hole in their throat. Apparently, the producers of this film don't think along the same lines. All in all, this is a great movie that you should rent whenever you have a chance.",8,0,0,23 November 2000
