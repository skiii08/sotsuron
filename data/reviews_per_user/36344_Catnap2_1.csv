The Ring," Satisfying thriller
","I really liked this movie.  It was somewhat unique to the horror movie genre - a suspenseful scary movie without any gore!One of the problems  movies like this have is they tend to fall apart. Loose ends don't tie up, mysteries are introduced - then not explained, etc. I thought The Ring did well in this regard.  While I had a problem with the way it ended (no spoilers but it just did not make sense to me), the preceding pretty well panned out.Watts of course was good, and I thought her boyfriend Henderson did a really good job too (not all critics agreed).  The kid was appropriately remote and kind of creepy.I highly recommend it to anyone who likes horror films.  I have never been a fan of slasher films and movies like this are so welcome as an alternative.",Null,0,0,25 February 2004
