Source Code," Stupidity galore
","Theoretically, this movie could have been great. No, not just great, amazing. The premise was quite promising, being that using Source Code, the protagonist could kind of infiltrate a recently dead person's memory and observe and interact with the environment the person was in. Interesting, no? The idea had some potential, but leave it to Hollywood to take a huge dump on anything with a potential.The movie is ridden with so much instances of absurdities and nonsense, it almost becomes hilarious at certain points. Firstly, the romance between the two leads ie Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. Believe me when I say this, Jake falls in love with Michelle's character after spending about...oh, I don't know... 4 minutes with her! I mean, seriously, wow! They have absolutely 0 % chemistry and by God, any parts in which try to establish their relationship and immensely painful to watch. And then there's the thing with his dad. We're supposed to feel sorry for him or something because.... they didn't meet each other for a long time...? But we never see any interaction between Jake and his dad. Heck, we don't see his father at all. We don't know anything about him. Why should we care at all? Oh whatever, the main plot involves Jake trying to find a bomber on the train. I just love how he tries to find out who did it. By randomly going up to people and threatening them. Classy, ain't it? Anyways, the person who turned out to be the bomber will probably be obvious to the audience less than half an hour into the film. And the whole concept of the 'twist' thing towards the end is so moronic it hurts real bad. Other than that, the special effects aren't good for this day and age, Russel Peters' role is absolutely pointless as he doesn't even get to tell one proper joke in the whole movie. What a waste. Of course at HQ, we also have the angry commanding officer, the sympathetic female and the bland white nerd all doing their respective generic jobs. Nothing you haven't seen before.Seriously, this is a very nonsensical film. Maybe just a tiny bit entertaining, but really doesn't matter when you realize that pretty much every other second in this film is inane and laughable.",3,2,5,1 October 2011
The Hangover," I'm not impressed...
","This seems get a lot of praise from professional critics and casual viewers alike. However, this isn't going to get much from me. The whole thing just seems like a rehash of ideas which've been already done before. Moreover there's no fresh feeling to it either as it's done in a typical modern day comedy fashion i.e tons of swearing, lots of sex references, action scenes and obscene humour. I don't have a particularly huge problem with any of these characteristics but when they are what the movie is based around, it gets quite a bit annoying.The storyline isn't as bad as some of the movies in the same vein. And there were a few moments that made me smile and even semi laugh. But the overall humour comes off as pretty dry. Using the f word a billion times does not make a movie funny. But that seems to be a problem with a lot of comedies nowadays.Overall, I though it was a pretty mediocre movie and I would only suggest checking it out if you like similar movies e.g Pineapple Express, Observe and Report, Superbad etc. Personally, I'm sick and tired of these kinds of movies.",3,4,9,15 December 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Nicely executed
","So yes, this movie isn't historically accurate at all, and although it would've been probably better if it was, it still comes off pretty good.The story is basically 'if American Jews knew what was going on in and around Nazi Germany at the time and gathered a group of people to eliminate as much Nazis as possible'. It's not so much the story that's good about this film. It's the actual content that really won me over. Or to be more precise, how the scenes are executed. There is a lot of dialogue accompanied with small, sudden bursts of action. The fact that these action sequences, no matter how small, occur so abruptly and unexpectedly, makes the sequences much more intense and interesting that any shoot-em-up could hope to make.Another great thing about this movie is that we actually feel for the characters. And not just one side either, we feel for both the Jews and the Nazis, so it's not biased either. I don't know if it was the director's intention to make us feel sorry for some of the Nazi soldiers but I sure as hell did. For example, there is scene where a Nazi soldier is brutally murdered with a club because he refused to give up the location of his fellow soldiers. He believe he died for his country doing the right thing. Another scene was where a Nazi soldier, who had just become a father, was shot multiple times by an enemy who he completely trusted for the time being. Betrayal, murder, vengeance are all part of the movie theme and I think it's a great portrayal of how much of a disgusting creature a human can be.I would've preferred it if this story could've been somehow fit into history as that would make it much more effective as a film. But for now, this is just an alternate reality film and nothing more. Plus, the ending was somewhat ridiculous and kind of ruined the genius of the whole thing. Aldo's 'masterpiece' was pretty dumb, to be honest. Anyways, this really is a good and enjoyable film and I'd recommend it to anyone who's not frightened by sudden, intense moments.",7,0,4,20 February 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Why Hollywood, Why?
","Once upon a time, when I was a little bugger, and my parents just bought me a PS2, a magical game came into my hands thanks to a friend. This game was Price Of Persia: Sands Of Time. It had everything a game should have. Good action gameplay, great entertaining plot, confusing yet ultimately solvable puzzles and decent characters to go with all of it. But you know what that amazing video game didn't have? Stale, tired Hollywood clichés. So now we come to this movie. Does it follow the (amazing) storyline? Nope. Does it follow it loosely? Nope. Are there one or 2 elements in the movie that come from the game just so they can claim that it's Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time? Yes, it is. You know what this is? Just a pretty cheesy adventure film. Let's see what's common between the source and this derivative. The fact that there's a dagger that can turn back time. A few action moves. And the twist ending (I'm being VERY generous with this one). What does this movie mainly have? Just about every Hollywood cliché in the book. The quirky protagonist with the sappy back story and humble beginnings, the love interest who doesn't like our hero initially but later falls in love with him, the evil uncle who kills the hero's father (Lion King anyone?), a comedic relief character, pointless chase and action scenes etc etc. And what's with evil uncle anyways? He's bald, has a goatee, has a dark shade under his eye. Why did they have to make the villain so friggin obvious? I've seen more subtle Disney bad guys. Sheesh! Oh yeah, and the movie has a typical happy happy ending.I can just imagine the scenario of the producers coming up with the idea for this film. Producer1: 'Hey got any ideas for a new film?' Producer2: 'Hmmm... well I saw nephew playing this game called Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time. It would make for another great lazy video game adaptation!' Producer1: 'Cool. What's it about?' Producer2: 'I don't know. Some dagger with sands in Persia or something. Who cares? We'll just get some rookie story writer to slap together a lazy plot and we'll market it to the unsuspecting video game fans and the other people who don't know anything about this Price Of Persia' Producer1: 'Brilliant! Money will fall on our laps like snowflakes.'To be fair, the movie is a bit entertaining. But that doesn't cover up for all the plot holes, lazy writing and general predictability. Hollywood can do better. They just don't because everyone pays for stuff that's generic and therefore easier to make. If you want to watch a cheesy adventure film, go ahead. If you're like me and are expecting the complex, layered and dark plot of the game, you better avoid this.",3,5,10,16 September 2010
Terminator Salvation," Zzzzzzzz....
","I like all the Terminators, I really do. I really dig even the 3rd part which was bashed a lot for no reason. However, this is not really a Terminator movie. It's a completely generic family friendly boring action movie loosely based on Terminator.Where should I start? The main plot is pretty much what most action movies consist of. Random, long, dragged out action scenes (ALL the time) with very little emphasis on the storyline unlike the previous Terminators. The special effects might have been good but I was too blanked out to really take notice. The so called post Judgement day world isn't nearly as dark and hopeless as portrayed in the previous movies. Christian Bale is a terrible John Connor. There are just too many plot holes when compared to the prequels. I just watched the movie a few hours ago and I can barely remember any memorable part. There are too many useless characters. The melancholic and helpless atmosphere all the previous Terminators provide is not present. Oh yeah, and the (completely awesome) signature score has pretty much been ruined.Overall this just a run of the mill action movie attempting to cash in on the Terminator's popularity. Complete bullcrap and I highly recommend you spend your 110 min on something else if you haven't watched it.",1,10,18,8 January 2010
500 Days of Summer," My very confused outlook
","I've avoided writing a review for this film for quite some time now because of a few reasons. One of them being I've been very unsure of how exactly I feel about this movie.Critics and average movie goers have praised this movie immensely. It has been described by professional critics as 'a delightful comedy, alive with invention' among other (positive) things. This specific statement is right about the movie being innovative. We have all seen, heard and read the overdone 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gains girl again'. But this is more like 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl... for good'. Going back to the statement :'a delightful comedy'? I think not. There is almost nothing funny about this movie. The supposed 'funny' parts are basically swearing...ummm...yep that's it. The other parts were way too depressing or 'touchy' to be perceived as humorous. Why this is branded as a romantic comedy I will never understand. If it were up to me I would brand this as an anti-romance movie more than anything. I will not go into the plot too much but I can tell you that the movie makes me sick even thinking about the concept of romance and love. How Summer (the girl) is perceived by Tom (the boy) as her soul mate and how it definitely seems that way in the beginning of their relationship. How it feels like they're 'in love'. And how Tom is pretty much stabbed and mentally abused when Summer suddenly described she's not interested. The popular 'Expectations/Reality' scene in which, on one side of the screen, Tom gains summer back (the expectations) and on the other side of the screen, where he is completely ignored by her (the reality). And of course the ending, which I won't spoil, all of these aforementioned factors combined together make me sick to my inner core.I will commend the movie for being original, not following a generic romance movie formula. And this is probably more realistic than just about all movies in the same vein. But... I just can't like it. It just disgusts and frustrates me way too much. Underneath all the sunny sunshine presentation of the movie, there is too much darkness and depression. And I'm not saying that this is a necessarily a bad thing. It's just that, the way it's portrayed doesn't click with me. It felt me leaving very hollow and unhappy.Then again, I am rating this more than I would rate a typical romance/drama and I'm not a fan of this genre so considering that this is a good rating. If you're into the romance genre check it out. Perhaps it's just my interpretation that's making me feel so disgusted at the movie. Like I said in my title, my views on this are pretty confused.",5,49,74,19 April 2010
The Expendables," Bullets, Explosions, Boredom
","Commando, First Blood, Rambo 2+3, Die Hard, Terminator, Scarface, Lethal Weapon. What do all these films have in common? They're all 80's action flicks. My relationship with these films is a very love/hate one. The ones with a plot, action scenes that relate to the story and have a good flow are enjoyable. Then there are the likes of the Rambo sequels which have a non existent or a very generic plot, contain explosions, bullets, random senseless violence and more explosions and just bore me to death. The Expendables was supposed to be a revisit to the past of the 80's action genre. Which route did they take? As you might have guessed by my rating, it's the latter.The story. I'll try to explain what little of that I understood. A bunch of random dudes (played by popular actors) like to shoot bullets and blow stuff up. There's an evil ruler in Vilena who they have overthrow by doing what they do best i.e destroying everything. Later they find out that there's an evil ex-CIA American who's backing the dictator up (why is he evil? God knows...) so they have to take care of him too.This movie pretty much throws every single 80's action cliché at your face without being charming or nostalgic. The evil foreign dictator, his daughter who disagrees with his methods, the guy who betrays the team (obvious since the first scene he's gonna do it), the crappy punchlines and catchphrases, the East Asian comedic relief, the token black guy, explosions just pushing people away, bullets never hitting the good guys and many more.OK, so perhaps you're thinking 'It's a cheesy 80's popcorn action flick. Enjoy it for what it is'. Well, there's a problem here. The action scenes are not exciting at all. They're scattered all over the place. The smallest thing will ignite a long, boring action scene. 'Hey, that guy looked at me funny. Let's kill him and start a huge fight with everyone around us'. And, the creators of this movie decided to jump on the shaking camera bandwagon which is beyond annoying. Just imagine, Jet Li doing martial arts while the camera is shaking like there's no tomorrow. Sounds retarded, no? It worked in the Bourne movies, Shooter and a few others because it added intensity. Why? Because we actually cared for the characters. Over here, they could blow up any second of the film and I wouldn't give a crap.There's nothing more left to say about this film. The characters are stiff, the story makes no sense, the action is stupid. This can be safely added to the legions of crappy shoot em ups. The only intense thing about the whole movie was the somewhat well composed music.",2,8,17,13 September 2010
Shutter Island," Psychological thrillers don't get much better than this
","I've always believed that within piles and piles of crap, no matter how big the piles, gems can definitely be found. This movie has proved this in respect to modern Hollywood. Where most movies mostly turn out to be generic, rehashed, remakes or just plain stupid, movies like this show some hope for the future of Hollywood.US Marshal Teddy Daniels is investigating a case of missing patient in an institute for dangerous mentally insane people. Along his investigation, he discovers that he is in a midst of a deep conspiracy. I won't go too much into the plot but I'll say this: The execution is nearly perfect. Shocking moments are delivered suddenly and swiftly. The twists and turns will keep anyone guessing throughout the movie. Intense, thrilling scenes which will keep a viewer's heart thumping are scattered throughout the film. Even after the final twist is revealed, the viewer can't help but suspect it due to the many deceptions before.My only complaints would be the use of really loud music and pointless nudity which could've been easily avoided. If you're looking for a good thriller look no further. It's not 100% original but it will keep you intrigued and entertained, which is more than I can say for 99% of the movies Hollywood is blowing out of it's butt currently.",9,1,4,13 June 2010
American Pie," The blueprint for all that is wrong with comedies nowadays.
","This is basically the reason that most mainstream comedies nowadays are so dumbed down. Sure, similar styles had been done before but this is what set off the alarm clock for all the atrocities to come.What exactly wrong with this movie? The whole 'comedy' part is based upon sexual references, sexual references, obscenity, and more sexual references. Ha ha! Hilarious right? Well no. There isn't much comedy in a random girl masturbating in the main character's room for no reason and then him prematurely ejaculating twice. There isn't any hilarity in being caught by your parents which jacking off. The supposedly 'funny' parts are completely bland and done in a very tasteless fashion. I don't think I laughed once throughout the whole movie. Hell, I probably found even Swing Vote more funny, a movie that didn't even emphasize on the comedic aspect all that much.And now thanks to this piece of crud, thousands of movie makers are convinced that you need tons of swear words, lots of sex references, obscenity and perhaps even more sex references to make a movie funny. Plus, most kids think I'm talking about this crap when I mention the song of the same name. Thanks a lot American Pie.",2,4,9,15 December 2009
Divergent," Diverging from Decent Filmmaking
","I used to be an avid movie watcher not too long ago. All sorts of movies: action, comedies, dramas, thrillers; you name it, I left no genre stone unturned. Unfortunately, it got to the point where every new movie I watched felt like a rehash of something I had seen before. I have been on a movie hiatus for about 4 years since then. I have still watched movies in this span of time but not as many as I used to. I do not observe them as carefully as I used to and don't consequently write reviews about them either. However, something about this movie awakened the critical beast within me. I have not seen such a plot less movie pretending to be deep in a long time and I need to write about it to feel like I didn't waste 2 hours of my life on nothing.What is this movie about, you may wonder? In a dystopian future, human beings are split into 5 factions. I don't remember the names of these factions and I won't bother to look them up. But basically, you have labourers, farmers, scientists, charity workers and the army. The charity workers also happen to be politicians and the scientists are jealous and want to be the politicians so they hatch an evil scheme to take over. Also, there are people who don't fit into factions and they are called 'divergent' (and are presumably talented at everything the other factions excel at), aka our main character Tris. The authorities don't like divergent very much because umm they couldn't think of a faction name for them I guess? Actually, the movie logic is that they can't be controlled. But why not? Just make a different faction for them and now you have them in line right? Oh well, let's just ignore that and take a leap of faith. The basic plot isn't anything I haven't seen before, and I've been out of touch with movies for the last few years. A lone teen/young adult in a dystopian rebelling against the really bad system that rejects them. Several movies have attempted this before, including Equilibrium, The Hunger Games etc. Does this movie do anything well enough for me to forget about the aforementioned fact? No, not really. The acting is bad, the music is annoying and the characters are terribly written.The acting is incredibly hammy. Sometimes the actors tend to overact while at other instances, they can't conjure up simple emotions. It gives the movie world a very dead feel to it. For example, a scene that is supposed to be rather dramatic towards the end of the movie has our main character bawling her eyes out like a maniac, while a similar 'tragedy' occurs a few minutes later and she doesn't bat an eye. The villain played by Kate Winslet is also emotionally dead and shows no acting range at all. Perhaps it's because English isn't my native language but I had a very difficult time making out the dialogue at times. The actors' speech felt very mumbled and incoherent.The music is very off balanced. Much of the time it overtakes the dialogue. Additionally, a lot of it isn't original music composed for the movie but popular radio songs instead which I always find a cop out when it comes to movie soundtracks. One of the scenes has knives being thrown around Tris by her instructor. It's supposed to be very intense and the music makes sure it tells us that by being very obnoxiously loud every time the instructor throws the knife. Similarly other scenes, particularly action scenes, have a very terrible use of music that distracts from the movie.The characters. Where do I even start? The main character, Tris, has to be one of the blandest characters since Bella from Twilight to be ever put on screen. She has absolutely no personality. Yes, she's 'Divergent', but what else? What does she like to eat, does she like animals, does she have any hobbies, does she like to screw around with her friends? The filmmakers made sure they don't address these questions at all, so we're left with nothing but a blank slate of a character. The other characters aren't any better in terms of development. The romance subplot is so forced, its borderline laughable. 'Hey, I touched you tattoo, let's have PG-13 intercourse now!' is the gist of the romance. The villain (Winslet) is pretty boring as well. 'I don't like human nature very much as it leads to violence so I'll use violence to destroy human nature' is her philosophy. None of the characters are interesting or have any sort of development throughout the story. The romantic interest is just a pretty face, the bad guy goons are well goons, and the main character's friends are just present as decoration pieces.Even after ignoring the unoriginal and silly plot, the movie doesn't offer anything that will make me want to look at it in a positive light. Weak characters, horrid music placement and cheesy acting clutter the movie throughout. How this had enough of a following to warrant a TV show, I will never know.",3,2,3,3 September 2014
Monsters vs. Aliens," Could've been better
","Well, let's see what we have here. Another one of them 3-d movies that are becoming very common nowadays. It's pretty predictable, and on the most part is family friendly and quite light hearted. That being said, the humorous parts of the movie reign supreme. Some of it is just random humour typically found in these type of movies. Some of it contains references to sci-fi films and such.The lead character, Susan, is not really interesting. However, the side characters, particularly B.O.B and the president, are hilarious. Unfortunately most of the screen time is obviously given to Susan which is a downside. Even though the overall plot is pretty predictable and maybe even a bit generic, things are generally kept interesting. The animation and effects are good, but not great by 2009's standards.The problem with this is that I found the high points of the movie it's funny parts, but they weren't enough to make this a great movie. Susan's love/drama life was given too much attention. Plus, the plot felt a bit rushed.If you're an animation fan like me, go ahead and watch it. It definitely has it's moments. However, it could've achieved an unforgettable status with just a bit more work. I think it deserves a 6.5 but since IMDb doesn't have that option, I'll give it a generous 7.",7,0,0,23 December 2009
Kick-Ass," Am I getting old or something?
","I had heard lots of good things about this. Random reviewers on the interwebs, professional critics and my friends all seem to love this. Obviously, I had to see what the hype was all about but I was also careful not to keep my expectations too high so that I wouldn't be disappointed. Guess what, I was disappointed.Now, I wasn't expecting an intriguing deep psychological movie or anything. I wanted to see a fun 'popcorn' movie with exciting action scenes and a nice portion of good humour. But the movie failed to deliver this for quite a few reasons. Firstly, even though there were some funny moments, a lot of the humour was based on swearing and sexual references (surprise, surprise). However, the humour itself is on short supply as a lot of the movie is wasted on drama and sappiness, something a popcorn movie should not have more than a few minutes of. Plus, the violence is a little too gruesome to actually fit into a fun movie. Just put the equation together and think about what we have here. I'll use 'Hit-girl' as an example. A strong little girl who constantly swears and takes part in all kinds of messed up violence, but also manages to have a sappy, dramatic history. Awww... how cute... NOT. Perhaps the movie should be named 'Hit-girl', because other than the fact that 'Kick-ass' is narrating and is simply in more scenes than her, there is nothing to insinuate that he is the main character. 'Hit-girl' had a much more important role in the story. But anyways, none of the characters are really likable, there way too much use of loud music in the a lot of the scenes, and nothing in particular sticks out about the whole film.This movie did not live up to my expectations, let alone the hype. It did keep me entertained, but not in a mind blowing way. Even though the story gave the movie some potential, it turned out to be pretty average.",4,3,10,19 June 2010
The Wrestler," Different, yet generic
","My reviewing gears are a bit rusty so I apologize in advance if this review comes off as unfocused.Darren Aronofsky, a director who is known for his somewhat unconventional films, has recently garnered a lot of critical acclaim due to the famous Black Swan. But then again, pretty much every full length film he has directed has garnered a positive reaction and this one is no different. Critics praised it, average movie goers praised it, everyone seems to love it, so it must be as great film right? Quoting a rather popular one liner from Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous Commando will make my answer to the previous question quite clear. 'WRONG!!! *Gunshot*' Well, you can exclude the gunshot but my point remains, there is nothing great about this film at all. Where is all this praise coming from? I'm not sure at all.The story is pretty straightforward. A wrestler who is way past his prime is struggling with his professional and personal lives. He's tries to balance them and faces hurdles in trying to accomplish this feat. He tries to find out what's best for him and whether he should continue his wrestling career.There are some things that are definitely different about this film. For example, the presentation itself is quite interesting. The film is shot in a rather uncomfortable way which is little hard to describe. I guess this is an attempt to make the film more realistic, but this does not make the film enjoyable to watch at times. The movie has kind of a dark atmosphere, which is commendable, though not entirely consistent. There isn't much of the glamour you might see in quite a few Hollywood films about celebrities. Definitely a different take on such a subject.However, there are a lot of problems that plague this film. Firstly, the story doesn't have anything special or original about it. 'Randy', our protagonist, is infected with typical Hollywood clichés. He's a negligent father (surprise, surprise), he's in love with a woman who has many problems herself and most importantly, he is portrayed as very selfish. Other problems include rather awkward moments which completely ruin the feel of the film. For example, there's a scene where he tries to bond with his daughter. They both go into an abandoned building and, get ready for this, start randomly dancing with each other. That's just.... silly. Another scene has Randy and the stripper talking about how 80s music is great and how 90s music is the devil. The conversation goes something like 'I love 80s music!' 'Me too!' 'I hate 90s music!' 'Me too!' 'Let's make out now' 'Alright!' Uhh... yeah... not a very well thought out scene at all.Really, I just scratched the surface of what I don't like about this film. These are not the only deficiencies this film suffers from. Randy's 'depressing' life is sometimes just not depressing. And I'm not talking about the purposefully happy parts either. The excess use of nudity and blood seems kind of unnecessary. But the biggest, most glaring flaw of this film is that it is just not really enjoyable to watch. Sure, some parts are definitely intriguing, some scenes are shot very well, and some of the ideas aren't too bad, but overall there was nothing that captured me, made me want to like the characters, or just enjoy myself while watching the film. It was uncomfortable to watch at times (which I'm not sure if I should consider it a good trait), it was interesting and I can't say I was particularly bored at any point but there was nothing in the movie that made it seem 'good'. I don't think I'll ever understand the hype around Darren Aronofsky's films.",5,0,4,9 July 2011
Get Him to the Greek," Recycled, unfunny garbage
","Whatever happened to witty and smart comedy films like Monty Python, Airplane! and Spaceballs? They got replaced by films like this one that shouldn't appeal to any one over 13.What's wrong with this movie you ask? Everything. The plot, the characters, the 'humour', everything. Let's start with the plot. Some guy (who's exact job isn't made very clear in the movie) is supposed to get an 'out of control' rockstar to a concert. In doing so, 'hilarious' antics ensue which I will cover later in the review. What I hate about this plot is that the rockstar life is portrayed so negatively. Drugs, drinking, degradation of women. According to the movie, that's what rock n roll is all about. The music? Oh no, that has nothing to do with being a rockstar (OK, I'm exaggerating, but the music part is kept very minimal throughout the film). And of course, the film has the obligatory sappy part and a 'everything's fine and dandy' ending.As for the characters, they're all just so annoying! The main character, played by Jonah Hill, is an overweight, useless person who continues being everyone's welcome mat to wipe their feet on. His girlfriend, played by ... umm ... some random good looking chick, manages to be a busy surgeon and an obnoxious 'Oh.Em.Gee' teenager at the same time. Sean Diddy plays the boss, and is as much of a scumbag in this movie he probably is in real life. The rockstar, played by Russel Brand also makes me want tear my hair apart due to his extremely irritating 'I'm a rockstar and therefore better than you' attitude.The 'humour'. Where do I start? Barfing, pooping, drug use, overuse of alcohol, breast exposure and other forms of female degradation are common. Sean Diddy pulls out jokes which would be considered very racially insensitive if it wasn't for the fact he is black himself (I consider these jokes offensive anyway). Swearing is obviously very common and is never used in a humorous fashion. There are a lot of awkward moments in the film too which are supposed to be funny. But the filmmakers forgot one thing. If there is no humour applied to awkward moments, they are just that, awkward and not funny, not by a long stretch. Then there's this scene where the obligatory crazy chick takes out a dildo and rapes the main character. This is supposed to be hysterical, but I think any sane person will find it awfully disturbing more than anything. The only somewhat redeemable joke was the little Lars Ulrich/Napster reference. But that doesn't make up for the fact that there is so much tasteless 'humour' and also the fact that Lars' cameo is pretty much wasted.This is a terrible film. An example of how much Hollywood has dumbed itself down, at least in terms of the comedy genre. But what's even sadder is, that most people have swallowed this as a good comedy flick. I'd honestly watch Epic Movie 60 times over in a row than call this a good movie. Yes, it's that bad.",1,14,33,13 October 2010
The Ugly Truth," Predictabality destroyed it
","Here we go again. Another one of those movies that have been done a bazillion times already. Granted, it had it's funny bits but overall the whole thing just felt so darn clichéd.So here's the basic storyline. A pretentious woman looking for true, passionate love and a guy who's a complete jerk and believes men only care about looks of a woman, hate each other. But wait, what's this? After a bunch of random bullcrap they end up together! Did you see that coming? I mean, who would've thought? Oh right, just about anyone who's seen romantic comedies before. Yes, just kill any shred of potential this movie had by destroying the plot line and making it generic romcom ending no.992. Most other characters excluding these 2 are basically props and add nothing to the story. The basic argument of the whole movie is 'men are afraid of love' and 'women are control freaks'. Ah, just shut the hell up with your dumb morals and just give us a decent funny movie. Oh, that can't happen because just about everything in Hollywood has to go by the dumb rulebook. Yes, never try to be original, always repeat what has been done and be very predictable.Like I said before, some of the jokes are good but most of them have been already done so they felt pretty bland. Even in the good jokes, none really stood out. This is a very forgettable movie and is definitely not worth watching because of a few decent jokes. Unless you're a big romcom buff, avoid. That's the real ugly truth.",4,1,2,7 February 2010
The Runaways," Just another one
","I don't know much about The Runaways, other than the fact that they were an all girl rock band from the mid 70s. As a person who likes rock music in general, I was drawn towards this film. So now that I got to see it, this is nothing more than a generic rock n roll film.I don't think you need any further explanation if you've seen a few films of the same type. But if you haven't, here's what the content mainly consists of. Sex. Yep lots of that. Band members doing it with random people and even with each other. And drugs, obviously. They'll smoke (I consider cigs a drug), snort coke, drink even though they're underage, take pills and all that stuff. A very retarded thing is how they managed to smuggle tons of drugs onto a Japanese airline. It's really hard to believe considering that was an international flight.Another dumb thing about this film is how everything fall conveniently into place. Want a manager? Oh, there he is, on the other side of the street. Don't have any members for your all girl band? Take 2 paces to the left and there's your female drummer. Go to the right corner of the bar and there's your female vocalist. Other members will just appear magically. They get popular in what, 2 days? That's what it felt like anyway. And due to the cliché rock n roll unhealthy lifestyle and the oh-so-mean manager, the band falls apart towards the end.I don't know how much of this is actually based on truth. As Joan Jett was part of the production, I'd say a good amount. But the crap is just so hard to swallow. With the exception of the central characters the acting is quite stiff. Whatever, the only real redeemable thing about the whole movie was the decent music. Sure it was a bit entertaining, but as a person who is not familiar with the band, I don't have a good impression of them. I wonder when Hollywood will actually make a film that actually discovers the positive side of rock n roll, like the loyal fans, the ideologies and I don't know, the MUSIC perhaps?",3,2,5,4 August 2010
The Breakfast Club," Bleh
","So this is it? One of the most acclaimed and praised movies of the 80s? This?! I'm not sure I'm watching the same movie as all these folks so positive about this one.It tries to be very deep an meaningful but to be honest, it really goes nowhere. We have a pretentious bully, a spoilt daddy's girl, sports guy, a nerd and of course, a retard all in detention. What happens throughout the movie? In the beginning, they just have random scuffles with one another. And later, they open up to each other and basically talk and rant about their incredibly clichéd teenage problems. Hmmm, didn't you guys hate each other like 2 seconds ago? And then there's the stupid note, which is also supposed to be very in depth, towards the teacher who put them in detention which reads: 'You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct?' Yeah, and even after the movie is over I see you as the exact same people, except perhaps the bully, who was also probably the only interesting guy in the whole movie but his character too was ruined towards the end. And, there is a scene where all of these idiots start dancing to synth rock music for no reason inside the school. How the hell did they find rock music inside the school while in detention anyway? Plus, the ending is completely idiotic and unbelievable.The worst thing about the movie is that I don't feel anything for any of the students. I mean, they could've dropped dead any second in the movie and I wouldn't have given a rat's ass. As this is a drama, we're actually supposed to feel for them in at least one way or another. Well, I didn't. And it's not that I have a stone cold heart. The last scene of 'Up' put me on the verge of tears. I fail to see why this movie couldn't do something that would make most people feel emotionally attached to the characters.Even if the overall idea of the movie isn't that bad, the execution seems completely terrible to me. The acting, cinematography etc. might be good but the overall plot does not come together well at all.",3,11,22,20 December 2009
The Proposal," A good idea ruined by romcom conventions
","There seem to be tons and tons of generic romantic comedies out there nowadays. Most of them have the same basic storyline and the 'comedy' is pretty dry. This movie, however, is different. When I read the plot I though to myself 'Here we go again'. However, I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. It has many parts that made me smile, even laugh. The acting, the production, the cinematography, it's all very neat and polished. But what exactly went wrong with this? Well, with all the unconventional humour found in the movie, I did not expect the movie to succumb to usual romcom clichés and such. But towards to end of the movie, it pretty much became like every other romcom. The movie became very less funny, there was too much emphasis on the romance and the ending is completely predictable to anyone who has even watched a couple of romcoms. I already knew what the ending was going to be when I read the plot but when I saw the movie, I kept hoping that this one would defy the dumb rules of romcoms.Overall, this is a movie that starts out very promising but ends up very generic. When will movie makers realise that you do not need to stick to stupid rules to make a good movie? If you're a romcom fan, I'd definitely recommend it as it's probably the best I've seen in the genre, alongside 50 First Dates. If you're not a romcom fan, this is worth checking out but only if you have nothing better to do.",6,0,1,15 December 2009
Rock Star," Interesting beginning and a dull ending
","As the storyline of this movie is based on Judas Priest, my favourite band, I had to watch it. I had really high hopes for it. Did it meet my expectations? Unfortunately no.It starts off really well. A kid with lots of talent, whose dream is to be in his favourite band. His cover band gets attention by the his heroes and he is recruited as a replacement for their vocalist. Once in the band, he quickly gains fame and fandom and is loved by many. However, he also discovers the unhealthy ways of rock stars, including lots of partying, alcohol, drugs, random sex etc. His ideas and input are also rejected by the other band members. All this is portrayed quite well and the actors are really good at what they do (except Anniston perhaps, whose character I thought was mostly quite unnecessary and pointless).But the ending does not come together well at all. It's pretty unrealistic and very predictable. I expected it to be something really awesome as most of the movie was quite well thought out. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I think it would've been way better if he quit the band and joined/made a different hard rock/metal band where he could do whatever he wanted and avoid all the negative aspects of a rock star life and thus set a good example for future rock stars. Hey, look! I came up with a better ending already! Seriously, this movie could've been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the stupid ending.Overall, I think this is a movie worth checking out if you like movies about the rock star business. Just don't expect too much and end up bitterly disappointed like I did",6,1,1,19 December 2009
