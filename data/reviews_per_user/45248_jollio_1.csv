United 93," Let's Roll America
","This movie makes you feel as thought you are right there an eye witness to history, minute by minute but time seems to fly by really fast action. Don't blink are you will miss something. There you are sitting with them as life happens right in your face. Sometimes you are shocked and have to turn away and at other times you are bought to tears as you see people just like you and me pour their hearts in last goodbyes to loved ones. This is very much a family movie. Don't miss this and never forget these terrorists really want to kill all non believers or die trying. See you all there,fellow Americans. I believe we all need to be reminded over and over. Just like Texans need to remember the Alamo and all remember July 4th it is what makes us whole complete Americans. May the one true God Bless America and rid the world of all evil.",10,3,7,30 April 2006
