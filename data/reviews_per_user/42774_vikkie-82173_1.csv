It," You'll Float Too!!
","I love this version of the book. It stayed close to the TV mini-series from 1990 but made it more accurate to the time line because the actors were acting like the kids in the book and the kids of that era. (the TV mini-series could not do that because of the 1990 prime time FCC rules of language).Some people don't like the CGI but those people should have read the 1000 plus page hard book version that Stephan King wrote decades ago and then watch the TV mini series and then realize this is how King would want the movie to be.Since the announcement is out, there is a chapter two for IT. I found this out after seeing this movie and after watching at least 90 minutes. There is no way this awesome movie could be made in 2 hours and 15 minutes. At least to do it justice.Right before the movie was to display the credits it put IT on the screen in the scary type-style an the CHAPTER ONE appeared. I CANNOT WAIT. There is not even anything on IMDb.COM about this until the movie was out or a full week. This movie made genre records for opening weekend.I know it is the time for creepy and horror movies but this is different. Not the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies. Stephan King NOVELS are awesome!!!! Check out the NOVELS online our in the library.",10,6,12,15 September 2017
