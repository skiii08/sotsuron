Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Best Film of 2004
","Kill Bill: Vol.2 is the best film of 2004. Uma Thurman does a good job, Daryl Hannah does a good job, Michael Madsen does a good job and of course David Carridine does a good job. Kill Bill: Vol.2 is better than Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator. Quentin Tarantino should have an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director. This movie is better than Kill Bill: Vol.1. This movie has action and humor. This is Uma Thurman's best movie. I agree with Richard Roeper I think David Carridine should have got nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This is a fun movie to watch. My favorite movie of all time is Pulp Fiction another Tarantino film.",10,3,6,4 July 2006
Minority Report," Steven Spielberg's Worst Movie
",I can't believe Steven Spielberg directed this horrible movie. The following stupid parts of this movie are when Tom Cruise is escaping from the Mag Loc and he falls through a window and he falls into a Yoga Class and their in in the same position as he is and the other stupid part is when he has a bandage over his eyes and then a Cops Commercial appears and then they have a picture of John Anderton. Normally I like Tom Crise and Steven Spielberg but this is different. The creepy parts are when John Anderton gets his new eyes and his wife carries around his old eyes. This is a stupid movie because the script was not well written.,1,5,11,29 January 2006
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts Best
","Erin Brockovich is Julia Roberts best performance.I think Steven Soderberge directed this movie well. The writing is good. Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her performance as Erin Brockovich. The first time I saw Julia Roberts was Flatliners, then I saw her in Hook and I finally saw her in Pretty Woman. Her first film she did was Mystic Pizza. I have never seen it. I think Albert Finney did a good job. I like the cinematography. This is one of Steven Soderberge's best films. I hope Julia Roberts keeps getting better roles. She is one of the best actresses. This movie grew on me. The screenplay uses a lot of numbers. I think Julia Roberts is hot in this movie.",10,1,3,30 January 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Better Than The First One
","This movie is better than the first one. It had great action and humor. Dead Man's Chest had great sound and special effects.

I saw this movie in the theatres. This movie had more humor than the first one. I liked the acting, sets, costumes, and music. This movie is over the top. I think Keira Knightly is hot.

Being John Malkovich," Original Movie
","Being John Malkovich is an original movie. This movie has great humor. John Cusack did a good job, Cameron Diaz did a good job, Catherine Keener did a good job and John Malkovich did a good job. This is one of the best movies of 1999. American Beauty beats this movie. This movie is so imaginative. This movie got nominated for 3 Oscars: Best Director - Spike Jonze, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress. I could not hardly realize that was Cameron Diaz. John Cusack was hard to recognize too. This movie had great acting, directing, cinematography, sets and script. This is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. I do not know why everybody hates this movie. The movie that came out later that is similar to this is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.",10,0,1,5 February 2007
Batman Begins," The Best Batman Movie Ever
","Batman Begins is the best Batman movie ever. Christopher Nolan does a good job directing this film. This movie got nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Christain Bale does a good job as Bruce Wayne, Katie Holmes does a good job as Rachael, and Michael Caine does a good job as Alfred. This movie has cool technology. I also like the sound. All of the other Batman movies are silly. I like the Batsuit and Batmobile. I also like the cave. I am surprised this did not get nominated for Besr Picture. This movie is a ride to watch. I think Christain Bale is the best Batman. I can not wait to see The Prestige hopefully it will be as good as Batman Begins.",10,1,1,7 September 2006
JFK," Oliver Stone's Best
",I think this is Oliver Stone's Best movie. This film is a masterpiece. This was my favorite movie in 1992. This film won two Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. This film should have won Best Picture over The Silence of the Lambs. This was Roger Ebert's #1 film of 1991 and I agree. Tommy Lee Jones got nominated for Best Supporting Actor. I am surprised Kevin Costner did not get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. The cinematography is great in this movie. I seen this movie a lot of times and I am still not tired of it. JFK is a beautiful film. I think Oliver Stone should have won for Best Director. JFK is 10 times better than The Silence of the Lambs was.,Null,0,10,26 April 2006
Schindler's List," Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece
",Schindler's List is a great film.Even though it is a graphic telling of the Holocaust. I think Liam Neeson should have won for Best Actor.I still think Tommy Lee Jones deserves his Oscar for The Fugitive. Don't get me wrong I still think Ralph Fiennes did a great performance. I think this is Steven Spielberg's best work. I think the Cinematography is great. This movie was filmed in Poland. I'm glad Steven Spielberg shot this movie in Black & White. Schindler's List is better than Saving Private Ryan. I am so glad Steven Spielberg won Best Director for this movie. People who hate this movie do not know what a good movie is.,10,11,16,29 January 2006

I think Heath Ledger has a great performance as The Joker. There are a few creepy scenes. This Batman film kept my interest through the whole movie and most Batman movies do not. I liked the technology of this film. The Dark Knight is my favorite movie of this year. I think Christopher Nolen did a great job directing this movie he has out done himself. This movie is even better than Batman Begins. I will definitely own this movie when it comes out on DVD.,10,2,5,20 July 2008

Total Recall," Arnold Schwarzenneger's Best
","Total Recall is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie. Total Recall got cut to avoid an X rating. This is a very violent movie. The story still is confusing though. Paul Verhoeven did a good job. This movie also features a then unknown Sharon Stone. Ronny Cox was good as the villain. The technology is cool in this movie. The acting is top notch. I can not wait to see the unrated version the way Paul Verhoeven meant it to be seen. I have seen the unrated versions of Basic Instinct, Robocop, and Flesh + Blood. Later I bought the cut versions and I noticed how much they actually cut out. I like comparing the R rated versions to the unrated versions. I just recently saw the cut version of Robocop and noticed how different it was to the unrated version.",10,1,2,15 May 2006

","The first time I saw War of the Worlds I was blown away. I think the script is good, great special effects, good acting, good directing, and great sound. This is 10 times better than Minority Report. This is one of the better Steven Spielberg films. I think Steven Spielberg had a slump during Saving Private Ryan through Minority Report. He got back on track with Catch Me If You Can. I think the aliens are better in War of the Worlds than Independence Day. I hope this movie gets nominated for an Oscar. War of the Worlds is what Minority Report should have been. My only complaint I had with War of the Worlds is no mention of God.",10,2,4,29 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best Star Wars Movie Ever Made
",Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie ever made. This movie is better than the previous Star Wars movies. I thought the sound was good in this movie and it did not even get nominated for an Academy Award. Revenge of the Sith makes you understand the Star Wars story even more. This movie had great special effects. This was the first Star Wars movie to get a PG-13 rating because the others were rated PG. This is the most emotional Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I also like the action. Hayden Christensen does a good job as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. The performance that really sticks out in this movie is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wain Kenobi. The directing in this movie is top notch. I am surprised George Lucas did not win for Best Director.,10,0,2,13 May 2006

Star Wars won Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction and Best Original Score and it deserved all of its Oscars.

I think Harrison Ford did a good job, Carrie Fisher did a good job, Mark Hammill did a good job and Alec Guinness did a good job. I think this film has great sound. I wish Star Wars beat Annie Hall for Best Picture. The only way to see it is in Widescreen. When you see it cropped you do not get the whole experience.",10,0,0,18 January 2007
The Thin Red Line," The Best World War II Movie Ever

This movie has great acting, great script, great cinematography, great sets, and great directing. This movie has an all star cast including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, Jim Cavisal, Dash Minock, Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly. I think Terrence Malick should have won for Best Director instead of Steven Spielberg. This movie is not stupid like Saving Private Ryan is. I hope Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima are as good as The Thin Red Line. This movie is similar to Saving Private Ryan but it is better. It must be similar because it is about World War II.",10,1,2,15 January 2007
Jackie Brown," A Fun Ride
","Jackie Brown is a fun ride to watch. Samuel L. Jackson is good, Pam Grier is good, Bridget Fonda is good, Robert De Niro is good and Robert Forester is good. Robert Forester got nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Max Cherry. This movie has good humor too. The violence is not as graphic as Pulp Fiction. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away. I own all of Quentin Tarantino's films. This movie is as good as Pulp Fiction if not better. This is one of Tarantino's best films.

I think this movie has the best Lightsaber duel ever. I also like the music. This movie won an Oscar for Best Sound. This movie has more character development than the other Star Wars films. The special effects are even better than the first one. I think this is Darth Vader's most sinister role of any of the other Star Wars movies. Secrets will be unfolded. I think Irvin Kershner did a great job directing this one. This is the order of the original Star Wars Trilogy: 1. The Empire Strikes Back 2. Star Wars 3. Return of the Jedi. This is the best acted of all of the Star Wars movies.,10,1,2,13 September 2006
Sin City," The Best Film of 2005
","Sin City is the best film of 2005. Sin City has both action and humor. The cinematography is great, the acting is great, the sets are incredible and it is written well. I think this movie should have won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and not Brokeback Mountain. Bruce Willis does a good job, Jessica Alba does a good job, Mickey Rourke does a good job and Rosario Dawson does a good job. The movie is shot in Black & White with hints of color in it. This movie was cut to avoid an NC-17 rating at least I think. I hope I am right about this. This movie is disturbing. This movie is also powerful. This is Bruce Willis's best film.",10,0,1,1 July 2006
True Romance," Tony Scott's Best
","True Romance is Tony Scott's best film. This was my favorite movie in 1994. The film was written by Quentin Tarantino. It is better to get the unrated version than the R rated version.
