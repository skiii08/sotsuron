Walk the Line," Thoroughly enjoyable!
","I thought Reese Witherspoon did a remarkable job in her role as June Carter. And she can SING!That was the most delightful discovery about her performance in Walk the Line. She did a credible job, even if she took few risks with her role. In fact, hers was probably one of the least demanding roles in the film. The risk-taker in this one is, hands down, Joaquin Phoenix. He said he knew nothing about picking a guitar and never sang before in his life. He was terrified, by his own account and worked really hard to develop his character.He succeeded wonderfully well! There is a temptation to compare this film to last year's RAY. Don't give in to it. RAY was a traditional biopic, this was, at it's very heart, a love story. The trauma of his brother's death left a deep scar on Cash's family and stunted his relationship with is father. Even as he achieved greater success, there was always the gnawing desire to win the approval of a hard, bitter man. His father's emotional abuse and menacing behavior informed Cash's actions, including his pursuit of June, even more than he was willing to acknowledge. She was the love of his life, from the moment he heard her perky voice on the radio as a child until the day he died, four months after her passing. The consummation of that love affair was a healing experience. It was, in truth his rescue. If you approach this film expecting something like RAY, you will be disappointed. If you approach it as the love story it truly is, you will be delighted. Joaquin deserves an Oscar nomination.",9,1,3,23 November 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," 'You got it right.'
","I don't know where to begin. If one judges a film by its ability to literally transport the viewer to another time and place, this film succeeds. If one judges a film by the cinematography, the composition of the scenes, whether the characterizations are well drawn, this film succeeds. If one judges a film's merits on integrity, truthfulness, honesty, this film succeeds. Good Night and Good Luck captures a moment in time.We look back on the fifties as a simpler time, our period of innocence. This film tells us straight and true that it was no simpler and no more innocent than our lives today.In fact, the sharpest contrast drawn between today and back then is the intelligence and the literacy, the erudition and the commitment to the tenets of good journalism of Edward R. Murrow and his crew.I cannot picture a Brian Williams or anyone else telling the owner of the network, as Murrow tells Bill Paley, 'I can't make it to the game tonight. Thanks for inviting me, but I'm busy tearing down your network.' A flawlessly executed film, the acting ensemble well cast, the point clearly and eloquently made, this film should be nominated for an Oscar, a Golden Globe and anything else that's out there. Thank you George Clooney. Your father is correct. 'You got it right.' Thank you Steven Soderburgh. Thank you, Mr. Murrow.",10,315,366,15 October 2005
