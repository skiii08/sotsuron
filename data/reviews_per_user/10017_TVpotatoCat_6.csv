Your Name.," Give it a try even if it sounds like not your style
","Oh man did I like this movie! It has everything I look for in a movie: an interesting plot, deep relatable characters, and an atmosphere that leaves a lasting impression for a long time.I heard about this movie a long time ago but the summery didn't sound interesting enough for me. I'm not a big fan of romance nor drama. I decided to eventually give it a try due to the quarantine, and it exceeded my expectations greatly.My only issue with the movie is that it starts slow and gives the impression of a simple romantic drama. I didn't mind much since it drew me more into the story and the character's life, but my husband was extremely bored, so I suppose it's not for everyone.But the plot twist in the middle! Wow! I didn't see it coming. I was at the end of my chair until the movie ended. I especially noticed that they kept the characters reactions not over the top like it's done in so many Animes, it gave a more realistic feeling and felt more like watching a movie and not a cartoon.
Also, the animation is amazing.This is a masterpiece. It's not often that I watch a movie and then still keep thinking about it a few hours later. Too bad you can't see this kind of depth in Hollywood movies that have a much bigger budget.",9,0,0,26 April 2020
The Shape of Water," I really liked this movie
",A movie first of all is supposed to be telling a human story and this movie does so wonderfully. They somehow managed to show character's depth and development in one movie equal to what can only been seen in books. I really don't understand the negative comments. The characters were so believable and complex that the story didn't get out of my head even a few days after watching it.,10,6,10,5 May 2018
Joker," I would not call it a masterpiece as some did
","There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.",7,965,1410,15 October 2019
What We Do in the Shadows," A good watch for a relaxed evening
","This is a fun and amusing movie. It has some gore in it but that doesn't damage the overall light feeling this movie gives.It portrays the inhuman characters in a very human way, a thing that many other movies and series tried but failed, you can't but to sympathize with them as they address the daily issues many of us experiencing without being vampires: new roommates, finding your place, dealing with changes.It really gives a different feeling than all the modern Hollywood films which are focusing on action and drama. I enjoyed watching it.",9,1,2,14 May 2016
Warcraft," A fantasy comes to life
","I'll start by saying that I'm a big World of Warcraft fan. I played the game for years and this is why I'm aware that I'm probably biased. I loved this movie! It was amazing to see the game come alive. Stormwind city, the portal, the giant wolves, the Gryphon and most of all: The Orcs! It was amazing to see them 'real'! Terrifying, and huge! I wouldn't want to stand in front of one. And now about the plot: The movie has a good story, it has depth, it's about telling a story and not only about showing special effects as it is with so many other movies that has abundance of special effects. In the end I was surprised at how much I loved this movie since my expectations weren't high. The story had some heart breaking moments, it had amusing moments. It managed to show the emotional side in the conflict between humans and orcs. The Alliance and the Hord. A war is not made only of armies but also of individuals who had to make some hard decisions. What I liked less about the movie: Even me, who is familiar with the game, had to struggle in some points to follow the plot. I don't know how the experience is for people who are not familiar with it. I assume that if I came there with no previous knowledge I would have been very confused. The second thing I liked less is that the humans were portrayed too honorable and good for the humans' nature. People in power had to make some difficult decisions in difficult times but none of them were driven by personal motives. I found it not very realistic but I suppose that the creators were simply following the plot line of the game.",9,2,3,12 June 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," One of the worst
","When the film was still in the cinema the movie had a 7 and something rating on IMDb. Add it to the fact that the producer promised that this movie will be better than the failed second one I decided to spend my money in hopes it'll be a pleasant experience. It's a very pleasant experience if you consider sleeping to be so pleasant you're willing to pay for it. It was actually the first time in my life that I almost fell asleep in the cinema.This movie is simply ridiculous. And what is more ridiculous that there were people over the age of 15 who liked this movie. Actually I wouldn't even call it a movie. For my best understanding a movie has to have a plot. This excuse of a movie had no plot. Or maybe it had one but it was long lost between all the explosions and fight scenes.A movie is supposed to be a way to tell a story and play on the viewer's emotions: drama, comedy, action and so on. But someone decided to replace this with special effects. This movie was not made for the sake of telling a story, this movie was made for the sake of showing explosions, fight scenes with giant robots and buildings being destroyed.Seeing that this 'movie' actually had a profit makes me think we're on to a future presented in 'Idiocracy'. This 'movie' didn't have a plot nor deepness, or believable characters. Or maybe it had some of it (though I'm sure there wasn't any deepness), but it was such a small part that personally I didn't notice it between all the explosions.I regret wasting my hard earned money on something that shouldn't have been in the cinema from the beginning.",1,0,3,27 June 2014
