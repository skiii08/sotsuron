The Avengers," Avengers is a landmark Marvel film with the effects to match.
","Good: Incredible special effects, action sequences, and just a thrilling ride throughout. Robert Downey Jr. is a great actor with lots of charisma, and I don't even like Iron Man. Captain America has a lot of appeal as well. Banner is good too. What this movie lacks in serious depth it makes up in acting and aesthetics.Bad: As usual of Marvel films, the humor is misplaced and at times excessive. It makes the film lose it's seriousness and the sequences are no longer gripping. And that scene where Hulk randomly smacks Thor. Is that supposed to be humorous? It makes no sense whatsoever and adds nothing to the plot.Verdict: I would definitely recommend it. It's just a enjoyable film to watch.",8,0,2,23 May 2016
Ip Man," The story is just as powerful as Ip Man's fighting.
","Highs: Incredibly thrilling. I went to see Ip Man with high expectations, with it being Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung and all, and I was blown away by the fantastic choreography, the thrilling speed and skill shown by the fighters, and the superbly portrayed antagonist and protagonist. Lows: It is a bit of a propaganda film, but it's Chinese and takes place in WW2. We have all sorts of acclaimed propaganda films in America too, like Saving Private Ryan, Zero Dark Thirty, etc. There's zero issues with the portrayal of Japan in this case, since it's a war film.Verdict: Go see it. It's an R-rated movie, but a tame one at that.Some scenes might be a bit hard to stomach though, because the violence does get a bit gruesome (bones breaking, pools of blood, etc.) but nowhere near many other R-films I have watched.",10,1,1,26 May 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Big buck blockbuster bares banal bearings but not yet boring.
","Good: Action scenes were great, along with the stunning visual effects. For a Marvel movie, there's no surprise there.Bad: Some of the action was repetitive and kinda dumb. A bunch of minions fighting the Avengers led by a big mastermind? Where have we seen that before? Banal might be too strong of a word (that was just for the sake of alliteration) but it sure approaches it. The character development is obviously lacking, and so is depth. Humor is a bit cheesy, and while I did laugh along with the audience it just doesn't fit. There is not a sense of seriousness to the fight, which is why I tend to prefer DC movies.Verdict: I did enjoy the movie. Not saying I didn't. But it is just not gripping at all. If you haven't watched it yet I would recommend you see it but I'm not gonna watch it more than once.",7,1,3,23 May 2016
The Dark Knight," The best of the trilogy, and that's saying a lot.
","Good: Superb action with gripping fight sequences. The interrogation chamber was chilling and held me to my seat. Just the right amount of dark humour that is beautifully portrayed by the late Heath Ledger. Ledger really is a great actor. Bale was good too, but he really falls under the shadow in the Dark Knight. Incredibly resounding and deep.Bad: Joker's plan is a little bit too intricate when analyzed. It requires too much to fit together to work. And of course, the voice. Bale's voice is not what I think Batman should sound like.Verdict: See it once, twice, or more. I generally dislike putting 10/10 or 1/1 but this deserves it.",10,0,1,23 May 2016
Happy Feet," Penguin pointed plot paints a passing picture.
","Good: The animation is good. It was semi-3D and quite fluid. The plot by itself is not a bad concept either. I liked the idea as a whole. The singing is moving in some instances, and uplifting in others. The water and massive icebergs gave you a sense of awe that is always welcome in any movie.Bad: The concept has lots of flaws. Like the entire 'penguin communicating with tapping' thing. That's not what penguins do. The entire film is surrounded around a human deus ex machina which perfectly solves everything just because the penguins can tap dance. That's the thing I hate about animal movies. If animals really were as smart as humans they would've taken over long ago. Verdict: Go watch it with your kids or whatever. it's not bad.",7,1,1,23 May 2016
