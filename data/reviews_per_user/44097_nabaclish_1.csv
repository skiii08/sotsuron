Marie Antoinette," Costume Pic!
","Really great cinematography; beautifully shot. The acting was superb... conveying emotions with expressions and gestures; there weren't that many lines in the movie, but the story and character development was still very easy to follow.My only complaint was that the spoken parts was very hard to hear at times, but I do love the realistic dialog and the 'fly on the wall in Versailles' perspective that the audience gets.Kirsten Dunst really shines in this historical piece. When outlandish fashions and extremely formal customs of 1700s France bewilder and annoy Marie Antoinette upon her arrival to the French court, the audience can totally sympathize with her isolation and alienation. We feel happy when she finally begins to fit in, and sorry for her when she runs into challenges with her marriage. The blend of modern music with Renaissance was very refreshing. Not quite as jolting as the soundtrack in _A Knights Tale_, but more easily to identify with then a completely harpsichord and opera-laden period piece.",9,1,7,11 November 2006
