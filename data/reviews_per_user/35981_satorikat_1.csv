The New World," Not Impressed...
","Maybe its just me, but I think I'm probably not alone.The New World, to sum it up, was like a bad historical romance novel without the sex. It was tedious and boring and the music about drove me insane(it was very loud and obnoxious). I didn't like the portrayal of the Native Americans, they seemed very 'flighty', and not very true to life.I really just didn't understand the appeal, and neither did my husband. There wasn't enough romance to call it a real romance movie, there wasn't enough action to call it an action movie, and there wasn't enough realistic history to call it a historical drama. In fact, the only reason we finished it was because we thought it was going to end sooner than it did, and by the time we realized we had another 30 minutes left we figured 'what the hell?'.I wouldn't recommend this to movie to anyone looking for an entertaining evening.",4,1,5,14 May 2006
