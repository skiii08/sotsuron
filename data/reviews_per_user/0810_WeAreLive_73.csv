The Avengers," Avengers Assemble
",The Avengers is one of my favourite Marvel movies from the MCU. I have watched this movie like twice first time was on DVD and the second time was on Channel 4 in the UK.The acting was good.The Camera movement was good.The Special Effects were good. Overall I would check it out.I won't spoil any plots or details.,10,3,4,6 April 2018
Howl's Moving Castle," Howl's Moving Castle
","Sophie is a young woman who works at a hat shop, she meets this strange man (Howel) who escorts her away from two men. Then she arrives home and gets cursed by a witch to look from young and beautiful to old and wrinkly. She, runs away meets this turnip head scarecrow and finds this castle which is on two legs and is run by a talking flame and some young boy who we have zero background over.The dub by disney was pretty good plus it was nice seen Christian Bale in a dubbing movie and go Batman. Same with Josh Hutcherson (who is on the recent Ultraman dub by Netflix) everyone else including Billy Crystal, Jean Simmons, Emily Mortimer and Lauren Bacall.I had been planning to watch this movie for quite a while especially since there were references to this movie I came across like in an episode of ben 10 Omniverse and when the castle itself made a small came in an episode of Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan. I have reviewed both shows.While it is not my favourite film by Miyazaki but I still like it.",7,0,1,5 July 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Better then the first one
","Yeah, you heard me better than the first one. As I have mentioned in my review in The Hulk. It had terrible special effects and bad acting this one changes all of that because the new actors did better and it wasn't just some cheesy special effects but more realistic. My favorite scene is the fight between The Hulk and the Abomination. However what never made any sense was why was Tony Stark talking to General Ross in the post-credits. The overall good movie though.",8,0,0,23 October 2017
Your Name.," Not my type of anime movie but still good enough
","Yesterday I decided to finally get round and watch this movie. I have to say it was pretty decent for what it was but it could have been better if it wasn't so long and confusing.
Like how was one head ribbon making the boy and the girl switch places?
Why was the girls father a massive douche bag by just yelling at her for not walking properly. All of this time travel and them forgetting there names were just confusing. Why did the boy write 'I love you' on the girls hand instead of his name? The two main characters barely had chemistry or development with one another as they were rarely seen together.However the voice acting and animation to the movie was pretty good.
Even though there are a few dodgy scenes in the movie. Including a scene when the girl vomits rice in a bowl and when the boy drinks the girls spit. It should have been 1 hour 30 minutes instead and watching a video of a bulldog summarises this whole movie in 13 seconds. Not saying Your Name is a bad movie or anything but it's definitely not an award winning either. I don't hate the movie I am just indiffrent to it. Good day!",7,1,3,13 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The beginning of the force
",This would be the first episode in terms of chronologically for those who are new to the star wars franchise or are going to watch the movies.This movie starts off with Obi Won Kenobi as teenager and his teacher Qui-Gon Jin are going to the negotiation with the trade federation. We are then introduced to the infamous Jar Jar Binks who later joins.This movie also explains what was Anakin's slave life like before he was recruited as a padawan and was trained by Obi Won Kenobi. The movie had good acting and special effects.This an excellent beginning in chronology to the world of star wars.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.,7,0,0,3 August 2018
Iron Man 3," I think we need to jump the shark again
",I am sorry guys but I personally think Iron Man 3 isn't as good as the other Iron Man movies. In Fact it is probably the weakest in the whole of the MCU film series.The movie as a whole just felt boring even my uncle who I went to see it with wasn't too proud. For example when pepper is about to fall to her death in an area filled with fire but Tony doesn't catch her in time. My question is how did she survive that? The goods to come out of this movie was the different armors of Iron Man.You are welcome to watch this movie since you need to watch them in order but in my opinion this isn't as good and you might be disappointed.,4,0,3,12 March 2018
Akira," Happy new year
","The story is set 30 years later in Japan at the time it was made, it shows a possible future what could happen this year. The film was made in 1989 but the setting is in 2019.Kanada and his gang of bikers get involved in stopping biker gangs which leads to their friend Tetsuo to be in a creepy hospital like area where they treat him and he has these illusions because of these three kids who also operated by the same people they look like senior/mid aged people but they are actually kids.This is good way to get introduced to the mature side of anime, as it has a lot of gore, mild nudity and lots of strong language. With of course mature themes, I normally don't like anime which has too much gore, horror or nudity but this was actually really good.There are two dubs to the movie, the pioneer and the streamline dub. If you want to watch the dub I would I highly recommend the pioneer dub as with the streamline dub there was a lot of mistranslation, miscasts and of course dialogue changes . If you see any weeb reviews claiming the dub is bad please do me a favour and pay no attention to them because people like them just love to ruin anime for others and just think they are better then everyone else because they think their annoying japanese voices are so perfect. These people are the main reasons why I always stick to dubs.We have a perfect cast from the Pioneer dub with Johnny Yong Bosch as Kanada and Joshua Seth as Tetsuo they both fit their roles perfectly and we also have voice actors like Michelle Ruff, Michael Lindsey, Jamieson Price, Sandy Fox and former child voice actor Cody Mckenzie my only complaint was that they should have had another child voice actor to do one of the boys who were still kids at the time like Aaron Dismuke or Max Mittelman Borby wasn't bad or anything but they to create chemistry they should have had each of the kids with different voice actors with the exact gender. But Corby was a lot better then both Barbra Goodson and Bob Began as both kids since they were both adults trying to sound like younger boys but failed.As for the streamline I could only get through 45 minutes of it and other then Cam Clarke as Kanada I don't think anyone had a clue on how to voice their characters or were even given the right direction. Luckly, Barbara Goodson and Steve Kramer made up for it when they did additional voices for the pioneer dub.Overall if you want to get exposed to the mature side of anime I would high recomand this movie. It is big coincidence that this movie took place in 2019 and I am writing this review on the first day of 2019. Have a good year everyone.As for you BatmanFunReviews I thought you were a cool guy but I guess I was wrong.'I'm no fan of anime type of movies' then question then why do you even watch or reviews them. If there is tons of stuff out there for you to review. I just feel like you are just trolling.",8,0,0,1 January 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," One of the better movies from Disney/Star Wars
",Even though I still do disapprove of Disney and Star Wars having that merger. I really enjoyed this movie it was a good tie in to Episode 5 and it explains how the plans of the death star were saved.My favourite bit was that scene with Darth Vader not going to say which one thought.It had good acting.Good special effects.It is very promising to Star Wars fans.There will be reviews for Episode 7 and 8 I will be doing but they won't be friendly or positive whatsoever. There will be a review for Solo as well once when I have got round to see it.If you want an example of a good Disney Star Wars movie I would highly recommend Rogue One.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.,9,2,2,3 August 2018
Captain Marvel," Worst MCU movie I have ever seen.
","Honestly, this is the worst MCU I have ever watched. This is my fifth time now trying to get IMDB to accept my review. If they don't expect this one I am going to just give up reviewing this title.The movie takes place in the past when Carol was starting out as a pilot for the air force, then see runs into these kree shots this a car like box thing and gains powers. They are on a mission to stop the Skrulls.The movie felt like an attack from disney on Marvel fans and just felt like it was encouraging feminism. I am truly disappointed.Brie Larson's acting completely ruin the movie even Captain Marvel was just a Mary Sue. I am glad she never got too much screen time in Endgame.Look if you like this movie or if you are going to see it more power to you but you are going to be disappointed.",3,18,33,5 May 2019
Iron Man 2," Good introduction to Black Widow and Nick Fury
","Yet again we have another excellent Iron Man movie.We are introduced to both Black Widow and Nick Fury in this movie. The S.H.I.E.L.D spy/assassin and the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D for any who isn't familiar with these two characters.The best scanse are when Iron Man and War Machine fight each other at the party, when Nick Fury and Iron Man are having a talk at the Doughnut restaurant and when Black Widow suits up.Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy.However what doesn't make sense is how did Whiplash escape and what was he going to do next.But it was pretty good movie.",9,0,0,12 March 2018
Spider-Man 2," Tobey Maguire does it again
","This movie was another successful movie in this trilogy. Like I said with on my Spiderman 2002 review this movie is really good for the new generation of Spiderman fans. I watched this the following day after the first one and I really liked it. The acting was great this is probably one of my favorites projects by Alfred Molina. I laughed at the when James Jamieson dressed up as Spiderman in his office and he was doing posses. However, there is a scene that can terrify children when Dr. Octopus was in the hospital and his arms were moving.",10,1,4,7 October 2017
Batman Returns," Good but not as good as the previous one
","This film was good and it had a lot of action in but there were flaws in it.Most of the characters were gone from the previous film without any reason (Jim Gordan, Harvey Dent, and Viki Vale).The woman who played Selena Kyle was hot in this movie considering I wasn't born when this movie came out but a horrible miscast as Catwoman. The actor who played Penguin though was good.Like I said this movie was good but not Batman 1989 good.",6,5,15,19 September 2017
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Midcore at best
","Honestly, this isn't the best Wolverine movie I have watched it was just an okay one at best.However this movie did after all sort of explain how Wolverine was a weapon X-program and how his brother Sabertooth ended up going their own ways and one turning.Also what they hell did they do to Deadpool towards the end of the movie? He looked like a stuffed manakin.The rest of the movie was okay nethertheless.",5,1,1,4 August 2018
Aquaman," A dive in the oceans of atlantis
","I finally got round to seeing this movie today and it was absolutely amazing especially in 4D. Even though I defended Justice League last year looking back it was not as good as this masterpiece.Heck, this is possibly even better then anything (except for Infinity wars of course) that came out of the MCU the past year or so. I admit I was not a massive fan of Black Panther nor I enjoyed Ant-Man and the wasp that much.After the success of wonder woman 2017 and somewhat Man of Steel I am glad they are looking back at their products on how to make their movies better. Even if a small number of comic book nerds or marvel/mcu troll would not agree.On to the actual movie it self. It did a good job focusing the story more on Aquaman despite small changes but it still did a good job portraying it even if you are not familiar with aquaman.The script and the dialogues were pretty good. Acting wise it was good without having any over acting or getting too pretend as their roles. The casing of Jason Mamoa, Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, William Defoe, Temura Morrison and Nicole Kiddman was a very well done aswell.The CGI was really good for each scene both in and out of the water as well as the special effects.Overall this was an amazing movie and possibly my favourite I have seen this year.",10,0,2,6 January 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," A bit more childish compared to the other studio ghibli movies but it was still good
","Two young girls, 10-year-old Satsuki and her 4-year-old sister Mei, move into a house in the country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. Satsuki and Mei discover that the nearby forest is inhabited by magical creatures called Totoros (pronounced toe-toe-ro). They soon befriend these Totoros, and have several magical adventures.Like I said in the title even though I do find it a bit more childish compared to the other films I thought it was a fun watch especially with how cute totoro plus as i am quirented I have been watch quite a few studio ghibli films on Netflix. So expect reviews for those.The dub was also good, it was nice seeing Tim Daly (the voice of Superman) in an anime dub.Overall if you are looking for something for your kids to enjoy I highly recommend this film.",7,0,0,4 April 2020
Deadpool 2," With great powers comes even more irrsponsablity
","I just saw Deadpool 2 today on the plane today and it was pretty good. Although, the first one was better but second one was still fun to watch.The fight scenes were cool, the acting was good although I was disappointed that Ron Perlman never got the role but Josh Brolin did him just and its funny that he previously voiced thanos in Infinity Wars and will reprise him in the sequel. Spoiler ahead for a Thanos and a DC Universe joke in the movie.My favourite scene is when they are fighting a mutant boy and the scene with the X-Force jumping in.If you loved the first movie then you will love this one too so do check it out.",7,0,0,10 September 2018
X-Men," A good introduction to the X-Men
",This movie is about a young girl by the name of Rouge who first discovers her powers after taking a dose of her boyfriends energy. She is then taken to some fight club where she meets logan and then later on Professor X recutes her as an X-men member.This is a very good movie as it was the beginning of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stuarts careers as Logan and Charles Xavier.The acting was good and so was the camera angles and movements.If you like the X-men comics then you will enjoy this movie,10,0,0,4 August 2018
Spider-Man 3," I don't consider this film garbage
","I honestly, don't think this movie was bad at all I love how there were three (two later on in this film) villains in this film instead of one this time. I also laughed at a few scenes when Spiderman had the black suit on.I actually had a bit of a crush on Mary Jane when she was a waitress in this film even Gwen Stacy when she was on a date with Peter.Okay, this film even showed me to trust people and put what was in the past behind. For example, in this film, Spiderman was blamed by Harry that he killed his dad but it wasn't and Sandman killed Uncle Ben in this film.Like I said on my Spiderman and Spiderman 2 review this is a good film for the new generation of Spiderman fans. I really wish there was a Spiderman 4 if this movie wasn't so much hated. But don't listen to the bad reviews this is a good movie trust me.",10,1,2,7 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," A billion times better then Planet Hulk, Thor, Thor Dark Worlds and The Incredible Hulk put together
","This movie is truly an amazing experience to have especially if you are watching it in 4D. Both me and my dad went to see it at the Cinema on a Friday night and we both enjoyed it.Thor Ragnarok is definitely a fun film for both kids and adults to watch. The effects were awesome.The acting was good.The story was amazing. The best scenes are when Thor fights Surter (Clancy Brown) at the beginning of the movie, the fight scene with Thor and the Hulk and the final battle especially since we see Hulk fight a wolf. Overall awesome movie if you haven't seen it yet. Stop reading my review and go watch it.",10,1,5,23 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Tom Holland out shines both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.
",It's without a doubt that Tom Holland official became my favourite Spider-Man actor after this movie. If you enjoyed his performance in Captain America Civil War you will love his performance in this movie. Though my only annoyance is that Tony gave him a suit to use but he never made one for himself and the fact that he was mentoring him throughout the movie. Another thing which is a massive annoyance is that Peter Parker seems to hate Captain America despite the fact he claimed in the previous movie he is a big fan of him. The best scene is when the Vulture and Spiderman are having there final fight.It was nice seeing Michael Keaton in a Marvel movie after doing Batman back in the late 80's/90's it was a nice change. Overall awesome movie.,10,34,57,13 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The force is strong within this movie
","This is the last movie of the original trilogy. After the events of The Empire Strike we see Han Solo in his carbon frozen form hanging in Jabba's palace then Luke and Leia come to his rescue. But Jabba makes Leia his pet and Luke and Han fight the bounty hunters while being entertained by dancing Tew'ieks.Later, we are introduced to the Ewoks on Tattonen who rescue Leia and join the fight to stop the separatists. Meanwhile Luke goes off to deal with his father and the Palpatine. But we see massive turning point in this battle not going to say what though....This was an end to a good and classic original trilogy. I would recommend it to anyone even people who weren't even born of this era to watch it.Have a good day and may the force be with you.",10,1,2,3 August 2018
Suicide Squad," Two Words: Not Impressed
","This movie could have been better if there was more action involved in the film then talking and if we would have seen Batman in more scenes. The only time we see him is when he is fighting Deadshot, stopping Harley Quinn and Joker and when he is talking to Amanda Waller. The acting was good in the film I think the acting was good in the film though Margot Robbie and Will Smith were excellent as Harley Quinn and Deadshot. But my main problem was The Joker in the film. I think Jarad Leto was a miscast as the role he is nothing like Jack Nicolson or Heather Ledger.",3,0,0,29 August 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Better then The First Avenger
",Honestly I think this one is 10X better then the first one. We know that Bucky is alive and was programed later on to become weapon known as the Winter Soldier.The best scenes are when Cap and bucky have a fight on the road and on the landing bay at SHIELD. When Arnim Zola triggers a bomb in the lab and destroyed the building and when Steve takes the elevator but gets attacked by agents.Samuel L Jackson definitely improved as Nick Fury in this movie and it turned out that his eye patch had a tracer or boob in it I can't remember why he burned it.Overall awesome movie 10/10,10,0,0,15 March 2018
Doctor Strange," An excellent introduction to Doctor Strange
","I went to see Doctor Strange on my 17th birthday since I had an option for what I wanted to do and.....(continue to next paragraph)==Warning I have taken two paragraphs from another persons review==Watching this in theaters with the sometimes too-loud sound, seeing the buildings and streets give way and rotate and otherwise bend themselves completely to a person's whim, immediately made me think of Inception. But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real. However it was if you watch it in 4D you would enjoy it.Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.Bennadict Combabatch was an excellent choice for the sources supreme and also as the voice of Dormammu.However the race/gender change for Baron Mordo and The Ancient One was weird but still good.
The best scenes are when Dr Strange goes up against Dormammu and says 'Dormammu I have come to bargain' But Dormammu replies 'YOU HAVE COME TO DIE!!' There is more to this I could talk about but I am going to let you watch it for you self.",10,0,1,21 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disney will you ever learn?
","Before I begin my rant just a small reminder for those who are watch the movies in chronological order this is the ninth movie and it takes place after The Last Jedi.There maybe a lot of spoilers in this review.I gotta agree with the top review that Star Wars has always been about good storytelling and here it does not feel like any of it exists. First off I admit I was looking forward to the emperor's return. But here is a question: How the hell does he survive his battle with Anakin and Luke after they killed him in episode 6? Why even include him if you are not going to explain this?As for the good i admit they finally knew how a lightsaber works, the choreography was pretty decent and the effects were good. Also I am glad they only gave Rose a cameo because you have no idea how much of a terrible character she was.Now for the bad the story makes absolutely no sense at all like Rey's training and these weird force responses with kylo renn she had been having .Other things such as apparently snoke was created by the Emperor and some how had these clones which make no sense at all. Snoke was supposed to be the main villain in this trilogy but they decided to do damage control at the last minute and bring him back (facepalm). Majority of this movie is filled with nothing but scenes that make me cringe or made zero sense to the Star Wars canon. I admit it was nice seeing Poe, Rey and Finn work together but that still does not make me care any less about them as characters. Plus I just can't believe that apparently Rey is the Emperors daughter. (Wait the he had kids???) I guess it is a primary example of what happens when you cram two-four movies into one movie. It makes zero sense. Heck the original cast had zero screen time.
Here is the thing Disney if can't make good Star Wars movies and if you can't be asked to listen to fans but instead go by your twist agenda then here is what you should do sell the franchise and get rid of Killer Kenedy. Heck, i had more enjoyment watching that one single 22 minute episode of Steins; Gate 0 (review coming soon) over this 2 hours trash.Overall this is yet another make believe movie by Disney that ripoff more ideas of the original trilogy. I have been a huge fan of Star Wars for the last 3 year I may have not grew up with originals or the prequels but I still watched them and they are the true star wars to me not this movie. Even my dad fell asleep in the cinema.Look I have said it before and I will say this again if you enjoy this movie or are going to watch it more power to you. But me personally I would stick by the original trilogy, the prequels, both clone wars cartoons and rebels. And if you want to check out something Disney Star Wars related Rouge One is the way to go and even though not many people would agree with me but Solo is pretty good as well.The sequel trilogy is nothing but garbage and something which shouldn't have existed and if you want to read my reviews for my other Star Wars related movies they are all on my profile.I might be here all day ranting about this movie but I am going to stop now.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.",3,12,23,27 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Transformers VS. Godzilla
","I liked the mind meld idea of the 2 pilots, and I thought they covered most bases explaining the technology behind the enormous robots (Jaegers) pretty well. It does have a few technical plot holes here and there, but the film does have a 'let's just get on with it' kind of feel. The alien creatures (Kaiju) are great and the robot v monster battles are superb. Towards the end the pace picks right up and the story starts to fall apart a bit, but by that point who cares? In general Pacific Rim is a fast paced, slick looking piece of techno-action that most Sci-Fi fans will enjoy. It's big, loud, dumb and very pretty, largely due to Guillermo Del Toro being at the helm.The movie does have cool fight scenes and pretty cool music which is always a plus.",7,0,0,8 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The clone wars
","Attack of the clones is the second movie after The Phantom Menace in chronological order and there is a long time skip between this and episode so beware of that.After the events of the Phantom Mences and the saddening death of Qui Gon Jin. We see an all grown up Anakin Skywalker with his Master Obi Won Kenobi go and investigate a case at a bar.Later on Obi Won Kenobi has gone on mission where he discovers a factory that makes clones and he also meets the original clone himself Jango Fett with his son Boba Fett. Meanwhile, Anakin is given an assignment to protect Padime the senator on mission but at the same time he gains feelings for her.We also introduced to The other clones, Count Dooku, The battle droids and many other characters.This was an excellent tie in to The Clone Wars animated shows (If there are anyone who watch that shows) as it showed events what happened after this movie. This movie and the series was good at explaining how Anakin is slowly turning evil. It's worth the watch.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.",10,1,2,3 August 2018
Ant-Man," Though its not the best Marvel movie but excellent introduction to Antman
","I would be honest Ant-Man isn't the best Marvel movie up to date but it was still amusing to watch since it had a lot of funny and memorable characters like the thugs (Scott's buddies) and that weird bunny (Tom Kenny). Paul Rudd,Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll were all pretty good as their characters.The best scene out of the whole movie is probably Falcon's cameo when Antman tries to escape S.H.I.E.L.D but Falcon blocks him and he has to fight him to get past him. Also the last fight scene with Yellowjacket was awesome and when he enters the microverse. However the post credits were useful since we get a sneak peak of Wasp's costume and Hope Pym would become the next Wasp which I am looking forward to in the upcoming Ant-Man and Wasp. Also one of the post credits does lead into Civil War since we see Sam and Steve visit Bucky.Overall good movie but not the best.",8,0,0,21 March 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Excellent introduction to captain america
","==Warning ahead I have taken a paragraph from someones review==Captain America: The First Avenger is a pretty decent film by its own merits. Showing the good old retro style and production design, since this film is directed by Joe Johnson who is capable of portraying the old times perfectly. Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Definitely not new but it's still enjoyable.What I do think this movie did right was Captain America's origin. Also actor Hugo Weaving, the person who was bucky and Neal Mcdonough were also very good as there parts. Red Skull's death never made sense to me I hope Hugo Weaving returns as his role in the near future. Anyways I don't have much more to say about this movie but it good.",8,1,1,15 March 2018
Justice League," Ignore the heavily bad reviews
","I have just seen Justice league today and I am actually satisfied with what I have been given. Gal Godot, Ben Affleck and the rest of the cast as the league members were good as there characters with an exception of Ezra Miller because his face was just plain ugly as Barry Allen, his weird face gave me the creeps and it is weird that when The Flash is running he produces blue electricity instead of yellow. On top of that Ezra didn't look comfortable when he was doing the part.The effects were amazing it was nice seen some Green Lanterns during a flashback scene again especially seeing them use there rings. I can't wait for who so ever will be Green Lantern in the next movie (if there are more) and Steppenwolfs voice was really good. But the Parademons were a waste and looked like creatures in military suits and I wish we got to see Apocalypse and Darkseid. They could have even played the old Justice League to make the fans happy but too bad they didn't. Honestly, when I read the reviews at first I was very unsure of going but after when I saw it I was astounded by what I had seen. In fact, the movie actually had funny jokes in a few scenes. My favorite part was the last battle though I am surprised this movie is only 2 hours long I wish it was longer. But the best part is it is less scary or terrifying compared to a couple of scenes on Batman VS. Superman.If you are a fan of the original Justice League shows and the animated movies then you might enjoy this. It is definitely worth your money. I just hope Zack Snyder doesn't plan on shutting DCEU down because of all the bad reviews. Ignore the jealous morons righting bad reviews about this movie trust me it is not bad or garbage.",7,3,9,30 November 2017
Man of Steel," Why all the hate?
","As I have stated why does this movie have so much hate and criticism? I feel like I am the only person out of people I know who actually liked this movie.Okay, when I watched with my sister she just found it as too much action. But I think too much action is better than no or very little action. Okay, there was a bit of overacting at the beginning of the movie during Ke-LL mothers pregnancy. But the movie had lots of good effects like the buildings falling, Superman's powers and the pool of skulls and good acting. My favorite scene was where he saved a school bus from drowning and the whole fight with General Zod.Honestly, it is a good movie well better than Superman Returns. Don't listen to the haters.",10,3,5,29 October 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best Spider-man movie ever
",Spider-Man into the Spider-verse has to be the best Spider-Man movie out their honestly. Stan Lee and the rest of the crew really out did themselves.This movie did a good job introducing miles morals as a character and portraying his origin while introducing the spider-verse in the most spectacular way. It is pretty a new Spider-Man for the new generation.The plot and how it was timed was excellent and it wasn't predictable what so ever. Alongside that it delivers the message across without over doing.The animation and art style was pretty good though I didn't really like how the kingpin looked but it did still work especially when they had to animation bend in the movie.The voice acting was pretty good despite a few missing lip movement of the characters while talking.I admit when first saw the trailer the animation looked a lot like a stop motion advert but I was wrong.It is a pretty cool movie overall and I would really recommend it if you are a Spider-Man fan.,10,0,1,27 August 2019
Spider-Man," The origin of Spiderman
","This movie was really awesome I remember watching it a day after my 16th birthday and I was so happy because my 16th birthday didn't go as planned on the day, my dad was on a night shift and my mom was too tired so I decided to open my uncles birthday present and I got the first 3 Spiderman movies. If you love the comics you would love this movie. Tobey Maguire was awesome as Spiderman. I would say give it a go for the new generation of Spiderman fans.",10,0,0,7 October 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good
",I saw this film alongside the second one way before the I decided to watch the original trilogy and it was great.Call me weird but I even had a crush on Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy in this movie she definitely hotter than the one who was in Spiderman 3. Andrew Garfield was a good Spiderman I don't care what people say about him. I liked the bit where Flash Thompson challenged Peter to basketball and when Spiderman was fighting the Lizard in school.I would watch this movie but the only problem is it tells Spiderman origin again.,9,1,3,7 October 2017
Now You See Me," The 4 horse men
","It was a good movie but...............==Warning I have taken a two bits from someone's review==You would expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas (Eisenberg) says, 'Always be the most intelligent person in the room' or something similar, this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away, isn't as unpredictable as it should be (really, you couldn't see that ending coming?) and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious, were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement, as it's been laying clues all along - and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the 'twists' coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie, the end is the big reveal. But it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show, of course, with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting, stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while, Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the 'glamour' rather than a serious character, which was a shame as she was good.",6,0,0,5 May 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," My favourite one
",Out of all of the X-Men movies this is probably my favourite one because both the past versions and the future version of the x-men including the cast members merger together all for this incredible movie.In an alternative timeline the Sentinels have taken over and have nearly wiped out every mutant. But the X-Men are still fighting them. So Charles tells Logan to go into the past to meet his younger self and stop Mystic from ever killing Trask so that the sentinels don't invade.The movie as I stated above is my favourite and the acting was just perfect.My favorite scene was when Beast throws Wolverine and Logan's scream was just classic. If you enjoy the X-men movies or just love the X-Men in general then this movie is for you.,10,0,0,4 August 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Easily the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movie
","This is definitely my favourite MCU movie alongside Guardians of the galaxy both 1 and 2, Thor Ragnarok, Doctor Strange, Captain America the winter soldier and The Avengers.==Warning I have copied this next paragraph from the first review I saw==
 
The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel BrÃ¼hl. Were all great. The best scene is the fight at the airport with all of the avengers and the last fight scene when Captain America, Iron Man and The Winter Soldier.For a random reason I actually thought that Daniel Bruhl was Tobey Maguire invading the movie trying to get his role back as Spiderman. I hope we see Daniel return in a future film as Zemo. What I am confused about was like why wasn't Thor or Hulk contacted by the avengers for the fight.Paul Rudd definitely killed it as Ant-Man in this movie when he became Giant-Man and both Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland were definitely the right choices for Black Panther and Spider-Man.I hope Infinity Wars answers how Captain America will fight without his shield. Overall great movie I hope DC dose something similar to this with all of the Justice League in the near future.",10,1,3,17 March 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Disappointing
","Honestly, I was looking really forward to watching this movie. But in the end it was just very bad.The acting is bad.The monsters were just ugly as sin.I have never read the book but I just think Ezra Millers character was just bullied through out the movie and boy he was a miscast. I can't believe this guy is the new Flash.I have really enjoyed Harry Potter and his books but not this movie.The only good thing to be coming out of it is special effects and the fact that Johnny Depp was involved. Other then that. Don't waste you time.",3,0,0,24 April 2018
Spirited Away," A childhood classic
","Chihiro and her parents are moving to a small Japanese town in the countryside, much to Chihiro's dismay. On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro. Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world.I watched this film twice once when I was 11 and just recently on netflix and what can i say it was a ride of fun.The characters are likeable, the visuals were good too.Overall it is a good movie recommended to both kids and adults.",10,0,0,30 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers Endgame part 2
","Sidenote: this again is a review for a film I am writing as college homework so do bear with me for any SPAG errors.Welp, it has been a good 11 years of the MCU with some amazing films, sure there might be some bad movies such as Iron Man 3 and Captain Marvel but other then that the MCU has had many impressive films and now we come down to the endgame. Ever since 2008 there have been around 22 movies and now we probably have the best movie of the MCU in my opinion although, it is on a sub-par with infinity wars. I also felt very emotional because of a death of a character specifically an avenger not going to say who otherwise I might spoil too much.I finally got around to seeing it yesterday and I am completely mind blown. I was very disappointed with Captain marvel day before yesterday when I watched it but after this movie I am fully happy. I remember saying that Avengers Infinity Wars was the best movie of 2019 at present.If you have not caught up with the MCU like my sister was yesterday or if you haven't watch Infinity wars yet I recommend you watch all those first because to understand this movie you need to understand them first. Also, this review is filled with spoilers so if you don't want to get spoiled get out of my review right now and watch those movies before you continue reading. Cause this movie is going to be hard not to spoil.So, endgame takes off where infinity wars ended/ant man and the wasp post credits scene, when everyone but a few avengers disappear. It had been 3 weeks ever since Thanos wiped out human life on the earth, they find out where Thanos is hiding Thor kills him because he got rid of the infinity stones. They also take the infinity gauntlet with them.5 years laterCaptain America, War Machine and Black Widow are still figuring out what to do? Thor goes his separate ways, Hawkeye becomes a vigilante in Tokyo still grieving over his disappeared family, Iron Man starts a life with Pepper and has a daughter, Hulk mixes his brains and brawns together, Thor alongside the Asgardians and ant man finally escapes the microzone only to find out that Thanos invaded the earth and wiped out the population.They realise the only way they could restore everything is if they go back in time and stop Thanos from getting the stones so each of the avengers have a pym particle which can send them back in a moment in time before Thanos got to them. I enjoyed this scene because it gives me memories of each movie I watched of the MCU and makes me relive a few of their best moments. However, there was a high price for this.The effects in the movie were good, the camera angel was excellent and the time and pacing of the story was good too. The cast including Chris Evens, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Pratt, Scarlett Johnanson, Elizabeth Olson, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Robert Downy Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, Don Cheadle, Zoe Saldana, Evangeline Lilly, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tessa Thompson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anthony Mackie , Rene Russo, Dave Bautista, John Slattery, Sebastian Stan, Hayley Atwell, Emma Fuhrmann (who knew after 5 years Cassie would become hot) Vin Diesel, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else did a good job as their roles. I am going to really miss Chris Evens and Robert Downy Jr as their roles.My only fault with this film is that there was a lot of talking in comparative to the last movie and a lot is going on at once. But that was my only fault.The best scenes in this movie are when we go back in the past and Steve gets to see Peggy again, Tony gets to meet his dad, the fight scene when Captain America gets to fight Captain America (I wonder how long that took for Chris Evens to film), the final fight between thanos and when War Machine calls ant man regular size man.This is possibly the best movie I have seen in 2019 I could even give it a 15, 50 or even 100 if I could. Thank you, Stan Lee (RIP), Kevin Forge and everyone who worked on this movie I really loved every bit of it.If you actually, decided to continue reading and haven't seen the movie it. Opps, but I still recommend you watch this movie.",10,139,263,6 May 2019
Batman Begins," The dark knight indeed
","Batman begins is an awesome Batman film, in fact, it is my favorite out of the three from the trilogy. My favorite scenes were when the police come to the scarecrows hideout and the bats distracted the police to let Batman escape, Scarecrow's voice in the particular scene and when Alfred asked Bruce 'why do we fall?' and that was very inspirational in the film.",8,0,0,29 August 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers Infinity War (Part 1)
","This review is for English reports for college so do bare, with me if there are any SPaG errors or if I am missing any details. So I finally got round to seeing Avengers Infinity Wars yesterday, and I have to say I am completely mind blown. This is probably the best movie of 2018 heck even best of the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. Over the past decade or so MCU has been doing very well with their movies and so far I have enjoyed if not all but majority of their movies (Iron Man 3 not so much). Ever since 2008, there have been over 18 movies stating with the first Iron Man movie.  If you haven't caught up with the movies or if you are missing any I would recommend you watch them first before you buy tickets to watch this movie or continue reading my review because there will be spoilers as I go along. As usual the acting, special effects, camera angel and plot of movie was all good. All though the only problem I found with this movie was that too many things were going on at once. But luckily that never put the actual down. There is a lot of Easter eggs which may surprise for example when Thanos is about to claim an infinity stone there is a similar figure that resembles the Red Skull and towards the post credits before Nick Fury turns into dust you see the symbol for Captain Marvel on Nick's phone which may foreshadow Captain Marvels appearance. But I am very surprised that Nick Fury never contacted her for the first or the second movie but he contacted her for this.Towards the beginning of the movie I wish we got to see how the Asgardians got knockout by Thanos which was still puzzling to me and where Hawkeye and Ant-Man was during the movie and did they disappear like the other few people or are they still there. Also I am not really sure if I am comfortable with the fact that has a cyborg eye and the Stormbreaker (which is owned by Beta Ray Bill in the comics) hammer because he lost both in the previous movie, Black Widow having blonde hair or even Captain America having facial hair and regular shield instead of Wakanda making him the same since they have metal as previous one he lost in Captain America Civil War and I wonder why The Hulk was resentencing Bruce Banner to transform.The best scenes are all of the fight scenes with Thanos and the black order, the bit where Teenage Groot gives Peter and Rocket attitude, the chemistry between Rocket and The White Wolf and when Ned does a distraction for Peter. The scene when Spider-Man is about to disappear and he is crying for his life to Tony saying 'I don't wanna go' I nearly cried at that scene and when nearly all of New York is about to disappear. There is a few deaths which you might cry over in film but I won't say who because I think I have spoiled plenty.I am glad this movie had the Hulkbuster and the Spider-Suit.All and all Stan Lee and the rest of the crew did an amazing job. If you haven't seen Avengers Infinity Wars yet I would recommend you go watch it. 10/10 I could even give it 50 or 100 if I could. Can't wait for Part 2 next year and the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp movie coming out in a few months' time.",10,2,4,6 May 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," Pretty good despite being the weakest in the whole trilogy
","After the presumed death of Jean Grey, Scott finds out that she was still alive despite her saving the X-Men and sacrificing herself in the previous movie. In this movie Jean becomes the Phoenix and the Dark Phoenix which ends up making her lose her humanity and she must fight it.As usual the acting and CGI was very good in this movie. However, I wish Bobby and Kitty became and stayed a couple. I wasn't too big on the whole Bobby and Rouge thing. Maybe because of my nostalgia from Wolverine and the x-men.Just a warning of note you may cry when you watch because it has a very depressing ending.That's all I am going to say.",7,2,2,4 August 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," =Warning I have taken a part of somebody else for this=
","This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, a mutant appears in some random scene and they are recruited by either Apocalypse or the X-Men. The writing is all over the place and we don't get to know the characters, they're simply put there.Because Bryan Singer is in love wit Stryker of course we get to see the Weapon X program (again!) and of course, Wolverine because why not.As for the characters: Magneto barely does anything in the whole movie, Apocalypse is a one note villain, Xavier phoned it in and Jennifer Lawrence was NOT Mystique at all, as expected she played Raven Everdeen.Finally, the big battle comes and nothing really happened, the world is being destroyed and the governments sit quiet.",4,2,4,4 August 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Could have been better
","Well, where should I start first of all I Andrew Garfield did another excellent job as Spiderman and I still found Emma Stone hot as Gwen Stacy. This movie also had a lot of action and Jamie Fox was great as Electro.But there were a few flaws to the film like Rhino at the end of the movie was a guy in the suit. Harry Osborn as the Green Goblin killed Gwen instead of Norman Osborn even though we saw him at the beginning of the movie which never made sense speaking of the Green Goblin the guy who played Harry in the movie was great as James Franco's successor but he was a miscast as the Green Goblin. But what never made sense was how did Gwen exactly die from falling inside the clock tower when Spiderman caught her in time.I really wish Marc Webb didn't pull the plug on this movie and have The Amazing Spiderman 3 get canceled. If they weren't going to have a Spiderman 4 in the previous films. I hope they don't play this game with Tom Holland as Spiderman in the current films as they did with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield who have both been great Spidermen in these films.",7,1,1,7 October 2017
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Another Fantastic Film
","Like with the previous this film was very awesome it had good acting, special effects and I also like the dialogues. However, the only disappointment with this film was we never got to see Galactus (What he would look like in The Movie.)My favorite part in the movie was where Johnny calls The Thing a rock-slide and Ben says 'I'LL SHOW YOU ROCKSLIDE!' and starts to chase him.Overall awesome and as I have said in my review for the previous movie if you are a fan of The Fantastic Four you have come to the right place.",9,2,2,24 October 2017
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," New World Pictures Dub VS. Disney dub
","In the far future, a thousand years after a nuclear war left the Earth as a nuclear holocaust. The Valley of the Wind, a small kingdom ruled by King Jil struggles for survival as the community tries to defend the Valley from gigantic Ohm creatures and toxic plants that live beyond the Valley in the Sea of Decay, while Jil's daughter and heiress to the throne, Princess Nausicaä tries to understand and feels it is wrong to destroy the toxic jungle. The Valley is attacked by the Tolmekian people who plan to destroy the Sea of Decay by using the greatest warriors that started the holocaust. After Nausicaä is taken prisoner, Nausicaä escapes and goes beneath the Sea of Decay where she discovers the toxic plants are not poisoning the air, and are purifying the world by draining the air of radiation and toxins. With everything at stake, Nausicaä unites with the Ohms and set out to the Valley and foil the Tolmekians plan of unleashing the Great Warrior which will start another holocaust.There are two versions of the movie one which was by New World pictures and another one by Disney.While the old dub was hard to find and it probably wasn't worth me watch but i decided to check it out to peep my curiosity. The Warriors of the wind version was not good one bit. The movie was cute which made certain scenes either confusing or made my eyes role. The poster was completely changed from the original and to put the icing on top the dub was rushed with not even a single voice actor having a clue about what they are doing. Also to correct an idiot who wrote a review around 1998, Disney were not responsible for the dub.The second dub on the other hand was more faithful with zero cuts and more fitting voice.So if you are going to watch this movie dubbed, the Disney dub is the way to go and it is available on Netflix.With that aside, for Miyazaki's first movie it was really good, with beautiful visuals and a thrilling plot.",9,0,0,1 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Does Disney hate Star Wars or something
","Again before I start ranting just to start things off this is the eighth movie from the chronological order and it takes place The Force Awakens.First of all, can Disney actually learn from their mistakes after their 7th failed? Do they actually care about what fans actually want? To answer both of those questions the answer is No!This is just nothing more then another make believe movie from Disney and Star Wars. I mean seriously Force ghosts can use the force? Princess Leia can fly in space? Do I need to go into detail about last battle and Luke? But hey I will give it a point on creativity in the worst possible ways since there is littarly no creativity there. The main villain in this is just a bully and a crybaby. This whole movie is a sick joke and a cash crab from Kathleen Kennedy because of her stupid feminist propaganda belief look I get they want more female characters in the franchise but the way how they go about it is bad and offensive on many levels. I am going off topic a bit here but I actually wonder how did this travesty beat the 4 movie of Yo Kai Watch in Japan. It's just unbelievable how some people are trolls and like anything to do with Star Wars. Sorry I went off topic there I just wanted to share the facts.It's pretty stupid the fact that the movie before this, Rouge One was a huge success and I was happy with that movie. But instead of looking at their most successful project they just have to go back to square one where their troubles began. Pathetic just pathetic just hope after episode 9 Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kenndy and her feminist hench are finally removed from lucasfilms for good. Also well done for getting rid of Luke and why was he so mean in this movie. If you were going to get rid of him. Then why couldn't you have added the force ghost of Anakin and Obi Wan. If you want people to pay to see your movie at least do that. But at the end of the day Disney and Star Wars just like to be greedy snakes who only care about money.I am going to end my rant here!
If you want to see my other Star Wars reviews they are on my profile. In fact I have reviewed all of them today including a movie that has nothing to do with Star Wars called Time of EVE. If you want see my thoughts on that it's very positive. I think I have done enough reviews for one day. As I have said on my Force Awakens review if you want to watch this movie or if you like it more power to you but you would be disappointed.RIP Carrie Fisher you will be missed as you the only Princess Leia there is. Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.",2,4,7,3 August 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," A worthy introduction to the Guardians of the galaxy
","Guardians of the galaxy is one of my favourite MCU films and it got me into MCU. Believe it or not before I ever watched Guardians of the galaxy I literally had no interest in Marvel or even the Cinematic Universe but after this movie that all changed. 
The acting was very good especially from Chris Pratt (Star Lord), Michael Rooker (Youndu), Bradley Cooper (Rocket Racoon), Vin Diseal (Groot), who ever was Drax and Zoe (Gamora).No spoilers for any plot details but it is definitely an entertaining film. I would defintly check it before watching Vol.2.",9,2,3,4 April 2018
Jurassic World," I love this movie more please
","This movie was incredible. I have to admit I have never seen any of the Jurrasic Park movies and when they came on TV I got scared when I was younger. I have to say this movie with Chris Pratt was incredible, I couldn't believe it took me two years to see this movie because of how scared I was when I was 15 but now I am 17 and I am not scared.Wheather if you have grown up with the Jurrasic Park movies or not I can guarantee you this that you will love this movie.I hope the sequel to this movie which is coming out next year is successful like this movie is.",10,0,2,15 October 2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A child hood classic
","Although I have never watched Roald Dahl version of Charlie and the chocolate factory but I have read the book for that version. As for this movie it really lived up to Dahl's expectations the acting including David Kelly, Freddie Highmore and Johnny Depp were really good at doing there parts. Especially that cameo Christopher Lee had as Willy Wonka's dad/the dentist. This is a very fun movie to watch for both children and family. If you have not seen it yet I would definitely recommend it.",9,1,2,25 April 2018
Logan," Thank you Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart
","Logan is the final movie in terms of Hugh Jackman's wolverine and possibly Patrick Stewart's Charles.In an alternative timeline all of the X-Men are gone. Wolverine and Charlas are the only ones that are left as Wolverine is getting old and week in terms of heal, while Charlas is getting sick.Both Charles and Logan discover a girl by the name of X-23 who has the same powers as Logan. But unlike logan she only has two claws and they must keep her safe and unite her with the next generation of mutants.This was a satisfying pay off as Hugh Jackman's last movie as Wolverine, when there was dreama or action it didn't feel forced and the best part is that the movie is R rated.If you loved both Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman as their characters or just generally loved their movies. I am telling you now you are in for a treat,",10,2,3,4 August 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not as good as the previous one
","I don't hate this movie at all hence I have only gave it an 7 instead of a 10. But it's not as enjoyable as The Avengers movie. First of all in the comics I am pretty sure Hank Pym created Ultron not Tony Stark. Oh and what is this relationship with Black Widow and Hulk/Bruce Banner going on. Have the creators forgot about Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk. That he was in a relationship with her. If that is the case then I guess The Incredible Hulk movie never happened. So Jarvis is Vision now and FRIDAY takes his place in Iron Man's armor.The goods to come out of the film is the acting, Andy Serikus's introduction as The Klaw, the fight between Hulk and Hulkbuster, the final battle and James Spader as Ultron.I wish they killed Scarlet Witch off instead of Quicksilver because she is just practically useless on the team and well done Disney for abandoning the Hulk on a shield helicarrier. It's a decent movie overall but not as great as the last one.",7,0,0,6 April 2018
The Dark Knight," Do you wanna know how I found The Dark Knight
",The Dark Knight was an amazing film but not as good as Batman Begins. I will be honest though I found this movie very memorable compared to the other two. The best scene was when Batman was interrogating The Joker and when the Joker kept on making stories about how he got his scars. RIP Heath Ledger you were the best Joker in this film. I also liked Two Face in the movie and Batman's voice was very booming in this movie.,8,0,0,29 August 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," You may cry
","This movie was incredible to watch in 4D. The scenes were more memorable, funny and heartwarming then the first one.In this movie Peter finally discovers who is father is and he believes that he can live like a family once again. But it turns out that he may have been his father but not his daddy. Major Plot twist.
The best scene was when Peter and Rocket argue at the start of the movie by Peter calling Rocket a 'Raccoon' and a 'Trash Panda'. When Rocket calls a ravager 'Tazerface', when some ravagers are chucking alcohol at groot which was sad and funny at the same time. But the best scene is definitely the last battle.The acting was good, plot was amazing and the special effects were awesome. Can't wait for Infinity Wars and Vol.3",10,0,0,4 April 2018
Thor," Excellent introduction to Thor and Hawkeye
","This movie did a great job portraying the god of Thunder himself Thor. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins all did a great job as there characters.The best scene is when the destroyer armor gets released into midguard and Thor and the gang fight it. This movie also explains why Loki is evil and that his parents were frost giants.We also see a brief cameo of Hawkeye when Thor is trying to get his hammer back and Hawkeye was ordered to fire at him.The rest of the movie is just good.",8,1,1,23 March 2018
Castle in the Sky," Miyazaki's beauty
","Synopsis
This film is set in a Victorian era that might have been, influenced by the visions of writers such as Jules Verne. As Pazu, the apprentice of the engineer who maintains a mine's elevator machinery, carries his boss's dinner back to the mine, an unconscious pigtailed girl floats down from the sky into his arms. This girl, Sheeta, and her magical levitation-stone pendant hold the key to a mysterious, mythical sky-castle known as Laputa. Sheeta and Pazu must flee from both air-pirates, who seek the sky kingdom for its legendary treasure, and the army, led by a government agent with his own mysterious agenda for Laputa.The film has really good visual with a plot which would make you go 'wow'. You don't even have to be an anime fan to enjoy this but can still respect the art of this movie.The cast was also pretty good, I watched the Disney dub, please don't listen to anyone who says that the dub is bad or the old dub is better because they are wrong. While James Van Der Beek sounded a bit old as Pazu i still enjoyed his performance, Anna Paquin also did well as Sheeta. Other voice actors including Cloris Leachman, Mark Hamil, Richard Dysart, Jim Cummings, John Hostetter, Mandy Patinkin, Michael McShane and Andy Dick were all phenomenal in this movie.Recommended to all ages.",9,1,1,27 March 2020
August Rush," A very heartwarming movie
","A young boy called Even Taylor was sent away in an orphanage as a really young without ever meeting his father or his mother. The boy grew up and has this ability to make any form of music just by the sounds of his surroundings. One day he leaves the orphanage and meets this strange looking who takes him in to use him for his talent. Until Even realises that there is a bigger world out there for his talent.The acting for this film was very good but the top performers for this movie have to be Freddie Highmore as Even Taylor/August Beach he really knocked it out of the park with his acting and it's probably his best child roll. Also the late Robin Williams as Wizard.The music in the movie was well performed as well.If you want to have a good family friendly movie which is a magical story though it does have a bit of mild language but nothing major, but is 90% for both kids and adults i highly recommend this.",10,0,0,9 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Execute order 66
","This is the final from the prequel trilogy and is chronologically the third movie of the franchise.After the events of Attack of the clone and both clone wars cartoon (if any of you are/were following those). The senator was kidnapped by count dooku then Anakin and Obi Won go and face him to save. We are then introduced to General Grievous and his droid army.This movie was good at explaining Order 66 when Commander Cody and the clones were ordered to betrayed and kill the jedi and, when Anakin turns to the dark side and becomes the monster you see in the original trilogy. Meanwhile, Padme is pregnant and about to give birth to Luke and Leia. Out of the prequel trilogy this my favourite as had the most tear jerking and heart crushing moments.The only thing which never made sense was that Anakin says to Count Dooku that he hasn't seen him ever since he cut off his hand and he also says to General Grievous 'You look shorter then I expected' where as in the clone wars Anakin is see in lots of episodes fighting Grievous and Count. I know the show wasn't thought of at the time but I think it's still worth mentioning.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.",10,1,2,3 August 2018
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman 2017
","The Wonder Women movie is like one of the best movies in the DC Cinematic Universe at present. I also liked Man of steel and Batman VS Superman but Wonder Woman, in my opinion, has the right balance between the two films a reasonable amount of talking and action. Suicide Squad was terrible. It is definitely worth your money if you are a fan of Wonder Women, the DC comics and you enjoyed the animated movie which came out in 2009 (see my review).I went to see this film with my sister and my mom in the cinemas and we all enjoyed it.This film had a lot of good special effects, backgrounds, dialogues, and acting. My favorite scene was the final battle between Areas and when Wonder Women finishes him off saying 'Goodbye brother'. Also, Gal Gadot continues to shine as Wonder Women I am looking forward to seeing more of her in Justice League. Chris Pine also did good acting as Steve Trevor I wish he could reprise him again. (Not going to spoil anymore) But warning Dr. Posion is scary.",10,3,8,2 November 2017

The Dark Knight Rises," That is one way to end The Dark Knight trilogy I guess...
","Out of the three movies of The Dark Knight trilogy, I do feel this one was just decent not good or terrible. The reason being is that I found this movie more talking than action if there was more action in the movie than I would have enjoyed it a bit more. I did get annoyed that Scarecrow was only used for 1 minute in the movie. Mostly this film was Bruce trying to get out of prison with a broken back which I found funny when he got whipped and the last scene with the Batmobile exploding seriously why do we not see Bruce Wayne escape and the worse part is when Alfred saw a man that he thought was Bruce.",6,1,1,29 August 2017
Black Panther," Not the best or the worst
","This honestly feels like Marvels version of The Lion King more or less.My biggest complaint is that this movie killed off both Andy Serkis and Michael B Jordan as there characters. My favorite scene is when they are in the casino and they are fighting, the car chase and both battles between Black Panther and who ever was Michael Jordan. Overall it's pretty good movie but it is not as good as Thor Ragnarok.",6,1,7,13 March 2018

",For those of you who are currently catching up or are about to start watch the MCU Iron Man is first film to start with.Robert Downy Jr was an excellent choice for the billionaire playboy Tony Stark.The movie was excellent in plot and effects. The casting was good and the camera movement was excellent.My overall conclusion 10/10.,10,1,1,12 March 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Unfair Hate
","Honestly, I really enjoyed this movie I don't understand why does the movie have so much hate. I really feel sorry for Zack Snyder if he reads these reviews on this site.Like with Man Of Steel this movie had really good special effects, acting, and action.Okay, there were a few drawbacks like less action but the last fight scene was just awesome with Doomsday. I was even in the cinema yelling 'DOOMSDAY DOOMSDAY DOOMSDAY' when he was getting created however it is a shame he only roared.Ben Affleck is a worth successor over Christian Bale as Batman and Gal Gadot was really good as Wonder Women and she continues to shine as the character in Wonder Woman 2017 which will be reviewed soon.My favorite scenes were when Batman says to Superman 'Tell me do you bleed!'. The actual fight scene, the opening scene, and the final battle.But warning ahead there are a few scenes what might make younger audiences jump like when Bruce visits his parents grave and when he has a dream.Overall an awesome movie I even went to see it with my sister. Don't listen to the morons writing bad reviews they are just jealous.",9,21,30,30 October 2017
X2: X-Men United," The adventure continues
","After the first movie, Rogue is now all settled in with the rest of her teammates but things get into a huge mess when the MRD discover where the X-Men are stationed and because of this they are forced to be on the run.We also see Cyclops's love triangle with Jean which is taken to a whole new level of romance.As usal the acting was good from Hugh Jackman, Ian Mckellen, Patrick Stuart, Alan Cumming, James Marsden, Shawn Ashmore, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry.Just like with the other one the movie was good especially the post credit scene.",8,1,1,4 August 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Come on why all the bad reviews??
","I am pretty sure it's not that bad is it?
To be honest this movie is better then the first Thor movie by far. Honestly this movie isn't as bad as Iron Man 3. This movie does clearly show what happened to Loki after the first avengers. By the end credits of the movie we learn that Loki was never really dead he was just discussed as Odin the whole time which never really made any sense but still. Any ways this movie isn't as bad a critics say it is.",9,2,4,23 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What have they done to Star Wars?
","Okay, before I start my rant I am just going to mention this is the seventh movie of the franchise if you watching in chronological order.So this movie is about a women who is roaming around on the planet called Jakku and we have no idea other then her name who she is? where did she come from? And whatever happened to her parents? The character is just not interesting whatsoever, she is just a Mary Sue version of Star Wars. She doesn't seem to care at all.Kylo Renn is a massive joke his face makes me puke he looks like professor snapes son. He looks more like a bully that is about to take a kids lunch money or play with someone's glasses. Also how did him and Snoke come to power. Apart from the CGI and special effects everything else about this movie is terrible. I am sorry but I don't think Disney can make a good Star Wars movie at all they more or less care about money and their political beliefs then the franchise.Also JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kenandy messed this up so badly that they ruin the whole franchise.Majority of it was just boring. If you want to watch the movie more power to you but if you really love the franchise you will be very disappointed.It does make me wonder how did this movie get an 8/10. I wonder if Disney are forcing all of the cast and crew who worked on this movie to give it a 10.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.",3,18,22,3 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A new hope, a new beginning
","This movie takes place after the events of Revenge of the sith, Rogue One, the Rebels animated series (If there are many people that watch that) and Solo if you would like to watch the movies in chronological order.After decades of the events from order 66 we see that the Emperor and Darth Vader have gained power over princess leia's planet and Leia has been kidnapped by the separatists so C3PO and R2D2 land on desert planet to look for help.We are then introduced to Luke Skywalker who is living with the family who was left with after Order 66. Han Solo is also introduced in talking to Jabba and Boba fett about something he owned him.Obi Won Kenobi also went into hiding and under a different name Ben Kenobi who agrees to help Luke and Han on the rescue mission.I won't be spoiling much but this is a good classic to the franchise.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.",10,0,1,3 August 2018
Deadpool," With great power comes great irresponsibility
","Honestly, before I ever watched this movie. I actually did not know much about deadpool even though I saw him in two animated incarnations and that midcore origins film which completely ruined him.After watching this movie I got to know him a lot better and learned more about. Who he is, how he got his powers and how he became an anti-superhero.It's really funny as well. My favourite scene is when he is looking for Francis and he is in a zamboni. Also that green lantern joke.The acting was good Ryan Renolds did a lot better as deadpool then he ever did in Orgins.If you love Deadpool, you will enjoy this movie.",8,0,1,4 August 2018
Fantastic Four," A Fantastic Movie
","I loved this movie from start to finish. If you are a fan of the fantastic four you have come to the right place. Ioan Grufford, Chris Evens, Julian (whatever his last name is), Jessica, and Micheal Chailk were really good as their roles in this movie. The jokes were funny my favorite sense was Johnny Storm puts whip cream on Ben's hand when he is asleep and when he wakes up Splat! the cream goes on his face and The Thing yells 'JOHNNNY!' Okay, I have to admit I found The Human Torch annoying at the start of the film but when I found out it was Chris Evens who is Captain America in MCU I was like why was I angry with Captain America.",10,3,5,24 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Trouble with the truth
","This movie takes place after A new hope.In this movie Luke meets the trial of his life when he faces off against Darth Vader and he learns the truth about who he is, who actually is Leia and what happens to the Jedi.Well I am not too much of an expert on this Star Wars movie so I am sorry this is not much in detail. However, we are introduced to Lando and this is the only time Boba Fett talks.
If you liked A New Hope you will enjoy this classic as well.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.",10,0,0,3 August 2018
