Mission: Impossible III," It is Great, but Takes a Couple of Missteps
","The first attempt hurts itself with a poorly explained plot and not enough action. The second spectacularly fails for two reasons: horribly conceived action mostly shown in slow motion, and a plot with more holes than the car Morpheus and Trinity drive during the highway chase from 'The Matrix Reloaded.' The third 'Mission: Impossible' movie finally nails the target. The plot is more reasonable, far better developed, and more clearly explained. The action is better and more intense; it is back to a level that easily allows suspension of disbelief. The supporting roles are better written and acted, and for the first time, the villain works. This movie is by far the strongest of the trio, but could have been even better without its two mistakes.J.J. Abrams, one of Hollywood's hottest minds after creating 'Felicity,' 'Alias,' and 'Lost,' is the new director. Abrams also wrote the script with 'Alias' collaborators Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Their effort yields the right mixture of action, character drama, and story. The gadgets are great. They are more realistic than those in the James Bond films; every one of them reasonably could exist, and many probably do. The most commonplace is the pitching machine, used as a surprise to both the audience and the characters in one the movie's most delightful parts.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) no longer participates in active missions. He now earns his living training their most gifted entrants; his finest being Lindsey Farris (the lovely Keri Russell, of 'Felicity' fame). Now engaged to Julia (Michelle Monaghan), he is enjoying his semi-retirement. Unfortunately, Farris is captured observing Black Market arms broker Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and Hunt must make the agonizing decision to help bring her home.During the rescue, Hunt and his teammates Luther (Ving Rhames), Declan (John Rhys-Meyers), and Zhen (the lovely Maggie Q) discover that Davian is attempting to acquire The Rabbit's Foot. Nobody at IMF knows that is, but Davian's involvement frightens both Hunt and IMF computer expert Benji (Simon Pegg). Ethan also must deal with Theodore Brassel (Laurence Fishburne), the chief executive of IMF, who is more reluctant to take action.After two bland villains, Philip Seymour Hoffman blows the roof off the dome and into the ozone layer with his performance. Davian is the complete package. When a bystander spills wine on his dress shirt, he does not become angry. In other contexts, however, he is a focused and lethal. Imposing even while bound to a chair, he promises that he will find Ethan's girl and torture her. Although the character tends to remain calm, Hoffman projects a quiet menace that can break to the surface when provoked. Indeed, it is Hoffman's ability that makes his captivity scene, plus all of his others, work so well.Probably all that needs to be said about the action is Vic Armstrong. The legendary Armstrong is probably the best action choreographer in history. All of the fights, whether involving guns or flying body parts, are created with masterful skill and conceptualization. One of the best is a helicopter chase through a wind farm. Hunt and his team must race to save one of their own while trying to escape their pursuers at the same time. The climax is even better and employs the same device in more serious circumstances. Abrams accomplishes much with the way he captures it all, although a less shaky camera would be appreciated.Also at his best is Cruise. Hunt's engagement provides a more human subtext, and I have never seen Tom better. He captures the emotions and pressures of Hunt and redirects them with surprising accuracy. Tears stream down his face for Julia. I have acting experience, and true crying is much more difficult than most people realize. Cruise truly instills life into Ethan Hunt.The first error is the opener. It is a harrowing two-and-a-half minutes, but the scene is incomplete. 80% of the movie passes before we see its conclusion. I first remembered the preceding action being far shorter because when I first saw it, I kept thinking what everybody else likely was, 'When will we *finally* get back to where we started?' The beginning is strong enough without the cliffhanger, and its inclusion backfires later on.The second deals with the Rabbit's Foot. Benji (Pegg) hypothesizes that it could be an 'anti-god.' Davian's buyers will pay 850 million dollars for it. All of the threats, deception and violence occur because so many people are scrambling to obtain it. When the conflicts are finally resolved, Hunt asks what we are all wondering, 'What is it?' The answer is never given. A writer should never deprive the audience of that which they have conditioned them to desire.These are not small mistakes, but they do not comprise a large part of the movie. The rest of the movie, from the action, to the acting, to the hero and villain, is all beyond recommendable. I rate this movie an eight of ten, but it could have been a nine or even considered for a maximum score. So much is expertly done. Its failings are like to pimples on a beauty queen's face. Although they are ugly, it is still a dang attractive face.",8,0,1,2 July 2008
The Fifth Element," Luc Besson's Joy is Infectuous
","Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg. Luc Besson deserves a medal for that name. Take the two most beautiful names from a language priding itself on elegance and add the ugliest one-syllable name ever concocted. Monty Python would have loved using it. It would have been as classic 'Mr. Smoke-too-much,' and 'Sir Robin the Cowardly.' An ingenious name does not make a movie by itself, but this one sums up Besson's brilliance. His world 250 years in the future has enough creativity for ten movies, and nothing is too absurd to occur in it.In the year 2263, Earth is the home of The Federated Territories, which is much like the Federation in Star Trek. People now live hundreds of feet above the surface. New York's flying cars still adhere to organized paths, but traffic moves in several ascending layers. Most people live in apartments where the bed retracts into the wall and they can have a restaurant come directly to their window. They cleanse their bodies by lowering the refrigerator, stepping atop it, and raising themselves into the shower. Some people prefer to use auto wash. When the police come into your building, you must place your hands into yellow circles on the wall, unless you are auto-washing, of course.Besson's vision of the future is more unique, creative and colorful than anything else to enter the cinemas save George Lucas' most recent episodes in a galaxy far, far away. Alas, the people live in dangerous times. Every 5,000 years, a black hole opens and a creature of pure evil enters our universe. Technically, it should be a white hole that sends it our way. In any case, if this evil reaches Earth before the Fifth Element activates the weapon against it, all life will be destroyed.To the rescue ride the Mondoshawans. They possess the four elemental stones and Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), the Fifth Element, but evil has an ally this time. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman) has sided with the evil being, although what he stands to gain is a mystery. He uses the unwitting Mangalores as his allies, and it is them who ambush the Mondoshawan craft as it approaches Earth. However, Leeloo anticipated difficulty. With the help of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) and Priest Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), she embarks for a distant rendezvous where the fate of every living being depends on the outcome.Bruce Willis plays a friendlier, less abrasive, more stable hero than is his norm. Willis built his considerable fame playing everyman heroes, and he still carries that spirit with him as Dallas. He projects sadness far more effectively and believably than he does in 'Die Hard with a Vengeance,' and does so by muting his acting. Tommy Lister and Brion James play their roles as president and military leader with panache, and Holm meets all expectations as Priest Cornelius.The highest praise, however, belongs to Jovovich. She is able to do what few actors dare dream, namely create her own accent. While Leeloo has unfathomable strength and mind-blowing physicals skills, bullets still hurt and she is vulnerable in a world that bombards her senses in ways she never could have imagined. Jovovich has fun with Leeloo learning new words. She has the exuberance of an exploring child and emotes flawlessly in a language nobody in the audience understands. Plus, she can shed tears as well as anybody. There is no weak moment in her performance.Despite the fantastic name and distinctive appearance, Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg does not end the day among the classic villains. The shortcomings are not because Oldman acts poorly. They come from the way he and Besson created the character. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel is not imposing or diabolical. Oldman elicits some laughs, which is a strong emphasis of the movie. However, he talks so strangely that many of Zorg's lines are difficult to understand.The action is awesome. Besson peppers it with reminders that none of it should be taken seriously. Many of Leeloo's fighting moves are purely comical and Dallas' winning attack in the climatic battle is purely for laughs. At one point he is no more than eight feet from three Mangalores and they all miss him with their fully automatic weapons. Despite its goofiness, the action quality is top notch.The best scene is a comedy-of-errors routine in Dallas' apartment. He must deal with multiple groups of people without everybody else knowing. He makes use of every gadget he can before, of course, the police arrive. It is a scene reminiscent of the old time comedies starring the likes of Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. In a way, it epitomizes what Besson's movie is all about, and that is pure fun.",8,1,3,5 October 2008
Batman Returns," This is Tim Burton, not Batman
","I was in the Emergency Room a few months ago. After all of the good shows were finished, I searched for something to watch and stumbled on 'Batman Returns.' With no guide, I decided to stay there. I noticed that I sort of enjoyed it, but everything seems more entertaining when you are in the Emergency Room and your pain just melted away. I was also numb to the transgressions of the film because, for some reason I will never comprehend, I had watched it more than one time before. Numbness, however, does not equal quality, and it is never there the first viewing. The problems evident in the first film grow as cancer and leave only sadness, hurt and shame.A crime wave increasingly engulfs Gotham City as Christmas approaches. Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) pushes his design for a new power plant in a private meeting with the Mayor (Michael Murphy) and his aides. In reality, his plant is designed to drain power, simulating a power shortage so he can be the city's savior and turn a sick profit. When Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), his insecure secretary, discovers this purpose, Schreck shoves her out of a top floor window. Revived by Cats, she returns to her apartment, mentally snaps, and becomes Catwoman.Meanwhile, the Penguin (Danny DeVito) kidnaps Schreck. In his lair near the sewers, he blackmails Schreck into helping him with a heroic introduction to the public. Schreck soon arrives at a scheme to recall the mayor so he can push his plant unopposed. He convinces Penguin to run as the replacement. Even when he bites a man's nose for all to see, the public still adores him. That reaction is simply too big to leap, much like how the Penguin's men find blueprints to the Batmoblie, much less the technical knowledge to rewire it. Catwoman later joins Penguin after Batman interferes with her vendetta against Schreck, but Penguin is preoccupied with bedding her.The plot I have just described is not as clearly stated in the film. The film jerks unevenly from one subplot to another, and eventually the main story becomes blurred under all the shifting sands.Director Tim Burton's portrayal of the Penguin is unforgivable. Instead of a high class criminal who happens to be fat and have a big nose, Penguin is now a hideously deformed midget. When he is only a baby he eats a live cat. His hands look like claws. He spits and drools blue saliva. His underlings dress in circus costumes. At one point he eats a raw fish, and I don't mean sushi. He actually bites the fish and digs in. Scientists should study his immune system. He violates so many laws of biology he may as well be a new species.Rarely has a cinema character been so filled with pain and hatred. His parents dumped him in a sewer stream as an infant. At some point, circus performers take him in and incorporate him into their freak show, later shut down after complaints of missing children. The Penguin has no function in life; he only wants to hurt people. He is a sexual deviant, such as the time he massages a woman's breast while placing a campaign button. His ultimate plan is so depraved the film should be rated R for that alone. When we see it in action, his gang's transportation is so inefficient they can not possibly finish even a fraction of what they are attempting.The whole film is mean-spirited, but never more than during Penguin's demise. He is publicly disgraced and pelted with rotten fruit. Afterward, he wildly screams 'MY NAME IS NOT OSWALD! IT IS PENGUIN! I AM NOT A HUMAN BEING! I AM AN ANIMAL!' Next, his life's dream fails and then his gang abandons him as Batman closes in for the kill. In the end, he is reduced to screams of misery as he wildly slashes air with his umbrella. As his slow, inhumane demise reaches its conclusion, blue ink pours from his mouth in such great amounts he would be dead in seconds were it blood. I normally enjoy seeing villains suffer, but the Penguin's thirty minute destruction is depressing, not fun. He was never treated as a human from day one; he never had a chance. Yes, he is evil, but the indescribable cruelty he suffers is so great that in the end I pitied him.The film's blunders do not end with Penguin. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) remains quiet and reclusive. 'Why are you now determined to prove that this Penguin is not what he seems? Must you be the only lonely man-beast in town?' wonders Alfred (Michael Gough). We first see him sitting pensively, gazing at the floor as if an internal battle is happening in the deepest recesses of his mind. Again, the film treats Batman as being a curse. During a key scene between Wayne and Selina, he speaks about he could not reconcile the 'two truths' of his life. His 'difficulty with duality' destroyed his previous relationship. He later speaks about being 'split right down the center.' Even the cavernous, dark sets of Wayne Manor suggest a depressing, lonely existence.The whole movie overflows with festering pain and permanent wounds. Instead of delivering a dynamite climax, the film focuses even more on torturing its characters. Schreck and Catwoman eventually turn up, and then it becomes her turn for an emotional beating. It is the only part of the climax that works, and it does because of Walken. Actually, the only dramas that work are those involving Schreck, and Walken deserves exclusive credit.During all of this, Wayne tears off the hood of his Batsuit. Catwoman earlier penetrates it with homemade claws. The inconsistency continues as Wayne conveniently drops for five minutes after being shot. More proof that Burton is willing to bend anything to fit his misplaced exercise in malice and spite.",3,3,9,28 October 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," This Movie is a Total Waste of Time and Money
","Three years is a long time to wait. For some, it is a wait for redemption after 'X-Men: The Last Stand' relentlessly assaulted what made the X-Men so appealing in the first place and grandly blasphemed two of its most beloved characters. For those who enjoyed the movie, it is the anticipation of seeing another story in the unique world of mutants. Shame on Marvel Enterprises and Fox Studios for violating the hope of the first group and the trust of the second.'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' has five major problems. First, it has too many mutants to develop. I am familiar with each character and still felt overwhelmed. Second, there is too little substance to the story. Third, the action has too much glitz and too little entertainment. Fourth, writers David Benioff and Skip Woods mangle already established fact. Finally, a great many mutants are altered from their original form. That final error, while not noticeable to some viewers, is possibly the deadliest offense to fans of the X-Men cannon.There are 11 significant mutants in the story, and that does not count minor characters. The original 'X-Men' has ten total. The most well-known mutants are included in those ten. That is one difference. Also, 'X-Men' has at most half as much action as this movie. Less character time is needed in 'X-Men,' yet more is given. That focus adds importance to both the story and the violence. Bolt (Dominic Monaghan), the Blob (Kevin Durand), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney, giving one of the movie's coolest and most focused performances), and especially Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), are most gypped by 'Wolverine.' As Roger Ebert has often pointed out, Wolverine, also called Logan (Hugh Jackman), possesses powers that are mundane compared to those of Storm, who can control the weather, or Magneto, who can rip a train car in two with the power of his will alone, or even this movie's Emma Frost (exceedingly beautiful Tahyna Tozzi), who can turn her skin into diamonds. Wolverine's appeal arises from his aggression and his struggle to remember his past and its unknown hurts. The movie never really investigates what formed Logan into the one of the most unique personalities in Marvel Comics. His motivations, the emotional impact of his decisions, the exploration of his nature, and later-forgotten trauma are insufficiently explored. Of the four X-Men stories released to date, this one should be the slowest and most thoughtful. It is the fastest and least thoughtful.Like Marc Forster in 'Quantum of Solace,' director Gavin Hood looks totally lost trying to choreograph action. Imagine watching a baseball game where the camera appears so close to the baseball that we cannot see the hitter until the very last instant. Without a good view of the baseball's position in the environment around it, it is difficult to see how it travels from the pitcher's hand to home plate. That is similar to the effect created by zooming the camera in too far during action. The action in 'Wolverine' is mostly close-quarters involving unnaturally fast moving people. Hood also uses way too much fancy trash. I lost count of how many double-sideways flips someone performs during a fight. One of them involves teleportation, but falls way short of the Riddick vs. Lord Marshal battle from 'The Chronicles of Riddick.' One of the high points of 'X2' is Logan's discovery of the room where his memories were lost and his metal claws gained. His flashbacks, combined with a later conversation with Colonel Stryker, provide an outline of what occurred. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' clearly establishes itself as a prequel, not a separate movie. Therefore, it should not ignore what we learned in 'X2.' 'Wolverine' not only does that, its replacement story far less compelling. Logan's signature personality is neutered even after his breaking point. He was never supposed to be a peaceful man. Whatever happened to 'You were always an animal, all I did was give you claws'? William Stryker's (Danny Huston in a role previously manned by Brian Cox) behavior when threatened and the later consequences make his status in 'X2' impossible to believe. The timeline places 'X-Men' far earlier than it claims to be. Even the story behind Logan's amnesia is cringe-worthy. What previous movies establish needs to be honored.Another problem is Logan's self-healing abilities. As in 'X-Men: The Last Stand,' he has become too invincible. Judging by his rate of healing in the first two X-Men movies, he survives at least two traumas that should be enough to kill him. Agent Zero of the comic books can nullify Logan's healing factor and absorb damage to his own body. His only skill here is good aim. Jason Bourne has good aim. Police snipers have good aim. That is not a superhuman ability. Deadpool spends so little time on screen that including him in the promotional material borders on false advertising. Logan's final battle is against an enemy whose signature weapon rips off both Optimus Prime and 'Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.' The second may sound ho-hum, but many comic book nerds love gaming too.This movie simply has far too many problems and too few redeeming factors. It proves that the X-Men series has not merely had a bad day. It has completely jumped the shark and is all but certainly beyond redemption. Taking Marvel's most popular character and making a dead-on-arrival movie shows serious incompetence from the creative team. The ending answers all questions, but those answers are not worth a free ticket to see the movie. My only wish is that I could forget the entire movie, except for the fact that it is despicable.",2,24,51,5 May 2009
The Mummy," All hail Imhotep
","For centuries, greedy adventurers and gold-seekers sought the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra. This hidden metropolis of myth and legend is the rumored resting place of the wealth of the pharaohs. What none of them know is that Hamunaptra is also the housing for the cursed Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo).More than 1,000 years before Christ, Imhotep is caught in an affair with the pharaoh's mistress, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez). Even though Imhotep escapes, Anck Su Namun is not so fortunate. Determined to resurrect her, he and his priests violate her tomb in Hamunaptra but are apprehended before they can finish. In addition to being mummified alive, Imhotep is also condemned with the most terrible of ancient curses. The catch is that if he is ever released, he will become 'a plague upon mankind with power over the sand and the glory of invincibility.' A secret society maintains vigil over the ruined city in order to keep him sealed in his eternal prison.Fast forward to 1923 Cairo, where American Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), a former visitor to Hamunaptra, is to be hanged. Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) discover his past and secure his life in exchange for his escort to the city. Carnahan is not interested in treasure, but instead wishes to unearth the book Aman-Ra. As an Egyptian-speaking librarian, she is drawn not by its solid gold cover, but its historical merit. There is a rival band of Americans guided by O'Connell's old comrade Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), the frontrunner for weasel of the decade. He carries amulet bearing every major religious symbol and possibly one or two he made up. When he runs into trouble, he holds each one in the air and utters a prayer in that language.The procession that arrives at Hamunaptra consists of nine named characters. The plot I described above all takes place in the first twenty minutes of film, but nearly an hour goes by before the mummy makes its appearance. The premise of the movie is all about rules and more rules, but the writers avoid audience confusion by taking painstaking care to establish them, as well as using repetition to solidify them in our minds. My second viewing revealed even more connections that I missed the first time. It is imperative that the viewer be educated in this film, and the writers' skill gives the Hamunaptra set an uncanny life. When Imhotep arrives, the viewer is prepared but not impatient.There is also a nice marriage of mood and function. O'Connell is the type of hero with eyes in the back of his head, and the movie correctly treats his action scenes with an appropriate level of absurdity. Director Stephen Sommers does a fine job achieving the right tone from the script, which he also wrote. The movie is not short on creative yet droll devices for the heroes to survive, including a moment of genius when Jonathan pretends to join a crowd chanting Imhotep's name. There is also a running gag on how far the mummy's jaw can open.The all-important special effects are exquisite and still look strikingly good eight years later. One particularly impressive effect is a face-bearing sandstorm that is chasing an airplane. The gunner relentlessly fires the mounted gun into the storm creating a snake of miniature sand explosions. Vosloo spends most of the film as some combination of Imhotep's sinewy skeleton and revived skin and flesh. The skeleton has a wide range of facial expressions and looks realistic when it moves. At one point a scarab crawls out of a hole in his neck and into his jaw, and he eats it. There is also the appearance of some of the Biblical plagues, although I think the biblical hailstorm was falling ice, not basketball sized meteorites. 'The Mummy' is at its core an action movie, and ultimately lives or dies by it, so quality special effects are essential.The stunts are as well, and the delivery does not disappoint. Several of them are good enough wow even the most experienced action fan, especially during a scuffle with the crumbly stone soldiers.The cast was mainly comprised of accomplished stage actors. All fill their assignments well, Weisz in particular. Vosloo does not speak a single syllable in English, but still impresses. All elements come together to take a complex world of rules and make it bona fide entertainment, so 'The Mummy' ranks as an eight out of ten.",8,1,2,5 June 2007
X-Men," X-Citing Movie That Changed Cinema Forever
","Thanks to the trend started by Marvel Comics' first movie, the comic book-movie genre has become the dominant force in the cinema. Marvel has planned four more movies leading to 'The Avengers,' 'Spider-Man 4' has been announced and a new Daredevil movie is rumored to be in the works. Christopher Nolan rocked the summer with 'The Dark Knight.' All of these movies are possible because of the legitimacy 'X-Men' brought to the genre.Patrick Stewart's opening statement explains that new mutations are causing the evolutionary process to take a giant leap. Members of the new species, derisively called 'mutants,' possess supernatural powers that cause some 'regular' humans to hate them. Congress, led by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), is considering a law that would require every mutant to register with the government as do sex offenders.A mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellen) survived Hitler's holocaust and worries that the Mutant Registration Act will begin a new one. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believes in taking every step needed to avoid violent conflict. Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Barry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who is also a physician, stand with Xavier. Magneto's followers are Sabertooth (Tyler Mane); who seems to hate Wolverine; Mystique (the lovely Rebecca Romijn) and Toad (Ray Park, who also played Darth Maul). Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and runaway teenager Rogue (Anna Paquin) are the newcomers to Xavier's School for the Gifted.Whereas movies such as 'Spider-Man' and 'Daredevil' contain two or fewer characters with supernatural powers, it can be easy for a script to grow excessive with the legion of characters in the 'X-Men' universe. Writer David Hayter, best known as the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video games, demonstrates good self-discipline. He and director Brian Singer limit the mutant count to ten. Although each possesses a unique look, 'X-Men' does not differentiate the characters on that trait alone. Only two wield similar powers, and the script includes a conversation distinguishing the two. The introduction of these powers provides much of the entertainment early. I watched the television show as a child yet was not familiar with some characters' capabilities.Some of the personalities are poorly realized, but Hayter and Singer compensate with small details such as Toad's quirky attitude and Mystique's sultry body language. Some have complained that Cyclops is boring. Judging by what I hear from the comic book enthusiasts, Marsden's character is translated on target. Cyclops' 'Mr. Morality' personality is much like Superman's. Unlike in the two sequels which totally cheated him, Cyclops plays a pivotal role in the story. Magneto is the most effectively developed character. His horrific childhood motivates him. He does not desire power or wish to exterminate all of humanity. He takes drastic action only when he cannot see better options.With the future of comic book movies in serious trouble after 'Batman and Robin,' 20th Century Fox allotted the production team only 75 million dollars. Some of the visual effects look shoddy and occasionally the timing is wrong such as during the incident where Wolverine is hurled backwards. That said, the fights utilize the mutants' abilities inventively and the choreography is above average. The only problem is the use of the hang-time error. The hang-time error occurs when a character flies threw the air, but does not fall closer to the ground. Thankfully, it appears only twice. The two outstanding scenes are Magneto's answer to a police siege and the Wolverine fights during the climax. The X-Men display good teamwork in their missions, especially at the end. Sadly, neither of the sequels comes close to matching it.Acting-wise, Halle Barry drew disapproval from the X-Men nation. She is not great, but not bad either. Apparently I am not familiar enough with the drawn character to know what causes the uproar. McKellen, Stewart, Jackman and Paquin perform the best. Paquin has the most demanding role. Most people seemingly do not realize how tough it is to show the depth of emotion she does in the climax without being corny. Wolverine is an angry and independent person. At times it looks like Jackman is readying himself to bite somebody. Stewart inhabits Professor X as well as he does Captain Picard and no other actor has the combination of appearance and acting specialty to better Ian McKellen's Magneto.Movies based on comic books had a bad name when 'X-Men' was released in 2000. Batman and Superman were the two franchises to come before it. Both eventually jumped the shark and into unfunny wackiness. 'X-Men' had to convince the public that comic book inspired films can still take their subject matter seriously. It did, and I assign the most credit to David Hayter. Although the series eventually jumped the shark itself, 'X-Men' stabilized the comic book movie with its skillful construction and sober but not somber atmosphere.",7,0,1,3 December 2008
Spider-Man 3," Another sad example of a trilogy gone bad
","It came to pass that in the age of comic books and film, no trilogy could be completed with the same directing team. Tim Burton gave way to Joel Schumacher, Richard Donner was replaced by Richard Lester who was replaced by Sidney J. Furie, and Brian Singer became a name of the past as Brett Ratner stepped into his chair. Then Sam Raimi swooped in to save the day with his Spider-Man movies. This unprecedented continuity should have made it the first superhero series to have a successful third film. It should have, but it did not.Sure, it is and will continue to be a smashing success at the box office, but from an artistic standpoint, it fails. The principals that made the first two films so delightful are not present anymore. The Spider-Man films have gone from an uplifting and unique experience to an exercise in gorging sensationalism and sliding standards.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally found the ideal balance between college, work and his responsibilities as the masked hero of the city. His grades are immaculate and he is ready to propose to his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Mary Jane has recently opened her career as a Broadway singer. He is about to receive the key to the city after rescuing Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the daughter of a police captain (James Cromwell). Life could not be better.That must change, of course, and this time the problem is threefold. First, Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to follow his father's footsteps and become the New Goblin. The second comes from an escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who is zapped by antimatter whilst fleeing from police, turning him into the Sandman. The third is a sticky mass of black spindles from outer space (CGI) that adheres to one of his Spider suits.The black 'creature' is an alien symbiote that amplifies anger and aggression in its host. Parker soon changes into a cruel, self-centered jerk. He wounds Mary Jane's soul deeply and repeatedly until he is at imminent risk of alienating her permanently.The most conspicuous problem with this film is the inclusion of too many antagonists. As difficult as it is to compress two villains into a movie, not to mention the Man vs. Self conflict that occupies much of the film, it grows more convoluted when Venom (Topher Grace) finally shows his face.The Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus were complex, carefully-constructed characters and had a large share of the movie to themselves. It was not until midway through the films that they first fought with Spider-Man, and much time and effort had been invested into the characters by then. The three villains here are in constant conflict for more screen time and none of them are given a fair portrayal. Venom in particular is badly cheated. He is probably the most well known Spider-Man adversary after Doctor Octopus, but he is only minimally seen in the waning moments. Even then, the camera never focuses on his face long enough to let the audience drink in the impressive visual it is.The film wastes no time with its first violent encounter, an aerial chase between Spider-Man and the New Goblin. It contains by far the movie's best action, but is hampered by problem number two; nobody dies once. We are teased and fooled too many times for the fabric of the film not to tear. Various characters are stabbed, drowned and blown up without fatal consequence. One character even hits his head with near decapitating force and falls to the unforgiving pavement yet survives. Perhaps they all received a gift from Wolverine.Sandman is another mammoth blunder. He is completely invulnerable to damage and grows so big Godzilla would be proud. He is literally twenty stories tall at one point and missiles only cause giant sand splashes. Raimi also rips off The Mummy by granting him the ability to disintegrate into a sandstorm. The special effects are so spectacular the Academy can probably hand the movie the Oscar now, but Sandman was never meant to be Imhotep, and the problem is literally too huge to ignore.The black Spider-Man segments go too far. We ended Spider-Man 2 elated that Mary Jane and Peter had finally discovered the true romance that had been growing for so long. Instead of a continuation of that element, the fledgling romance is systematically destroyed. The drama is undeniably good, but watching Mary Jane being shoved through the ringer over and over is extremely difficult to watch. The bridge scene is especially tough and had many in the opening night audience in tears, but this element is ill-timed and should have been put off for the fourth film.Even the action is not right. Most of the time, the camera is zoomed in so closely and travels so quickly that we can hardly take in what is happening and the problem is exacerbated by a plethora of quick cuts. It is confusing.Every such scene illustrates that Sam Raimi has changed his directing style. The Bond movies, for example, stand in contrast. Terence Young, Guy Hamilton, John Glen and Martin Campbell directed all of their films the same way. Only Lewis Gilbert changed, and the result was Moonraker and his ignominious end in the franchise.Stalwart regulars as J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Harris) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) are underused, which further distances the movie from its two predecessors. The second film ended with a hanging storyline involving Jameson that held great promise, but it is abandoned. There are strong themes of redemption and forgiveness, which along with the fine acting, particularly from Dunst and Church, help elevate the film, but its mistakes are too critical and numerous for it to rate any higher than a five out of ten.",5,2,4,12 May 2007
The Terminator," Read with me if you want to live...
","The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present.Tonight...With those words, the legend was born.Then the words fade. There are bright flashes. Out of the smoke rises what looks like a human being. But this is no normal human. Before long he yanks the heart out of a punk who refuses to give him his clothes. He feels no pain, no fear, no pity or remorse. He exists for one purpose only. He is THE TERMINATOR.A few miles away there are more flashes. From the smoke emerges Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a human warrior from the future sent to stop the Terminator from accomplishing his mission. What is his mission? For forty minutes we are left in suspense, until the full story is told. In the future, an artificial intelligence is facing imminent defeat at the hands the humans, who it nearly drove to extinction. In a last ditch move, it sent the Terminator back to the year 1984.Its Mission: Kill the future mother of John Connor, the leader of the human resistance. Wipe out his existence entirely so there will be no resistance.Her name is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). She is not rich, nor a genius. 'I can't even balance my checkbook!' she says, 'Do I look like the mother of the future?' But she is. And she is in great danger. Reese has to protect her at all costs, but he could not bring any weapons through the time warp. Nothing dead will travel back through time. How can you stop something that is indestructible?That, my friends, is the crux of what makes this so great. Bits and pieces of information about the future of mankind are dropped in the film's first half. Eventually we can piece them together. Director James Cameron helps us out with flashbacks, as we see the horrifying battleground of 2029 through the eyes of Kyle Reese.Once the exposition is done, the story refocuses on the troubles presently facing Connor and Reese. They can only hide so long before the tenacious machine tracks them down...and kills them.The main element, besides the story, which makes the movie so effective is the way it is directed. Cameron is one of the most gifted directors in the industry, that much is certain, and one of his fortes is pacing. He also co-wrote the script, allowing him to mold the step-by-step action to his directing. The result is a tight, gripping atmosphere with air of mystery and horror mixed in. The story is sound, and builds carefully, with the audience staying involved for both the exposition and the action. There is never a dull moment.The special effects are not very good, even for that day. The visions of the future are not too slick, and most shots of the Terminator's metal structure look fake at best. Still, Cameron finds a way to give his imagery impact and depth. The musical score is percussion heavy and synthesized, but what makes it work so well is that it's tenacious, subtly embodying the personality of the title character.As for the acting...well, Cameron is a great director there, too. Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the Terminator. His most haunting quality is the straight face he keeps while slaughtering anyone who stands in his way. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are wholly convincing, making us feel for their plight. The always likable Paul Winfield also gets in on the act as a police lieutenant.In the end, this is Cameron's movie to win or lose, and he uses all of skills to the fullest. Despite its shortcomings, 'The Terminator' is a winner. Perhaps I can finally forgive Cameron for 'Titanic.'",7,18,29,28 August 2003
The Bourne Identity," A New and Engrossing Hero is Bourne
","Jason Bourne is not James Bond. The name bears a remarkable similarity, as does the world the super-agent inhabits, but the parallels end there. Bond investigates and spies for his government; he possesses alluring charm, perfect confidence, detailed knowledge of his enemies, premeditated plans, and an ability to murder anybody without warning. James Bond seeks violence; violence seeks Bourne. Bourne has no desire to take others' lives, but wherever he hides, the bloodshed finds him. When it does, he has no choice but to use his lethal skills. 'I don't even know who I'm running from,' he laments. He must devise his next moves quickly. He is not charismatic and he has no swagger. The two JB's are completely different, but the brains and brawn behind 'The Bourne Identity' prove both styles can succeed.A fishing vessel off the coast of France rescues Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), unconscious and floating face up. He has been shot twice and has a laser pointer imbedded in his hip. When he awakes, his biographical memory is gone. The pointer provides the only clue to his identity--an account number to a bank deposit box in Zurich. He uses extremely advanced martial arts to escape intense situations, and what amazing skills they are. He strikes with a superhuman combination of strength, precision and awareness. He seems to have eyes in the back of his head. His environmental perception reaches extraordinary levels, but he cannot understand why, nor the reason somebody tries to kill him in Paris.A mysterious branch of the CIA does know. Its leader, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), fears the implications of Bourne being alive and causing commotion. From his basement war-room, he directs a team assigned to track Bourne and put him 'in a body bag.' After Marie (Franka Potente) drives Jason to Paris, Conklin adds her to the hit list for his specialized assassins (Clive Owen, Nicky Naude).Few action movies work well without a powerful villain. Physically, Chris Cooper is the perfect choice for Conklin. His perfectly slicked hair, bass voice, and face, which looks like the façade to a vault of experience, make the perfect image of a forceful leader. Cooper communicates a lot of information with his mannerisms, mostly while issuing orders with fire in his speech.The great part is that we don't just see him give the orders. We hear them explained, we hear responses from team members, we see the field agents receive their messages and prepare for action. Liman keeps us in the room when he hear his underlings report what they have discovered and how. We see him update his superior (Brian Cox) and discuss with him the next course of action. These scenes add a special flavor to the film.The action appears at an unusual pace, mostly during the first hour. The best are the fistfight in Paris and a car chase that soon follows. Liman follows the top rule for filming action. Do not try to manufacture tension with rapid fire cuts or fancy camera work; let the quality of the production speak for itself. Just find a quality angle to let it speak. It is sad that Paul Greengrass broke it for the two sequels. Only Alex Proyas has permission to that.What is on screen is indeed high quality. It also reveals another difference between Bond and Bourne. Evasion is always his first option. While being chased inside a building, Bourne throws away the gun he takes, the third time in the movie he does that. Even in the climax, he only kills the guards because he has no choice but fighting them. Acting wise, Damon plays Bourne straightforward, nothing fancy here. Damon is understated, the correct approach for a character of that personality, yet he remembers that even a hunted man can smile.Potente is an attractive woman, but that is not the point here. Marie's function is companionship and transportation for Bourne. She is more than a sex partner. In fact, Bourne chooses to sleep on the floor when they share a room. Potente also remains toned down. Brian Cox and Gabriel Mann (playing Conklin's top assistant) both bring what their roles need. Cox has his best moment when he tells Conklin 'You never made a mistake before!' Most impressive among the supporting cast is Clive Owen, who speaks volumes with his silence.'From Russia with Love' is probably the only Bond movie structured like 'The Bourne Identity.' Both are heavily plot and subterfuge focused. The payoff is far better in the former, but 'Bourne' excels more in its slow areas. By keeping a close eye on the details, Liman assures that no moment is boring. There are no Bond-like gadgets since Bourne has no Q to make them. He uses standard equipment in innovative ways. That is only one of the reasons why 'The Bourne Identity' wins in all categories.",8,3,4,6 August 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," Destroys all that is left
","THIS COMMENT CONTAINS VERY HEAVY SPOILERS!Anticipation was high entering May of 2003 when the first sequel to 'The Matrix' was released. Writers/directors Andy and Larry Wachowski redefined reality in the first film, yet fell victim to the impulse to do it again. 'The Matrix Reloaded' contained their shocking ending, but in doing so the Wachowskis altered their perfect vision beyond repair. That set the course for this film and all of its follies.1. Lack of time in the Matrix: The title is a bait-and-switch. It is called the matrix yet almost no time is spent there. I count five brief scenes: Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) meeting with the Oracle (Mary Alice), the invasion of the Merovingian's (Lambert Wilson) night club, Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Smith (Hugo Weaving) seeing the Oracle, the final fight between Neo and Smith, and the end meeting of the Oracle and the Architect (Helmut Bukaitis).2. No Agents: 'Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an Agent has died. I've seen an Agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.' Morpheus, 'The Matrix.' Back then, the Agents were scary. They are one of the primary reasons 'The Matrix' succeeded so greatly. They were invincible. Wherever there were people, they could follow. I remember my jaw dropping when Agent Jones avoided Neo's gunfire, and when Smith delivered impossibly quick punches to Neo's stomach, and when Smith was run over by a subway car, only to emerge anew from it seconds later. Instead of them, we are given a single gun battle against the Merovingian's henchmen.3. Zion's defenses: 'Electro-magnetic Pulseit's the only weapon we have against the machines.'-Trinity, 'The Matrix.' 'They can't know we don't have an EMP.'-Lock, 'The Matrix Revolutions.' Say what? Zion is the last human city and the center of human resistance. They do not even equip their entry point with an EMP while 250,000 sentinels are closing in? Wow, they are dumb.4. The source of Neo's power: 'The power of the One extends beyond this world; it reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.' The Oracle. 'Where?' Neo. 'The Source.' The Oracle, 'The Matrix Revolutions.' So the power of the one comes from the Source. Does he control the source? Does it control him? If that is so, why does the Source not revoke his power once he has refused his function? If he was working for the machines, why did the Agents fight him? 5. Virus Agent Smith: Star Trek survived without Khan. James Bond was just fine after Goldfinger. 'Batman Returns' made a huge profit without the Joker. This series would have flourished without Smith as a cheap Borg rip-off. The whole idea makes the Matrix invalid.6. The battle in the dock: Another sad example of writers contradicting what is established for the sake of an action scene they want. It is like Space Invaders; kill as many machines as you can before they overwhelm you. It is stupid and frustrating, only existing for the CGI. The main battle of the film should be in the Matrix, not out of it.7. The Architect: 'That's his purpose, to balance the equation.' 'Smith is the result of the equation trying to balance itself.' The Oracle, 'The Matrix Revolutions.' Does that mean that the Architect created Smith? Smith assimilates the entire Matrix. Could the Architect not see it? Why would he create a program that will destroy the Matrix, infect the Source, and then destroy the real world as well? These questions are raised but no answers are given. The plot becomes as mysterious as Wes Studi's character from 'Mystery Men' when it should be providing answers.8. The function of the One: 'The Agents are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors; they are holding all the keys which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.' Morpheus, 'The Matrix.' Now we know how the war can be won. Instead of winning the war, Neo can only help by the providence of Smith's existence.9. The Merovingian: Just what the hell is this guy's function? All he does is make random decisions. He even fights the Source by imprisoning the Keymaker. Then he holds Neo, the only person who can save him and everybody else.10. Seraph's inconsistent power: The agents are helpless before Neo's power. The Seraph was able to hold his own against the One, then struggles with the Merovingian's inferior programs. If they were as good as the agents, they *would* be the agents, so Seraph should have no trouble.11. The death of Trinity: If they were to kill Trinity, it should have been at the end of 'Reloaded.' When her life is saved, she becomes untouchable. Her salvation makes us root for her even more. I liked her from the beginning, and she grows more and more sympathetic as her love for Neo does. Killing her in an unheroic fashion kills the part of the trilogy's very soul.12. The Ending: Everything in the first film pointed to the One winning the war, not dying for a truce with a wicked enemy. That is *the* main reason that 'The Matrix Revolutions' was poorly received. Humanity only survives because of Smith's crusade. With their stupid decision regarding the ending of 'Reloaded,' the Wachowskis painted themselves into a corner. After villains like Agent Smith and the precise ruthlessness of the machine army, we want to see victory, not treaty. Great lengths are taken to ensure we hate the machines. The ending is what broke 'Reloaded,' and here it breaks the trilogy. The Wachowskis depriving the viewer of what they conditioned them to desire is unforgivable, Christ allegory or not.",2,3,6,7 December 2007
Armageddon," Does Michael Bay Want to Hurt Us?
","I felt an unpleasant, adrenaline-like sensation during much of the runtime of 'Armageddon.' That feeling was not from thrill, delight, joy or entertainment. It was rooted in anxiety. This movie was made to combat alcoholic hangovers. If some genius makes this an in-flight movie, such person should be arrested for violating the Eighth Amendment.I propose a new law--no more 'Meteors Heading for Earth' movies. 'Meteor' focused on the diplomatic aspect and failed to entertain while 'Deep Impact' highlighted the plight of a few dysfunctional people on Earth. That latter is so painful to watch that I wished the meteor would hit quickly so we could all get on to more enjoyable tasks such as catheterizing ourselves.After a comet plays bowling ball with the Asteroid Belt, several displaced rocks reach Earth, conveniently hitting only our largest cities. I call them homing space rocks. Yes, it is a *comet*. NASA uses the term meteor, but meteors are smaller than asteroids. Meanwhile, trouble is brewing on Harry S. Stamper's (Bruce Willis) offshore oil platform. When he finds his daughter (Liv Tyler) in bed with A.J. (Ben Affleck), he chases A.J. around the facility with a shotgun. Apparently he is not aware of what happens if his shot penetrates an oil pipe.NASA director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), who should switch last names with Stamper, selects Harry and his crew to drill a hole in the *comet* and insert a nuclear bomb to split it and deflect the two halves away from Earth. Harry and his crew (including Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson and Ken Hudson Campbell) learn to be astronauts in 12 days. While the training scenes last far too long, they are the most interesting part of the movie. The shuttle is piloted by William Sharp (William Fichtner) and Jennifer Watts (Jessica Steen). A Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare) joins the party when they refuel.Boring and annoying describe the movie's first half, but once they enter space, the assault begins. Upon landing, the crew discovers that the *comet* is prone to earthquakes. The smaller the solar body, the more unstable the tectonic plates, I suppose. In any case, a lot of commotion and destruction ensues. Director Michael Bay creates and edits it as aggressively as possible. Different shots are strung together at incredible speeds while lights flash and an extreme amount of sparks fly. The acting mainly consists of people shouting at each other and running around in near-panic while the music raises the hyper-scale to maximum. 'She's gonna blow,' 'the clock is ticking' and 'we have no time' dominate the dialogue. Only Stormare and Thornton stay calm enough to act well throughout; others have their moments, but not many.What equipment NASA has created! The shuttles, ground vehicles and space suits are apparently made of flexible diamond. They take repeated beatings but remain in fine working condition, except when the script calls for something to blow up. Amazingly, Sharp has trouble disarming his own bomb, which only reminded me of a better scene in the video game 'Max Payne.''Armageddon' may be Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay's answer to 'Independence Day,' but they forget that ID4's main strength was that it spent more time resting than moving. Bay tried for a stand-up-and-cheer ending, but 150 minutes of loud, hostile movie-making does not give me the urge to cheer for anything. 'Armageddon' is the definition for 'sound and fury signifying nothing.'",2,0,3,12 November 2018
Die Hard 2," This Time, Nothing Can Mute the Greatness
","In 1988, 'Die Hard' became a surprising success with only a 28 million dollar budget. Less money was spent on Timothy Dalton's two Bond movies, and they are not as daring as their immediate predecessors. With more money and confidence from 20th Century Fox, the writers and producers went to work on the sequel. 'Die Hard 2' is bigger and better. It is not better because it is bigger, but because Renny Harlin is the director and writer Steven E. de Souza shows more self-discipline.'Die Hard' is well-made with far above average action, snappy dialogue, a top-echelon villain, sets that augment the mood, and Michael Kamen's helpful music. It would receive an instant recommendation if not for the gathering of idiotic characters (my review mentions eight) led by Paul Gleason's police chief. Here, we only have two: police Captain Carmine Lorenzo (Dennis Franz) and returning news reporter Dick Thornburg. Lorenzo is not as omnipresent as Gleason's Dwayne T. Robinson. de Souza exerts more control over Thornburg's interfering powers and makes his actions slightly more reasonable.Intrepid Los Angeles policeman John McClane (Bruce Willis) is in Washington D.C. spending the Christmas Holiday with his wife Holly's (Bonnie Bedelia) family. He arrived before Holly and awaits her arrival at Dulles Airport. When a group of outlaws plays havoc with the flight tower, McClane once finds himself in the center of deadly standoff. He sees the repeat situation as atrocious luck, but his misfortune turns out to be the good luck everybody else needs that night.Harlin explains the situation to the audience over a news broadcast, but the crux is that former South American ruler Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) has been extradited to face drug trafficking charges. His plane is to land at Dulles that night. Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) sees the situation differently and demands that Esperanza be handed to him in exchange for control of the tower. Holly is on one of the planes lacking enough fuel to go to another airport, so John places himself 'on the playing field.' John McTiernan photographed the action in the first movie well. Against Renny Harlin, however, he loses. Harlin is one of the most adept action directors in history. There is not one bad second during the six action scenes. Harlin uses zoomed out angles to best exhibit the spatial relations between the combatants and the environment. When they are firmly in our minds, he combines close-ups with his longer distance shots for maximum effect. Next, he incorporates even wider shots to complete his masterful presentation. When Stuart and his men are throwing several grenades, Harlin accomplishes with one angle what most directors need three or more to equal.He utilizes only one jump scene. Most often, he allows us to see what likely will happen before it does and builds our anticipation by waiting a few more seconds to finish his trick. The brawl outside a church is a prime example, as are McClane's lethal finishers in the luggage room and skywalk shootouts. Harlin also takes his time during Colonel Stuart's 'lesson' to the control tower. That particular scene will shock anybody who does not know about it before their first viewing. Sadly, I am not a member of that group. All of the other scenes provide a prelude to the finale, which is not very long, but showcases Stuart like never before. I was so impressed when I first saw that I went back and watched it twice more after the movie finished.William Sadler uses his large eyes and prominently boned face to help give Stuart a chilling countenance. Few can look stern as well as Sadler can, and he can convincingly shout without yelling. Stuart ranks third on the Die Hard villain list, but not because Sadler or the written character are weak. Thomas Gabriel and Hans Gruber are simply exceptional villains played by two good actors giving career performances.If one argued that nobody could have played McClane better than Willis, I would agree. He is not distressed if only his wife is hurt. He treats any loss of innocent life as failure, and Willis lets us see the anguish and fury when it happens. Willis carries an innate toughness and common man charm, so he does not need to act for those traits to shine. Bedelia does not have quite as much time as before, but as soon as we learned that their marital problems have been fixed, it becomes much easier to for her to sell us the character.Most importantly, Franz is not featured as prominently as Gleason was. Lorenzo is still an idiot, but not to the extent of Dwayne Robinson. I do not like Franz because his parts here and in 'NYPD Blue' reflect disgracefully on the 98% of good policemen in our country. Lorenzo cost this movie its ninth star, and it would have cost it more if the character had more screen time. Fred Dalton Thompson is good as usual playing Lorenzo's boss and watching Art Evans is fun.The overall cast performs better here than in any of the other three John McClane movies. de Souza has a poor resume but would have a far better career if he had replicated this success. 'Die Hard 2' is action at its core, but the other elements such as lighting, set design, plot and, of course, acting which transcends the genre, are in full force. Give Harlin talent, money and anything resembling a good script and he can make a most superior product for anybody who can handle the content. I hope another 'Die Hard 2' is in his future.",8,1,3,24 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," My Quantum of Solace for this Movie is Zero
","Ever since I was old enough to gain admission to PG-13 movies, I have always made sure to attend the newest Bond movie during opening weekend. Never before have I been so upset. Albert R. Broccoli produced every James Bond movie from 'Dr. No' to 'GoldenEye.' He would be ashamed of what his daughter Barbara and stepson Michael G. Wilson have done to Bond. A large faction of fans has become concerned that James Bond has been altered beyond recognition. I have advocated patience. 'Casino Royale' is intended to document how he becomes the character we all love. However, there is no acceptable reason for what 'Quantum of Solace' does with him. Sadly, the paper shredding job done to the character is not this movie's worst sin.James Bond was always an immoral man, but fights for worthy values greater than himself. He has committed himself to protecting England first and the rest of humanity when needed. He does not murder because it amuses him or provides fulfillment. He fights to save lives and improve the quality of those lives. James is a protector of all that is good in this world. 'This is about stopping a war,' he tells Wai Lin in 'Tomorrow Never Dies.' If one watched the 21 Bond movies and took notes, they would find 200 quotes and decisions demonstrating that aspect of his character.The people behind the 22nd throw that into a dumpster. This James Bond resembles Star Trek's Khan minus the intelligence. He is a man ruled by wrath and bitterness now. His mind has become so distorted by bloodlust that he begins to act like the Punisher. The consequences of his actions are hinted at in the trailer, but what the movie bludgeons its viewers with is even worse. 'Is this how you treat your friends?' wonders Camille (rising superstar Olga Kurylenko). For the first time, Bond is unlikable.The least coherent of the preceding 21 movies is 'Octopussy.' That movie is a model of clear storytelling next to this 225 million dollar plane crash. 'Quantum of Solace' is not a movie. It is a collection of action scenes glued together. Did they conceive the action first and then meet for 60 minutes to decide how to connect them? The movie has James globetrotting with the speed of a terrified cheetah in fast forward. The script is full of pointless dead ends that receive and inordinate amount of attention. The villain, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) has friends in high places, but his connection to them, their motives and the benefit of their partnership are not clear.Early reviews indicated that the plot is poorly explained and tough to follow. I prepared myself for that possibility, but was disgusted by the severity that fault. 'Quantum of Solace' opens with a car pursuit. Who is chasing Bond? How do they know where he is? Why were they in that location in the first place? The movie does not consider those questions. A foot chase soon follows, but who Bond is chasing and how he connects with what transpired right before are a mystery. The entire movie is sloppy, and no other Bond movie even approaches it. 'Quantum of Solace' is no easier to understand than 'The Chronicles of Riddick.' Marc Forster made his name with high-quality, low-budget dramas. 'Quantum of Solace' proves that action movies are a galaxy out of his depth. The action does not border on incomprehensible; it is absolutely incomprehensible. Forster shakes and jerks camera so violently that its holder should have shredded tissue at every joint, if not broken bones and torn muscles. Paul Greengrass introduced the earthquake-camera. Forster raises the Richter scale to 10.His errors do not end there. Forster's edits the action with such speed that were this movie a sprinter it would make Usain Bolt look sluggish. The average shot length during the action is far under a second. His shots are from a variety of angles and distances. Following the action is like climbing Mount Everest. Forster's editing and cinematography are so dreadful that I had trouble determining who is who during a fight involving two men *wearing completely different colors*! Their positions in the environment and in relation to each other are literally impossible to see. In Greengrass' 'The Bourne Supremacy,' Jarda and Bourne are similarly dressed during their scuffle and it is not difficult to tell them apart. 'Quantum of Solace' required an enormous budget. Forster nullifies all the money and effort put into the action. What a costly waste! Daniel Craig's James Bond is far more immortal than any to come before. At least two hundred bullets are aimed at his car during the opening chase. Most are fired from close range. Predictably, Bond remains unharmed even though the car is pummeled. At least Pierce Brosnan always drove heavily armored vehicles during these chases. The science fiction elements in 'Die Another Day' created drastic animosity among many vocal Bond fans. 'Quantum of Solace' is an equal offender. MI-6 uses audio-visual equipment imported from the Star Trek movies. Their display panels look nearly identical to Zion's in the Matrix sequels. M (Judi Dench) comes a quarter-step away from talking to a computer.Even a villain of historical proportions could not have saved 'Quantum of Solace.' Dominic Greene is among most boring in the series. The movie is in such a rush that Amalric has little screen time. He can not save Greene; nobody could have. His grand scheme borders on moronic. If the producers want to emulate Bourne, hire Doug Liman and sack the current writing trio. The end provides a beacon of hope that the real Bond will soon be back, but that does not excuse a dismal movie. The series has jumped the rails, and I hope it has not jumped the shark. There can be no solace for the cheated fans.",3,4,7,16 November 2008
Batman Begins," The Batman Movie Made the Right Way
","'Who is Batman?' Riddler asked in 'Batman Forever.' It is a question the writers of the first four Batman movies never attempted to answer. 'Batman Begins,' a film completely separate from the previous four, centers itself around answering those questions: What motivates him? How does he feel about his choice of how to live his life? Why did he make it? How does he regard the people he protects? What about the people he fights? Are they even people to him? Most importantly, 'How did he become Batman?' Tim Burton's and Joel Schumacher's versions of Bruce Wayne were blurry silhouettes. The same applied to the villains. For the first time, Wayne is now a genuine character, as are his friends, enemies and strangers. Among all that Christopher Nolan's movie does right, that aspect is the most crucial.Few movies have an acting lineup like Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Ken Watanabe and Morgan Freeman. Very good to great performances are normal for this group, except perhaps Holmes who was a huge name at the time. The foundations of good action are a strong story and characters who make us care about the outcome. Most of the above names have strong eye for good scripts and are also capable of making average writing appear better. The writing here is greater than average, and the whole cast gives performances worthy of their names.Speaking of names, it is one of the most important facets of Wayne's story, as his father Thomas (Linus Roache) was the most respected man in Gotham City. His life changes when he sees his parents murdered. Bruce (Christian Bale) refuses to forgive the culprit. 'Your father would be ashamed of you!' declares his childhood friend Rachel (Kate Holmes) when she realizes the extent of Bruce's hatred. By the end of the movie, the word ashamed has been replaced with proud.Christopher Nolan reportedly told his crew that 'Batman Begins' would be filmed like Blade Runner. In fact, it is Tim Burton's movies that bear a closer resemblance. This film, in contrast, has many more scenes shot in daylight, the natural colors are allowed to show, and its villains are not bizarre looking pillars of hatred. Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne was reclusive and gloomy; he stumbled over his words and exhibited little personality. Batman was viewed as a burden and curse. Here, Wayne's transformation to Batman sheds the curse. He is articulate and lively, possessing people skills missing from Keaton's version. He has anger, but he is not an angry man. Instead, it comes from his passion for justice.Wayne travels the world trying to understand criminals, but ends up in prison himself. Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and the League of Shadows rescue him and train him at their monastery. He next returns to Gotham to use his training to defeat the pervasive crime and corruption. His first target is Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), not only the most powerful criminal, but the most powerful man in the city.Aside from showing the shaping of Wayne's character, the movie invests time into the literal creation of Batman. It does so by introducing the new character of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman, who along with James Cromwell is one of my two favorite actors). Details such as how he built the Batcave, acquired the Batmobile, and created the Batsuit are not merely glossed over. We see Alfred's (Michael Caine) active involvement in the process. This act of the story is never boring and not a moment is wasted.Aside from Falcone, the main villain is Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy). Wilkinson flawlessly captures Falcone's belief in his unconquerable power and malice towards all who disagree with him. Equally successful is Murphy. His Crane is a soft-spoken yet dangerous and manipulative individual. Alfred is not as passive and grandfatherly as before. He is younger and more dynamic this time, but his love and concern for Wayne and his family is as real as ever. Holmes makes Rachel a strong-willed woman, and gives a more effective performance than she ever did in 'Dawson's Creek.' Surprise, this writer has seen a few episodes of that show.All of this provides the context for the action, which unfortunately is the only area where Nolan comes close to fumbling the ball. It is varied and creative in its concepts and settings. I think the stunts are great. I use the words 'I think' because Nolan makes it impossible to see much of what is going on. He often zooms the camera in very far, at times moving it too quickly for the eyes to focus. He accompanies this with many, many quick cuts. The result is a choppy, incomplete perception. There are times when the shot is far enough away and pauses long enough to see what is going on, and it looks entertaining and skillful. Aside from the Batmobile chase, those moments are too sparse.Even so, the movie succeeds on all levels, including the action. All of the small successes mix into a solid product in every area. I really enjoy how the movie shows the maturation of the Wayne's beliefs and attitudes. 'Batman Begins' sticks to its message. Well conceived and created in all ways, this is the Batman movie I have waited for my whole life. Thank you, Christopher Nolan, thank you.",8,1,2,9 July 2008
The Transporter," Starts at 80 degrees, ends at 20 below zero
","Meet Frank Martin. Martin (Jason Statham) is a retired British Special Forces officer currently enjoying retirement in France. Well, sort of retirement. Frank actually makes his living by transporting goods or people from one location to another. His services have made him a millionaire many times over, evidenced by his oceanview palace. The two-tower structure comes complete with fancy gates, a brick driveway, a garden, two kitchens and even an elevator. In his pristine garage resides the only love of his life, a perfect BMW. His services come with three rules: the deal never changes, no names, and never look in the package.The movie begins when Martin arrives with perfect punctuality outside of the world's richest bank. He is to whisk three robbers to safety, but four emerge. Citing rule number one, Martin refuses to leave and calmly explains why he cannot carry four men. The lead robber puts a gun to his head, but without the ignition code, he cannot drive. Checkmate. The panicking leader executes the fourth man.Martin starts the car and is pursued by police in a wild chase through busy streets and narrow alleyways. Dodging and swerving his way to safety, Martin outsmarts the police in the film's high point. This car pursuit has drawn comparisons to a similar scene in The Bourne Identity.The movie only rests for little while, and then it is on to his next job. His contact explains the job, then says, 'It is for a man named...' 'No names,' Martin interrupts, reiterating his strict adherence to the rules. The client's name is Wall Street, I suppose, since he is only addressed with pronouns. The cargo is large bag to be fit in his trunk.While tending to a flat tire on the way, he notices his 'cargo' squirming. Curiosity gets the best of him, and he discovers a hopelessly bound girl (Qi Shu) with her mouth sealed shut as well. He has no sympathy and completes the deal, but when his customers double cross him, he enacts revenge and the hostage ends up in his home.The girl, Lai, is grateful for the help and stays with him though she is free to leave. However, her former captors are not too happy with her current quarters. 5,000 bullets later, she informs Martin that she was smuggled in from China as part of a human slavery operation and many more will follow.Up until this point, the film is performing admirably, but once it's second half commences, the wheels begin to fall off one by one. The chemistry existing between Statham and Shu in the first act quickly evaporates. Not even the discovery of Martin's conscience works.We are led to believe that Lai's father (Ric Young) is one of the slaves, but we later find out that he is the mastermind behind the operation. This new discovery throws into question why Lai was in the bag in the first place, and raises many other questions as well. The film never gives its audience the courtesy of answering those questions, and it feels as if Luc Besson is making it up as he goes.The action also goes down the toilet. It mostly consists of Frank being confronted by a group of ruffians and knocking them to the floor. Each man rises up to fight again, and every time he has them beaten more henchmen appear and join the fray. His reluctance to use lethal force is astounding. The invulnerability of every character completely undermines the effectiveness of everything the film wants to do, and reduces it to the level of Beverly Hills Ninja. The climax involves Frank parachuting onto to a semi-truck in an attempt to commandeer it. It is boring, and reminded me of how much more I enjoyed the semi-truck chase in License to Kill.Statham flourishes as the amoral Martin and Qi Shu fares well as the confused and vulnerable young girl in strange surroundings. Francois Berleand is satisfactory as a friendly but suspicious detective, but has no interesting material. Matt Schulze falls flat in embarrassing fashion with his lifeless treatment of Wall Street. Ric Young is equally bad. Even Shu, who probably set the record for time being bound on camera, becomes a drone in the second half.Cory Yuen is better than this. Luc Besson is better than this. Moviegoers deserve more than an action film that slowly destroys itself. The first half warrants a good score, but what follows is so putrid that The Transporter rates only a four out of ten.",4,11,14,4 March 2007
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Solid Entertainment Despite not Matching the Original
","With the serious inflation of movie ticket prices this decade, it can be easy to lose historical perspective on the popularity of older movies. 'Jurassic Park' shattered the box-office money record by over 150 million dollars. It has since been passed nine times, but truly was one of the great cinematic events in history. Director Steven Spielberg's movie employed more realistic and intricate animatronics than any previously seen. Its Computer Generated Images (CGI) revolutionized special effects. The T-1000 from the second Terminator film had been the crowing achievement in visual effects to that point; 'Jurassic Park' showed humans and technological illusions interacting in ways far exceeding anything that came before. If it were released as is, those images might earn Oscar Nominations today. A sequel to such a groundbreaking and competently made film comes with titanic expectations. When 'The Lost World' is judged by its own merits, a lot of good comes to the surface. It does not match its predecessor, nor does it need to for satisfying entertainment.Sam Neill and Laura Dern do not return for the sequel. Thankfully, Jeff Goldblum does. Golblum's Dr. Malcolm lightened 'Jurassic Park' with his pithy summaries of the various situations. Some were sarcastic; others told the truth in an amusing way. Goldblum knows the correct approach for a man completely unaware the humor inherent in his words. The sequel misses the characters who do not return, but Malcolm is indispensable. 'Jurassic Park 3' proves how mundane Neill's Dr. Grant is without Goldblum around.Richard Attenborough is the only other actor to return. Again he plays John Hammond, the mastermind behind the dinosaur amusement park. Attenborough has the same exuberance and ready smile as before. He is more reserved since Hammond is older and not as healthy. He was 73 when the movie was filmed, but his performance makes Hammond seem ten years younger.Hammond grew Jurassic Park's dinosaurs on another island. One day, a wealthy couple stops on the island and some small dinosaurs injure their daughter (Camilla Belle, who has had some lead roles since). Hammond's nephew Peter (Arliss Howard) uses the incident to dissolve his uncle's power. Hammond knows that Peter will 'pillage' the park, so he summons Malcolm to request his presence on an observation team. Ian bluntly refuses, but a new development changes his mind. Meanwhile, Peter prepares his own team for a trip with less noble aims.Since all but three characters know what creatures are on the island, the wonder and amazement factor is mostly absent. Instead, the movie generates pathos for the dinosaurs. A cruel hunter (Pete Postlethwaite) breaks an infant T-Rex' leg and ties him to the ground. The animal's wails of pain and cries for his parents tug on the heartstrings of anybody who has a four-legged pet. The movie includes an extended scene of people mistreating frightened animals who wish them no harm. Even Dr. Malcolm, who plans to kill any dinosaur at the first sign of trouble, has moral issues with that behavior. When two other members of the observation team (Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn) make a critical error, the situation becomes far more dangerous.I will not comment on the ending except to say that it is a puzzling decision by the writers. It left many people scratching their heads. 'The Lost World' did not approach the box office total of its predecessor as sequels to popular movies typically do. The final half hour may have generated some poor word of mouth or discouraged repeat business. In any case, it is unnecessary.It would have been better to prolong the main portion, which contains more carnage than the first movie. The two best scenes are the 'cliffhanger' problem and the final confrontation with the raptors. The quality of the raptor scene meets Steven Spielberg standards. It is the cliffhanger, however, that equals anything the first movie offers. Young directors should observe how Spielberg films them. He uses many extended shots to best demonstrate the relative locations and actions of the characters. He prefers long, moving shots to quick editing. Goldblum provides the lightness with his comments. He has the most fun during Malcolm's radio conversation with an unpleasant lady. Spielberg and Goldblum elevate a movie that could have been a major disappointment. With them, 'The Lost World' earns seven marks from a possible ten. Without them, it would be a disaster.",7,0,1,2 November 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," And X-Men Jumps the Shark
","EXTREME SPOILERS FOLLOW! CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED! 'We are betraying the very principles upon which the Federation was founded,' states Jean-Luc Picard in 'Star Trek: Insurrection, 'It's an attack upon its very soul.' That same statement applies to 'X-Men: The Last Stand.' 'Insurrection' is based on the moral dilemma quoted above. Too bad 'The Last Stand' features no conflict so compelling. Worse, it is not the characters who betray the X-Men concept, but the writers themselves.The protracted, somewhat convoluted ending, of 'X2' has resulted in the most peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants to date. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), a furry, blue mutant who can float in the air, presides over a new department in the President's (Josef Summer) cabinet. Magneto (Ian McKellen) has fled with his two associates and Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is flourishing. On the bad end, Cyclops (James Marsden) cannot recover from the death of his girlfriend and the day both Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto dread has arrived. Pharmaceutical leader Warren Worthington (Michael Murphy) has invented a permanent cure for mutations. This is not Kryptonite to Superman. Kryptonite works only at close range, and no mutant can boast Superman's invincibility.The supernatural abilities of otherwise normal people comprise the foundation of the entire X-Men world. Remove a skyscraper's foundation and it falls upon itself. These circumstances can be compelling if they are never more than a threat, but making it a mass-production weapon is like detonating charges inside the skyscraper's foundation. If there is another fictional series in which fans sit still for that, I will be surprised. Introducing the weapon on a minor mutant would not have been as bad, but making Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) the first victim deprives the audience of one of its favorites.'X2' ended by setting up the Dark Phoenix story arc. Her inclusion is as serious a misstep as the cure weapon. Killing Cyclops in the first 10 meters of the sprint is bad enough, but the problem lies in the entire concept. Superman cannot be defeated without kryptonite, but it still takes work for him to defeat even the simplest foe. Defined as a 'Class 5,' Phoenix (Famke Janssen) can defeat an army literally without moving a single muscle. It takes more than computer effects and mass destruction to entertain a mature audience. The NFL would not be popular if the quarterback could stand completely still and throw a touchdown pass every play. It would be incredibly boring. When a character can win with no effort, it ceases to be entertaining. The visuals are hardly special, either, despite the fact that 'The Last Stand' cost more to make than the first two X-Men movies combined. The Phoenix destruction effects are similar to the Sandman effects in 'Spider-Man 3,' but far inferior.Finally, killing Professor Xavier is an unforgivable sin. The manner in which he dies is nearly as disturbing. If he died saving the planet, or attaining a permanent peace, it would not be as bad. He dies in failure. From the popularity standpoint alone, that is like killing Q in the James Bond movies, Alfred in Batman, or Luke Skywalker or Yoda in Star Wars. What is the X-Men's home called? It is called Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Not Wolverine's school, nor Storm's, nor Iceman's. Professor X is credited second and first, respectively, in 'X-Men and 'X2.' Even though he is not a lone hero like Bond or Spider-Man, Xavier is the wheel around which all the other characters turn. The X-Men start disbanding after his death. From the importance standpoint, it is like killing James Bond himself and then giving his mission to 008. The writers try to undo their action by giving him a new body after the credits, but that just adds insult to injury. Xavier has been the same for over 40 years, and two rogue writers do not have the right to change him or be licentious with his life.Wolverine's healing factor is much different than before. In 'X-Men,' it took several seconds for him to get back up after being ejected through a car windshield. Here, the Phoenix blasts him so badly that we can see parts of his skeleton. Losing flesh that quickly should be fatal even for him, but it takes about second for him to fully regenerate. The climactic action contains some neat ideas and sleek execution. However, the long awaited battle between Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) is about as unimaginative and juvenile as I've ever seen. I had better ideas when I was 12. Roger Ebert wrote in this review of 'X2' that he imagined them standing in hot water. They should have consulted him before using the simplest concept that came to mind.'X-Men: The Last Stand' suffered from a shortened production schedule, and it shows up in the lack of polish in the dialogue, the substandard nature of many action scenes, and the shallowness of some character development. Still, its enormous problems cannot be blamed on circumstance. I realize that the character of the Phoenix and the concept of the cure come from the comics, but not every idea in their hundreds of issues makes a good story. Even with that considered, killing Professor X and giving him a new body after the credits is the worst of many ways that 'X-Men: The Last Stand' jumps the shark.",1,0,2,27 August 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," What Should be a Run Turns into a Sprint
","I was admittedly not optimistic when I heard that the runtime of the new Fantastic Four movie is a mere 92 minutes. The inclusion of the Silver Surfer means that Galactus, the omnipotent planet eater, will also appear. Their story is long and complicated, with a hoard of powers, rules, subtleties and motivations. It would probably take a three-hour movie to cover the arc without rushing. Even a two-hour affair would have to make cuts, but at ninety minutes there is no hope for an adequate treatment. Galactus is nearly omitted from the movie, and Marvel Comics fans expecting to see the most powerful being in the universe will be resoundingly disappointed.I took part in a play called 15-minute Hamlet as a drama student in High School. While 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is not so extreme, it races to finish itself as if running for the pole at a NASCAR event. Some James Bond fans dislike 'Tomorrow Never Dies' because, they assert, it moves too quickly, yet it is a two hour movie. I slammed 'Total Recall,' for over killing its premise to the point of boredom, but even that film is 113 minutes long. High velocity is fine for the Silver Surfer, but his movie should be deliberate, not supersonic, to justly tell its story.As Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) prepare for their wedding, several meteors slam into Earth creating environmental anomalies such as frozen lakes and power outages. In marches General Hager (Andre Brauger) who begrudgingly asks Richards for help. Reed soon ascertains that the Silver Surfer (Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne) is responsible and he and his team endeavor to find him and solve the mystery.The situation complicates when Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch (Chris Evans), has his molecules disrupted by touching the Surfer. Then there is the matter is Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), the all-metal villain from the first film. A diligent workman is shown chiseling his petrified body. The Fantastic Four defeated him by rapidly heating then cooling his body, so cracking of his inner parts is the problem, not a hard layer. What a circular saw can do for that problem is a question the movie prefers not to answer. General Hager also recruits Doom, but Reed's warning that Doom is not trustworthy is soon proved right.There are more dramas, including Reed and Sue questioning their future plans. The one and only problem with the film is its minimal treatment of all its content. Neither the plot nor the conflicts contain any inherent errors, and just ten more minutes of movie would help them greatly. Despite Galactus' near omission, enough material exists to cover another half hour.The acting is sadly not as inspired as it was in the first film, where the chemistry among the leads made the whole operation work; only Kerry Washington is as good as before. Alba, Evans and Chiklis are all comfortable in their roles, but lack the same gusto I saw in 2005. The Surfer barely speaks; Fishburne could have recorded his voiceovers on his lunch break.The minor roles, however, are horrendous. I hated Andre Braugher in 'Frequency' and hate him here too. He has one acting approach: frown, droop his cheeks, and say his lines with no expression or dynamic. His army colleagues are equally boring. One of Hager's top aides is Johnny's latest target for flirting, but their chemistry is so cold it could freeze Han Solo all over again. 'Fantastic Four' was filled with clever uses of the teams' powers, but the new movie is bereft of such ideas, except when Johnny beats up Doom in the climax. 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' does not treat itself with enough respect to rank higher than a four out of ten.",3,0,1,12 July 2007
Transformers," What a Career Change for Bay
","Michael Bay has directed seven theatrical films now. For a long time he was a trash director. Before 'The Island,' he had five to his name: 'Bad Boys (1995),' 'The Rock (1996),' 'Armageddon (1998),' 'Pearl Harbor (2001)' and 'Bad Boys II (2003).' Only 'The Rock' is not deplorably bad, and the other four sometimes border on unwatchable. I refused to see 'The Rock' for a long time, but did on the advice of a friend, and after seeing it, I felt that Bay could be a legend one day if all of his films were that good.Bay has now increased his record to three for seven. 'The Transformers' is a first rate Science Fiction film that abundantly brings action, drama, computer visuals and inventive sound to the screen. While I contend that 'The Matrix' did not deserve its visual effects Oscar, I give no argument to its sound effects award. 'The Transformers' employs equal inventiveness and raises sound effects to a level never achieved before.The most challenging effects are the complex transformations themselves. They take place so quickly that it is impossible to see most detail, but the ear has no such limitation and the terrific sound sells the illusion. I look forward to the DVD release so I can discover how many creative noises were used in the symphonic cacophony of sound (how's that for an oxymoron?).The brilliant audio is not limited to the transformations. A transformer named Frenzy attacks with hurled blades with a distinctive hum that will be tattooed on my mind forever. The transformers' voices are all mechanized and deepened, yet easily distinguished from each other. Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from 'The Matrix') voices Megatron and his voice is altered so well that I could not tell it was him, yet their speech is easy to understand. There are a host of other examples like the whizzing of Scorponok's blender hands, the hum of Starscream's jet engine, the sound of the robots' computer hacking, missiles zooming through the sky, shockwaves, and the crunch of metal beings striking one another.The opening narration explains the premise. 'The Cube' can create planets and fill them with life. On the transformers' home world, a group called the Decepticons used the Cube for evil, and the entire planet was rendered lifeless in the following war. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) scour the stars in hopes of destroying the Cube to prevent the Decepticons from ravaging other worlds.Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf) is the grandson of an arctic explorer. The explorer found the frozen Megatron, leader of the Decepticons. Megatron's followers come to Earth and believe that the Cube is here and Sam holds the key to finding it. An Autobot named Bumblebee locates Sam and protects him until his comrades can arrive.Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense John Keller (Jon Voight) gathers the most brilliant computer students in the country to identify who hacked into their defense system. One of them (Rachael Taylor) asserts that an artificial intelligence did, and is bluntly dismissed. Witwicky picks up Michaela, the High School belle (Megan Fox), and they are both thrust into the crisis when Bumblebee fights a Decepticon disguised as a police car. Another Decepticon destroys an airbase in the Middle East.Complicating the matter is Agent Simmons (John Turturro) of Sector 7, a secret group whose existence is unknown to even Secretary Keller. This point is where the film works against itself. Simmons knows enough to realize the scale of the threat, yet he takes the simplest course of action--arrest the Witwickys. No questions, no thinking, no planning, just barging in with handcuffs. Simmons waves his 'do anything I want and get away with it' badge in their faces like a power hungry child. Optimus Prime frees the family, but when the largest SWAT team comes out of nowhere, the Autobots no longer help, even when the government peons capture Bumblebee.'Why should we protect them?' protests Autobot Ironhide, 'they are a primitive, violent species.' When I heard that line, I almost agreed with him. The government had made its noose and placed it around its necks, and were about to jump. It all works out, of course, when Keller intervenes, but suppose it had not. The Decepticons might have won. I have no problems with Turturro's work, but I hate seeing him on screen since he seems to always play idiot of the decade.I wrote in my review of 'Spider-Man 3' that the Academy could hand it the visual effects Oscar. After seeing the awesome climax, I have to reconsider that statement. The sand effects in the Spider-Man film were more impressive, but nearly the entire finale here is computer created, and it is long. It is sometimes hard to follow who is who, since only Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, Megatron and Starscream have their own personalities.Were it not for Agent Simmons, this film may have received a ten star score, although I wanted to see more of the Optimus, Megatron fight. The human characters exceeded my expectations and the setup allows a strong foundation. In any case, Michael Bay is now a respectable director, and I look forward to his next film.",8,0,1,23 August 2007
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo puts Mission Impossible into nosedive
","One term that we critics like to throw around is 'Train wreck of an action film.' It would be nice to deploy such a phrase in this review, but that would not be fair. A more appropriate term would be 'Plane crash,' or perhaps '65 car pileup.' This is eye candy for the blind. The plot is so confusing that after three viewings I now realize that it made no sense in the first place. The first movie also had an impenetrable plot, but at least I could piece it together by forming my own explanations where it had none. With this, I have to form explanations for my explanation and theories for my theories. On my third viewing, I predicted, with near infallibility, what the next scene was and what dialogue was to take place. Yet I still could not come up with sound fill-in for a plot which sports more holes than Swiss cheese.Just how was this allowed to happen with such an anticipated blockbuster? Is it not logical for the studios to be extra careful that these projects are done right? If that was what they wanted, then they sure picked the wrong director.That man was John Woo, who in this case demanded that the script to be written around action scenes he wanted to film. The result was a herky-jerky final cut that ran a ludicrous 3 1/2 hours, which left the good folks at Paramount Pictures with two uninviting options. They demanded drastic cuts, the surest way of wrecking a film. Still, it was better than shelving the project completely.The plot of the movie is...why bother? Tom Cruise plays the good guy, Dougray Scott plays the bad guy, Thandie Newton plays a romantic interest to the good guy, and Richard Roxburgh plays the world's toughest twit. Scott wants to acquire a bio-weapon for evil, and Cruise wants to use it for good. The battleground is Sydney, Australia.Beyond the plot exists the action and the acting, both of which were deprived of the quality they deserved.Acting: No cast will look good when John Woo is the director. He carries his films with artsy direction and a martial arts overdose. From an acting standpoint, his directing is pathetic. Tom Cruise may be a convincing actor in his other works, but not here, thanks to Mr. Woo. Thandie Newton's character is lacking greatly, but it would probably be a sin to condemn her acting skills based on this role alone. She does have a dazzling face, though.The only person who seems immune to the Woo curse is Dougray Scott, who plays one of the most ridiculous characters in the history of the motion picture. There is no doubt that his character is evil, but he is so overboard it is almost laughable. There is one boneheaded scene where he severely cuts the finger of his 'best friend' and most trusted ally. I am yet to figure a good reason for him to do that. The movie does not seem to notice, as the next day his friend is back on the job, loyal as ever.Action: For this, Woo uses slow motion more than real time. Not only is this incongruous, but it interrupts and destroys otherwise good action. Not that it matters, since few people really care by the time Good Guy and Bad Guy are at each other's throats. I almost feel bad, now, for ripping 'Charlie's Angels,' in my review.  At least that was harmless fun. Between this and 'The Avengers,' I have seen nearly every rule of good filmmaking violated before my eyes.Sidenote: I am actually looking forward to the sequel, seeing that Joe Carnahan will direct. Hopefully he will take note of what went wrong with the first two, make the necessary corrections, and make a solid film that we fans can enjoy.",2,1,2,18 August 2003
Mission: Impossible," A good idea that is its own worst enemy
","The plot of 'Mission Impossible' is like a defective fireman's trampoline. It is painstakingly stitched together, reinforced and strengthened. Like a faulty apparatus, however it stretches and breaks under the sheer weight of what it is supposed to support.I can explain the entire plot of this movie. I viewed the movie recently after seeing it five or so times before, but the difference was that it had been four years since my last viewing. With the aid my previous experience, I was finally able to connect all of the dots and see the whole picture. Contrary to popular belief, every facet of the story is explained, but not clearly so. In the end, it is like somebody viewing a complex tapestry through a pair of fogged glasses.I noticed a curious coincidence when I watched the theatrical trailer. A point was made to show all of the violent moments of the film. The images include mid-air acrobatics, fights, chases in the street, gunshots, exploding cars, guns being loaded, a woman being slammed against furniture, people clinging to the outside of a bullet train and an exploding helicopter. The impression is that of an exciting action film; the movie itself is not. The trailer even makes Henry Czerny's character look like the villain when he is not.The Impossible Mission Force, or IMF, is the most elite branch of the CIA where failure results in the repudiation of all knowledge of the operation. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of an IMF team led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, in the role originally played by Peter Graves). Phelps is absent for the first operation, an elaborate deception used to coerce a confession. Jim's wife (foreign film actor Emmanuelle Béart) is under anesthesia for the act, and the team is worried that she will die from being under too long. It seems logical that the IMF would not risk the life of an agent without an anesthesiologist present, but never mind.The team's mission, which they choose to accept, is to catch a traitor attempting to steal the NOC List, which matches undercover code names with the agents' birth names. All but Ethan are killed, and the director of the CIA (the aforementioned Henry Czerny), believes that Hunt is an agency mole since he is the only one to survive, although Claire is soon discovered to also be alive. After his escape, Hunt contacts the list's potential buyer (Vanessa Redgrave, highly respected international actress) and agrees to steal the real McCoy so he can discover the identity of the man who betrayed him and his team.The problem is that the plot does explain itself thoroughly, but does so in such a convoluted and roundabout fashion that it leaves heads spinning like tops. There is one section where the mole is lying and trying to shift the blame to another. During this time Hunt is saying and thinking competing versions, and the result is confusing so nobody is sure what to believe. If you want see films that have complicated plots but explain them with marked clarity, watch 'Star Trek VI' or 'The Maltese Falcon.' It is bad enough when the casual moviegoer is baffled, but when Roger Ebert says he cannot pass a test on the plot, the script has some serious problems.The other issue is the movie's inability to define itself. Despite the sales pitch of the preview, there is little action to speak of. It is really more of a suspense film, but by misrepresenting itself, it limits its potential. The two famous scenes involve the theft of a computer program from an impenetrable vault and the finale when a helicopter is attached to a bullet train and gets dragged into the Chunnel (an underwater train tunnel connecting England to France, for those who do not know). Only three bullets are fired, and none of them by Hunt.The acting is mostly pedestrian. Only Czerny and Voight, and to a lesser extent Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, stand out. Czerny is deliberate and Voight is especially effective with the delivery of two lines, 'if discovered, they'll be executed,' and 'They stamped it didn't they? Those damn Gideons!' Yet, for some reason, I enjoy it. It is probably the ingenuity of the vault theft and helicopter finale. Despite its significant flaws, it has a real sense of fun and some wit in the dialogue. It will disappoint fans of the original series and people expecting lots of action, but it is just good enough to rank a six out of ten.",5,0,1,11 June 2007
Total Recall," Too much of a good thing.
","'Total Recall' is an adaptation of a popular Philip K. Dick story combined with the touches of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Paul Verhoeven. With a multifaceted story involving repressed memories, a repressive dictator and a stolen identity, the potential was there for a classic exercise in thrill that would offer more than just spilt blood. Under a more ambitious director, it could have been terrific, but instead it falls into the mire of repetition and tedium.The film is set in a future where the world is divided between two warring factions, one of which has colonized Mars for mining. Vilos Cohagen (Ronny Cox) is the appointed head of the planet and rules with a tyrannical hand. On earth, we are introduced to Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker married to the woman of his dreams (Sharon Stone). The only blemish on their marriage is his constant dreams about Mars and a mysterious brunet that inhabits them (Rachel Ticotin). Hoping to settle his mind, Quaid visits Recall Inc., a highly unusual travel agency that implants the memory of a vacation. However, the implant awakens another set of memories before it can be fully downloaded.Dazed and confused, Quaid tries to figure out why he has such strong memories of the red planet and why people are suddenly trying to kill him. The theory is that he was a spy on Mars, but somebody went to great lengths to erase his past. The scene is complicated by the appearance of Richter (Michael Ironside), a vicious hit man on Cohagen's payroll.Not surprisingly, the stunts are directed by Vic Armstrong, arguably the best in the business. His credits include all three Indiana Jones films, 'Last Action Hero,' the acclaimed sword fight in 'Rob Roy' and the last four Bond movies. 'Total Recall' is no exception. Every stunt and fight scene in the film, all 300 of them, are made with great skill.Unfortunately, the film dives head-first into overkill. Not fifteen minutes into the film, the first attempt is made on Quaid's life, leading to a brutal altercation. From there on, the action never stops. As more and more violent encounters occur, the film grows weary and flirts with monotony. The same sequence ensues in a subway station, at customs, in air domes, hotels, strip clubs and gubernatorial mansions, among a hoard of other settings. I truly lost count of the times that Richter's men attack, gunshots fill the air, enough bad guys are killed to give Quaid a crease to run away, and the process resets itself. Then there is the psychotic cabbie who just won't leave us alone.One of the hang ups with action films is the reality that too much of it can and will grow boring. By the time the climax comes, the viewer has had more then their fill of violence and loud bangs. Instead of cheering for the good guys, I was cheering because the film was about to end.To test that sentiment, I had a good night's sleep, and refreshing morning shower, then skipped up the final scene. I was taken aback by how exhilarant it was when it seemed so pedestrian the night before. One part in particular, an all-out brawl on an elevator, reminded me of the original classic in 'From Russia With Love.' Thankfully, the acting is good in the few moments where the film slows enough to have some. Arnold himself is less of a featureless tough guy, as he sometimes is, and more human. He feels rage, confusion, love and sadness. As far as true acting, 'Total Recall' is one of Arnie's finest moments. Also notable are the vicious Ironside and the lovely Sharon Stone, who makes her mark every time she moves her intoxicating eyes. My favorite performance, though, came from Roy Brocksmith who plays a recall doctor in one scene and steals the show when he is on camera.Had the story been handled more skillfully and the action not been so pervading, I would have loved 'Total Recall' and recommended it without second thoughts. Even an action junkie is likely to be exhausted by the extreme overdose. Towards the end of the movie, I had an inspired thought about none other than Quentin Tarantino. After his decision to split 'Kill Bill' into two films, he came under fire for using a coercive marketing ploy to double his money. Seeing what too much action can do to an otherwise worthy effort, was his choice not the right one?",6,2,7,17 January 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Delivers What it Promises, No More, No Less.
","If nothing else, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' put a big smile on my face. When analyzed, it might seem to be its own enemy. The script and musical choices prevent the action from being truly tense or awesome. Writer Simon Kinberg piles the scintillating quotes and revelations on top of the action, which undermines its ability to enthrall. The music is totally inappropriate for a normal action movie. None of that is a problem, because 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' does not have the same goals as they do. It is exactly what the title says it is, and that is not 'Ultimate Deception,' or 'Married Assassins.' The movie begins innocently in a marriage counseling session. The therapist (William Fichtner) makes basic inquiries such as marital satisfaction and sexual frequency. His clients do understand the questions, reminding me of Spock's puzzlement towards 'How do you feel?' at the beginning of 'Star Trek IV.' They are, of course, John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, or Bradgelina). The two do not communicate well. John always appears preoccupied and Jane apparently lacks the language to express her feelings. Despite their positive responses to the marital satisfaction query, they act nonchalantly towards each other. Since both are professional killers and neither knows it, they are unable to open up to each other as they live their numerous lies. 'There's this huge space between us, and it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other,' laments Jane as answers escape her.'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' does not skimp on the setup, nor does the violence quickly follow their revelations of each others' real careers. The amusement continues as the movie plays coy with how they intend to resolve the dilemma. Possibly the best laugh comes when John arrives home for dinner and sees a most unusual item on the kitchen counter. The swanky dinner is a close second. None of the humor is presented in the Monty Python/Mel Brooks 'I put it right in front of your face, now laugh' manner. It is merely there, hiding in plain sight waiting to be eaten layer by layer as one would a gourmet cake.John Powell's score frequently employs accordions and violins harmonizing in happy movements. The absence of music can push the tension higher. The classic Bond vs. Grant fight in 'From Russia with Love,' and Bond vs. Janus brawl amid the finale of 'GoldenEye' come immediately to mind. Most high-impact tussles are scored with loud, quick and intricate music employing prominent guitars, violins or horns, which is what most expect as Brad Pitt leaps through a threshold and into action. The contradictory elements assure the more fun, light-hearted feeling to the movie's marquee scene.Try as they may, John and Jane cannot deny their feelings for each other. The entire movie works around that concept. The true climax is not the final action scene. Angelina Jolie continues to amaze me. She creates more genuine tears than most actresses can, and repeatedly does so in goofball scripts. Her talents extend far beyond a pretty face and popular body. The action icon won an Oscar and played the lead in 'A Mighty Heart.' Pitt plays the relaxed but serious character he does so wonderfully, but sometimes speaks too softly. Director Doug Liman repeatedly fails to amplify his voice. Both Pitt and Jolie use their strengths to embody their characters' massive internal conflict.The rest of the acting is passable, except for Vince Vaughn, who works well with the resident oddball. His character, Eddie, lives with his mother and gives a pretty convincing argument as to why. Vince shows his comedic gift, but he is not as sharp as usual. Keith David's near-absence is disappointing.I had no idea what to think when the credits rolled at the conclusion of my first viewing. Upon further review, I appreciate the white picket fence approach employed. Pitt and Jolie were not just big name castings, but inspired choices who drew upon their budding love for each other to build a solid cornerstone for the rest of the picture. It is never difficult to root for them. I tend to prefer action movies with more vicious feels; nevertheless, I am happy I saw 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' and will continue to enjoy more viewings in the future.",7,1,4,15 September 2008
Die Hard," Remarkably Good Movie in Nearly Every Way
","'Die Hard' is an ingenious marathon of claustrophobic and acrophobic action. It features superior action, a script sparkling with great lines, stalwart characters in the three biggest roles, high-quality sets, and a neat Michael Kamen musical score. The greatly successful careers of Alan Rickman and Bruce Willis can be traced to 'Die Hard.' Sadly, one recurring mistake prevents it from reaching its awesome potential and ruined the movie for me my first several viewings.Nearly the whole movie occurs at Nakatomi Plaza, a beautiful property with a skyscraper at its center. On the 30th floor, an innocent Christmas Eve party morphs into chaos upon the arrival of Hans Gruber (Rickman) and his twelve-man squad. While posing as a terrorist taking hostages, the wily Hans really seeks the treasure in Nakatomi's vault. Mr. Gruber has planned one of the truly perfect crimes, except for the one element nobody could have predicted.Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia), who is Nakatomi Corporation's Vice President, has invited her husband John (Willis) to the Christmas party. John is not merely a police officer, but one with exceptional skill and toughness. The terrorists cannot take control of the people quickly enough to prevent McClane's retreat to the unfinished upper floors. With John now roaming in the building, Hans's criminal master plan goes from flawless to critically endangered.I cannot say much about the action that has not already been said. It is great, no question. Some Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of the time contain more brutal violence. I prefer Indiana Jones or Timothy Dalton's Bond movies for quality, but any superiority those movies have is small. Fans of automatic weapons in movies have plenty to feast on here. Few people know the name Charlie Picerni, who was a stunt coordinator for several famous television shows before working 'Die Hard.' His effort here deserves special mention, as does cinematographer Jan de Bont's. It is no surprise that their careers have been successful since.LAPD Detective Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) joins McClane and Gruber in the trio of main characters. All three rise above the level of average hero, supporter, and villain. 'Die Hard' wisely takes pauses from the tense moments to let those three characters rule the movie for awhile. One of the movie's best scenes comes when McClane tearfully admits to Powell that he regrets never saying the words 'I'm sorry' to his wife. Michael Kamen effectively tones down his memorable and often grandiose musical score to fit these scenes.With all of the high praise given so far, and 'Die Hard' deserves every word of it, there is one huge problem. It is called Idiot Plot Syndrome. Roger Ebert is known for using it, although he did not coin the term. When a plot has easily solved problems but they take way too long to solve because most of the characters are idiots, the movie is infected with Idiot Plot Syndrome.'Die Hard' puts on an idiots' convention. Let's consider Idiot Number One. McClane plans to lure the police to Nakatomi Plaza any way he can. With the phone lines cut, he uses a radio to report the hostage takeover. The brilliant 911 dispatcher completely ignores the report of terrorists with military weapons because she prefers to argue that the channel is reserved for emergency calls. Even machine gun fire loud enough to hurt her ears is not enough to punch reality through her lead skull into her stubborn brain.The police eventually arrive, and with them Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason). Robinson readily accepts every possible explanation except the real one. His stupidity is not too bad at first, and actually plays a critical role in advancing the plot. It becomes annoying when he sees what is really happening and fails to wise up. He even hates McClane after he saves the lives of multiple officers because he does not like how he did it. Even worse are Johnson and Johnson from the FBI. If FBI agents honestly think losing 25% of a group of hostages is acceptable, I want to change countries. Then there is the coke snorting brownnoser who works with Holly, turkey television reporter (William Atherton), and the hack doctor who describes 'Helsinki Syndrome' on the evening news. I could go on.When I saw 'Die Hard' the first time, I had no idea if the movie was supposed to be a rousing action thriller, and action comedy, or a parody. The action is too hard hitting to be absurd, but the supporting characters are too goofy to be taken seriously. As a result, I did not enjoy the movie as an action or a comedy. I was confused and annoyed. I ended up frustrated with a movie I should have loved. Without Idiot Plot Syndrome and the misplaced humor it brings, 'Die Hard' would certainly rate an eight of ten, and probably a nine. As it stands, six out of ten is all I can fairly award it.",6,2,5,10 March 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Bad acting, bad writing, a horrid ending, and Hollywood Bait and Switch
","There is a nice little idea for a thriller wrapped up in the first thirty-five minutes of the third Die Hard film. Too bad it only lasts that long.A beautiful, peaceful morning in the Big Apple is suddenly disturbed by a bombing at a department store. Barely do the police have time to gain their bearings when a call comes in from a man called Simon (Jeremy Irons). He wants to play a game of Simon Says with our beloved hero John McClane. Non-compliance will result in a 'penalty'--another bomb going off somewhere in the city.His first stop is Harlem, where must wear a sandwich sign bearing a racist slogan never seen in Harlem. When his life is saved by a man named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), Simon says that he too must run all over town solving his deadly puzzles.'Die Hard With a Vengeance' was promoted with the premise I just described, only it turns out to be the Hollywood equivalent of bait and switch. After a mere three puzzles, the focus shifts to a far inferior plot and deconstructs all the tension that has been built in the movie's first third.Following the explosion of one of his bombs in a Wall Street subway station, Simon threatens to destroy a school. The bomb will respond if the police use their radios, so the ever intelligent police chief floods all police traffic through 911, and sends out the entire police force to search schools for the bomb. In other words, there could be a full-blown gunfight and the cops would never know about it.While the police run around like chickens with their heads cut off, Simon, who has about a hundred men at his disposal, begins to rob several billion dollars from a federal bank. This is all detailed in an overlong and uninteresting section played to the tune of 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home.'Unfortunately, the use of car sales tactics is not the film's worst problem; it is the characters, most specifically, the character of John McClane. In the first film, he worked for the New York Police Department and was trying to got transferred to the LAPD as soon as he could. In the second film, he was LAPD and any marital problems from the first film appeared to be water under the bridge. Now, he is a once again a New York cop, his wife lives on the opposite coast, and he is one step away from a life steeped in alcoholism. In other words, all the time we spent rooting for John and Holly to overcome their marital problems was wasted. I am of the opinion that if Hollywood studios cannot find a consistent, positive way to treat their characters from one film to the next, then they have no business making a sequel (see 'Speed 2').Samuel L. Jackson is probably one of the best actors in Hollywood right now, but the limitations of the material are evident. It is awfully difficult to care for Zeus because of his heavy racism (do not let his heroic actions in Harlem fool you, he had an ulterior motive). Likable or not, he easily outshines the rest of the cast, especially Willis, who benefits from several one-liners that are funny on paper, but delivered in a way that robs them of all comic appeal. One question: If Zeus is such a smart mathematician, then why is his vocabulary so limited?Jeremy Irons is well below average as the villain. He starts out in convincing fashion when only his voice is present, though the dark tone he used to voice Scar in 'Lion King' is curiously missing. Once we see his face, the character loses all impact. It is shame that Simon was not treated more like Kiefer Sutherland's baddie in 'Phone Booth,' who, if you remember, was not seen until the end. Of course, this would have meant sticking to the main premise of the film, apparently a task too large for the makers.Speaking of the end, 'Die Hard With a Vengeance' is devoid of excitement for the last half hour. I will not discuss the final scene except to say that it is not usually a good sign when a film forgets about seventy some characters it makes a point of showing on camera. Oh, and I still have not figured out how the trucks got past the border.Plot holes like this can be overcome with good acting but was there any to speak of? A tiny bit. Aside from Kevin Chamberlin's rarely seen bomb expert, the film's best acting comes from Alan Rickman, the bad guy from the FIRST 'Die Hard.' He is briefly seen in a flashback.",3,5,18,13 October 2003
Con Air," I Know How I Can Live Without It
","Jerry Bruckheimer may be gold at the box office, but he owns a spotty record when it comes to quality. For every 'National Treasure' and 'The Rock' exists a 'Bad Boys II' or a 'Pearl Harbor.' 'Con Air' is shoddily made. The screenplay insult many viewers with its stupidity. Were it not for the 'What Next?' factor, it would crash as ignominiously as its main device.The 'What Next?' factor is present when the hero finds himself in a seemingly impossible situation and is constantly frustrated in his attempts to solve it. In this case, it is a friend (Mykelti Williamson) in need of life-saving medication. He will die in two hours unless injected with insulin. Diabetics and their friends will shake their heads in disbelief when they hear that.Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), a former Army Ranger, is paroled after serving eight years for killing a man who was attacking his wife. The US Marshal Service transports him home on a plane full of 'the worst of the worst' en route to a Super Max prison in Alabama. The legal base for his conviction is baloney at best, but the filmmakers needed a reason to put Mr. Perfect Morality on the plane.Three of the convicts concoct an elaborate plan to gain control of the plane: Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich), Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), and Pinball (Dave Chappelle). They succeed and plot course to a foreign country, but must make two stops first: Carson City, to pick up the son of their money source (Jesse Borrego), and a remote airfield to board another plane. Anybody who caught those details on the first viewing deserves one-hundred dollars.Many other characters, too many to name, join the party. The notables are Guard Sally Bishop (a surprisingly attractive Rachel Ticotin), 'Swamp Thing' (M.C. Gainey, in an annoying performance), and serial rapist Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo, who cannot act to save his life), who desires to make Guard Bishop number 24. On the ground, US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack) deals with a DEA hothead (Colm Meaney) who wants to destroy the plane and all the innocent people on it. Malloy has a worse attitude than half of the convicts. Most resemble professional weightlifters. Realistically, they would be in solitary confinement, where there is no access to an exercise room.'Con Air' contains a surprisingly small amount of action. Only two such scenes last more than a few seconds, neither are impressive, and they both come at the end. The filmmakers place their hope in the many explosions. Explosions are not enough to carry an action movie, especially one not set in space. Besides, director Simon West makes most of them difficult to see. The end credits show all of the major characters smiling, right after the plane crashes on the Vegas strip, likely killing over 100 people.Only two characters experience any change. The first is Malloy. The second is Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), who murdered 37 people in a way that 'makes the Manson family look like the Partridge family.' Strangely, Greene is the nicest person on the plane. When he approaches a young girl, he acknowledges that he is sick and sings a Christian song with her. At the end, he is the only convict not killed or captured. How are we supposed to feel? Has he accepted Christ? Has the girl's kindness changed his heart? I didn't know whether to be upset or happy.'Con Air' has little to applaud. I had to see this movie more times than I would like so I could piece together its confusing and poorly-explained story. West had no concept of how to photograph action; he would greatly improve for 'Tomb Raider.' Outside of Cusack, Malkovich, Buscemi and Chappelle, the acting is awful and the music is worse. What writer Scott Rosenberg probably intended as an excuse for action scenes prevents 'Con Air' from truly stinking. It does not, however, earn it a recommendation.",5,3,6,28 July 2008
Speed," Come along for the ride!
","Following an enjoyable business luncheon, several high-ranking employees get onto an elevator in a 40-floor building. Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), who has wired the elevator's cables and emergency brakes with C4 explosives, sits in a freight elevator elsewhere in the building. After blowing the cables, Payne informs the police that unless 3 million dollars is paid to him in 60 minutes, he will detonate the brakes as well. Officers Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are ordered to examine the bomb, and end up saving all of the elevator's passengers, thwarting Payne.Just days later, Payne contacts Traven. Howard has concocted a new game, and this time he wants 3.7 million. A Los Angeles city bus has been wired with a bomb that will arm itself when the bus reaches 50 miles per hour. Once it falls below that speed, the bomb will detonate. If there is any attempt to evacuate, Payne will detonate the explosive remotely.'Speed' is without a doubt one of the truly great action films of the 90s. It is grandly suspenseful and sucks the viewer in for one thrilling ride. The aggressive soundtrack is superb, as is Jan De Bont's directing. From the elevator job, to the scene of the rogue bus hurtling through the streets of LA, to the phone dialogue between Payne and Traven, to the awesome climax, 'Speed' remains true to its hypertension-inducing form.In a similar manner, the movie presents the effect of the crisis on the innocent hostages. It presents them as normal, everyday people thrust into an extreme situation. Sandra Bullock delivers her usual strong performance as a commuter who ends up driving the rigged bus. She is the only passenger who is not one-dimensional, but even with the others frozen in their simple roles, we feel like we are on the bus with them. This creates an ideal atmosphere to tell the story in.As the lead, Keanu Reeves performs well in all facets of his role. He comes across as a complex person whose different strengths and personal qualities come into play in the various situations he encounters. His acting talent is often called into question, but his portrayal here is strong and leaves me wondering why so many are hard on him.As the antagonist, Dennis Hopper comes through with possibly the top performance of his celebrated career. It is hard to imagine anybody else playing his part at the same level. Payne is one of the most potent villains I have ever seen. He is a brilliant and well-prepared man. Howard Payne trails only Elliot Carver for villain of the decade.All of these ingredients add up to an outstanding film worthy of multiples viewings. From exceptional stunts and pyrotechnics to the intense plot, 'Speed' appeals to all categories of action fans. 'Speed' will treat the viewer to a capital thrill. It not as good as they say. It is better.",8,2,4,14 March 2003
Live Free or Die Hard," Escorts Die Hard to its Highest Level
","The fourth Die Hard movie was announced in 2003, eight years after John McClane's last screen adventure. There was no apparent progress for next two years. Rumors abounded, such as Jessica Simpson playing McClane's daughter or the two being caught in a terrorist action in the Caribbean. I had my doubts that this project would ever be completed. Even when filming began I was pessimistic, feeling there had been too much turmoil by that time. I saw the film, and have rarely been so delighted that I was wrong.I do not recommend two of the first three Die Hard films. The first would earn a nod, but too many idiot characters ruined it, and the third is awful. I wanted to see this one nonetheless because I had become endeared to John McClane (Bruce Willis). Willis returns and does so well it seems like there was no twelve year gap between films.McClane is once again a detective in the NYPD. He no longer abuses alcohol, but suffers anxiety over the well being of his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Lucy shuns her father and insists she be called by her mother's surname.When the control center at the FBI is temporarily disabled, Bowman (Cliff Curtis), the director of computers, issues orders that every hacker capable of the attack be brought to Washington DC for questioning. McClane, now a respected and trusted officer, is asked to transport New Jersey hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), but runs into trouble when he realizes that somebody desperately wants Farrell dead. That same person activates the anthrax alarm at the computer center, alters the stock market, and penetrates every computer database in the country. His shadow group transmits its threat to the public and pandemonium ensues.The leader (Timothy Olyphant) keeps watch from his hidden command post while he conducts the country like his personal orchestra. He can use public surveillance cameras to see anywhere in the country, alter natural gas lines, reroute telephone calls, confuse public service, control traffic and more. When McClane and Farrell flee into a tunnel to escape his helicopter, he floods cars into the tunnel from both sides. Farrell believes this faction is using a three step takeover scheme called a 'fire sale.' He realizes that his help may be invaluable since the terrorists may be using a program he wrote.I have asserted before that films can violate the laws of physics without harm, but once they violate the laws of common sense they lose credibility. This film is a fine example. McClane's body takes a physical beating and he is still able to fight. It is, after all, McClane's adamantine tenacity that lends the title 'Die Hard.' As for the other token, the villain's scheme is frighteningly well-planned. Olyphant's character, whose name I am withholding since it is one of the film's revelations, makes excellent points defending his deeds. I was almost convinced until I was reminded how much destructive chaos his behavior causes. There is only one problem with his plot, and that is McClane.Olyphant's villain is intellectual and well spoken, just like Hans Gruber from the original 'Die Hard.' Olyphant grants uncanny life to the page and creates a character even more imposing than Gruber. When he is flustered, we believe him; when he can barely control his anger, we believe him. The villain is just as resourceful as McClane and is a first ballot hall of fame antagonist.As an actor with stage experience, I look at performances differently than the average viewer. I am less concerned about whether or not it should be Oscar nominated than I am towards success within the demands of the character. Indiana Jones is not as difficult to play as Charles Kane, for example. These people are rehearsed professionals and we are not viewing their rough draft. The average Hollywood acting is better than most people want to admit. With that said, most of the performances are above average. Cliff Curtis looks so stressed out I wonder if he needed relaxation therapy when filming concluded.It is Willis' movie, but Justin Long comes as close as possible to outshining him. Farrell's expression is suppressed by the overwhelming nature of the situation, yet Long nevertheless brings distinctiveness to each emotion within those narrow walls. Willis has the more gripping screen presence, but Long is clearly the better actor.The one exception is Winstead. She is the perfect physical casting with her resemblance to the child Lucy, but her lack of emotion is too pronounced. Winstead spends most of her time flex cuffed but seems insufficiently distressed by it. Her acting is below average.I worried that the action would be truncated when I saw the PG-13 rating, but that is not the reality. The staging and choreography are even more praiseworthy from a technical standpoint than they were in the first three. We all know McClane is wrong when he advises Farrell not to bet on him. He has, after all, killed nearly every one of the terrorists at every type of location by that time. There is even the villain's lover (the attractive Maggie Q) who is even more immortal than McClane. One such encounter involves a car slipping down an elevator in a clever reference to the highlight of 'Jurassic Park 2.' Only a highway scene with a Harrier jet does not quite work, but at least it is fun to watch.The superb execution helps, but the action's context is equally important to adding impact. Repeating all that was good in its predecessors and omitting the bad, 'Live Free or Die Hard' entertains far beyond the typical summer action movie It can eat the first three for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and rates a nine of ten.",9,1,4,1 August 2007
X2: X-Men United," Excellent Movie until it Wears out its Welcome
","Focus is an important word. The first 'X-Men' movie has it. It is a short movie but carries a simple plot and has no unessential moment. The sequel is full of such moments. The characters are now established so there is more room for fun. Second chapters can use that to their advantage. 'From Russia with Love' is the best of Connery's Bond movies. 'Tomorrow Never Dies,' which comes after 'GoldenEye' re-introduced Bond to the public, is the strongest one starring Pierce Brosnan. 'The Empire Strikes Back' remains the pre-eminent Star Wars movie, and 'Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' are the fan favorites. All of those movies had focus. 'X2' gets so wrapped up in itself that it does not know when to quit.THIS IS YOUR WARNING TO STOP READING IF HAVE NOT SEEN THE FIRST MOVIE.'X2' begins where its predecessor ends. Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains incarcerated in a plastic prison; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos), still masquerades as Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is checking out a location that may be the key to his past. Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Barry) and Jean Gray (Famke Janssen) continue to teach young students at Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) School for the Gifted. Rouge (Anna Paquin), Bobby aka Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and John aka Pyro (Aaron Stanford) are among the best students.A mutant attack on the President (Cotter Smith) shatters the peace between 'normal' humans and their mutant kin. Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), a man with Hitler-like hatred of mutants, seizes the opportunity to attain authorization for a raid on Xavier's school. At his side stands Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), a mysterious mutant whose cooperation stems from reasons initially unknown.For the first three quarters, 'X2' is markedly better than its predecessor. Character interaction is briefly put aside in favor of story setup, but its strength from before remains. The subtitle 'X-Men United' indicates that this will not be a typical X-Men story. Everyone knew that a third chapter was coming, so we have an easy time accepting these sacrifices. Sadly, an axe-murderer mangled the dead-on-arrival third installment.The opening White House scene sets a high standard for the action and the writers develop Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) into one of the movie's most complete characters. Wolverine gets his first berserk scene. Many mutants have their own showcase moments: Bobby's ice wall, Banshee's ear-bone-busting scream, and Colossus' beat down of the military are some examples. The most awe-inspiring is Pyro's excessive assault on the police.The final assault on Stryker's base contains the best moments. It is at this time that writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter do not know when enough is enough. The action ends at minute 96 and the major conflict is settled at 99. That leaves nearly 30 minutes of dead space before the credits. A plot contrivance extends the act, but even that takes only a few more minutes. I am not averse to character time. The first movie is my favorite and it has the most.Cox turns Stryker into a more-than-memorable villain. Jackman again proves why he is the best actor to play Wolverine. The other standout is Kelly Hu. She mainly has to act with her face and does so flawlessly. It helps that she is a finalist for most beautiful woman on the planet.The movie has a lot of glass balls to juggle, but after the Wolverine/Deathstrike fight, they all fall to the ground and shatter. The interminable ending includes one more contrivance with cheesy special effects. The anticlimax causes 'X2' to fizzle long before it is over. Only because a majority is so great do I give it a recommendation.",7,0,0,29 October 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Somebody Give Greengrass a Steady Camera!
","Minus one horrible production decision, 'The Bourne Supremacy' would stand above its two peers as the best of the trilogy. The plot holds less relevance to the overall arc of Jason Bourne's life than the other two. It is also, by no small margin, the most complicated and involving of the three. Matt Damon gives his most successful performance. The pacing of the action brings a more even movement to the affair. Unfortunately, a *monstrous* misstep by director Paul Greengrass places ankle weights on 'Supremacy' as it tries to run.Writer Tony Gilroy had to discard most of the plot from Robert Ludlum's novels. Real-life assassin and terrorist Carlos the Jackal, Bourne's main literary antagonist, was apprehended in 1994. He now lives in a French prison, rendering Ludlum's story lines useless. Its replacement for 'Supremacy' deals with a leak in CIA money and the resulting cover-up.Two years after the events of 'The Bourne Identity,' Jason Bourne (Damon) resides in India with his lady Marie (Franka Potente). After an assassin (Karl Urban) botches an attempt on his life, he assembles all his weapons and phony passports. His next destination is Germany where he seeks his only known contact from the now defunct Treadstone project.Meanwhile, turbulence abounds at the CIA. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) prepares to receive documents naming the insider who embezzled 20 million CIA dollars. Both seller and buyer are murdered. Crime techs lift Bourne's fingerprint from the area, so Landy suspects that he may have come out of retirement to hide his involvement in the crime. The two investigate the same case from different ends, and what they unearth will surprise and distress them both.Chris Cooper played the villain in the first movie, and 'The Bourne Supremacy' suffers from his absence. His successor initially appears to be oil billionaire Yuri Gretkov (Karel Roden). It is he who arranged the failed murder of Bourne. He only appears four times, and two of those scenes are quite short. Roden also lacks Cooper's panache. That leaves Karl Urban's killer, who is not intended to be a lively character and is also missing from the center section. Landy is Bourne's primary antagonist, but she is not a villain. As she tirelessly pursues Bourne, she never allows her mind to be locked into her first impressions. Like a good detective, her top priority is finding the truth.Damon provides compensation. His performance demands the greatest range between heavy sadness and provoking anger. The puzzlement that dominated his feelings in the first movie is gone. We see a far deadlier and single-minded Bourne. He twice bared his teeth in 'The Bourne Identity,' but that was tame compared to what does here. His interrogation of the defenseless Nicky (an underrated Julia Stiles) introduces a previously unseen nastiness. Nicky's sobbing and pleas for mercy only escalate Bourne's behavior.At the end, he locates the daughter of a prior victim in order to give her the truth and offer an apology. We see him repeatedly blink back tears for a person he has never met. His voice cracks with grief over his past actions and the reality of seeing the destruction he wrought in her life. Damon plays this scene so well that Bourne's own emotions visibly respond to what he observes in the girl (touchingly played by Oksana Akinshina).Greengrass' method of shooting the film is a serious detriment. Unlike the movies before and after, the action is evenly spaced. It fits flawlessly with the overall story progression. It is here that Greengrass shakes the camera as if it is his favorite exercise. His earthquake cam jerks harder and faster with each successive scene. Even the still moments have some visual instability. A fight between Bourne and a former colleague (Marton Csokas) is probably the trilogy's best. That verdict is impossible to give because of the trembling cam. It feels like Greengrass is trying to let us see just enough to stimulate our appetites without producing the entire meal.If the bulk of the movie does not take this too far, the climactic car chase does. A number of crashes occur, and of course the epileptic cam pretends to be in them. A shaking world is different when the person is involved since our brain can make it all palatable. On a screen in front, however, it induces motion sickness. My friend had to close his eyes for much of the car chase. Somebody at the local theater vomited on opening night. Another friend thought of 'Cloverfield,' which is supposed to look like amateur photography, when I described the convulsion cam. Instances like those make Greengrass look bad.Greengrass' poor judgment tempted me to withhold a recommendation after my first viewing. It was only until my jaded second that I was able to see all the great qualities this movie has to offer. The Huntington's-diseased cam is not as exasperating on the small screen, so home video is the way to go. If Universal ever re-releases it in theaters, stay away.",7,0,2,26 October 2008
