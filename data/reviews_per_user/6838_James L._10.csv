Vertigo," Obsession with mystery
","The basic plot: An ex-police officer with fear of heights is assigned by a friend of his to keep an eye on his seemingly off-the-edge of sanity wife , but he soon becomes enamored with Madeliene and when she commits suicide ,he finds another girl with a passing resemblance to her who he has clothed, dressed , and done ultra-specifically like Madeliene, but then he learns her secret......The praise: Incredibly dreamy and cool, actually an allegory of the human love of the difficult and mysterious, the strange and the icy(Madeliene), over the plain and familiar( Midge, his ex-fiancee ), and the natural urge to explore and obsess with the strange,scary and beautiful  in the human sex urges.            Oh,yeah and James Stewart and Kim Novak are truly great in their respective roles. Jimmy Stewart is near-perfect as the mild-mannered soul with kernels of obsession both sexual and for a single mysterious woman , with a phobic fear of heights, known as Scotty. Kim Novak is perhaps perfect, drawing on wells of truly deep emotion and currents of beauty untold. Oh yeah, there is a great swooning Bernard Herrman score. It is the most stylish movie , elegantly photographed and designed with a truly elegant beauty that is both modern,old, and religious.There also is great suspense along the way , thrills,chills and mood. Perfect Hitchcock. Must-see.The flaws: The ending  is too uncharacteristic and pat of the rest of the film.",Null,3,3,11 August 2000
Elizabeth," Superbly done historical piece

Chicken Run," Great Fun
","The Basic Plot: An ambitious chicken called Ginger tries repeatedly to escape a British chicken farm, but fails repeatedly , and then a wisecracking American Rooster called Rocky, who supposedly can fly comes , and Ginger has him try to teach them to fly so they can escape , with failed results. and then when they learn that they'll be turned to chicken pies, their will strengthens ......The praise:Great fun. Funny. It combines the dry,satiric,absurd,best of British humor married to a parody of the gag-filled brand of humor personified in Rocky the flying rooster. Hilarious. You're kept in an exciting rivet of suspense up until the great climax. The claymation is great, and so is the cinematography.Very worthwhile.",Null,0,0,7 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Atmospheric chiller
","The basic plot: A skeptical and modern investigator, Ichabod Crane ,is assigned to a supernatural-ish case in small Sleepy Hollow, but soon descends into a dark web of murder,madness, and witchcraft.The praise: A spooky, dreamlike film.Johnny Depp is a tense object of nervous waves and intense delicacy in a great performance. Miranda Richardson is also very good in a good- hides-evil type performance. The film is incredible with it's mood and damp atmosphere , and as it exudes violence and grotesquerie , the combination of those two and the dark fantasy of the magic or supernatural scenes helps for perfect atmospherics. The inclusion of magic lanterns , technically complex crime toys and gadgets, and a frigid score help. Excellent cinematography. Great suspense and technical engineering at the end. The last shot is a picture perfect one of 18'th century New York, in a sophistacate snowstorm. This film literally DRIPS Burton from top to bottom to top. Ultraviolent.The flaws: The plot can seem tattered or confusing at times , and Christina Ricci gives an insubstantial performance.Note: The headless horseman looks like Sid Vicious! I'm listening to the Talking Heads singing 'Burning Down the House' right now just to pad this review out.",Null,0,0,9 August 2000
Edward Scissorhands," one of the best burtons,done in unusual charm
","The Basic plot : a person with scissored hands is rescued by an Avon lady who takes him to the suburbs,where he  wows the burbites at first but eventually faces problems. The praise:The fairy tale quality is done in minimalism ,combined with delightful cinematography,a contrast of pastels and black& whites in the well-designed sets, character depth,climactic ending,and a sense of emotion create a piece of art.Tim Burton(who directed it) is seen in depth,character and design,while Johnny Depp is perfect as Edward.It also has charm, but in a convincing way. An underrated  film from an underrated director, it was neglected at both the Golden Globes and Oscars,even where it should've won Best picture in my book over 'Dances with wolves '.Vincent Price's last role,as a bonus for horror fans. The flaws:They are quite small,and include exploration of plot and detail in.",Null,0,0,29 June 2000
Amadeus," Wonderfully entertaining period drama
","the basic plot: A boorish, but unimaginabally gifted young talent named Amadeus Mozart arrives in Vienna from Salzburg , and soon marries Constanza Weber. His rival and other court composer and teacher, Salieri , a mannered and polite man, but with mediocre talent, tries to ruin him by exposing unlawful plans for opera, and then by having him write a funeral concerto which he believes is for himself.This is told in flashback by an old Salieri in an asylum to a priest.The praise:Thoroughly entertaining.F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce are both excellent in their roles as Salieri and Mozart,and Elizabeth Aldridge and Roy dotrice do their parts as Constanza and Leopold Mozart well. The film is both comic and powerfully full of bittersweet drama, especially during the last part in which Mozart is writing the funeral concerto. Full of poignant nararation by F. Murray Abraham, in an excellent role which won him an Oscar, it also has a feel of masques, decorative follies and elaborate costumes, architecture and hair that characterize the period. The message that the movie gets across is that you can not judge a persons character  by their talent, and along the way you listen to a lot of great music and the genius of Mozart is explained . The ending in which Salieri proclaims himself King of mediocrity is classic. The flaws: A little too long.",Null,2,4,6 August 2000
To Kill a Mockingbird," An exceptional, black& white tale set in the depression
","The basic plot: A weaving of the lives of the Finch family, southern society, and Atticus Finch's attempts to defend a black man in a legal case.The praise: Basically an untwining of depression era southern society , it sets the lives of Scout( Mary Badham)and Jem(Philip Alford) Finch, as they live their lives along the backdrop of depression-era southern society, in which their father, Atticus ( Gregory Peck) must defend a black man in a rape case. A film which presents its setting excellently, it boasts beautiful,crisp,detailed black& white photography. Gregory Peck is at his ramrod peak in a demanding role as Atticus Finch . Everyone else is good too, including Robert Duvall in his debut as Boo Radley, a reclusive neighbor. It also shows that logic does not always win over prejudice, as Atticus, a lone individual, does not win the case.It touches the themes of racism and childhood coming-of-age and seeing people for their hearts and not for their outside behavior together, and in a very good fashion.must-see.The flaws: none.",Null,2,4,5 August 2000
The Sixth Sense," Frightening and inventive psychodrama, but an acquired taste
","The Basic Plot:A young, seemingly disturbed boy has frightening visions of the dead, and a melancholy psychiatrist tries to help him.The praise:Chilling, the understated script and dialogue counteracts in a way to the powerful and psychological imagery of old homes, dark streets, frightening bodies ,churches and formal areas. Haley Joel Osmont is brilliantly and lyrically understated, and Bruce Willis is fine too . More like a grim concerto than a horror film, it is what it is.Great autumnal hues, and a fuzzy soundtrack which fits it well.The flaws:Sometimes the taste is too classical for some,although at times the movie can be a little boring until another great image comes on.",Null,0,0,1 August 2000
Gladiator," Cool and Epic
","The Basic plot: Maximus, a powerful general is loved by the aging Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who appoints maximus to be the next emperor, but his jealous son Commodus murders his father so he can be emperor and keep Maximus off power. He then kills Maximus's family and sells maxi to Africa as a gladiator, where he is taken by Proximo to Rome,where he becomes popular and vows revenge on the corrupt Commodus.The praise:Very well-made. The battle scenes are exciting ,outrageous , exotic and gloriously action-packed , and a feast for the eye. Actually the entire movie is a great eye feast ,with classic sets and cinematography. It also has great suspense ,deviously larger than life dialogue,plot and acting, all leading to a climax that will make you cry.Russel Crowe is an icon, brilliant in a good role, he, in his armor out on the battlefield, under the sun ,with the crowd cheering. A larger than life movie.The flaws: A few slow sections along the way.",Null,0,0,4 August 2000
High Fidelity," Cusack is the main thing in not always satisfying venture
","The basic plot: Rob, a desperate,unlucky record store owner and obscure pop music fanatic matures in his relationship with laura, his girlfriend.The praise: Cusack is very good in his role,at times believable,funny and tragic. The modern day world is presented well,with a mix of modernism, and older, more lived in areas that perfectly characterizes the real urban world. The scenes with Laura and Rob are funny, and how he matures is sometimes presented well. The supporting characters are interesting, the rock music references are great.The flaws: It gets too talky and preachy occasionally , and more of the rock music could be keyed into the storyline.",Null,0,1,4 August 2000
