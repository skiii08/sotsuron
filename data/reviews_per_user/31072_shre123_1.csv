Frost_Nixon," A brilliant depiction of the interviews conducted by David Frost on Richard M. Nixon's scandalous presidency
","I was extremely surprised by this gem of a political film. I didn't expect much going into to it and was thoroughly delighted when i came out of the theater. Who would have thought, after so many failed attempts at politically based films, that Frost/Nixon would be one of the best pictures this year. The film portrays the interviews between David Frost, a popular talk show host, and Richard Nixon, the only president ever to resign as the commander in chief. Both Michael Sheen and Frank Langella are positively brilliant in bringing the story to life and their chemistry is that of subtle brilliance. Ron Howard has truly done some prolific work in making sure that every bit of tension, excitement, and awe are evident throughout the film. The excellent script, previously as a theatrical one, by Peter Morgan makes 'Tricky Dick' a truly lively character. Besides the film's other fine qualities, the thing that stands out the most is the fact that at points you sympathize with the tyrannous and manipulative Nixon. So rare is the villain an example of resentment in films nowadays. As a contender for the Golden Globe, I felt this was a worthy adversary to rival my favorite movie of the year, 'The Wrestler' and definitely better than the winner, Slumdog Millionaire. Kudos to Ron Howard and Peter Morgan for making this a political thrill ride you will not want to miss.9/10",9,4,9,16 January 2009
