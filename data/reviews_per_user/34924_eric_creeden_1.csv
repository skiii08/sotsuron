Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream: more potential than recognized
",With cinematography done by Matthew Libatique and soundtrack by Clint Mansell I feel as if this was a well composed depiction of downward spirals caused by intense drug abuse. The camera angles and editing techniques made this movie stand out in my mind. The original soundtrack adds an intensity that mirrors the events throughout the whole movie. I feel this movie had aspects that could have boosted its popularity among popular culture and increased ticket sales at the theaters. More advertisement prior to its release would have aided ticket sales in my mind. Over all this movie is one of my favorites for so many reasons that lie deeper than actor and actresses performances. The tone and demeanor of the movie captivates you in the spiral the actors endure and put themselves through in the Requiem for a Dream.,8,2,3,9 November 2008
