Scarface," A Brutal, Uncompromising Masterpiece
","Arguebly Al Pacino's best role. He plays Tony Montana, A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he's got in this world, his balls and his word, and he doesn't break'em for nobody. Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon he has an eye for the boss's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position, he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck. Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now. the film has a great supporting cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster, another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's Brightest points in his long ups and downs career, you can see this guy is very talented. The movie has a magnificent look to it. Also pay attention for two memorable scenes: The one at the fancy restaurant ('Say goodnight to the bad guy'). the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house. this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it's a must-see. For the rest of you it's highly recommended. 10/10",10,78,123,5 January 2005
The Hustler," Paul Newman's Best Performance Ever.
","Paul Newman plays one of his most famous roles as pool shark Fast Eddie Felson - a young man who's dreaming of beating Minnesota Fats (a memorable Jackie Gleason) - the best of the best. Unfortunately for Eddie, it doesn't happen the easy way due to Eddie's self-destructive character. The film's strongest part is definitely the acting by every actor involved. Aside Newmam and Gleason, there is also a nice performance by Piper Laurie as Eddie's girl and some strong acting by George C. Scott ('Patton') as Eddie's sleazy and greedy manager. The pool game scenes are very well shot and along with intelligent dialogs and beautiful black and white cinematography this film is well worth buying and should be part of any movie fan library.RECOMMENDED 10/10.",10,3,5,2 January 2005
Doctor Zhivago," A beautiful and memorable epic that gets better with age. Absolutely Perfect
","Doctor Zhivago is yet another proof why David Lean is considered the best epic director. After bringing to the world two of the greatest films of all times (Bridge on the river Kwai 1957, Lawrence of Arabia 1962) David Lean takes on Boris Pasternak novel and shows that he hasn't lost the magic touch. Omar Sharif in the title role is unforgettable as Doctor Zhivago and Julie Christie is one of the most if not the most stunningly beauty ever to appear on the screen as Lara. Just as the tag line says the story is about: A love caught in the fire of revolution. As you might expect from a director at the caliber of David Lean the film features some memorable scenes in the snow covered Russia with thousands of extras and an unforgettable score by Maurice Jarr. Look for Klaus Kinski in a small but memorable role in the the train ride to the Urals. it's an epic film making at it's best. Don't miss it.",10,1,2,4 September 2005
Where Eagles Dare," One of the best adaptations among Allistair Maclean's novels
",A highly entertaining world war II action film with two of the greatest actors of their time at a high point of their career - Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. The first hour or so is the setting to the action that will follow: a group of American and British soldiers is sent to a castle where the Natzis are holding an important American General. The plot of course is not that simple and has a lot of spins and surprises that accompanied by a fascinating action scenes (Very impressing for a 1968). With a beautiful filming location at the freezing landscapes of Germany and Austria this movie is truly an amazing to watch. Notable sequences are the cable car sequence and the final escaping sequence. Richard Burton gives his usual strong performance and Clint Eastwood is good as his executor. All in all a well crafted action classic that is highly recommended. 10/10,10,49,66,17 January 2005
Paths of Glory," Stanley Kubirck and Kirk Douglas at their very best!
","Stanley Kubrick's 1957 masterpiece is a movie that looks fresh and sharper than most of today's movies. The story follows the french army during the days of the first world war. General George Boulard (Adolphe Menjou) has an impossible mission for his subordinate Gen. Paul Mireau (a vicious George Macready) who knows the high risk of such mission but takes it because he was promised to get another star after accomplishing the mission. The mission is to take on the 'Ant Hill', a territory that for some reason is valuable to the high ranks. Kirk Douglas plays the part of The field commander Col. Dax, a man who unlike his fellow officers, has a decency towards his soldiers but can't save them from the cruelty lack of justice of the military system which is built only to protect the commanding officers. There are some cynical and sharp dialogs (something that's often missing from todays movies) delivered perfectly by all actors. Kirk Douglas is in top form here and brings a memorable performance. There isn't any dull or wasted moments here, every scene is significant and will keep you glued to your seat. Overall it's a fascinating classic that is well worth watching. Highly Recommended 10/10",10,0,0,20 January 2005
