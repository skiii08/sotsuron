The Greatest Showman," Surpassed My Expectations
","This is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre.
From the start to finish, I felt that there was some inaudible and invisible metronome setting the overall pace of the film, a consistent rhythm within many rhythms, if that makes sense. Everything about this film had perfect timing. Editing was seamless. Attention to detail was mind blowing, costumes outstanding. Special effects... whoa. Acting was flawless. I really can't find anything to criticize. 
To summarize in a sentence, first class family entertainment.",10,399,531,27 December 2017
Green Book," Critics - It is something new!
","How can anyone knock this film or say they have seen this type of film before?
It's based on the recollections of Nick Vallelonga and Dr Don Shirley.
If critics say they have seen this type of film before 'nothing new' then maybe the film should get even more credit for bringing the lessor known activists to the fore. Less you walked a mile in their shoes. Each new story we hear about is something new. Let's not be so quick to dismiss this film as 'nothing new'This film creeps up on you in terms of how you feel about the characters in the beginning and how you feel about them at the end, which I believe was one of the missions in this film, a reminder to all of us that not everything in this film or in life, is simply black and white.Whilst the film centers around the two main characters, you should take notice of the others, especially Dr Shirley's butler, fellow band members and take notice of how the film addresses the role of the police.The writing, directing and acting is outstanding.
This is something new, this is another story we have not heard before.Before this film I had never heard of Dr Shirley nor Vallelonga and now I can't stop reading more about these incredible people, I feel educated.Deserved to win best picture.",9,0,4,29 March 2019
