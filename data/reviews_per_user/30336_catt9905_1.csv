E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," may have gave some of the plot away
","Assignment 5-4 Professor DeSando April 26, 2010 Catt Campbell E. T.: The Extra TerrestrialE. T. was first seen by viewing audiences in 1982, it brought hope and love to people from all different walks of life, 'Mary' Dee Wallace, inspired mothers to trust their first instinct when dealing with their children. 'Elliot' Henry Thomas gave children hope that their fantasy's can come true. The central insight is a multiplex of wonder, misunderstanding, and friendship. As Elliot finds himself entangled in a new found friendship with an unidentifiable species, he finds it difficult to reveal the true nature of his new found friend. He begins to go off into a spiral of lies, distant behavior, and adult decision making that he thought was beyond his wildest dreams. As Elliot begins to embark on the task of helping his friend, he finds himself and family lives at risk. What is young Elliot to do save his Extra Terrestrial friend, or try to salvage some sort of normal way of life with his family? As the saga unfolds we see young Elliot and his family makes sacrifices, new hopes, and redeems happiness by making the ultimate sacrifice. As in Disney movie The Princess and the Frog, we see how sacrifice and love concur all misleading evils. The lighting throughout the whole movie is an intricate part of the film; Spielberg does a fantastic job of relaying the emotion of the character in each shot delivered. You feel as if you're living in the scene with the character, as they take the falls, fight off the villains, and cry their eyes out! Spielberg motif in E. T. is subtle, but evident in how he selects the holiday played out in the film 'Halloween', giving you mind blogging clues smoothly and allowing the audience to make their own conclusions on what might be coming next. He offers you a sense of relatable emotion to E. T.'s character, and almost validating that human beings come from another species with the scene where Elliot sleeps outside unharmed waiting on his Extra Terrestrial friend. Once again the lighting in this scene is drizzled with dim unfrosted lighting giving audience a jilted perspective of what Elliot emotion is going through. The audience is left with no choice, but to wonder how this friendship occurred and does it have sustainable longevity. We as the audience can only hope that the outcome for both Elliot and his Extra Terrestrial friend sustains the hands of time.",10,0,1,26 April 2010
