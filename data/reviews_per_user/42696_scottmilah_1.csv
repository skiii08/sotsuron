The Avengers," the avengers
","I have never really been into the whole super hero movie type of thing, but in my opinion the Avengers is a great action movie. I like that all the characters had a major role to play Whedon didn't leave nobody out or behind. I liked how splendid the graphics were and how it just makes the movie more liver. My favorite character in the Avengers is the hulk. I like how he tries to remain in control then after a while all of a sudden something just sets him off on a rage. The whole action scene is just to live from the graphics to the hulk ripping thing out of the walls and throwing them. The whole idea of this movie is excellent. I love the plot, love the themes and I especially love how each character had something to offer to catch the audience attention almost immediately. Thumbs up to Whedon great job.",Null,1,4,19 November 2012
