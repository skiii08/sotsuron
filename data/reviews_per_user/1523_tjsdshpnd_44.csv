The Blair Witch Project," A half baked cake in the end
","I have watched many horror cum thriller movies before. But this one surely was different than any of them. The plot of the movie itself interested me so much that I decided to watch it. The movie is about three young documentary makers who venture into the deadly woods in search of a local legend called 'The Blair Witch'. Before the start of the movie, a note appears which asserts to the viewer that the 3 students have disappeared in the woods and after one year, their video footage is received which is the movie itself.Since the entire movie is like an amateur video footage, it gives us a feel of the friendly videos we sometimes take with our friends with no camera focus, angles, lighting etc. The actors too had to be at their natural best, and they succeed in just playing 'lost' rather than acting. Hence all expressions of anger, frustration, fear etc look very much real rather than made up. The ending of the movie is like a half-baked cake, it does not fully satisfy the viewer. Overall, it is surely a one time watch for an entire different take on film makingRating : 7/10",7,1,2,21 August 2009
Captain Phillips," Rising tensions, pumping hearts and a jaw dropping ending
","Paul Greengrass known for the Bourne Series and United 93 like tense, dramatized, sometimes real life events directs another movie with the same premise. The real event of ship hijacking by Somalian pirates in 2009 is dramatized in this movie. As usual, the director rises tension levels to a fever pitch and you are on the edge of your seat in the entirety of the film. The constant cat and mouse struggle between first the Somali pirates and the unarmed crew members of the cargo ship and then between the pirates and the entire US Navy and Navy Seals is heart stopping to say the least. Two honorable mentions in the acting department. Tom Hanks as Captain Philips is impressive as always. The last 10 minutes of the movie where Hanks is shell shocked by the events was top class acting to say the least. Newcomer Barkhad Abdi who plays the Pirate leader is the revelation here. He is tough, mean and yet there is a humane side to him. He knows what he is getting into and yet he faces it with all conviction. This may not be the greatest movie to come out this year, but still it is worth a watch at-least.Rating : 8/10",8,0,1,16 January 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Bows Down To The Genius Called Spielberg
","The first movie of the Indiana Jones series is also the best of the lot. The movie which starts in South America (1936) travels half of the world to Nepal and ends in Egypt.The movie is all about gaining a certain Ark of the Covenant which allows direct communication with the Gods. Indy is assigned the job of finding this Ark and his rivals in this movie are the Germans(Nazis to be precise). The movie is an absolute entertainer and there is not a damn dull moment in it Spielberg has maintained a great balance of comedy and thrills with a background of sometimes weird and sometimes exemplorary romance . Every single frame in the movie has a certain 'Spielberg Touch', which is the hallmark of the great director. The next movies of the series were good but did not manage to create an impact as huge as this one. A must watch for sure, I recommend it wholeheartedly to all cinema loversRating :8.5/10",9,0,1,2 June 2009
In Bruges," No Novice Blues for Mcdonagh
","This was Martin Mcdonagh's first full fledged movie as a director, but nowhere in the movie, you will find the 'novice' touch. In Bruges is of the crime comedy/satire genre, which Tarantino, Guy Ritchie etc have excelled in. The story is about two British Hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who after successfully completing a job in London are sent to Bruges, Belgium by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) until the matter as well as the Hit men cool down. Bruges is a tourist destination of sorts for history lovers because it is a well preserved medieval town. But like many European towns, it is very dull and slow for a young fun loving person which Ray is. He hates the place and curses it to the core, wanting to leave it a.s.a.p. On the other hand, Ken loves the feel of the place and considers it a fairytale town and intends to live there until their boss calls. They meet some people there namely a dwarf/midget American actor, a local drug dealer girl etc who make their life in the place interesting. After a while, Ken gets to know from his boss the exact reason why they are in Bruges and the movie takes a different turn altogether. The plot is very engaging and the dialogues very witty and filled with satire. You never get bored during the course of the movie. The movie has many references to Americans, Canadians, Belgians, Englishmen, Vietnamese, Blacks and even Pakistanis with a tone of racism. But it is not 'On The Face' racist comments like in American History X. It is well capsuled in the garb of satire.I have watched very few Colin Farrell movies and this surely was his best performance. He has many shades to his character. He is fun loving, aggressive, sometimes even filled with guilt because of his 'small boy killing' mistake in his first assignment. Brendan Gleeson plays a matured role and his conversations with both Farrell and Fiennes are engrossing. Ralph Fiennes ruled the screen in his short but effective role. A special mention to the Bruges local drug dealer girl and Farrell's love interest in the movie. She had one of the best smiles I have seen. A great watch and I recommend it.Rating : 8/10",8,1,3,23 October 2009
Kung Fu Panda," An animated flick with its heart in its place
","An animated flick about a fat, lazy, noodle cooking Panda who becomes a Kung Fu warrior and savior of his land equals 'Kung Fu Panda'. Chandni Chowk To China is the famous or should I say infamous rip off of this movie. This flick is not only entertaining, humorous but also influential. This movie talks about a looser and how he beats all odds and becomes a winner by the strength of his will. One of the quotes in the movie - 'Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift, hence it is called as present' is one of the finest quotes in animation history IMO. The movie is predictable but enthralling at the same time. It never bores you which is an asset. Thus even after taking too much creative animated liberties, it still manages to create an impact.The voices given in this movie is perhaps the collection of the biggest stars for an animated movie I have witnessed ever. Hoffman, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan etc are utilized well. Jack Black lives his part as the central character. Overall, a good animated flick with its heart in its place Rating : 8/10",8,0,1,29 September 2009
Se7en," Disturbing, Cold, Sinful.......
","Watched a movie after a long time and what a choice for a comeback . Se7en is a shocking, disturbing, cold, sinful thriller which takes hold of the audience for the entire length of the movie. The story is about two police cops, one about to retire and one a very young new entry played by Freeman and Pitt respectively. Just before Detective Somerset (Freeman) is about to retire, a strange case of murder comes into picture which introduces the police department to a cold-blooded, patient and deranged serial killer who kills people one after the other on the basis of seven deadly sins mentioned by religion which are subjected to death of the sinner. Thus the serial killer aims at killing 7 people, one for each sin respectively. Detectives Somerset and Mills (Pitt) are given this case and they both try their different methods to uncover this mystery and catch the killer. A very unique plot, this movie is made even more thrilling by the classic direction of Fincher. This movie can be called a milestone in the suspense genre.Brad Pitt as the young, restless cop Mills has done his job pretty well . But there are some scenes where we feel that he is overacting a bit. Morgan Freeman on the other hand makes us feel that this particular role of Detective Somerset was written just for him. Kevin Spacey in a small role as the deranged killer is impressive and makes us feel that he is truly a cold blooded psychopath . Overall, a must watch movie Rating : 8.5/10",9,1,1,2 June 2009
Fight Club," Truly Kick-Ass
","This movie can get the two extreme responses. It could be liked tremendously by the viewer and considered as a masterpiece or completely opposite, it could be trashed by the viewer calling it a complete waste of time. Yes, that is Fight Club for you. I am the one who considers it a masterpiece. Fight Club is a violent, in the face, kick ass, gory bloodshed. But if you think that is it, then you are underestimating the greatness of this movie . This movie talks about the protagonist played by Edward Norton who for some unassumable reason has no screen name. He is a mentally disturbed insomniac who attends support groups made for people dying so that he can sleep peacefully. After this support group idea fails due to a girl called Marla who is also faking being on the verge of death, he meets a guy called Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt who jointly start the Fight Club which has certain rules and which undertakes certain dangerous projects all over the span of America . I don't want to disclose the end, because it has to be witnessed rather than readOverall, Fight Club contains a lot of bloodshed, broken bones, teeth, swollen eyes etc. It is one of the most violent movies I have seen and some scenes you cannot watch instantly. Brad Pitt steals the show in terms of capturing the viewers attention. But the actor who impresses the most is Edward Norton who narrates the entire movie and plays a mentally sick person excellently. The scene in which he beats himself up is superb. Watch this movie at your own riskRating : 8.5/10",9,0,2,2 June 2009
Memento," A Highly Intellectual Puzzle
","Well what can I call this movie, A psychological thriller film, a highly intellectual brain teaser or a puzzle. The problems I am facing describing the movie, the same problems I had while recollecting the movie. Some of the scenes surely required 2-3 times repeated watch. The story is well very well known and recently due to lot of copy controversies, it has came to limelight. But the advantage of this movie is surely the immaculate and out of box direction and the great editing . It is the most original movie that it can be .Guy Pearce plays his part convincingly. But surely the real hero of this movie is the story, screenplay and director . Nolan is a genius and audiences got a glimpse of that from this movie.A surely must watch movie If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual action-packed thrillers.Rating : 8/10",9,0,2,2 June 2009
Shaun of the Dead," A Strictly one time watch
","Comedies have various sub-forms or sub-branches as in Rom Com, Spoof Comedies, Sci Fi Comedies etc. After watching this movie, I got in touch with a new branch of comedy called as the 'Zom Com' or Zombie Comedy. It is horror in the garb of comedy consisting of real horrific zombies but the whole situation is handled with a comic touch. The protagonist of the movie Shaun is a loser who lives with his good for nothing friend Ed and 'prick' Pete who is a practical guy. His relationship with his girlfriend Liz is on the docks and on the verge of breaking. He hates his step-dad and his juniors at work don't respect him. One fine day he decides to make things right in his life. Sadly, the day he chooses is the same day when the Zombies decide to attack Planet Earth. Now, his focus is to save his near and dear ones from becoming Zombies and in the process, mend his life. Is he successful in his conquest and if yes at what price constitutes the movie.Story is fine, the comedy is provided through witty dialogues and some great acting. The beheading and mutilation of the Zombies looks amusing as well as comic initially. But after sometime , it becomes a little boring. The movie moves towards a predictable end and the viewer ends up thinking, 'Damn, there was something missing'. The movie is rated very highly in many online movie portals, but if you ask my opinion, the movie was pretty average. Overall, a strictly one time watch.Rating : 7/10",7,1,2,3 January 2010
Zodiac," Watch it on a Sunday Afternoon with lots of time in hand
","There have been many movies, good movies on serial killers and their psychopathic ways of killing people made in Hollywood. So how is Zodiac different from all of these. For starters, this movie is based on real facts taken from real Police Case files. A killer named as Zodiac was rampant in California during the late 60's. Secondly, such thrillers are usually fast-paced and keep the viewer on their heels (Example - Se7en, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs etc).But Zodiac is laid-back, slow and takes it's time. It is a movie which grows on you. Thriller Fans may even get bored and watch it in two sittings (Or even more) Story revolves around three people, A drunkard reporter who has talent but has lost his aim due to excessive drinking (Robert Downey Jr), A cartoonist who is extremely hard working and focused (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a SFPD Detective who is very determined and does not give up easily (Mark Ruffalo). All these three people use their different techniques to get hold of the Zodiac killer .Are they successful in their conquest is what the movie is all about.I am a fan of David Fincher and I like his style very much. He has tried his best to create a good movie with limited information and ensuring that facts are not altered. It is because of him that Zodiac still manages to impress after 2 and a half hours. Jake Gyllenhall had nothing special to do than run here and there and give his 2-3 expressions of surprise, fear and excitement. Ruffalo was good. But Robert Downey Jr was impressive in his short but important role. I want to see more of him for sure. Overall, Watch it on a Sunday Afternoon with lots of time in hand and nothing to do, but watch it for sure.Rating - 7/10",7,1,1,4 October 2009
The Prestige," Magical.......Truly Magical
","Watched this movie for the second time and loved it even more. Based in England at the beginning of the 19th century, The basic plot revolves around two rival magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier played by Bale and Jackman respectively who crave to outdo each others magic tricks and in this endeavor face very tragic results or ends. The basic plot itself is very interesting and when we have the great non-linear narration style of Nolan attached to it, it becomes even more pleasing and extraordinary as an overall piece of art.This movie also has many twists and turns which will challenge the viewer and keep him engaged and shocked until the end credits . The movie contains disguises, look-alikes, betrayals, magic meets science and the overall different layers of human natureThe two lead actors have done a tremendous job, so much so that I cannot make out who outdid whom in acting. The actresses Scarlett and Rebecca have played their part well. A special mention goes to the legendary actor Michael Caine who plays his supporting role in the best possible way. Overall, surely this movie makes it to the top 3 movies of Nolan until nowRating : 8/10",9,0,1,2 June 2009
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," An Almost Perfect Western
","The Good Ole Western movies which enchant movie lovers all over the world is one of my favorite genres. Fascinated By Sergio Leone, I have watched very few westerns made by film-makers apart from him. But I am glad I watched this one. Supposedly based on true facts about an infamous gang of robbers in the late 18th century which is led by the master-mind Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and his 'talented' associate Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), this movie talks about the rise and fall of the protagonists. It has all the ingredients of a classic western - Train/Bank Robberies, Excellent Cinematography, Great Locations ranging from desert sand dunes to flowing rivers, impressive BGM and perfect casting. Newman has a charming screen presence, He is one actor from whom you cannot take your eyes off. But Redford has matched Newman in every scene which is a tough task to follow. Ranked as one of the best westerns in many official lists, I recommend this movie for one and a half hours of pure entertainment. Rating : 7/10",7,0,1,8 October 2009
MASH," A Different perspective on war
","There are certain movies that can get the very extreme responses from viewers. They may be liked tremendously or maybe disliked thoroughly. MASH is one such movie. It is surely not meant for all. The movie first of all has got no definite plot, it is just a series of events interleaved together to create a satirical impact. Based on a Korean Army Hospital and it's staff of doctors, surgeons, nurses etc, it takes into account their journey filled with humor, insanity etc on the backdrop of a deadly war. There are innumerable characters in the movie, but predominant are two surgeons (Hawkeye and Duke), a chest-cutter (Trapper) and a slutty head nurse (Hot Lips). Humor is mostly in the form of witty satire on sex, girls(blondes), war, America and surgery. For example, the head nurse Hot Lips talks about degrading morals and manners in the army and at night sleeps with almost half of the unit. A Lot of focus on vulgarity is one of the reasons that can be a turn-off for viewers. The viewer may even feel that some events in the movie are added forcefully just to add to the movie humor quotient. One very most important character of the movie is the loudspeaker cum radio which can be heard between two scenes. Most of the announcements made are very funny and enhance the feel of the movie. There is not a lot of scope to show acting talent in this movie which has many characters. But Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye, Sally Kellerman as Hot Lips and Elliott Gould as Trapper leave a mark. We can see Robert Duvall in a very short role, before his Godfather days. Frankly, I liked this movie in parts and hence cannot wholeheartedly recommend it to fellow cinema lovers. But, will surely say that watch it for it's different treatment of war. I bet you wouldn't have seen such a war movie before .Rating : 7/10",7,1,2,15 January 2010
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick Loyalists will love it
","Director : Stanley Kubrick Cast : Ryan O'Neil, Marisa Berenson, Patrick MageeStanley Kubrick is my favorite director and Barry Lyndon is one of his least recognized films. The reason for it's less popularity is that the movie is very much unlike Kubrick. We get to see a different Kubrick style in this movie, and I am not complaining. To begin with, the movie is set in the 17th Century and requires costumes, sets and mannerisms of that era. Kubrick being the perfectionist he is, has taken care of every minute detail. The movie is about an Irish guy named Redmond Barry and his rags to riches and back to rags story. The central character of Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon is a very complex character to say the least. Kubrick has explored almost all human emotions from pride, lust, love to anger, hate, betrayal, jealousy and power. Kubrick plays with the viewer in the sense that at one instance the viewer feels for Barry Lyndon and at the other instance hates him to the core. In short, the character has too many layers and inner shades, the viewer gets to explore in the course of the movie. Along with all this, Kubrick does not forget the satire he is so frequently associated with. The satirical comments are on that era and made via a narrator who narrates for the entire course of the movie. The technical aspects of the movie are brilliant. Great Cinematography which is a feature of all Kubrick movies is seen here as well. According to me, this movie has the best cinematography than all other Kubrick movies. In short, Kubrick brings 17th century United Kingdom alive on the screen.About the acting, the lead role played by Ryan O'Neil is average to say the least. I personally felt, some other actor would have taken this movie to even greater heights. Kubrick fans will love this movie and enjoy every frame of it. Others might find the 3 hour ordeal as boring and a waste of time. Thus, I will not openly recommend it. Rating : 8/10",8,2,4,20 October 2009
The Grapes of Wrath," A Family Movie
","Had heard a lot about John Ford (4 time Oscar Winner) - The revolutionary director of westerns and movies with a social message who inspired a generation of film-makers. This was his first movie I watched and hell it would surely not be his last one. The Grapes of Wrath is a story of a joint family living in America (State of Oklahoma) at the times of the 'Great Depression'. Homeless and out of work, they had to move to the extreme west (State of California) to have a chance of earning livelihood and survival. They move from Okhlahoma to California in a vehicle that is old enough to be kept in the museum. Their journey to California itself is a highlight of the movie. They venture through different towns and states, get the sometimes good and sometimes bad reception of local people of every state, Hell,loose two members of their family in the journey (The Journey in Little Miss Sunshine is inspired from this movie). Living peacefully all these years in their Oklahoma Farm, suddenly they are faced with the materialistic facet of human nature. Some days they go without eating, somedays without sleep, Looking here and there for a job, they are ready to do absolutely anything. In all this trauma and pain, the only thing that remains constant is the human emotion of love and belonging. As a family, they are emotionally richer than the most richest man around. The clear message given in this movie above all is the importance of a family and the attachment to it is the only constant thing in life.Performances are absolutely top notch. Henry Fonda gives a great all-round performance which can be considered one of his best ever. From the family, the one that impresses the most is the family Matriarch played by Jane Darwell who is responsible actually for binding the family. Actresses in the black and white era normally over-dramatized or in short over-acted especially in movies as these. But her's is a very natural performance. Overall, this movie may not appeal to people who don't have the basic human emotions of love, belonging, grief etc. I am not of that kind and thus I thoroughly liked the movie.Rating : 8/10",8,0,0,8 December 2009
Forrest Gump," True Hollywood Fans Cannot Miss This Movie
","Lost count on how many times I have watched this masterpiece, but sincerely I would love to watch it many more times in the future. The title role played by Tom Hanks has become one of the most loved characters in cinema history . The character who is primarily dumb with an I.Q below 75 and who according to his teachers and other people around cannot achieve anything in life, achieves something that is a dream to even the perfectly normal people . Forrest goes from playing in the college Football team, to working in the U.S Army, from graduating college to playing ping-pong at an international level and from running the entire span of America continuously for 3 years to becoming a millionaire with his shrimp business. That is a lot of achievement and he does all this with the same amount of dumbness and stupidity he is born with. The other characters in the movie, Forest's Mom who stood by him his entire life, His love interest Jenny who in her younger days picks up the drug habit and goes the hippie way, and after she is matured marries Forrest and gives birth to a son but dies in the end. His friend in the army days Bubba, and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan who then becomes his business partner etc. All these characters are well written and have a considerable role to play in the making of Forrest Gump as a person. One cannot miss mentioning the references of world famous personalities such as John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Elvis Presley, John Lennon etc in the movie and their coincidental relation with Forrest.Tom Hanks has portrayed the role of a lifetime and he got awarded for it - Best Actor Oscar. His improvisations for the role such as voice modulation, walking style and just looking plain dumb all went for him. Overall, you cannot be called a Hollywood lover, if you have not watched Forrest Gump :)Ratings : 9/10",9,1,4,2 June 2009
Fargo," A Cult Classic Not To Be Missed
","Good Black Comedy movies are a rarity and black comedies on supposedly real life incidents are extremely scarce. Fargo's creative team including the multi-faceted Coen brothers made it a point to illustrate in the beginning of the movie that all events are based on real life incidents with their unique 'touch' of-course. Fargo is a story about a car salesman who is in desperate need of money and thus he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so that he can get a hefty ransom from his father-in-law (Who is a wealthy man and not much fond of his (son-in-law). Things go wrong when the crooks had to kill 3 people to hide their identity and thus a cycle is started of blood-shed which is investigated and eventually solved by a pregnant female cop who is actually the protagonist or the lead of this movie. Bollywood fans may find this story very similar to the Saif, Fardeen starrer 'Love Ke Liye Kucch Bhi Karega'. Actually Love Ke Liye is an average rip-off of Fargo.The performances are noteworthy especially the female cop played by Mcdormand (Favorite actress of the Coen Bros.) Her expressions are hilarious and her accent funny. I have doubts though if she deserved an Oscar she won that year for this movie, but surely it was a good performance. The car salesman played by Macy leaves a mark on the viewers mind. Steve Buscemi as the 'funny face', loud mouth crook utilities all the screen time he has been given perfectly. Overall, a cult classic not to be missed.Rating : 8/10",8,4,6,14 September 2009
Duck Soup," A Truly Enjoyable Experience
","I had Read about the famous Marx brothers and their legendary comic stint on theater and Broadway. Duck Soup being their most famous movie, The Marx brothers have left no stone unturned to make this movie a very special one. Duck Soup is a musical comedy which is heavily inspired from Broadway musicals. It is a rare mixture of witty and mad humor which can make the viewer die of laughter. The song sequences in between enhance the humor further. The story is irrelevant in such kind of a movie which is based more on the acting and precisely antics of the lead actors. While watching this movie, one might feel, no director was assigned the job of directing this movie and perhaps The Marx Brothers themselves were the whole and soul of the movie. But, the legendary Leo McCarey is the actual Captain of the Ship. Acting wise the three Marx Brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo carry the entire movie and the comedy on their shoulders. After watching this movie, I understood why Woody Allen once said that 'Groucho Marx was the best comic actor America ever produced'. His comic timing, dialogue delivery, legendary appearance and style of walking etc redefined comedy movies. The Duck Soup could generate mixed viewer reactions. Those who want to critically post-mortem it can trash it, but those who will consider the era in which it was made and just want to enjoy a few laughs will love it. I fall in the later category.Rating : 9/10",9,1,2,23 March 2010
The Battle of Algiers," Not only part of movie history, but world history
","Independence, Rebellion, Guerrilla warfare, military exercise, propaganda, state sponsored torture, clashes between local civilians and foreign tyrants. This may have been the history of most developing countries in the world. India can be a bright example. But, I have not seen a finer depiction of a rebellion for independence than this movie. I would rate it along with Battleship Potemkin, as the best propaganda movie, I have ever seen. The specialty of this movie is the way it is filmed. Black and white cinematography which also gives the impression of a documentary. I really thought, I was watching a documentary in History Channel than an actual movie. Editing is crisp as well, which really helps in not lingering in the death scenes which is the case in many other movies. The movie does not have a single protagonist or antagonist which according to me is the victory of the movie.I am so glad I watched this movie as not only a part of movie history, but a part of world history as well.Rating : 9/10",9,0,1,4 January 2014
The White Ribbon," A very matured take on lessons of life.
","The time period of our lives when we are the most susceptible and the most vulnerable to lessons of morality, differences between good and evil, death and life is childhood. But, the society norms say that childhood should be protected from all these thoughts. The White Ribbon challenges these norms and says the right time to discuss these things openly is from a very tender age. Hence we see a detailed discussion about death between a 13 year old girl and a 6 year old boy, where the girl says 'I am going to die, even you are going to die someday'. The level of maturity shown is very commendable.The movie basically is about a pre-world war small town in Germany governed by a baron, pastor and a doctor who are powerful people holding moral and religious high grounds in the village. Some oddly weird things start happening which change the dynamics of the village and are felt mostly through the eyes of the village children. Narrated by the village school-teacher, the movie encompasses the life of several village families and more importantly the family children.The director has used black and white as a medium to tell the story and it is extremely effective. Another unique quality of the director is his non-dwelling in scenes. He doesn't want the audience to linger in a particular scene for too long. Thus, sequences happen thick and fast and sometimes, you may loose track of what was happening (Thank god for the rewind button). Nevertheless the movie rakes the issue of violence and it's effect on children and the issues of morality and how they should be handled pretty effectively.Rating : 8/10",8,0,3,12 January 2014
The Machinist," Excellent Thriller which swept me off my feet
","Let the Spanish title not fool you, this movie is entirely in English, based in America but shot in Spain (It took great pains to make Barcelona look like an American City) The movie is about a Machinist(A worker who works on industrial machines) played by Bale who is also an insomniac (Apparently he has not slept for about a year). He spends his nights having sex with a prostitute cum friend or sipping coffee and eating pie in the airport canteen in the company of his favorite waitress. One day in the The place where he works, an accident occurs which changes his life and with the occurrence of a mysterious co-worker, his life becomes a living hell. The movie is a psychological thriller with noticeable similarities with cult classics like Fight Club and Memento. Yes, the non-linear style, dual personality blah blah. About the movie, it is fast paced and does not bore the viewer which is the necessity of a good thriller. The editing should be credited for this. About the acting, the entire movie was on the shoulders of one man - Christian Bale. And damn, he has excelled. Great actors are known for their complete dedication and focus for a movie. Examples given could be of Robert Deniro for Raging Bull who changed his physical appearance completely to look like a boxer etc. In this movie, Bale has lost considerable weight to get into the character who must have a visual impact on the viewer as a supposed freak. Hats off to Bale for his dedicationRating : 8/10",8,0,0,1 October 2009
American History X," Controverial but a must watch
","To start off, this was an extremely controversial movie when it was released.Maybe because of the racist, anti-black, anti-immigration, anti-Jewish, anti-Asian, anti- Hispanic etc etc remarks made continuously in the movie. This movie is actually divided into two parts and has a non-linear style of narration. The two parts being the flashback and the current scenario. The director has interestingly given a different look to both the parts with the help of colors. The flashback is depicted by black and white frames while the current part is depicted by normal color. The movie contains violence, sometimes very gory violence that may turn your eyes off the screen. It contains some statements which you may not agree with. But as a movie, it is a complete experience. The transition of the protagonist from a racial, neo-nazi skinhead to a caring, understanding guy who understands that it is not the color that determines a person, but his nature is put very underminingly by the director. His urge to stop his brother from going his way and spoil his life is depicted wonderfully. The part of the story in jail where Norton understands that he is wrong and has a radical transformation was done without preaching and high melodrama which is the case with many other movies.On the acting front, Edward Norton is anyways one of my favorite actors and in this movie all his acting prowess is put to the test and without any surprise he delivers . All the other actors especially Edward Furlong fit the bill perfectly . In short Controversial but a must watch Rating : 8.5/10",9,0,3,17 June 2009
Tropic Thunder," Great acting for a spoof movie
","It is said that one who laughs at ownself laughs the loudest. It is absolutely true in the case of Hollywood. Nobody makes more fun of Hollywood than Hollywood itself. Tropic Thunder can be called a satirical, insane and sometimes meaningless no brainer spoof on Hollywood war movies. The start of the movie itself is absolutely hilarious which shows some trailers of upcoming movies with actors who are the protagonists of the movie. The story is about four popular actors - One a black rap artist, one an action hero who has made 6 sequels of his original action hit, one comedy star who does 'farty' movies and one classical actor who has won the Oscars 5 times. All these actors come together for a war movie based on original facts written by a supposed Vietnam veteran. How These actors get into some real trouble during shooting and how they come out of it is the movie. The scenes and dialogues between the leads gives the humorous touch . The jokes are full of satire and intelligence. They poke fun of Hollywood trends and the Academy Awards. There are some instances in the movie when you may think 'What crap is this'? But spoofs are not meant to be intellectually motivating anyways, so view them as a good 1-2 hour timepass.Acting is surprisingly good for a spoof movie. Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. are the life of this movie. Jack Black does his usual stuff. Tom Cruise has a special appearance (Literally a special 'appearance') in the movie. You have to watch closely to recognize him. He has done comedy efficiently proving that he is a versatile actor. In short, a great one time watch .Rating : 8/10",8,0,2,1 December 2009
The Usual Suspects," Redefinition of a genre
","There is a quote in this movie which goes like this ' The Greatest Trick The Devil Ever Pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist' . Well I would like to say that the Greatest Trick the director of this movie pulled was to thrill and shock the audience until the last frame of the movie. You will be shocked by the twists in this movie especially in the later part of the second half. Yes, it is a bit slow in the first half, but the second half more than makes up for it. The basic plot is about 5 thieves or conmen who come together to plan a revenge expedition against the police . All these 5 people are somehow linked to a criminal mastermind called Kaize Soze and how Soze finishes them one after the other but off course with a certain twist in the end is what the movie is all about.About the acting in this movie, everybody's performance was top notch. But still I would like to mention the performances of Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Bryne which were exceptional. Another movie with flashback style of narration, this movie is surely not to be missed .Rating : 8.5/10",9,0,1,2 June 2009
Batman Begins," Nolan's First Tryst with Batman
","Nolan's first tryst with the comic character Batman and his much popularized Gotham City and it's infamous villains. This movie introduces the character Batman to the world thus explaining how Batman was born which has references from his childhood, killing of his parents etc. This movie focuses more on establishing Bruce Wayne's character, his ideals, his love, his passions etc. His relationships with the other important characters of the Batman comic series such as Alfred, Lucius, Rachel, Gordon etc is being highlighted more in this movie. The villains in this movie are The Scarecrow and Henri Ducard who pose a probable threat to the peace of Gotham. The very stylish and very technology-friendly bat-accessories are a treat to watch such as the bat suit, the bat automobile etc .Christian Bale perfectly fits in the role of Batman. And he is well supported by Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and others. This is one of the most real adaptations of a comic book character . A sure watch Rating : 7.5/10",Null,0,1,2 June 2009
Man on the Moon," One of the best Biographical Movies ever !
","Man on the Moon is a biographical depiction of the life of Andy Kauffman - An entertainer and stage/sitcom artist who took objection to people calling him a 'comedian'. He introduced himself as a 'song and dance man'. A truly multi-faceted performer who was loved and hated at the same time by people in his prime, he also was an inter-gender wrestling champion. Famous for his on stage set-ups, pranks and creation of fictitious characters, he evolved from a club performer to a man watched by 40 million people worldwide. This movie tries to shed some light on the personal ups and downs of Kauffman and the effects of his public life on his shaping up as a human. Even a premature death due to lung cancer did not mellow down the aura this man had. Man on the Moon looks at Kauffman's life as a chapter - Starting from childhood, to his prime days and ends with a question lingering in the minds of the viewer.On the acting front, Jim Carrey lives the character of Kauffman. People will agree with me that no other actor could have given this movie and character the justice that Carrey gave. Danny Devito in his supporting act is great. There are innumerable characters in the movie (Some people playing themselves such as David Letterman, Jerry Lawler etc), But the power of Carrey's performance is such that we only remember him throughout and after the movie. Why not an Oscar Nomination for Carrey I ask? The movie has it's happy and sad moments which will leave a smile on the face or a tear in the eye of the viewer. I personally had goosebumps while watching some scenes namely :1) The Christmas Act of Kauffman and appearance of Santa Claus . 2) The Philliphines Miracle healing hoax and the reaction of Carrey. 3) The Final Scene which I will not mention here.Overall, surely one of the best biographical movies I have seen ever. Highly Recommended.Rating : 8/10",8,0,0,16 February 2010
The Last Emperor," I am glad I watched this movie.
","I am fascinated by history and historical figures. It was and will remain my all time favorite subject of interest. So, I was more than thrilled watching this movie which sheds light on perhaps the most oldest but less understood Chinese dynasty history. The movie is about Pu Yi who was the last Emperor of China because in his life time itself monarchy was abolished and China went public. This movie covers almost all important incidents which occurred in his life right from his birth to crowning as an emperor at age 3, to his love life as well as imprisonment as a war criminal. His story is un-folded in a series of flashbacks and flashforwards. This movie is technically brilliant with superb editing and background music. Camera-work is also of the highest quality. Memorable scenes define the greatness of a movie. This 3 and a half hour long tale has lots of great scenes. The scene where a 11 year old Pu Yi runs after the carriage which has his mother but the gates are shut on him is replicated when the same Pu Yi runs after the car which has his wife at age 30. The final scene where an old Pu Yi has to buy a ticket to enter and sight-see his own palace gave me goosebumps. There are too many of such scenes which makes this otherwise long movie an enjoyable experience. I never felt bored while watching it. Each scene was giving me something. On the acting front, John Lone plays the adult Pu Yi with absolute dedication and understanding. It was as if, this was meant to be played by him. This was a very difficult role. He had to portray not only the arrogance and blue-bloodness of an emperor but also the helplessness and dejection of an average man. Peter O'Toole as the Scottish tutor of Pu Yi impressed with his graceful approach. The rest of the cast also play their parts sincerely. Overall, I was glad that I watched this movie.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Sci-Fi Flick with its heart in place
","This particular movie can be described as a sci-fi flick which has it's heart in it's place. A sci-fi movie which does not compromise on the emotional quotient of the movie and makes the audience emotionally attached to the characters. This movie is about Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who decide to erase the memory of each other from their mind so that they can be live a new improved life. The character played by Kate has finished the process of memory erasing and now Jim's character is about to do so. But during this process of step-by-step memory removal, Jim's character gets to love Kate's character all over again in his mind and wants to stop this process immediately. But as destiny would do, both of them with absolutely no idea about their past, meet again and begin to like each other once more .The basic plot of the movie itself is very engaging and enthralling. Jim Carrey who is known to be wild and nasty in his typical movies underplays his part to perfection so much so that in some scenes Kate has out shined him completely (This is even more amazing because Jim is known to steal the entire show in his earlier movies). Kate Winslet for me is the star of the show. She is a livewire on screen with her constant hair color changes from green to red, and from golden to blue. The other cast fit in their roles perfectly. A special mention goes to the editing of the movie especially in those scenes where Jim's memory erasing is taking place. And the director seems to be a fan Of Hindi songs, because in one particular scene, 3-4 old Hindi songs are played in the background .Rating - 8/10",9,1,2,2 June 2009
Pulp Fiction," Watched Cinematic History Being Created
","The very beginning of the movie showcases the dictionary meaning of the word 'Pulp'. The rest that follows is a 2 hour experience of a masterpiece, a classic cinematic experience. Pulp Fiction can be said to have redefined a genre. The basic plot is about two hit men, their Boss Marselus, Marselus's wife Mia, a boxer and two small time thieves and how their lives inter-relate. The movie is divided into many sections or chapters which brings out the different stories one by one. Tarantino and his unique, intelligent style of story-telling is seen in its brightest form in this movie. F*** and Sh** are the two most commonly used slang's throughout the movie. But a special mention to the dialogues of the movie. They help a lot in establishing the characters .About Acting, Travolta is probably one of the most stylish and charismatic actors of Hollywood. That is evident in this movie as well. His dancing skills are also put to task and he charms once again. Uma Thurman is a livewire in her short role. Bruce Willis has done a convincing job. Samuel.L.Jackson surprised me a lot, great actor who is very much under-rated. Pulp Fiction is surely not to be missed for even the newbie Hollywood fansRating : 9/10",9,1,2,2 June 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Only a heartless person will not have a smile during the course of the movie
","The Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart combination have given cinema lovers some great movies to cherish in the Black and White era. This movie is not only one of their best, but also one of the best of that era. Based on the basic principle of cherishing the greatest gift god has given to humans - Life, this movie takes the help of fantasy to explain this point very beautifully. The movie has a very simple story, the good virtues against the bad virtues and the triumph of the human spirit in the end. But, the treatment of the story is very fresh and it still remains evergreen. A Lot of suicides are reported nowadays due to various reasons, people ending lives without thinking of their near and dear ones. A Similar situation arises in the movie with the protagonist George Bailey (Stewart), who due to bankruptcy and other reasons decide to end his life leaving his wife and four children. He is about to end his life, when a guardian angel from heaven stops him and advises him against it by saying that every life is precious and ending it would change a lot of things around. He proves his point by showing George how his town, family etc would have been if he never existed. Seeing, the dreadful situation of his family and town if he had never being born, he understands the preciousness of his life and takes the suitable decision. The movie ends on a very happy note. Only a heartless person would not have a smile on the face or perhaps a tear in the eye during the course of the climax.James Stewart lives the role of George Bailey. My admiration for this actor never ceases to grow. Donna Reed is gorgeous. The other actors have done a great job. Well, this is the king of feel good movies, the ultimate family movie. It can be watched multiple times without even the slightest feeling of boredom. Recommended for people who watch movies with their heart.Rating : 9/10",9,3,8,12 January 2010
Psycho," A Milestone in the Thriller Genre
","Director : Alfred Hitchcock Cast : Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera MilesUndoubtedly the most popular movie created by the genius Hitchcock, Psycho is a masterpiece from all aspects of film making, be it the plot, screenplay, cinematography, sound and above all direction. It is a very intelligent thriller and keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled until the last frame.The plot revolves around a highway motel and it's caretaker and owner Norman Bates, his sick and somewhat spooky mother, a woman who steals large amount of money from her employer to improve her love life with her boyfriend and who comes to stay at this Bates motel . The proceedings that follow are extremely interesting and enthralls the viewer. We get to see perhaps one of the best murder scenes ever shot in cinematic history, the famous shower murder of the lady who stays in the motel . The protagonist of the movie Norman Bates character has been very well written and performed by the actor concerned as well. Sometimes we as an audience feel pity and sorry for him and after knowing his mental condition, this feeling increases even more.In short, Psycho is one of the milestones of this particular thriller genre. Many thriller movies either based on this or influenced by this have come in many large numbers, but the charm and the greatness of this particular movie will remain in the minds of cinema lovers for eternity.Rating : 9/10",10,1,1,16 June 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Polanski's Best
","The movie starts with a very soothing lullaby which has a very calming effect on the viewer - but that is the only thing 'calm' about the movie. Once Again, a psychological thriller, Polanski style, this movie is the very best in it's genre. The plot revolves around Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) who come to live in an apartment which has very strange neighbors, one of them being the old couple of Roman and Minnie Castevet( Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon). Initially, they appear to be very good as neighbors, almost playing the role of parents to the young couple. Guy likes them and spends a lot of time with them whereas Rosemary does not like their constant intervention in their married life.Things change drastically when Rosemary becomes pregnant. Certain things and events happening to and around her makes her believe that her baby is in danger. Her fears, her attempt to save her child and the end outcome constitutes the movie.The movie is a pure Polanski style master-piece. His obsession of seeing woman naked and raped (Even though it is a hallucination or a nightmare) is continued in this movie. But all this perversion is for a reason which makes the viewer truly understand his intentions. On the acting front, Mia Farrow has done a superb job. After watching the movie, I felt no other actress could have played Rosemary better than her. The other actors fit the bill perfectly. Overall, not suited for all, but one of the greatest movies ever.Rating :9/10",9,0,2,1 January 2010
12 Years a Slave," Slavery....the greatest blot on humanity
","The greatest blot on humanity ever imposed by humans was and will remain slavery. It is the lowest form of how one human can exploit another. Then it does not matter if it is sex slavery or slavery to pick cotton. 12 years a slave reminds us what some of the previous generations of humans had to go through just to survive.Based on 18th century America, it is the true account of a free black man and how he is tricked and sold into slavery, separated from his family for a period of 12 years and how he survives those gruesome times. Faced with different experiences of kindness from one slave owner to absolute inhuman brutality from another, the protagonist manages to hold his ground facing adverse conditions. Some of the scenes portrayed in the movie are so gruesome and inhuman, you want to turn your face away from the screen. The act of considering another human as an animal just because he/she is of a different skin color comes as normal as sunshine on a summer morning to the white antagonists. Acting is one of the strong points here. One of the few movies, where each and every actor plays his/her part almost brilliantly. The protagonist black man played by Chiewetel Ejiofor is a revelation. Surely, the front-runner for this years Oscar Awards for best actor. Michael Fassbender as the cruel slave owner disgusts you so much, you want to kill that bastard. The passion for cruelty which he portrays is awe-inducing. The simultaneous innocence and weakness portrayed by Lupita Nyong'o as Fassbender's sex slave leaves you teary-eyed. Definitely, the break-through performance of the year. A Small role by Benedict Cumberbatch and a cameo by Brad Pitt are perfect. This was the first Steve Mcqueen movie I saw, and I am totally looking forward to complete watching his filmography. Overall, a must watch movie.Rating : 9/10",9,11,20,16 January 2014
American Gangster," Long but Engrossing Movie
","The movie name may suggest that it is a movie glorifying another Gangster or Mafia head. Well it is not only that. It can be divided into two streams of stories that hold two different perspectives - One good and one Bad (This is left to the discretion of the viewer who to consider good and whom to consider bad). Based on a true story and set in the late 1960's, this movie talks about two people, A gangster drug-lord with a heart of gold - Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) and a honest but somewhat crazy cop - Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe). Lucas revolutionizes the Drug business by cutting down the middlemen and selling 100% pure dope with a price half than the impure ones. His product named 'Blue Magic' is a rage on the streets and it shuts down the business of other Mafia's. But Popularity brings in enemies as well which helps the cops eradicate his gang slowly. The movie is about 3 hours long, but for such a long movie, it does not loses the viewer's interest. I for one was very much keen to know what will happen next which made me complete the movie in one sitting. Credit should be given to the direction .Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe, both have been given enough screen space. But separately. They share screen space just for mere 5 - 7 minutes in the climax. Nothing bad to say about both of them. They played their part nicely. A good watch for crime genre lovers.Rating : 7/10",7,2,4,19 October 2009
The Green Mile," Frank Darabon't second tryst with Prison and Stephen King
","Frank Darabont seems to be very much obsessed with Prison, Prison Guards and Prisoner's stories. So after the classic, much appreciated 'The Shawshank Redemption', he chose a fantasy Prison story based on the novel of Stephen King (Once again) as his next venture. The story occurs in flashback which is narrated by an old man in a old age home. The old man narrates his story that goes back to the 1930's when he was 40 and the head Prison Guard of a section of the Prison called 'The Green Mile'. In The Green Mile those prisoners are kept who have been given the death sentence and would be send to the electric chair after some days. One fine day, the 'Green Mile' has a new prisoner who is enormous in size (Almost like an Adult Grizzly Bear Standing Up) and who has been given the death sentence for killing and raping two small girls. As time passes by, the prison guards come to know that this prisoner has got some magical healing powers and he actually has not committed the crime after all. Tom Hanks as the head Prison Guard has given his patent restrained performance. The three actors who impressed me were Michael Duncan playing the enormous prisoner, Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison. Overall, the only flaw of this movie is that it is 3 hours long",9,0,1,22 September 2009
Jaws," I will now think 100 times before entering sea water
","Long before Spielberg got interested in dinosaurs, extra-terrestrials, Jews etc, the most deadly predator on the planet caught his attention - The Great White Shark and thus was created one of the best thrillers in cinema History. The plot is simple - A chirpy, happy sea town named Amity which is famous for it's beach-tourism faces the deadliest challenge in the form of a man-eating great white. Three people namely the Police Chief of Amity, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a local fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) and a marine scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) take it upon themselves to get rid of the man-eater and save Amity. Are they successful in doing so and what will be the cost they will pay defines the movie plot. The plot is simple, but Spielberg takes this weak plot to an all together different level with his direction. His efforts are supported by his special effects team without which this movie would not have been possible. The movie is not all about fear and screams, it has it's comic moments and the touchy emotional moments as well. Spielberg has mixed these emotions perfectly and the outcome is brilliant.What can I say about the acting, when the protagonist of the movie is A Great White Shark.The Shark plays hide and seek with the audience most of the times and is seen only for some minutes at the end. In between the 3 'Human' actors, Robert Shaw impressed me the most in his short role as a sturdy fisherman. In short, Jaws is a movie, any true Hollywood Fan wouldn't want to miss.

Stalag 17," A Trend-setting Movie
","In Hollywood and other film industries, there have been many movies on Prisoners of War (POW'S) of the Second World War. But the first account of their life and 'escapades documented by Billy Wilder in this movie (Atleast, the movie narrator says so). Stalag means prison in German and this movie deals with the POW's of Stalag 17. This particular prison has surprisingly all sergeants as inmates who are continuously trying to flee prison but in vain. After the death of two of their companions in a bid to escape, they suspect a spy amidst them. Their main suspect is a flamboyant Sgt. J.J. Sefton (Holden) who has a very good rapport with the Germans and exchanges many goodies for other favors. Many events occur consequently that strengthen their suspicion on Sefton. To prove his innocence, Sefton decides to find the real culprit. Is he successful in his conquest and who is the 'real' spy is the basis of the story. Wilder in his inimitable style has not kept this movie an all serious affair. This is actually a very light-hearted thriller drama which makes you laugh all along. I personally feel this movie inspired some of the scenes in the greatest POW movie ever 'The Great Escape'. This movie has got a gang of characters. But some who stand apart with their performances are obviously William Holden as the complicated Sefton, Robert Strauss as the somewhat weird, silly but lovable Stanislas Kasava and Robinson Stone as the mute music lover Joey.It certainly has got it's moments, but I felt there was something missing somewhere.Rating : 7/10",7,1,4,25 February 2010
Mary and Max," You got to love Mary And Max
","Mary and Max are two individuals which are poles apart from each other, live in separate continents and have an age difference of more than 30. But there is something which makes them care about and think about each other. It is the great relation of friendship. We hear that our best friends are those who accept us along with our faults and shortcomings. Mary and Max are the best examples of that. Mary is a 8 year old girl from Australia and Max is a 40 somewhat obese guy from New York. Both have some things common such as they have no friends, love a particular Cartoon and have the fetish for Chocolate. They interact with each other through letters which reveals to the viewer their life story .Sorry, if I missed to mention that this is an animated movie - Not ordinary but clay animation. It is somewhat difficult to emote through clay animation but this movie does not suffer from that. The movie is filled with dark, satirical humor but you never feel offended by it. Along with it, it has it's 'cry buckets' moments which really move you. I will certainly call it a very matured animation movie by a newbie director. It is right up there in my list of favorite animations.Rating : 8/10",8,6,9,24 February 2010
Tombstone," One of the better Biographical Westerns
","Biographical Westerns are special for the simple reason that it is even more fascinating to know that all this stuff had happened for real. These were real bad-ass cowboys. That increases the importance of the movie. This particular movie is about the peacemaker and part policeman Wyatt Earp, his family and friends and his most famous shoot-out in the wild west which is now considered a historic event. All the main characters in the movie are real, the events shown have historic backing. But still, I think, the director's job is very important here. He has established all the characters in a very believable way. This movie also may be the director's tribute to all his favorite westerns. There is everything in this movie - juggling of guns, bashing at the bar, poker, alcohol, opera singer beauty and loads and loads of gun fights.Two actors - Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are very impressive from the extended star cast, especially Kilmer. He has stolen the show from everybody. This is one of the westerns where the supporting actors have done well. Overall, a full on action western with historic importance.Rating : 7/10",7,0,1,26 August 2010
The Deer Hunter," Average Movie
","There are a lot of Hollywood movies created taking the Vietnam war as a backdrop. The Deer Hunter is one such movie but is different in the sense that it focuses more on character development than the actual war scenario. Based on a small town in America, the movie starts with the introduction of a group of town dwellers who are hard-working as well as hard-partying and whose favorite pass-time is hunting deer. Three people of the group are enlisted in the army and are bound to go to Vietnam. The war, their capture, the game of life - Russian Roulette, their escape, the consequences and the changes in their mentality and life as a whole is the movie. Each of the three men loose something valuable in the war and their happy -go-lucky attitude changes drastically into something which changes their way of life. The story is good and the acting exceptional. But it did not appeal to me as a movie. The movie is very long in my opinion (3 hours). I do not have problem with long movies. But aimless long movies are the ones which I hate. The screen time is increased in the name of character development which was unnecessary IMO. (And the movie has got an Oscar for best editing.). This is not the only problem I have with the movie. It's treatment of the Vietnam war is completely one-sided, tilted towards America. I have a keen interest in history and I felt there was injustice against the Vietnamese. The acting in the movie perhaps is the thing that makes 3 hours endurable. DeNiro and Walken are the stand-out performers. Walken is a very under-rated actor IMO and this is perhaps his best acting stint. He overshadows Deniro in some scenes. Meryl Streep has done a fine job. John Savage is also noteworthy . This movie is rated very highly by movie lovers and I may hurt their sentiments by this review. But this is my honest opinion after one viewing and it may not change ever (Because I cannot give 3 hours of my life again for this movie)Rating : 6/10",6,3,5,10 January 2010
The Great Escape," A great thrilling experience....not to be missed
","I am watching quite a few 'Escape' movies recently and nothing gets better and bigger than this one. Based on a true incident about Allied Prisoner's of War's planning mass escape mission to flee from German POW Camps, this movie takes into account all the pre and post escape incidents. The POW Camp is also known to be escape-prone and it will take something big and special to flee from there. The prisoners present in the camp are also veteran 'escapers' who are given specific jobs for the escape. For example, one is made a 'Forger' who creates false ID's, another one is made the 'Tunnel King' who will plan a tunnel long enough to get out of there . There is also a separate story of Captain Hilts (Mcqueen), an American who at the beginning tries to get out on his own but then joins the rest of them due to circumstances. The movie can be divided in two parts, The initial part shows the planning and digging of the tunnel and the second part shows the post-escape incidents. The second part is stretched a little bit IMO and the editor could have come in handy here.But the movie is a great thrilling experience nevertheless.Steve Mcqueen as the arrogant 'American' is a treat to watch. He has done some daring stunts in the second half where he hasn't used any double. That was really impressive. Richard Attenborough as the leader of the escape team did his job convincingly . Well He can act too The rest of the actors (There are a lot of them) have fit the bill efficiently. Overall, You have missed something if you haven't watched this one.Rating : 8/10",8,0,2,8 December 2009
Pineapple Express," Watch it if you are high on weed
","Why did I watch this movie could be another topic of discussion. Out of ideas, devoid of choices, I made the decision to watch this one. Plot is simple. The protagonist of the movie ,A 'process server' (I heard the job-name for the first time in my life) is a witness to a murder committed by a corrupt female cop and a very powerful drug lord. To escape from their clutches, he along with his local drug-dealer friend run helter-skelter and get into this comedy of errors involving other drug -dealers, cops, Asians and what not . After a sequence of car chases, gun shots, getting high on weed etc, the true meaning of friendship dawns upon the lead actors and the movie ends happily, and a sigh of relief for the viewer.The movie has got a collection of bad to worse to worst actors. So keep no expectations on the acting front. Yes, James Franco is a saving grace with his 'high on weed' antics. But some 2-3 good hilarious moments cannot save an entire movie from mediocrity. Overall, a below average movie with 2-3 fun moments. Watch it only if you are high on weed or severely drunk .Rating : 6/10",6,1,3,24 September 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Nice End to the Trilogy
","The third movie of the Indiana Jones franchise has many new things added than the earlier two versions of this cult series. This movie starts off with a teenage Indy in the year 1912 and makes us look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Henry played by legendary Sean Connery. We also learn he is a 'Junior' and that he hates to be called that. The job in hand for Indy this time around is to find the 'Holy Grail' of the time of Jesus Christ. Another motivation for Indy to take this expedition is that his father is lost searching for the same thing . This movie moves from New York to Venice, then from Germany to Alexandria. Yes, Indy encounters the Nazis once again in this movie as in the first edition of the movie. An addition to that is that he encounters the Fuhrer himself.This is surely a better movie than it's previous edition, Temple of Doom. The lead actress in this movie is the best in the entire series, in looks I mean. Ford and Connery charm the audiences with their small father-son fights increasing the humor quotient of the movie which is such an integral part of Indiana Jones franchise. There are some scenes in the movie which makes you question your sanity but that can be considered as a part of cinematic liberties . Overall, a definite one time watch Rating : 7.5/10",9,0,0,2 June 2009
The Godfather," Words Are Not Enough
","Cinema lovers all over the world consider this movie as the best movie ever. And to some extent I agree . The plot of the movie has been repeated and copied by so many movies coming after this, that it will be of no use of me explaining it.The characters of this movie have become legends especially of Don Vito Corleone played by the great Marlon Brando. Many other actors in different movie industries tried to emulate this character in their own way but failed to create an impact as huge as Brando created. But the character who keeps his own amongst the geniusness around is Michael Corleone which gave a first glimpse of the acting prowess of one of the greatest actors of this generation Al Pacino . Another actor who impressed is the great Robert Duvall (Tom Hagen) who played the supporting part to perfection. The movie is almost 3 hours long but nowhere the movie loses its grip on the audience .Coppola has made sure that the audiences are craving for what is going to be the next twist in the movie .The best scene in the movie according to me is the Baptism and the enemy killings scene which showcased the great capabilities of the director. 'I will make him an offer he can't refuse' can be called as one of the best dialogues of the cinema history. This is one movie any cinema lover cannot afford to missRating : 9/10",10,0,1,2 June 2009
