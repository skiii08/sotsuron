Alien 3," 'Don't be afraid, I'm part of the family.'
","I think this third installment did pretty good. Probably didn't have the same effect as when the first two came out, but it did a good job to complete a trilogy. 'You've been in my life so long, I can't remember anything else.'After surviving the LV-426, Ripley realises that she's yet again landed on another island called Fiorina 161...a prison wasteland. After making it alive out of the EEV she realises that her co-survivors didn't survive this time round. As the EEV collided with turbulence Hicks was impaled and Newt sadly drowned...oh dear! Anyway just leaving Ripley on her own (again) she battles out the alien, as the alien starts pinching the prisoners off one by one. Ripley finds out that she cant be touched by the alien, she's this time immune as she finds out that she's carrying the baby queen in her stomach! Ripley I would more or less say your f*cked! With only a short time to get everything sorted, she has to kill the alien and kill herself along with the little sh!t inside her. Good luck Ripley!Very good to complete the trilogy!",7,0,4,31 October 2004
Training Day," 'Its not what u know, its wat u can prove!'
","This is definitely one of Denzel's best! Its great to see a different side of him, and it shows he can act (unlike sum actors!). For the fans whos used to Denzel as a good guy...its finely time to see him as the baddie. The thing thats great about this movie is that when the movie starts you'd think hes a bit of a tight pr!ck and not so much of a bad guy. But once the movie leads off, you finely realize that hes playing Hoyt and becomin more of a pr!ck as the film moves forwards. Alonzo Harris is nothing like denzels past characters! And thats wat i love! Hes badAlonzo's just a.....'Civil rights violatin' mothafucka'.",8,0,11,14 September 2004
Alien: Resurrection," 'What's in fcuking side me?!'
","I thought this movie kind of let the Alien saga down!!! Now at the end of Alien3 which i thought was a good movie, she had sacrificed herself to get rid of one of the most evilest things the human race has ever seen. A brilliant way for an ending and specially for a trilogy, but... they just had to bring out a fourth!'.....I'm the monster's mother!'Yes, Alien 4, they just had to bring another one out. However I must give it some credit that I did like the movie, but I have to say... as we all know that it doesn't even compare to the original, even Alien3 beats this!!! Now if it was my choice I'd prefer it to end at number 3, as I'm sure you would all agree on. But as it came out I'd give it 6/10 but I really see no point to this movie, Sigourney Weaver revives her classic role to take part in the 4th and hopefully the last.Ripleys cloned back to life two hundred years later making her around 287yrs old! She's cloned by the DNA that was left on Fiorina 161 at the time of her death. This time she more powerful as she has human and Alien DNA. Reason? Scientists used Ripley to get to the Alien Queen. For the scientists to continue their experiments they've brought in bait, not the bait you use on a fishing rod, they've brought in men for their templates, they probably had nothing else which could attract the facehugger.6/10",Null,1,1,31 October 2004
Alien," You can't get a better sci-fi than this!
","This movie beats all other Sci-fi horrors! Ridley Scott was the one who brought the remarkable picture to our eyes, and yet he's an Englishman and thats why I'm proud! 'I admire its purity. A survivor...unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality'Seven crew members are on there way home, until they're awakened from hypersleep by 'Mother', the ship's computer system, who has detected a beacon from another planet, known as the LV-426. Their next unexpected mission is to land on the LV-426 and search to see if there is any life form, orders from 'The Company'. Three of the members carry out a search on the planet to see if they can find anything worth bringing back. It's only when they realise that Kane, one of the crew members has been molested. A 'Facehugger' attached to his head while unconscious, feeding him oxygen... what is it doing? After Kane has had the pleasure of giving birth to the little sh!t, the crew start to realise what they've brought onto the ship as it starts to pick one member off at a time.A fantastic movie by a fantastic director!",9,0,1,15 October 2004
The Godfather: Part II," 'This is the business we chose'
","I love this movie!Only two years later from the first, they came back and continued the story and they look just as good as when they first started! Its as if the filming just continued without the two years in between, and thats what i loved about this movie.Carried on from the first, Michael Corleone is now the new 'Don' as he is the only one taking after his father, apart from Fredo who doesn't have the same power as Michael. Michael carries on the family business, but later realises that he has a close traitor in his mist, and an unexpected one too! 'You Broke my heart!' While telling that side of the story, Coppola and Puzo brilliantly put together the young life of young Don Vito, and thats when Robert De Niro came in the picture and did a magnificent performance!!!Al Pacino just gets better and Robert De Niro....Brilliant!A sequel not to be messed with!IN THE LOVING MEMORY OF:Carmella Corleone 1897-1959 (died of natural causes, coincidence?)Alfredo/Frederico (Fredo) Corleone 1919-1959 (killed by Al Neri, from the orders of Fredos beloved brother Michael. Fredo gave information to Hyman Roths henchmen Johnny Ola)",10,1,4,14 October 2004
Aliens," You see this movie, bitch!
","Yes another movie which did incredibly well. Unfortunately Ridley Scott didn't direct this second installment, but the man with the mind behind 'The Terminator' James Cameron, did a very good job to continue the journey after Ridley. 'Get away from her you Bitch!'It was pretty unfortunate that Ripley was hoping someone would find her and that it would only take around 6 weeks, instead it took a whole lot longer, without her realising....57 years later the frozen Nostromo is found by a Deep Space Salvage Team. Ripley is returned to the life she had, only to find out how long she'd been floating in space and to also find that everyone she loved and knew had gone. The only thing that still existed was the company she was working for. Yet she was offered another challenge to go back out to the LV-426, where her nightmares began!Determined to face her fears and to kill the deadly creatures, she's accompanied by a team of high-tech colonial marines and one of the Company representatives to investigate.Its really cool to see Ripley progress in her confidence through out the movies!",9,0,0,15 October 2004
The Godfather," 'It's not personal... It's strictly business'
","IN THE LOVING MEMORY OF:Santino Corleone 1916-1948 (known as the 'hothead')'Don' Vito (Andolini) Corleone 1892-1954 (in 1945 Vitos life was the mark for assassination, unfortunately it didn't go down so well for the people who did it, as Vito survived the attempt. Nine years later, he died of natural causes in front of his grandson Anthony)Apollonia Vitelli/Corleone 1931-1947 ('Keep Your Friends Close, But Your Enemies Closer' Unfortunately Michael should of thought of that little saying when he found out 3seconds before watching Apollonias death, she was killed by traitor Fabrizio, one of Michaels bodyguard)A masterpiece!",10,0,2,8 October 2004
