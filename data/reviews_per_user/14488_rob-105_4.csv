Antz," Woody seems young
","Some serious thoughts under the jokes, Woody Allen seems young, entertaining and light",8,0,0,4 October 1998
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Old 'Ring-head' says trust this movie!
","They did it!  The first movie of the trilogy showed this old 'Ring-head' some new truths about the original, mainly with inspired casting and marvelous performances.  The 'new truths' part isn't that difficult really, as any good commentary or critic shows a fresh side to this world.  It's just such a relief to be able to trust a big movie (or three) with something so important; after all I'm a twice-a-year reader since 1973 with a daughter named Elbereth (now twenty-three) and Middle Earth home furnishings! Naturally I hate having to gallop through scenes I usually love to contemplate, but I will never see Gandalf or Aragorn the same again.  They even got Merry and Pippin right!  (Gimli needs more good lines.) I react to the changes in plot almost as to the differences in the Gospels in the Bible; they don't so much contradict as enrich or broaden the story. I wasn't distracted by the special effects; they simply made some of J.R.R.'s descriptive passages (which I memorize) become spectacularly visual. I'm not sure how many more times I'll see this one waiting for number two, but it'll be a lot.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
A Bug's Life," better the second time
","delicious, and tasty fake out-takes... Woody Allen echoes and great Kermit-like voices in the circus bugs... we want the video.  This is 2d generation Toy Story done proud... we liked it even better the second time we saw it today!",9,0,0,29 November 1998
Gladiator," Russell hits the big time
","Gladiator is a majestic delight.  After two viewings I find it improves with repetition.  The gore is less distressing (as with Pvt Ryan) and Russell Crowe becomes stronger - I like him better than Kirk Douglas in this kind of role, and Kirk is an immortal.  But to me, Crowe seems less contrived and self-conscious and just as powerful.  'Spartacus Lite' a la Ebert suggests to me that the older movie (filmed near my town) has more human faces and sentiment with no computer scenes (though some obvious painted horizons) while Gladiator can seem too perfect (and location-authentic in appearance as a result).  I found the Blade Runner quotes by the director heavy-handed (the crushing of the creator's head with unseeing eyes looking on, among others) but my family didn't notice it, despite many Blade Runner viewings. I loved Oliver Reed in this (after delighting in his role in 3-4 Musketeers) as well as several other actors in the supporting cast.  The simulated environments were hard to fault and very beautiful.  The battle scenes rank with the best ever - Cross of Iron, 'Ryan, Hamburger Hill, Platoon, Braveheart and others.  It is long and uneven with occasional clinker dialogue and a slow middle, but I and my family will see it yet again. With its obvious integrity and great production values I say it will stand the test of time.",10,0,0,7 May 2000
