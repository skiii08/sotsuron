First Man," Biographical
","Yes, another flight to the moon movie! But unlike all other true stories and science fiction before it, this film focuses on the life of Neil Armstrong giving a glimpse into the individual he was. This film is set apart because we now know more about him and his family including the deeper look into his wife, cheers to Claire Foy who gave a great performance. Knowing this new information, Armstrong was not the most spectacular person to get along with and his wife especially, must have been extremely patient and loving to put up with him.
The film gave more insight into the Gemini mission and what the astronauts had to withstand during their time in space. I thought the movie overdid the 'puke' cam and at times I had to look away from the screen because I didn't feel well from the unsteady picture. Also, the film was overly slow in places. If the slowness was removed it would have shortened the film time a bit which would have been nice.
Overall, a nice insight into Armstrong and family. Glad I did not see in iMax or maybe I would have had to walk out due to the home movie unsteady nature of filming. Otherwise enjoyable!",6,0,0,4 November 2018
A Star Is Born," Cooper Carries This Film
","I too am surprised by all the fantastic reviews and talk of Oscars for this film. I went to see with high expectations and maybe that's why I am somewhat disappointed in what I came away with. To be fair, I was entertained and did enjoy the movie.
First, most obviously, Lady Gaga's singing is by far the strongest asset she brings to the movie. However, her acting performance is flat and wooden, especially when on screen with a seasoned strong performer like Cooper. At times her performance almost seems awkward and staged. Secondly, Cooper amazingly has a great voice! The songs he sang were actually more enjoyable than the songs Lady Gaga sang. Better written songs and performed really well. The story itself is not breaking any new ground. One career begins to accelerate as another starts to decelerate. The movie is enjoyable, but certainly not this amazing drama with an amazing chemistry between the actors that should suck you in! Cooper carries this story and Gaga could use more acting lessons.",6,1,4,21 October 2018
Lone Survivor," Unbelievable!
","I had read the book and enjoyed it so naturally was excited to see the movie. The movie is not even close to recognizable to what I read in the book! When the seals first run into the 3 Afghan men Marcus' character is arguing to keep them alive. In his book he goes into length stating how government dictates rules of engagement and how politicians tie the hands of soldiers! Yet in the movie he is a spokesmen for the lives of the enemy. Then the soldiers pick off the Afghan soldiers easily, but they take bullet after bullet and never seem to bleed out. They even tumble off a cliff with one hitting their head on a rock, another slamming his back into a tree yet everyone can get up and keep fighting! It is ridiculous. This could have been a good movie if the actors looked at the actual material seriously instead of turning it into an 80s action flick! Even the background music stunk.",3,0,1,25 March 2016
Lion," Unfortunately Overestimated
","I was excited to see this film since I am adopted myself. The beginning was engaging and pulled in the viewer. The crazy situation resulting in the child's separation from his family was interesting. Then seeing the horrible conditions the children endured while living on the streets. When the film switches to an adult version of our character, the plot slows way down becoming mired in old flashback scenes which are meaningless to the viewer. Also, there is an adopted brother who is developmentally delayed with behavioral issues that distract from the film's content. Wanted to like this, but it just became to slow and the abstract 'visions' weren't enough to keep this going.",5,3,7,28 May 2017
