Love and Death," One of Woody's best!!!
","Hilarious comedy inspired by philosophy, Russian literature, Swedish & French films looks better with each passing year.  Woody himself has declared this film to be his favorite -even more than Annie Hall.  His Boris is a fine comic creation and almost sexy in a loopy sort of way; it's here in Love and Death where he seems strangely confident and hasn't settled into the heavy stammering and constant neurotic fidgeting that has now become his trademark.  Diane Keaton as half saint/half whore Sonja (foreshadowing her serious Looking for Mr. Goodbar character) is simply marvelous and provides a beautiful comic foil for Allen. (It's hard to remember how good of a dramatic actor she is while watching her flirt with a Napoleon impostor.) The two zing in their scenes together -Don't! Not here!- carrying them off with a played-to-the-hilt, frothy zestfulness that make you long for the days when we had good comic film duos: Silent Bob and Jay, Matt and Ben, Danny and Mel just don't quite cut it for me.  The now 28 year old film -like most of Allen's films- has hardly aged and should be seen if you haven't already.  There's a beautiful DVD treatment that's been released and I highly recommend it.  Enjoy!",Null,1,1,4 January 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Mixed bag
","There are a few good reasons to see this film: 1) the Saul Bass-inspired opening title sequence is sheer heaven and when it's complimented by John Williams's cat-and-mouse, Bernard Herrmann-like score (his best in years) the result is 3 minutes of a movie lover's dream!
2) Christopher Walken's gaunt-eyed, haunting performance as Frank's father is his best in years and will hopefully be rewarded by some critics and the Academy!3) Amy Adams brings her energy and enthusiasm to the screen right when we need her to:  the film begins to sag in the middle but picks itself up a notch when her braces flash themselves at the screen and her charmingly awkward candy striper begins to fall for Frank.4) the story itself -a young man's broken home gives way to his inner grifter who switches identities at lightning speed while being pursued by a sympathetic F.B.I. agent-is fascinating and strangely inspirational.  However, it has been directed by Steven Spielberg when it needs someone like a young Scorsese or Robert Altman or Peter Bogdonovich or Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne, Paul Thomas Anderson, or even David Lynch!  Any one of those filmmakers would give the story an extra layer and  made it memorable instead of what it is: a moderate piece of entertainment.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  Spielberg's timing and rhythyms are a just a snap off and the film drags instead of zips.  It's stale Old School when it should be fresh-cool and jazzy.  (Watch for the scene when Frank has a pool party and notice the background action -it's probably the stiffest staging of a house party since Reefer Madness.)  Leo's a good actor who doesn't deserve the wishy-washy criticism being heaped on him: his performance as Frank is just fine and he remains one of our most compelling actors.  Hanks, however, is Hollywood royalty even though he's never been anything more than funny, reliable, and sometimes solid; his performance -and Boston accent- are uneven and it makes you think that Dan Ackroyd must have been unavailable.",Null,0,1,5 January 2003
Minority Report," Minor film, major performance *slight spoiler*
","A futuristic action/suspense tale that plays out like a sprawling, souped-up, special effects-laden Twilight Zone episode with a cheesy murder mystery tacked on at the end.  It's hard to remember Steven Spielberg directed because it feels like every other futuristic action/suspense tale that's come down the block for the last 15 years.  The only real 'Spielberg' touches are his clever homage to his own first directorial job -the Night Gallery episode with a blind Joan Crawford- and a slight nod to the Chuck Jones-Warner Brothers cartoons -the timing in the scene where Cruise submerges himself underwater from the creepy-crawly mechanical spiders only to have one slow single drop from the tub's spout almost give him away evokes the best Road Runner & Coyote skit- and (of course) the all's-well-that-ends-well finale. Tom Cruise is a smart man and has taken the Burt Lancaster route: both were good looking men with average talents but they both worked hard and took risks and grew into phenomenal actors.  Cruise has now knocked 4 or 5 roles out of the ballpark (Jerry McGuire, Magnolia, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report) and proves once and for all that he's a great actor and a great movie star. He's become completely fearless in front of a camera and he takes the typical shlock detective-haunted-by-the-past part and invests John Anderton with dignity, compassion, and a powerfully emotional reserve that only he could bring.  It's a great performance.The wonderful Samantha Morton, Max Von Sydow, and Belushi-eyebrowed newcomer Jason Antoon supply their great talents and do fine work as the supporting players but Colin Farrell  -a sexy guy in a flavor-of-the-month way- doesn't really register here: he just fades into the background.Minority Report is worth seeing but it's hardly the deep, dark, mind-blowing social commentary people make it out to be.",Null,0,0,7 January 2003
Sweet and Lowdown," Almost one of Woody's best
","Woody Allen's valentine to jazz music and neglected artists would easily be considered one of his best if it wasn't for a second act that begins to meander and turn ponderous.  The evocative '30's tale of a self-destructive jazz musician (Sean Penn) who dreams of making it big while trying not to fall in love with a mute young woman (Samantha Morton) is so beautifully done that when it begins to shift towards Uma Thurman and Anthony LaPaglia, it stumbles and almost loses its magic.  The film picks itself up again towards the end but that middle section fails to interest.
 However, Sean Penn is easily one of our finest actors and gives an incredible performance that's matched by a heartbreaking Samantha Morton. Together, the acting chemistry is breathtaking; when they're apart, the film drags.  Both actors more than deserved the praise and awards bestowed upon them and their work here will probably be considered classic one day.  As great as the actors are, the sets and costumes, music and  lighting all play a major contribution to the feel of this film and show an amazing commitment to detail that Woody should be applauded for.  Sweet and Lowdown is a good film that should be seen even if it falls short of being a classic.",Null,4,7,12 December 2002
Donnie Darko," Love it or hate it
","People seem to either love it or hate it-like Moulin Rouge, American Beauty, Blue Velvet-but there's no denying it's cult power.  The film is a convoluted mix of pop culture, philosophy, science fiction, rebellion, and comic books.  I'm not sure how I feel about it but I know Roger Kelly has talent and an effective technique that also shows some skill; by contrast compare with Roger Avary's sloppy The Rules of Attraction.  He managed to coax fine performances from a cast you wouldn't normally take seriously (Noah Wylie, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, Katherine Ross) and get interest generated in Jake Gyllenhaal.  He's a sexy nerd who could be Toby MacGuire's darker, more complex brother.  Mary McDonnell acheives small miracles as Rose and Holmes Osborne does well with Eddie.  There's really not a bad performance here.  While the film does confuse, I think the key can be heard in the DVD commentary: Mr. Kelly confesses the ending was clear in his mind but allows the viewer to come up with their own answer.  It's a tricky thing to accomplish well and while The Fight Club throws its twist from left field-an idea Chuck Palahniuk thought of halfway through writing it-that film was just stylishly satiric pulp.  Here, the warnings, messages, and wormholes build toward the inevitable yet it bogs itself down; it finales with the American Beauty montage and a haunting Gary Jules song.  Kudos for Drew Barrymore for seeing something here and being instrumental in getting it made.  Another round of applause for Patrick Swayze taking a risk and playing a slick-but-shallow guru. And another for Richard Kelly being brave enough to follow through with his vision.  Though it's flawed, there's enough here to satisfy a movielover and make one curious in this new filmmaker.",Null,0,0,4 December 2002
