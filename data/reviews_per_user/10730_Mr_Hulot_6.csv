Casablanca," One of the best.
","***Spoilers***Casablanca is certainly one of the most exciting and touching films ever made.  We like it's main characters because of what they do, they are willing to sacrifice there most vital relationships for the sake of a greater cause.  They represent the best within us.The story is set in Casablanca a Moroccan seaport that is the last portal of escape for Europeans who are fleeing the spreading menace of fascism and the World War. Casablanca is full of intrigue and danger a city full of refugees from all over Europe as well as those ready to aid them (for a price) or prey on them.Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, the tough cynical owner of a restaurant where expatriates congregate.  He reveals himself at first to be a selfish and cold hearted man.  As the story progresses we learn that despite his motto `I stick my neck out for no one' he in the past has placed his life in danger for many worthy causes.  He is a romantic and idealist whose spirit has been crushed by the harshness of the world.Soon we learn the exact circumstances of his disillusionment.  Ilsa Laszlo, played by Ingrid Bergman, wanders into his restaurant, accompanied by Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid a hero of the anti-Nazi resistance.  They need letters of transit to escape Casablanca, and continue to fight the good fight, and soon learn that Rick has got them.  Rick however wants to retain his political neutrality, and we soon learn, is bitter that Ilsa walked out of him during a love affair that they had in Paris years ago.At its heart, the film is about the need to sacrifice personal happiness for the greater good.  It probably cannot be divorced from its historical context. It was released in America when the country had just plummeted into World War 2.  In order to prevent the world from being annihilated or enslaved, ordinary people had to put aside their petty grievances and find within themselves that which is heroic.  That's what this movie is about.It's also enormously entertaining. The film boasts wonderful performances by Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, another idealist trying to pass himself off as a cynical profiteer.  Peter Loore is delightfully slimy as Ugarte, a petty thief who tries to turn every situation to his advantage. As countless others have already said the dialogue is second to none, providing a plethora of instantly quotable lines.Casablanca, is rousing, thrilling and deeply moving.  It gives us the great themes within a framework small enough to feel personal.  This is moviemaking at it's best.",10,0,0,13 August 2002
Citizen Kane," The march of time...
","Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble.  It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories.  The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized.  At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains.  Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.As the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity.  Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death.  The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently  destructive of human values.  Kane himself states `If I hadn't been born rich I  might have been a really great man.What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity.  We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed.  At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people.  This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore).  Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man.  This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar.  Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time.  He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions, he broke all the rules.  The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations.  A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another.  Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth.  The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb.  Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does.  And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made.  Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film.  When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target.  Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane.  It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music.  Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams, obsessions and fears.  Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century",Null,265,355,13 August 2002
Gone with the Wind," A flawed but still vital masterpiece.
","Gone with the wind is first rate in spite of its obvious flaws.Essentially it is the story of a woman of enormous psychological power and ambition who finally meets a man who is a match for her.  All this takes place against the backdrop of the demise of the Old South during the civil war.Essentially the Old South is presented as an agrarian civilization that is destroyed by the waves of industrialization from the North.  The culture and its traditions, both good and bad we¡¯re entirely destroyed.Gone With the Wind soft-pedals the horrific realities of slavery.  The south is given the glow of a grand and dying better way of life.  It is presented as though it were an idyllic paradise.  The film¡¯s magnificent baroque cinematography contributes to this effect, who can forget that scene where Scarlett O¡¯Hera stands with her father atop a hill listening to him give a speech about the beauty of devotion to the land that you own.  The camera pulls back and we see a magnificent panorama of the white mansion surrounded by the green land and the red glow of the setting sun.  The scene is precisely mirrored later on when she looks down on the ruined mansion after the war has struck.  We are given a powerful contrast between the civilization as it once was compared to how it is after it has been crushed by war.Much of the movie¡¯s emotional power draws on its image of the remnants of a thriving culture and civilization slowly decay and vanish.  Against that backdrop, we see the passions and lusts of an arrogant and selfish young woman destroy lives.Vivien Leigh, displaying none of the wary vulnerability she shows in A Streetcar Named Desire, is a woman of iron.  She is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a quiet reserved southern gentleman.  This love seems most improbable, it is never explained, most likely she wants him simply because he is the least likely human being to return her feelings.  Her advances are known, but not objected to by Melanie played by Olivia de Havilland, a gentle ill soul who is supposed to represent the true Christian spirit. To get her hands on Ashley, Scarlett betrays and manipulates everyone in sight. She finally meets her match in Rhett Butler, a dashing, dangerous and brilliant cad, played by Clark Gable, the most lusted after actor of his day.  Originally connecting with Rhett in order to drive Ashley mad with Jealousy eventually the two become indispensable to each other. Throughout their years together they are both steadfast partners and opponents each vying for the upper hand in the relationship.  All this emotional turmoil takes place, as I have stated, against a background of social and political upheaval that seems to mirror the turmoil in their lives.Gone with the Wind successfully invokes the feeling of a world entirely different from our own.  It really does immerse you in the world of the old south.  For that reason the airbrushing of the issue of slavery and the racist depictions of the black characters are unforgivable.  Though it is worth noting that despite her stereotypical image, the character of Mammy, played by Hattie McDaniel in an Oscar winning role, is portrayed as having greater intelligence and maturity then her master Scarlett.Despite these reservations, Gone With The Wind is a cinematic landmark that demand to be seen by anyone with interest in the history of the film.10/10",Null,1,2,13 August 2002
Amadeus," Amadeus remolded by Forman
","Was Amadeus a hippie, a hedonist, a proto rock-star, a rebel, or is Forman just portraying him as such to fit the patterns of his continuing cinematic exegesis of historical figures?  Forman was raised under two dire dictatorships, the Nazi and then later the Stalinist.  No doubt that such a background fostered in his heart a dislike for all formal authority, for legalistic structures, and inspired in his mind a love for that archetypical rebel figure, the one who does not so much fight authority, because he despises it, but through virtue of higher alligence, to his own personal vision or inspiration, simply comports his life as though authority did not exist.     Mozart as presented by Forman fits this mold, and is a spiritual brother to Andy Kaufman, Larry Flint, and Randle Mc Murphy in Man on the Moon, the People vs. Larry Flint, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest respectively.  He is giving us the same character over and over again, and telling us the same story at different times and places throughout the ages. This is fair enough if Forman sees this as the essential struggle occurring within the confines of the cosmos, but does his vision also encompass the masses or is he giving us the anti- Tolstoy an view that history is driven only by the actions of a few isolated great men, visionaries and revolutionaries? Yes, I like this movie, but it does not give us the sweep and grandeur that would properly reflect the music of it's subject.  Ultimately it tells us more about it's author then it does about its main character.  Is this a case of the cannibalism of history in order to support a director's personal vision, or simple appropriation of powerful `symbolic' personalities in order to present a Manichean view of the universe? I cannot pretend to know.     I know this, the film is energetic and amusing, like all of Forman's work that I have seen, and leaves the audience with a stronger feeling of connection with the misunderstood individualist visionary then it does with the gray world which is bent on crushing him, here represented by rival composer Salieri.  The best thing it can do is inspire an audience member to take the first few tottering steps out of hypnotic TV created reality and try to create a world of his own.  Why Forman hasn't gotten around to filming the life of Vincent Van Gogh is a mystery that remains unsolved.8/10",8,2,4,23 September 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Magnificent and deliberately mysterious
","Spoilers ahead.2001: a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late Stanley Kubrick.  This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused.  Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over.  It is a film that you could meditate on.     The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer,  it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part)  the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself.     The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past.  We see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation.  The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation.  An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool-making and violence.  They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons.  We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia.  The characteristics inspired by the monument's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence.     Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development.  On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered.  The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications.  A mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter.  A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission.  Most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation.  The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all  of the traits of human beings.     The film has many outstanding sequences.  As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding.  Most memorable are 'Blue Danube' and 'Also Spake Zarathustra' (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.)  The cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life.     The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis.  In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well.  The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis.  The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution.     The architecture of the film is also meaningful.  The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie.  The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed.     This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake.  It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine.  It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope.     This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth.       In the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much.  Hollywood's view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one.  But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it.  The process of making this film used all of his creative resources.  The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax.  The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence.
     2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience.  Those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities.",10,45,92,21 August 2002
All Quiet on the Western Front," Greatest Pacifist Film
","All Quiet on the Western Front is the finest film ever made about war. Germany during World War 2 suppressed it, so powerful a statement it is against the inhumanity of war it is no wonder our leaders fear it.     The film focuses on the process by which young men are turned into killers for the state.  We see naive boys deceived by a nationalistic sermon on the virtues of self sacrifice and the glory of combat delivered by a loathsome schoolteacher.  They are thoroughly indoctrinated, and the lot of them signs up to fight in the Great War.  Only after basic training begins do they begin to realize the magnitude of what they have set themselves up for.     There are some of the most stunning and grisly combat scenes ever filmed.  One remembers a soldier hit by a bomb near a barb wire fence, when the smoke clears we see nothing left of him but his hands desperately clutching the barb wire.  Another scene involves a soldier forced to spend the night in a crater with the corpse of a man that he has just killed.  In a fever of madness, he engages the body in an imaginary dialogue, first attempting to justify his action then finally begging the inert object for forgiveness.  The scene is lurid, nearly surrealistic and terrifying.     The main character of the film is death, and the soldiers slowly getting used to his presence until they are hollowed out and numb.  They come to realize not only the brutality of but also, more importantly, the pointlessness of war.  In one discussion they wonder what they are doing trying to kill the English and the French, considering that none of them have ever known an Englishman or Frenchman.       Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket was modeled on this film in both structure and theme, but despite that film's undeniable value, this one remains superior.  At the time of my writing this review George Dumbya Bush is planning to push America into yet another pointless war with Iraq, I wish I could get every American to watch this film, it might just turn popular sentiment against the war and save tens of thousands of lives.",10,4,8,15 September 2002
