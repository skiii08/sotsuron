The Hangover," Fun and funny movie!
","Fun. That is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. It was a blast to watch, funny and strange all at once! The premise is that a group of friends head to Vegas for a bachelor party. They wake up the next day with hangovers, none of them recalling events of the night prior and noticing that the groom-to-be is mysteriously missing. What follows is their adventures in Vegas to make sense of the strange surroundings they have awoken to (a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet is the tip of the iceberg), their quest to find their missing friend while also trying to remember how it is they got into this mess in the first place. Bradley Cooper is an up and coming 'It' boy, you can tell, and yes he is charming and great in the film. But so are all of the actors. The writing is solid, the film will make you laugh. A great comedy for adults to enjoy.",8,1,3,8 June 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Recommended
","This film completely surprised me with how good it is. I had resisted seeing it in the theatre and was persuaded after hearing that it was good. Verdict: It's a fantastic film! It started a little slow, and when I saw that it was broken into 'chapters' my heart sank as I wondered how long the film was. After the first fantastic sequence, the pace seems to slow, but it does pick up again and at the end of the film I was left with the feeling that it would be one to recommend. All the actors are great in their roles, Brad Pitt was a riot! If you like Quentin Tarantino films, this is definitely one for you. Worth a look at and highly recommended.",8,0,6,8 June 2010
The Butterfly Effect," Okay
","Starring Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart and Elden Henson, this movie explores the idea that one small decision or action can change the course of not only your own life, but the lives of others. Evan (Kutcher), is breaking down mentally – just as his father did – and comes to realize he has the power to go 'back in time' and change events, and thus the lives of his family and friends. Each change leads to a different scenario, a different life experience, but none of them satisfy Evan since they are never perfect. He seems determined to ensure that everyone ends up happy, well-adjusted and sane, but with each shift it seems there is always one person in his life who ends up suffering. It is certainly an interesting premise, and the acting is quite good. Recommended.",5,0,1,8 June 2010
Peaceful Warrior," OK movie
","I read the book and really enjoyed it so that of course led me to rent the movie.The movie is quite different from the book and only covers about half of the book.Nick Nolte as Socrates did a find job, although he played the character different to how I would have imagined from the book - in the book Socrates seemed much more lighthearted and fun, full of energy and joy. Meanwhile Dan in the book got a little annoying, but Scott Mechlowicz did a good job with the character.The ending actually made me cry, it resonated with me. So overall not as good as the book but still worth watching. I'd recommend it to friends",6,0,1,10 January 2010
Jerry Maguire," Romantic comedy
","I've seen this film a few times now over the years and always enjoy it. I'm not a particular fan of Tom Cruise, but I do enjoy him in this film. Cuba Gooding Jnr steals the show with his performance, and Renee Zellweger was fantastic in this role. Jerry Maguire tells the story of a sports agent who is fired from his big corporate job and instead has to forge his own way relying on a single client. It's a movie about believing in others, believing in yourself and about questioning your own morals and beliefs. It's about finding what really makes you happy, and about finding happiness in unexpected places. A great movie recommended if you like romantic dramas or comedies, or are one of the few remaining Tom Cruise fans.",7,1,1,8 June 2010
Titanic," One day this will be a classic
","An historical film, to be sure (it made history at the box office). A classic? Probably one day, I don't think enough time has passed to truly call this a classic just yet, but of course it definitely has all the makings of one. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio shot to fame with this film, and I have to say even though they are OK, I don't think either of them struck me with their talent. They are both marvelous actors, but it wasn't until years later that I really believed that. Still, they have wonderful chemistry and make the love story believable and heartfelt. As for the film itself, it is a grand scale film, really something to enjoy on a big screen if possible. Although over the years it seems people have come to view this film with much indifference, it is a film worth seeing if you haven't already, and if you have, it is one to revisit every few years.",7,0,2,8 June 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Boring and slow.
","I didn't know what to expect going into this movie. My friend had free tickets, which is really the only reason I went. I don't know anything about Sherlock Holmes (aside from vague details), haven't read the books or researched the history of his character. So I go in with a blank slate, willing to enjoy the ride if the movie is good. Unfortunately it is not. In fact, it's bad. It's so bad and so boring that I literally fell asleep during the film. I think I missed a good 30 min chunk somewhere in the middle. Before you say, 'Well then you can't possibly judge the film since you didn't see it all,' let me say this: I didn't miss much. Because when I woke up, I was still able to follow the story just fine. I was at that stage, however, praying for the end to come quickly. The plot is bad, the acting is not much better. I hated the filming style, all that ridiculous slow-motion, fast-motion, fast cuts, narrating the fight scenes – all CRAP. And terribly distracting. I think RDJ is a good actor, Jude Law is fine and Rachel McAdams is good, too. So why did they do this movie? I place a lot of blame on Guy Richie who just seems self-indulgent and determined to be 'stylish' instead of actually making a movie for audiences. My advice: Don't bother seeing this movie, even if you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes. I don't know his backstory, but I'm told they pretty much ruined his character in this movie and turned him into some weird-ninja-dude.",4,22,39,15 January 2010
The Ugly Truth," Enjoyable film
","I liked this film so much I went out and brought a copy to keep so I can re-watch it whenever I like. Somehow this romantic comedy passes the average mark, to the point where I can say I love this film. Romantic comedies are hardly ever original nowadays, and the idea of two mismatched people falling in love against the odds or expectations is certainly not new. But Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl make it work, with the help of a quirky and fun script. In my opinion Butler is the one who really saves this film, because even though his character is a jerk most of the film, in quieter moments he shows us a softer side – with just a look – that makes the audience aware there is more going on below the surface of his character. The end scene between the characters in the hot air balloon is all Butler, as he sells the love story ending everyone wants. I really was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film, and highly recommend.",7,0,2,8 June 2010
