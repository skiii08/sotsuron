Sucker Punch," Zach Snyder is the better Michael Bay
","Walking into this movie, I had mixed expectations.With Zach Snyder directing, I knew I was going to get plenty of action with so much slow-mo that it would probably kill me. I was correct with that assumption.Beyond that, the movie seemed like it had a great premise, and in combination with Snyder's directing style, I thought it could be a damn good movie.Now after seeing it, I am slightly conflicted. So I will just break it down into different points.CG/Action: HOLY BALLS WHAT IS GOING ON! OH MY GOD THAT IS SO CRAZY WH.. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! So in other words, it was pretty amazing. Action was great, with good uses of slow-mo though there was definitely too much of it, and with any movie with too much slow-mo, you get 1 or 2 unnecessary shots of something flying through the air with a slow-mo close up, or some kind of slow-mo battle hit on something/someone. And overall, it was used too much, and I was fully expecting a lot of slow-mo.Not even talking about the action, just the landscape, the scenery and all that jazz. It was still pretty impressive. The worlds they give you when you are in Baby Girl's mind are creative, expansive, detailed and a little bit breathtaking, though the action makes it too fast to be out of breath for long.Acting: This was really hit or miss. Baby Girl really didn't have much acting to do with all the action scenes she was in. She could pull off the action scenes (while getting me excited in more ways than one), but off the actions scenes, there were a few good, and a few bad. The other girls, again had a lot of action scenes, so those were choreographed well, but out of them, just some good and bad. Blondie has a moment where... Well, if you have ever seen Happy Gilmore, there is a seen where he is about to get hit with a car, and someone screams 'HAPPY LOOK OUT AH!!!' but it comes out as 'HAPPYLAGADAH!'. If you don't know what I am talking about, watch the movie again =p. It was funny, which went completely against what the scene was going for.Again, it was hit or miss. Concept/plot: From what I understood of the movie, the concept seemed pretty good. Some girl getting locked away for some reason, and she had to go into her mind for some reason to escape. During/After, I loved the concepts presented. How the whole escaping your mind thing came into play, the important plot points that fueled the whole thing, they were all intriguing and interesting. I don't want to give anything away, so I will be vague, but the ideas themselves are very captivating. Fused with the plot, you have a grand idea for a movie. Not necessarily unique, but still something that can make a great movie.The execution of it all was disappointing though. Well, that is misleading. They did it in ways that were good, but there was so much more they could have done with it. They left out points that would make parts of movie much better, and they had a few parts that could have been changed or done differently. Give the concepts to a director such as Peter Jackson or Martin Scorsese, and it could have been done beautifully. Zach Snyder, though I like him, he doesn't make the most phenomenal movies with compelling plots.Actor/Actresses: Well, mostly actresses... Yeah everyone was gorgeous, beautiful, and most of the guys in the theater were probably turned on through most of the movie, through a combination of explosions and revealing clothing. I have no complaints.Overall, I think it was a good movie. Expect a lot of the appeal to be in the action, but the plot isn't totally devoid of worthiness. There are some cool points, decent acting and intriguing ideas, and in the genre of action, Zach Snyder is definitely does it better than Michael Bay, but don't expect another Inception.",8,14,30,25 March 2011
Iron Man 2," Great Movie, just some things need more explanation
","Before I went to see the movie, I looked online to see what people thought of it, and there was a lot of mixed reviews, so I didn't know what to think.At the end of the movie, I was very impressed by the movie. It added a lot to the first one, while still moving on with its' own story. It had a good mix between comedy, dialog, and action, though I think it could have taken a small bit from the dialog and add it to the other two parts.Something I have noticed about Iron Man 1 and 2 is that both movies were setting up something. During most of Iron Man 1, they were setting up the Iron Man story; they were giving Iron Man's back story. That makes sense, to explain where the hero came from. So when I went to see Iron Man 2, I expected it to jump right into things, but by the end of the movie, I realized it was setting up some more. (1st of two spoilers) At the end of the first movie, after the credits their was Nick Fury, from SHIELD, wanting to talk about the Avengers. Okay reference to the avengers, that is cool and all. Then when the second movie came, Nick Fury played a bigger part, and you slowly realize that Iron Man 2 is slowly setting it's way up to the Avengers movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not trying to drown us in Avengers references and scenes. There really are only two or three scenes talking about the Avengers, and a few clever references (a certain shield belonging to a certain super hero) and that is about it. The thing is that all of Tony Stark's progression as a character in this movie, is to guide him to being a part of the Avengers. (2nd of two spoilers) And the end of the second movie, after the credits, you see a guy from SHIELD in New Mexico, and they find 'something' and you see Thor's hammer, which is going to be the next movie in the series.So though it is a good movie, and made my inner nerd freak when I saw Thor's hammer, I am starting to feel iffy about the Avengers Movie, whenever it comes out in a few years. They still need to do Thor, Captain America, and Ant Man, and then the Avengers. Will the last three movies just be set ups as well? And when we do finally reach the Avengers movie, will it be as amazing as all the sets up make it seem?That is a question that only time will answer. I still recommend seeing this movie, if you are a comic book fan, or even just an average movie fan.",9,2,2,8 May 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," In my opinion, first good video game to movie transition
","I am a big video game nerd, so when a good game or game series get made into a movie or movies, I get excited, and nervous. Turning a video game into a movie is a hard process, because so much of what makes a good video game good, is the interaction between the storyline and the user control. Without a movie theater that lets us vote on what we want to happen or what we want the main character to do, the whole thing loses that decision aspect. So it is hard to make a good video movie.I have seen many other movies based off of video games. The Super Mario Bros movie... awful. The Bloodrayne series, and any other movie done by Uwe Boll is just terrible (he has turned a lot of video games into 'movies'), Silent Hill was a decent movie, but compared to the original game, it wasn't that respectable. The Resident Evil movies had hardly anything to do with the original games so I can't even compare them. That is all I can think of off the top of my head.Other GOOD directors such as Peter Jackson, want to try and tackle such an idea, specifically with Jackson, the Halo games. He and others involved in that project realized it would be too hard, too costly, and too problematic to make such a highly rated game series into a movie, so it got put an indefinite hold. So even good directors like Peter Jackson take their time with the idea.So going into this movie, I was expecting to be disappointed. The Sands of Time was one of my favorite games for the gamecube/PS2/xbox console. When I was done with the movie, I was throughly impressed. It wasn't groundbreaking in cinematography or anything of the sort, but for the type of movie director Jerry Bruckheimer had to deal with, he did a great job.The movie itself didn't mirror the actual game, because if so, it would have been a crazy movie, but it did keep the major key elements that was in the original story. There was even some homages paid in the movie, that normally wouldn't have been smart film shots, but referenced to the cinematic in the game. It was small things like that that made me appreciate the movie more. The movie had great action, thoughtful dialog and really interesting CG that complemented the key story concepts I mentioned earlier.The only complaints I had were: - There were some cheesy lines from time to time, but I was kind of expecting that since it is a Disney movie. - The fight style of the game, of Dastan, was unique and is one of the main reason the game was so much fun to play. He was a fast, acrobatic fighting machine. He would jump and flip off walls, slide, turn, dive off anything and everything in the game, making the obstacles an interesting play through. In the movie, they do have some scenes where he has to show those skills, but it is only for a short time. He does do a good amount of fighting, but less of the acrobatics. I really wish they did a little more of that in the movie.Besides that, I thought it was a great movie, and anyone else that likes a good action movie, or anyone that was a big fan of the games should go see it!",8,1,3,4 June 2010
Shrek Forever After," It's... another Shrek movie.
","I wouldn't say this was a bad movie. That would be a lie. I did enjoy this movie.The major problem with this movie was that it just was another Shrek movie. Similar plot line, same jokes as the other ones, same resolution.As a movie, it was alright, but it failed to stand out as anything. It didn't do anything to make it stand out from the rest of Shrek movies, or in movies at all. It was 'Just another Shrek Movie.' That is how I felt about it. It was an interesting concept, adding to Shrek's life story, but by the end of the movie, I thought to myself 'Well, at least I didn't pay to see this.'So, I would say it's worth a watch, but don't expect anything exceptional.",6,2,4,20 July 2010
Up," Pixar's best film yet!
","I have always been a big fan of Pixar's movies. I have seen everyone of their movies, and I have never disliked a movie. Some were only good, and not great, but I still enjoyed every single one of their movies.The the movie that came out before Up, WALL-E, showed to be an amazing movie and even got a nomination for an Oscar. It seemed hard to beat that, but they managed to to come close, if not beat them.Up is a fantastic movie, based on a simple promise between two people who love each other to death. An old man, who loved his wife very much, and was willing to keep a promise they kept, even after death; to go to Paradise Falls.Up had a lot of firsts for their series of movies. A lot of violence (though child-like), blood, a reference to being sterile or even still birth, not to mention, a character having a mullet =pRegardless, even with these new elements, Pixar manages to make a masterful piece of art that will wow and astound you, and making you want to go out and buy this movie as soon as you can.",10,0,2,7 March 2010
