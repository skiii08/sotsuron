Blade Runner 2049," A marvellous picture, a tremendous sequel and a visually triumphant piece of pure artistic cinematography.
","To be honest, I have never thought that a picture -at least one that is made by mere mortals- could be this perfectly rounded, astonishingly profound and overall sublime and enjoyable: blade runner 2049 superseded all expectations and defied all the unfavourable odds since it was unfortunately met by a less enthusiastic response from the unworthy common cinema crowd, because if such a high end film has been showered with praise by critics who valued its aesthetic and artistic value, yet had such low audience reception- even though it had their amazement - then we simply do not deserve good pictures anymore! 
That being said, let's immediately delve into what makes blade runner 2049 such an amazing picture, and one of my all-time favourites. Evidently, there is not a single movie that had succeeded without having a great cast, and this movie is not an exception, gathering some of Hollywood's finest: an ensemble cast containing Ryan Gosling , an actor who ironically fits the role so perfectly, starring as 'K', an android cop whose sole mission is to retire replicants , a form of bioengineered 'humans': organic machines endowed with great strength and intelligence created to obediently serve their human masters. A blade runner in the street jargon, 'K' struggles between exploring his identity and trying to do his job, a position that was once filled by Rick Deckard, played by the great Harrison Ford, the protagonist of the previous picture who is now fleeing the authorities. Their stories interlink so vividly when K's monotonous life with his holographic partner joy -played by Anna de Armas- is shaken by dangerous doubts about his nature and origin which leads him to seek the answers in the troubled and gloomy past of replicant history. The realistically stoic performance of Mr. Gosling and the sense of controversial humanity that Harrison Ford's acting brings to it is surprisingly not the reason that made me exalt it this much; I have seen this dystopian futuristic picture that addresses the worst consequences of human degeneration and societal decadence so fearlessly, as a work of great beauty: behind the urban dark colours of a suffocating futuristic L.A and the rusty colours of a toxic Las Vegas lies a gem of cinematography, the work of a camera moved so creatively to produce one of cinema's greatest shots. Dennis Villeneuve has proven once and for all a place next to this century's best film directors, backed by his brilliant precedent works such as prisoners, Sicario and Arrival. This movie is by all means a visual feast full of sharp colour changes, deep symbolic imagery and ravishing wide shots that celebrate both the pulchritudinous creation that is the lively human form in all its height and the lowest form of exploitation and duplicant maltreatment. But the most astonishing feature of this movie has to be the reality it portrays: if the original blade runner, directed by the brilliant Ridley Scott, had dealt with the segregation and subsequent hunt for duplicants, and asking about what makes us so different, and what makes one human, the sequel has finally put fourth the most important question: 'do androids dream of electrical sheep?'. This picture discusses how new life forms that transcend the limitations of physical existence claim a space so big in our lives that we can no longer live apart from them, something that made an impossibly tragic relationship - the one between K a machine and joy an AI-controlled spectre- procure my compassion.
A moving, well crafted and brilliantly directed movie, blade runner 2049 is by far one of the best sci fi films I have ever watched, and one of the few that made me care about its events even though they are purely fictional, a movie that encountered some misfortunes along the way but succeeded in being the best sequels of all time.",9,1,8,12 June 2018
Darkest Hour," An Oscar worthy picture embellished by a beautifully delivered performance.
","'Darkest hour' is a masterpiece, one of the rarest pictures to convey authentically the ambiguous and shallow intricacies of security councils and defence rooms during the second World War, it follows one of history's biggest politicians, the former British prime minister Winston Churchill, a man who stood alone against the pernicious European peace treaty that would have rendered the United Kingdom a slave nation to the German Nazi regiment. Winston Churchill, as depicted by the Oscar worthy Gary Oldman, was a man of honour and pride, one who would never allow his beloved country and fellow countrymen to fall into the hands of a ravaging European war , a man who didn't let his blood stained past hinder him from his political duties. Let's be frank and delve in directly to the thing that compelled us the most to buy tickets to this picture: the man , the legend , Gary Oldman , one of Hollywood's greatest actors and the highest grossing actor at the moment in all of history, He is undoubtedly the most suitable man for the endeavour , and believe me, I am not exaggerating when I describe his role that way : portraying one of Britain's greatest men is without a doubt a very difficult thing , let alone for a British man . This huge responsibility is furthered by the fact that the actor and the personage have nearly nothing physically in common, the actor , a man of a slender physic, had to adapt himself with Churchill's weight and resemble to the most his manners and most importantly his face , one that was worn out by politics and its complexity, a job that couldn't be possible if not for the make up team that stood by the actor to create the closest depiction of Winston Churchill known to date. Even though the attempts were multiple on the story of sir Churchill during the second world war , this picture topped them all ,hence its staggering record of 6 Oscar nominations: it didn't rely totally on the mind blowing effect of its astonishing cast , notably the one in a lifetime performance delivered by Mr. Garry Oldman , but wrapped the whole thing in a visual gem : one of this movies pillars is its flawless directing , M. Joe Wright created a compelling picture to add on its beautiful story , and succeeded in supporting the cast's expressive acting with a war tensioned atmosphere , one that explores the depths of war in Europe , and the sense of powerlessness that turns good men cruel , this picture clearly does not try to justify the critical decisions that were taken during that period and that perhaps directly killed countless innocent Men , it only shows that the worse have clearly been avoided thanks to the manner in which Winston Churchill solved the moral dilemmas of the war. 'Darkest hour 'is one of this year's top five pictures, it deserves the critical acclaim that it received and will undoubtedly be commemorated as Gary Oldman's best performance (although I am a devoted fan of LÃ©on the professional ! )",8,0,3,21 February 2018
The Hateful Eight," Quinton Tarantino strikes, once again!
","It hasn't been a long time since Tarantino's first try on the western genre: 'Django unchained ', which was by all means the most financially successful picture this director has ever created and it's once more a huge stamp in his neat directorial career, nobody can deny that Quinton Tarantino is one of Hollywood's most creative and immaculate directors, and 'the hateful eight' does nothing but to approve. It is by far one of the best written, directed and screen played spaghetti westerns of all time and it's another flash of the old Tarantino 's story over action. As obscure and flagrantly dazzling as every one of his movies are , Tarantino confines this masterpiece in a 'reservoir dogs' like setting , only that it is set in a post- civil war united states .In a time of hatred , racism and blood lust, black bounty hunter and ex- major Marquis Warren, played by the amazing actor Samuel. l. Jackson, finds himself trapped by a blizzard in a shack with a curious group of people among which stands Kurt Russel as John Ruth 'the hangman', a brute for whom Mr. Russel was naturally fit, tasked to escort a convicted female to a nearby town to be executed, only to be interrupted by a unprecedented blizzard that leaves him to accompany the major and another unexpected guest to their safe haven. In this tensioned atmosphere stands out a man of a familiar personality someone whose character is charmingly witty ,extremely skillful yet apparently dangerous, seemingly unusual to such an excruciatingly calm set. As a matter of fact, anyone who'd watched 'the inglorious bastards' would think he's kind of a western version of Christopher waltz's unforgettable 'Hans Landa' ,many people would even say that the persona itself, actually played by the brilliant Tim Roth, is nothing but a lazy copy of the German icon, which is kind of true seeing that Oswaldo Mobrey is nothing more than a polished adapted version of a Nazy officer, is it really that bad to renovate such a memorable personage in a new fresh landscape and with a new actor whose talent is nothing less than his predecessor. In my opinion, it's certainly a hard task that only reveals the brilliancy of the writer that is Mr. Tarantino. As expected from this surprisingly infamous director, this picture has it sufficing share of twist reveals and top-notch action. I can promise you the same way I do for every Tarantino movie (maybe apart from death proof) that this picture is a must see, it's a visionary gem that despite the decor monotony will always keep you on the edge of your seat. It ' s a great picture with a lot of depth and artistic value for it is in itself a mystery that gradually unravels itself in Tarantino-esque manner.",8,1,2,2 September 2017
Interstellar," Interstellar: a true space odyssey.
","How could I describe such a beautiful picture, such outstanding performances and top notch directing? Christopher Nolan's interstellar is the year's true gem, and above the most authentic scientific experience that Hollywood has ever witnessed throughout al its long history of space films, an astonishing accuracy that was guaranteed by the now Nobel prize winner Tip Thorn. It is a true Oscar worthy masterpiece. Interstellar is a perfect mix between brilliant cinematography, staggering visual effects, and a surprisingly accurate depiction of the world of astrology, and is inarguably the best picture by visionary director Christopher Nolan (I still concur to that statement in the year 2018, after 'Dunkirk ' his latest epic film, has been brought to the big screen). But let's not speak profusely about the brilliance of Christopher Nolan, for it is a universal consensus. Instead let's dwell on the real charm of this movie, the one that transcends its scientific accuracy, which is its incredible ensemble cast and their respective performances, starting by Mathew Mconaughey who made an Oscar worthy piece of acting, portraying Joseph Cooper, a widowed spacecraft pilot who struggles between his responsibilities as a father and those of the leader of earth's last hope to escape an impeding extinction, a character with so much emotion to show but in such unforgiving conditions and that only an experienced and talented actor can understand and depict. In such a dark apocalyptic atmosphere, though shot dynamically and rather beautifully by Christopher Nolan's camera, shines a persona that soaks all the heavy scientific and gripping scent of the movie into a gentle mix of hope and affection: in a time of hopelessness and fear, Amelia Brand, portrayed by the beautifully talented Anne Hathaway, disavows science in a time where can only lead to her doom and acknowledges entities that not even science can understand, human sentiments that transcend space and time. This stance, though seen by some as criminally obscene and illogical, is of the essence of this picture's philosophy, one that is meticulously explained and pictured by the beautiful imagery and clever dialogue that interstellar has more than enough to show. Another exceptional feature of this picture its perfectly timed usage of wide shots, using this to create peaceful pauses throughout the intense course of the film to silently stare to the inspiring abyss of the deep dark space, giving the viewer a sense of immersion and serenity that only a few movies succeeded in achieving.
One might call interstellar a technical masterpiece, a visual chef d'oeuvre or a scientific reference, yet its most important aspect is far more deeper in my opinion, one that supersedes the story or the future it represents: the depiction of humanity as a lonely entity in this universe and exploring our connection with it, discovering that the outcome of us being the only species even when settling in the fourth dimension is quite possible is for me very unsettling, what's most praise worthy in this marvellous picture is the question it leaves the audience with, as it is for all the pictures that Christopher Nolan has blessed us with.",9,1,1,28 June 2018
Split," M.night shaymalan's big return.
","It was all about 'split' the week it came in theatres , and honestly it's by far the most compelling, thrilling and exciting movie of this season ,it was inarguably an Oscar worthy picture. It's hard to be decisive about how good are M.night shaymalan 's movies are , since two of this era's most acclaimed movies ( 'the sixth sense' and 'unbreakable'. ) were his making , yet his career was undoubtedly in a huge recession or even in a distressing decline since 'the happening' . Yet , Mr.shaymalan never ceases to amaze,not only did he make 'split' which is the triumph of 2017's thrillers list , he also showcased one of this decade's most brilliant actors; James Mcavoy, this movie's ultimate star.Even though his ecstatic acting talent had been cornered and frankly wasted on either bad dramas or corny PG-13 superhero movies he made his breakthrough in this tremendous portrayal of the multi personality young man named,truly and among others , Kevin Wendell in his deranged journey in depths of his own dissociative mind , and in his life long struggle between complete insanity and a promised normal life, under the guidance of his most faithful companion and 'DID' activist Dr. Karen Fletcher portrayed by the astonishing Betty Buckely . James Mcavoy has exhibited under Mr.shaymalan's visionary supervision a great deal of talent as he shifts both physically and mentally between twenty two completely distinguished personalities, in which the youngster Hedwig resides the hardest to portray, leading Mr. Mcavoy to lead one of this industry's best performances of all time. In this Odessy like journey Kevin drags Casey Cooke who's portrayed by Anya- Taylor joy in a labyrinth of despair and terror, this put the promising actress in a position in which she had excelled being one of the key elements of the well crafted psychological horror story. Split is by all means the gem of M.shaymalan 's movie universe and quite the kick starter for all the incredible young cast .It's a new take on this new fusion that mixes both the horror elements from a neo noir movie and the entertaining thriller action in one brilliant story that proves one more time that the director M.shaymalan made his comeback, knowing a new tie-in movie is already in pre production. This only leaves to wait for the visionary's big psychologically themed pictures in which he exceeds.",7,1,3,17 July 2017
Get Out," Well directed and subtly terrifying: get out is my kind of horror movie.
","This picture honestly came out of nowhere, because who would expect from Jordan Peele, a man who was knee-deep in comedies and humorous yet of poor taste comedic duos, would write and direct this visionary picture. 'Get out' is by far my most favourite horror film, a classy film that does not rely on cheesy jump scares and completely irrelevant stories, it is a film that raised the bar of great scary movies and transcended to a high artistic level, utilising the power of cinematography, dialogue, soundtrack, symbolism and acting to crate a gem , a movie that sends shivers down one's spine without any kind of conventional scaring technique . First of all, this movie is a directorial triumph, with a scent of classic Tarantinesque vibe and subtle foreshadowing and clever writing, Jordan Peele took Hollywood by storm with his first and original work featuring an ensemble cast of both new commers and more experienced actors. Photographer Chris Washington , portrayed genuinely by Daniel Kaluuya, is an African-American photographer who has an interracial relationship with white wealthy southern girl rose Armitage , depicted by Allison Williams, and is obliged to meet her apparently opened family ,but after experiencing multiple incidents inside the family's residence, it is clear that the Armitage family has other plans for the poor Chris. The great amount of fear and plain confusion that Chris feels during his visit is beautifully screened by the incredible and Oscar worthy performance of Mr.Kaluuya , this added to the intimidating and honestly anguishing performance of Catherine keener added more depth and creepiness to the already shocking reality conveyed by the theme of the movie itself . Another crucial element in the success of the movie is the brilliant use of camera angels: the movies is a collection of perfectly shot and unsettling scenes that gave this movie its originality and granted its success. 'Get out' sets itself apart from its peers, giving more importance to writing, seen in the well-crafted screenplay, and vivid performances of its cast making the audience clench to their seats in both awe and fear. But what made me love this picture so much was how visionary the overall directing was, how much importance was given to the smallest details in the film, to a point in which you will always miss something in the first time you will watch this movie.
Another important aspect of this movie was its noble cause, or at least is noble message. The entire movie is an allegory of the racial state of some of America's communities especially towards people of colour, 'Get out' recaps rather brilliantly what has been said multiple times in many significant Hollywood films, but this particular picture meant the most to me because it made itself as a work of art in the process: this mesmerising picture is going to be the best start for a staggering career for the ascending director Jordan Peele.",7,1,2,13 May 2018
American Made," A deeply entertaining picture about the downfall of an American dreamer.
","'American made' is undoubtedly one of the funniest and most charming pictures I have ever watched, it adds an incredible one man cast to a flawless direction and an extremely moving story. It stars the one and only Tom Cruise as Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who finds himself in a turmoil of drug and weapon smuggling, compelled by an opportunist CIA operative who, once pressured by the geopolitical repercussions of their operation, leaves Barry stranded in a violence ravaged central America accused of drug dealing and money laundering. This picture is, in my humble opinion , one of the best depictions of 'the war on drugs' campaign that was led by the former USA presidency ,a time when central America became the promised land for ones who lack moral qualities and would do whatever it takes to grow as rich as possible before the cocaine fuelled mayhem there could settle down. Amid this human madness was caught Barry seal, a southern family man, whose sole interest was to provide more for him and his family and truly achieve the American dream. But, to the surprise of many, success in that period of global hysteria can only be achieved through illegal activities, something that was more than simple under the inter-continental crisis. as a matter of fact, Barry seal's involvement in these activities is undoubtedly an immoral act for which a legal prosecution is more than merited, selfish and stubborn as seal's actions may seem you can only root for him and support his unlucky adventure, even though we fully comprehend his unforgivable trespass of the law . Is it the charismatic personality of tom Cruise? Or is it just the genuine everyday working class man Doug Liman made him? To be fair, 'American made' wouldn't be such a good picture without the visionary direction of Mr. Iiman , he is by all means one of Hollywood's finest , with a directorial career that includes among many Mr. and Ms. smith and the Bourne identity , a personal favourite : this picture was so well crafted that it makes you abandon your ethical righteousness in favour of another victim of the injustice system , maybe many are right to think that Barry Seal was a insensible low life criminal , an immoral drug dealer , but according to Doug Liman he was nothing more than a simple man with a big hope , a southern naÃ¯ve man who was used by an uncaring society , he is an American hero who had his share of mistakes and bad deeds , but he doesn't have to go down in the American history as a dishonest fraud nor as an iconic patriot , he is simply an example of both greed and faith , Barry seal is the American dream made of flesh and blood , a common and calm life that was disturbed by the shallow flashings of wealth , and whose demise was certain the moment he took on the burden of achieving his dream , in the American way.",6,0,0,28 December 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A thorough and remarkable performance by Ben Affleck congested in an inconveniently slow paced movie
","Make no mistake, batman v superman :dawn of justice is an astonishing picture , it proves conclusively that Zack Snyder is a visionary and a world class director, yet in spite of all the respect that I give for all his pictures, I contest deeply over one single small yet crucial detail : the excessive length. The movie was filled with unnecessary and annoyingly lengthy scenes. For example, all of superman's meaningless walks through the capitol building or the streets of New York were easily, and in my opinion harmlessly expendable. Those spare moments would have been creatively used by the director or the screen writer to shed more light on one of this movie's biggest triumphs: the batman. Ben Affleck's performance was by all means this movie's last and best hope. I hate to use one of this domain's most utilized expressions but his acting was incredible, and this was for him the ultimate challenge. Because before I watched BvS, I had seen the dark knight returns: one of the few animated movies that have deeply touched me. This old masterpiece was DC's last fascinating movie that had, unexpectedly, amazing voice acting. The resemblance between that movie and the one we are talking about is uncanny , it even follows the same story arc but with a few big changes that made the batman character more intriguing, because it is for the first time since Michael Keaton's unforgettable performance in Tim Burton 's dark fantasy, that we see batman killing without remorse, affirming that he is no longer the guardian that Gotham deserved. It seemed like the incorruptible knight has finally fallen to the temptations of taking a man's life and this in itself is extremely shocking, because something must of had shattered his values and I as everyone who have seen the movie are craving to know what forced this man to show such brutality and despair. That's why Alfred pennyworth ,played by Jeremy irons, is for me one of this movie's essential pillars: satirical though as he may seem Alfred is this time worried about the safety of his friend and master, because the world has gone crazy since the arrival of the man of steel, whose mere existence in this movie ruined it for me . Henry cavil had his glorious moments and will undoubtedly have even more, but this movie is by far not one of them. In the time when every single member of the cast had shown a spark of good acting, Henry cavil exhibited such coldness and passiveness that he turned to be unworthy of this movies time, unfortunately he was there in every moment and every scene to the point that I started to doubt his acting skills In a nutshell, this movie might have been this year's biggest disappointment as the majority of the critics had confirmed .And I approve with certainty that this movie was the victim of poor editing and rushed screen writing, but at least showed us the bright side: the future of the dark knight is in safe hands.",6,1,2,2 April 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," An unexpectedly entertaining journey through the cruel depths of war.
","Hacksaw ridge is by far Mel Gibson's best movie as director; it had all the criteria for it to be this year's best picture. It is a calm journey through the life of a simple yet unstable southern family; it brought us to admire the simplest joys of life, the happy and loving daily life of the American suburban families before the war. This movie showed us the true meaning of love and compassion and restored our hope in humanity. And then as expected gave us its obscure side, throwing us in the most well directed and performed war decors ever filmed, a true human carnage between the seemingly weak American army and the ruthless Japanese battalions. Hacksaw ridge is a story of pain and suffering and war, but it also represents the eternal fight between good and evil, and by that not meaning the two armies themselves but the true battle between faith and despair. Hacksaw ridge is truly a modern odyssey. One of the most crucial elements of such an amazing quest is the protagonist Desmond doss, a man of iron will and unbreakable faith who tried to save humanity in my opinion from violence and war. Portraying such a persona is undoubtedly a great challenge, and Andrew Garfield was up to it: The young actor exhibited with the help of the industry's veteran Mel Gibson one of the most sincere performances in the history of war films, his great acting skills were a key element to the success of this picture. The character of private doss was itself a fascinating trait that contributed to the critical acclamation this picture had received, he is as Andrew Garfield perfectly fits a man of a poor physique yet of great courage and altruism, his a medic that dived head first into the hordes of dead in the battlefield without hesitation, he is a loving husband, a great son and a true patriot who stood willingly in the face of the dreadful war in japan in order to save his fellow brothers in arms. In this dire times , the only one who truly stood by the side of private doss was his father Thomas , a good turned cruel man that lived to tell about the war to end all wars, he was disturbed and traumatised , something that Hugo weaving mastered on screen , he was such a great cast choice and delivered more than what was needed from a secondary character, he visualized in every move he did and every word he spoke the true horrors of war, he was all the time dark and shocked demonstrating what a war could do to a country, a family and a man. To sum it up, hacksaw ridge is definitely a must watch, it's by far one of this year's most exciting and overwhelming pictures. It is a top notch movie that depicts unprecedentedly the march of one man to end a war, it's the story of a real war hero who chose not to take the life of his brethren, and it's a movie for the director Mel Gibson to be proud of.",7,8,11,8 April 2017
