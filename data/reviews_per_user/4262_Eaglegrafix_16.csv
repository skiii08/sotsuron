Walk the Line," You Get only a Glimpse
","I've waited a long time for 'Walk the Line.' A fan of Johnny Cash all my life, I was anxious to see a movie about his life. No movie can do justice to a man like Johnny Cash in the time permitted. But the part of his life this movie deals with, is does well as far as the story and gives a strong performance of what it chooses to show about the singer. My opinion is that it leaves out some very important things about Johnny Cash. I never got to see in this film the creative intelligence of the Man In Black when it came to his ability to write songs and music. I see it in the way he deals with situations in his life but not otherwise. It was something that made him good all his career that was missing. About the two main roles. Reese Witherspoon absolutely convinced me I was watching June Carter (with the exception of the first scene she was in). Sorry, but I am not one who is crazy about Juaquin Phoenix's performance. As good as it was, he only had me convinced during the scenes he was singing. That part of his performance was powerful but that is where I think he concentrated his study and efforts. In the non singing scenes I had flashbacks to other Juaquin roles - especially in Gladiator. There are other actors that could have matched Reese's performance level - whether they were considered or offered, I do not know.",7,1,4,3 December 2005
3:10 to Yuma," Where have all the good westerns gone?
","I love westerns, they are my favorite genre both for reading and movies. I was excited to see this with Crowe and hoped it would have the grip of a good true western like The Quick and the Dead. Especially since it was a remake of an excellent film.Not even close. Yes, it started with promise up through where the Ben Wade is taken into custody. The manner in which that happened and the the rest of the movie was a disappointment and an affront to the truly good westerns. Ben Wade is bad, real real bad...no he is good at least a little bit...no he is totally evil...no he has some redeeming qualities...blah blah blah.By the time the film ended it was only Dan the one legged rancher about whom I had any feelings for and could care less that Ben was allowing himself to go off in the train so that Dan would get his Pinkerton money paid to his family who needed it now that he died. Ben will escape before the train reaches Yuma. The only good thing about Dan's death is that his son finally was proud of him.Someone needed to watch Shane again to see how to do it in classic western style.",1,7,14,29 September 2007
Skyfall," Best of the Craig Bond Films
","Daniel Craig is without question in this reviewers opinion a great actor. The roles he has played as James Bond are not his greatest work and the reason can be the the stories and the Bond character are not demanding enough to pull the best out of Craig. Bond has had a formula that must be followed or he fails at being bond. His vodka martinis, his trysts with and treatment of 'girls' or beautiful women requires little talent. In fact requires little less than to look, walk and talk in a suave and sexy way. But that's our James Bond so those who play Bond are judged not by their overall acting ability but by the way they play the role to our satisfaction. So we develop the fan clubs for Connery and Moore and even Brosnan for those that managed to play the role for at least three times.Craig, in Skyfall does his most credible job as Bond and show his overall acting ability to a greater degree, making this film one where Bond is a bit deeper than most others. I can say that the Craig section of the Bond films did release us from the obligatory monster sets and monster king pin 'Dr Evil' kind of villains. No kitty cats to pet and no sharks to feed and that is a relief because then the story has to rely on other things to entertain the audience.Skyfall does take the audience to other spots in the world but the focus of the story is London and Great Britain. Is this good? Perhaps but London herself is no a very sexy city to use as a backdrop or even as a main stage. In spite of many great individual buildings with interesting architecture, it does not have that overall sense of intrigue or sexiness. Perhaps it is simply not different enough for most of us. But the story is an English story this time and the villain targets London for his nastiness.The villain is the number one best villain as far as character is concerned. Javier Bardem, the super evil killer tank that could not be stopped in No Country for Old Men, the one that had ice cold freon running in his veins has has been out done by Bardem in the role of Silva. So totally ruthless without a drip of conscience for the evil he plans and carries out you are amazed at how much of a connection you make with him. Just as the quote from Goldfinger has become almost universally known James Bond asks 'Do you expect me to talk' Goldfinger replies 'No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.' The quote from Skyfall will be Bond:'(dodging an explosion) Was that for me?' and Silva's reply with a laugh is: 'No, but that is'. If you've seen the film you know what the scene is. If not, you'll still be just as surprised.Special Effects are not the star in this film as much as the often have been but the stunts still reign supreme. Bond can still do things and survive things that would kill the ordinary man in fit condition. But that is why we like him. He is virtually indestructible. In Skyfall however, his mortality is shown more than any other Bond film to date. This seems to make him even more of a hero. He suffers and yet does not fall, well that's not exactly accurate.All said, Bond is more human, more sensitive and less a chauvinistic brute wrapped in suave dressing. He is more one of us and for that all the more amazing what he accomplishes without super powers, super gimmicks and super effects. It is a pleasant relief that after 50 years in the field, Bond can still carry the flag.",8,3,11,17 November 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Every Generation needs to see E.T.
","E.T. is truly one of the best movies in history. It needs to be viewed by each generation or it gets lost in the clutter of modern animated features and other movies of lesser quality but greatly promoted. E.T. was truly a family adventure film with strong lessons but not sermonic. But while the story was excellent, it was the quality of the film and its ability to mix special effects so well, we truly believed E.T. was here with us. Even today, with special effects having grown with 'leaps and bounds' a viewing of E.T. holds up and does not present with a 'old timey' movie look. Like I said, every generation of children should see this movie in the theater as my children did when it first came out.",10,1,2,24 March 2005
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy Excellent
","Once I rate this 10 what more is there to say. The movie could not be better. First, the story is one of the best spy stories ever written - especially about the cold war. Second, the technical aspects are also top shelf. It does help to know the story, to have read the book or to at least have seen the Masterpiece Theater production of the same title with Alex Guiness. Both actors, by the way play the character superbly. But if you have not seen or read the story, then pay attention. Every scene, every dialog is important. Many flash backs and the story is not told in a linear manner. Keep the various time frames straight and you will put the story together as it develops. Do not expect the unexpected...expect that George Smiley will find the mole and will settle many accounts, as will others. Colin Firth is again one of the best actors ever to be on screen. Somehow he can absorb the person he is playing to such an extent, we forget it is Colin. Tom Cruz cold learn a lot from Colin. Not all the dead stay dead so keep your eyes open.",10,4,7,26 April 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," A 'Nice' Way to End the Story
","I'm a huge Jason Bourne fan. I read the books as they came out, enjoyed the attempted TV Movie in 1988 even though it was mostly because of Jaclyn Smith. This third in the Matt Damon/Bourn film is very welcomed and unexpected. Some of the ending of the Bourne Supremacy was re-worked into Ultimatum with changes. No matter, the story is promising from the very beginning. I knew that however it was going to end, it will be good and I would be satisfied. There is a great deal of updating from the book simply because we are in a totally different world with technology than in 1980 when the first Bourne book was published. All that matters to me in respect to the story is that Jason keeps his character and spirit and drive he has in the books while the events and action shots in the movie are no where to be found in the books. Damon plays Bourn with the same finesse as he has the other two movies but I think he is less frightened, less confused and less timid in Ultimatium - he has matured and that is good for what happens in this movie. The action is good, varied and creative. Just about when I thought it was going to be just another clichÃ©, it takes enough of a twist to keep me fixed. The more intense fast paced scenes are broken up with intense but more deliberative scenes. Bourne very rarely loses control of himself even though he is stymied again. The action is very much in your face and might be over-the-top and would be unbelievable if it were anyone other than a Treadstone trained asset. If you watch Identity and Supremacy, just before viewing Ultimatium, realize that it was not planned as a three set. Much of the ending of Untimatum was injected into the end of Supremacy which was going to be the end...but thankfully it was not and that does not in any way spoil Ultimatum...It still has wonderful surprises for those who do not know the story and love a good spy action movie.",9,0,2,3 August 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," A movie that ends where it was headed - nonsense in nowhere.
","Even the collection of great actors Clooney, Bridges, McGregor, and Spacey was not enough to give this movie a reason to watch. I'm convinced that this movie was written while the author was at a party with friends and was stoned or high. It must have been a group effort with each friend providing their ideas for the story and each one is included. There is essentially no plot. One can hardly even write a synopsis of this film - but we try. 'Looser journalist Bob Wilton, desperate to make some kind of mark in his world and impress his wayward adulterous wife, decides to take at face value the story of one certified lunatic. To get the story, Wilton must track down lunatics #2 & #3 to research the story. In the process #2 takes him on a journey through Iraq through what is a drug-head trip and Wilton converts himself into a lunatic. Wilton becomes his imagination and lives as if it is his reality.' That might make a good story but, it doesn't have the cohesiveness to make any sense and each unbelievable event has no or very little connection to the rest of the film. Some of the events are funny such as when #2 stares at a cloud in and effort to practice his 'cloud bursting' skill, he takes his eyes off the road in a flat dessert and runs into the only rock able to total his vehicle. It must have been the revenge of the cloud that placed the rock in the middle of the flat road. When finally we get to see #2 stare at a goat, the joke is dead, as dead as the goat and not at all funny. There is a funny part, when the whole 'camp' is fed LSD by #3 in its breakfast of eggs and in its drinking water. The troops begin to trip and actually do things that are hilarious. Some get into a tank and drive it through the security gate and into the desert with no destination or mission, it goes back and forth in the background of the following scenes. The breach in the fence allows the prisoners of war, - oh, this post was a holding jail for captured enemy we see - to escape into the desert. Again the problem is, it has no connection to the rest of the story. Without a story, there can be no climax and no ending so the writers and director have Lunatic #2 & #3 fly off into the sun in a helicopter (that seems to come out of nowhere) leaving Wilton, now certified lunatic #4 to 'carry on the mission'. We ask, what mission? The copter literally flies off into the sun like the cowboy rides off into the sunset in a western. But that is not then ending after all. We are smitten with having to watch Wilton go back home and come to terms with a wife that prefers another man and maybe that is what was needed for his peace of mind all along - to be rid of an unloving woman both physically and emotionally.",1,5,12,20 April 2010
The Lives of Others," Some movies simply tell the truth - this is one.
","This a movie that had to be made and must be seen by as many in the world as possible. If I were to comment much on the story, it would become overly political so I restrain. The movie is political but it says more about conflict of conscious and redemption than it does about political beliefs. A powerful story of tragedy and triumph, of greed and grace, of love and deception. It is a story about the cost of sacrifice and the cost of compromise. The screenplay is masterfully written and and the story carefully directed. So good is the crafting and telling of the story that the movie transcends borders - any audience can appreciate it. The art direction was very well balanced and added to the emotions the story brings out. Its only obvious weakness in my opinion were the few times it lacked continuity causing the editing of some sequences to be a bit awkward. For those who believe that government knows best and the populace needs the government to care for its needs - they need to see this movie. For those who believe in individual liberty and freedom of expression and decent at all levels - they need to see this movie.",9,6,8,8 December 2007
Garden State," Almost Great but Only Good because of a deleted scene.
","I wanted so much to just love this film. I wanted to give it a 9 or even 10 but I can't. After watching it the first time on a DVD I liked so much about every character except good old 'Dad'. By now you know what the story line is and how the plot develops so I'll dispense and get right to what makes this a 'should see' movie but not a 'must see'. If you have not seen the movie or only saw it in the theater, then get the DVD and view at least one of the deleted scenes - between Andrew and Dad. (see recommendation at end of comment)**CAUTION - NECESSARY SPOILERS AHEAD ** I'm a strong fan of Zach Braff. He directed himself so well in this movie it would not be noticeable unless I knew if from the DVD cover. He is a master of subtle comedy. So why does Braff develop all the characters in the movie so well only to leave dear old dad a shell of a character? Sure we learn about how Andrew Largeman at nine years old pushed his mom causing her to fall back trip over the open dishwasher door and hit her head on the counter top which put her in a wheel chair the rest of her life. When we learn that, we safely assume that her death at the beginning of the movie was a suicide not an accident or murder. We can assume that is why Andrew and Dad are estranged. We can assume that for some reason the family rejected Andrew and sent him to a boarding school from which he never returned until his mom dies. We have learned over the course of the movie that Andrew has been in a drug induced state from just about every anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, anti-anxiety drug that has been released to the public. So we can assume that there was something unnatural and wrong and he suffered mental illness.The problem is, that's too much assuming. And it's all because Braff decided to cut the one scene that gives understanding of Andrew and his Dad. In the bonus material and the DVD Braff comments on how hard it was to cut it from the movie. I believe he never should have. It's a crucial scene that helps us understand that Cranky Dad had issues and some unresolved ones at that. He takes it out on his son. The missing Scene is powerful and should have been left in. It is long, it is talky but it is powerfully played , especially by Ian Holm (Dad) and without it you do not understand the final conversation the two have. In the missing Scene, Andrew is standing over the bath tub where his mother took her life by drowning her self. He dad enters and they 'talk'. They very thing Andrew earlier promises to do but we never see because it was taken out.Ian Holm plays the dad with such finesse and you can not appreciate it without this scene. All the questions that I was left with about Andrew and his relationship with his dad are answered if you see this scene.My recommendation, get a DVD, watch the movie until you see Andrew try to stop a drip on the tub faucet. Then stop the movie, go to the Special Features and find the missing scene with Dad. Watch the scene without commentary and then go back to the movie. Braff - you're so good, this was one where your instinct let you down.",6,0,1,8 December 2007
Avatar," Excellent on so many levels
","We have only one complaint about this movie. Many good reviews have already been written here...many also are spoilers which is a shame. The experience should not be spoiled by anything other than ones own imagination which, for this film is not difficult. It does not take much predicting to preceded the story in your mind as you watch. Very few surprises are written into the story but that in NO WAY takes away from the power of the story. All a viewer needs to know before hand are what is presented in story synopsis which do not reveal the ending or resolution of any number of conflicts that arise in a good story. We compare the impact of this movie to that of the Lord of the Rings. The fantasy creatures become very believable very quickly and give the viewer a sense of being among them. We completely forgot all the hype about the animation and effects and watched the film in 3D (highly recommended) as if we were watching life action. Our only complaint is in the casting of Sigourney Weaver. She does not have the ability to act beyond her past roles. Alien clings to her like irremovable paint. The film excelled in finding so many good actors that were not beset by past roles. Putting Sigourney Weaver in the role she plays could only be compared to casting Nicolas Cage instead of Sam Worthington and John Travolta instead of Steven Lang. Thank goodness Cameron had the sense not to do that.",10,8,13,2 January 2010
Psycho," A Movie Out of Time
","It took me 48 years to see this movie. Not a fan of the horror genre, I generally avoid them. But there have been a few that I've see that are really good. Psycho is a good film but time has passed it by, it is a movie out of time and just does not carry the punch it did in 1960.Technology advances degrade much of technique used in this film. Audiences today are too sophisticated to be drawn into a film like this. Modern horror movies depend heavily on special effects and not on the subtleties used in Psycho. Being released in black & white is an advantage and helps give the film a feel of being the classic it is.Anthony Perkins is superb in the role as Norman Bates. Other than Martin Balsam and Perkins though, the rest of the actors deliver only average performances. The lines are rigid and often lame, again the effect of time passing the method by. Perkins however can take the worst role and give it smoothness.I'll not reveal any spoilers but for a movie so referenced and so often used in comedy and serious pieces, it is impossible to see this movie today without knowing what happens to the main characters.",6,3,15,23 February 2008
The Holiday," The Holiday Spoils itself without any help here.
","Don't worry about the mild spoilers here, the movie spoils itself very soon after the title sequence.Even romantic comedies need a story with some kind of anticipation or suspense. Even mediocre romantic comedies have twists in the story and lead the view down one path before springing an unsuspected element on them. But truly awfully bad romantic comedies do not need any of that because you can discover in the first 5 minutes of the film what the final scene will be. You know who will end up with whom and you will know why. You just have to watch how they move from development of character to the final and very obvious conclusion.The Holiday is just that kind of movie. So if you love romantic comedies and love to predict without any chance of being wrong, this is the movie you should see. But it is not a good movie, just an overly sweet story where four good actors made some quick easy money and walked away without looking back.Ms. Diaz is as charming as ever but did not fit this role or do it justice in the slightest. Nothing about her performance convinced me she was who she was playing or could actually even be that person. Ms. Winslet was a bit more charming and convincing but only when she was in her scenes with Eli Wallach - the only character in the whole film that brought anything to the role or made me even care about the film. I was more interested to see if Arthur Abbott (Wallach) was going to make the big event honoring him or not.Using Jude Law was a waste of great talent on a role that was so tangled I could care less about his character. And Jack Black is...well Jack Black. Sometimes charming, sometimes childish and sometimes acting as if his character was in a different movie.So after three of the four main characters had been introduced and the story began to develop, I knew Miles (Black) and Iris (Winslet) would be together in the end and they had not even met in the movie yet. And when Graham (Law) stumbled drunk into the cottage where Amanda (Diaz) was staying, I knew the knot had been all but tied.But when the limo driver would not drive down the lane to drop Diaz off at the cottage when she arrived (because he would not be able to turn around 'down the lane'), and we see her dragging two large suitcases through the snow for several hundred meters, I knew that the director/writer were more skilled at contrivance than at either directing or writing. I was proved right when the same limo driver somehow shows up at the cottage to pick Amanda up near the end of the movie. And somewhere on the lane from the cottage, when Amanda demands he go back, he turns around with no difficulty. Not good enough, Amanda, in what is a mix of hot flash and panic attack acting runs ahead of the limo across fields and through gates she never closes to return to her love in the cottage. That was the comedy part I laughed at finally. I'm still looking for the romantic part.But writers and directors have to start somewhere so I give this pair a 3 and do not blame good actors for being a movie that is not worth the time or money to even rent it.",3,0,1,19 January 2008
War of the Worlds," A Whole Hearted Sellout
","I was so surprised by the movie. I give it a 4 because in my opinion there are only 4 things that are good about it. It has superb special effects. It kept one concept from the original story the snoop scope. Dakota Fanning was captivating. I liked the Mustang Tom drove in the beginning.Otherwise, this movie was so totally a let down. It was not a movie of H.G. Wells book. It was Cruise-centric and exploited Wells' story to the point of disgusting. About half way through the film, I lost any care or concern about what the 'aliens' were doing or going to do. How they got there and whether or not they were any real threat to the world or not. There are probably dozens of B-Movie scripts that would have been just as good a shell for Tom to preform in. Obviously, it was all about how Ray and Rach would eventually survive even though they get 'caught' by a tripod.Harlan Ogilvy played by Tim Robbins actually was the scariest character in the story and had greater dimension than did Ray or Robbie who were both single dimensional bores. When Ray 'silences' Harlan by presumably killing him with a shovel, I expected a better payoff than simply ending up in the catch net of the alien. That murder and the one(s) he is responsible earlier because he brings a gun and then carelessly drops it, shows Ray to be a person who valued only his life and that of his children. He lacked the character that a person would need to actual accomplish what he does in the movie. He was not better than just one of the mob. Trying to make him a hero when he takes down the Tri Pod and figuring out their shields were down (another event never explained) just does not work. This movies is so far removed from the quality films Spielberg has made. I saw it on DVD and for a special effects movie based on a Si-Fi Classic the DVD has no special features that make it worth buying. One featurette that shows how the tripod and aliens were created. Not interview, no commentary, no outs or deleted scenes.",4,2,3,8 July 2006
There Will Be Blood," Good Acting, Poor Framework
","Daniel Day Lewis deserved his Oscar for best actor. In spite of the films multitude weaknesses, he delivered a superb performance in the role of Plainview.The movie also deserved the Oscar for best Cinematography - it was wonderful. Better than many films for a long time.That's it however. The movie itself, the story, the direction, editing and soundtrack made me feel like I was riding in a truck over a very rutted road and bouncing my way along without a seat belt.Plainview is evil but the movie has to a actually tell you so and demonstrate it so because there is nothing in his character that would make you think him to be capable of some of the actions he does. His most atrocious deeds seem to be forced without motivation.I found this movie to be very similar to Road to Perdition. Well acted, but unlike Perdition, There Will Be Blood is built on a poor development of the story.",4,3,8,15 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," SW:EIII The one I've Waited almost 30 Years For
","I'm not one of those who is ready to declare Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith the best of the bunch. It is a good movie, better than most of the others but to me it was much better as satisfying my years of curiosity than being a good movie if left to stand on its own.If this was the only movie I had seen of the 6, I would really be confused. It's value is that we finally find out the why or how of so many questions that Episode IV created in 1977 - It was 1977 wasn't it? I know 28 years is a long span of time but I still believe George Lucas did the right thing by starting with the fourth installment rather than the first. We would never had seen Han, Luke, or Leah if that had happened.This movie will make very little sense to those who have not see EIV but that is all they have to see to enjoy it. Want to know whys of the darkest villain of all time? This will take you there. Want to know why Luke in EIV is living in a desert climate on the far reaches of some system? You find out. But you have to see the movie all the way through because, while it has a more than usual predictability quotient, it takes the whole story to appreciate it.After seeing 'Sith' I left the theater saying, 'Good but not to the level my friends and family who saw it before me say it is.' There is a great deal of action. In fact the whole movie is a weave of action scenes that you burst into right out of calm quiet pathos filled scenes. The one thing I felt about the editing was a 'rush.' As suddenly as an action is suggested, you are in the middle of it. After the first scene, the movie spends very little time in outer space. System to system and planet to planet travel just happens - you have to use your imagination.George Lucas is very focused on two major threads in this story that weave with each other and he cuts to an absolute minimum anything else. Maybe he learned something from EII? While the action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, I did feel after a while that they were looking a lot alike. But there are enough scenes that are inventive and they are scattered throughout the movie to make it quite exciting.If children can take the action and the violence, the rest of the film is very safe and tame for the family. It is not Kill Bill by any means but limbs may fly at a moments notice and you want younger people to be prepared and able to handle that.Finally, there are few real surprises for the Star Wars fan, just an exciting unfolding of a story that finally puts the last important pieces into the puzzle so that it makes sense - a satisfying ending.",7,0,0,25 May 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Authentic Holmes, At Last!
","EXPERIENCE THE REAL SHERLOCK HOLMES This is the authentic Sherlock Holmes, not the antiseptic version played by Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Bretts. The Robert Downey Jr. Holmes is closer to the Holmes created by Sir Arther Conan Doyle than any other portrayal I have seen. Holmes was a mess. An addict of many things and almost uncivilized. Holmes was also brilliant and expert in many things which this movie shows when no other have. As most genius characters, he did not fit in his world or his world's expectation of proper behavior.In this film, Guy Ritchie has left his marks, for certain and one of his marks is to portray life as it was or is in any period his characters are set. London itself was a filthy dirty city during that period. Good personal hygiene was pretty much found only among the upper class. So the setting is authentic as is the character. For those who have trouble understanding the story, or finding the mystery to be solved, that is, in itself authentic to the books. Frequently Holmes is solving a different mystery than the readers (and in this case the viewers) are led to believe. Twists and turn-abouts abound, authentic to a Doyle plot. In the end...well in then end I will not spoil it, but will strongly recommend this movie as the best Sherlock Holmes I have seen to date. If you want to experience the authentic Holmes - a genius misfit, then see this movie.",10,3,6,2 January 2010
