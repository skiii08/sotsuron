The Blair Witch Project," Spooky, cheap yet effective movie
","Most people hate this film because they say it is cheap. A good film doesnt have to have lots of special effects, good actors or a perfect director, but those make it better.This film is about 3 teenagers who go missing in the woods, and then what they recorded on their tape was found, which is the film. Now, you may not know this, but the Director and the producers played tricks on the actors, by placing rocks, sticks and the all-famous blair witch sign wherever they went to make the actors actually scared.The blair witch project scares you, when they find things outside the tent, (SPOILERS), people go missing and the ending scene, where they are running through the haunted house and the blair witch kills them all.(END OF SPOILERS) You will not fully understand the ending if you dont watch the whole film, the beggining scene is the most important because it gives you a history of the Blair witch. Darkness is used very well, as half of the film is in pure darkness with a torch or nothing.This film is definately worth watching, and scares you even more after-dark...9/10",Null,0,1,28 July 2003
Resident Evil," Ok film, wouldnt watch it again
","-------SOME SPOILERS!-------- Resident Evil is based on the popular game by capcom, but fans of all the games will notice something. For example(spoilers ahead!), the train scene with things smashing through the roof may remind you of Resident Evil 2, So i suggest you watch this IF you havent played the game! Because if you have, it will seem like you have seen it before. Plus all the characters turning into zombies probably will remind you of Resi 1,2 and 3. Oh and the end is just begging for a sequel. ----END OF SPOILERS---- Plus the soundtrack isnt great in my opinion. This film tries to be scary, but you expect most of it and get easilly tired of it.So- in one sentance, i summarise it: Ok attempt at a horror film, ok actors.",6,0,0,26 July 2003
