Black Swan," ''did I just spent Â£9 to get in here and got mentally raped??!''
","well don't get me wrong. Natalie Portman's acting was OUTSTANDING. You barely see someone can be so into her role and acted so well that makes me deeply cheer for her performance.BUT, NOT the movie itself.Yeah I know every single technique about this movie was great, well and beautifully made. The dance, the characters, etc. BUT FOR WHAT? For getting disturbed by those horror movie like twisted psychopath scenes? This movie is literally like an artistic version of Saw series, kept getting people upset and disturbed and then, end of the story. This movie degraded my impression about Darren Aronofsky's work, although I did like his The Fountain and The Wrestler very much. Of course showing a human being's wanting and desire and all those suffering caused by those things IS a necessity of to be categorized as a 'good movie', but it is NOT enough. Without creating at least a tiny bit of peacefulness or showing a way out of these sufferings is just like a beautiful picture frame hang in an art gallery without a picture in it. It will ONLY demonstrate how disgustful this world is and we are here not to live through the sufferings but to self destroy without a purpose. This is not why we are here, isn't it?And THAT's what makes a massive difference between those great and SOLID movies in the history such as The Gladiator, Titanic, Terminator 2, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond.If you like to be disturbed, go watch the Black Swan. If you are looking for a great movie experience because you just saw the impressive IMDb scores, my suggestion, NOPE.",5,2,6,12 February 2011
