The New World," Zzzzzzz
","I don't think I have a spoiler in here, per se...but checked it anyway because of descriptions of characters.For someone who actually likes slow films, this was an irritating watch. I am a longtime Christian Bale fan, ever since Empire of the Sun. Also outstanding here was the simple presence of Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas; simply an actor you don't want to take your eyes off of. For me, she was as mesmerizing here as a young, new Juliette Binoche when she first was filmed. Just a non-existent script. On the flip side, I can never forgive Colin Farrell for Alexander.What irritated my about this film, and this might be slightly off topic, is that the 'settlers' were portrayed as so weak in character, with elements of narcissism, general neurosis, sadism, and self-pity that makes you want to slap most of them. The key phrase mentioned before, 'self-indulgent', is a kind way to put it. I was hoping Malick would be kind enough to wipe them all out with dysentery by the end...Its pretty to watch, though the disjointed cinematography nullified that for me. Colin Farrell did not spend nearly enough time in the cage.I thought that this film might have the promise of something like Three Colors: Blue, or even the more modest The Quiet Earth, but it tragically missed for me.",2,0,3,18 July 2006
