The New World," Disconnected
","Well i saw it today...sometimes i fell that this movie could be much better.In my opinion this movie have an awful film editing, some scenes are in the wrong place, the movie misses parts, increase the pace forgetting explanations, than slows again...but the explanations are lost, characters changes happens...and we really don't know why, i connected with her...but only with her character, and i really don't understand why she forgets her civilization, her family so fast. I don't think Colin made a bad acting role, he was well, but she is a natural born star, with a smile that makes any one felt in love for her character in a second. Bale does his part very well too. But more than a actors movies, this is a director movie, for the best and worst. We have some moments beautiful moments, thats the reason of the 7...but the movie as a 'movie' has some big problems...but its a poetic image voyage that we all should see. And if you sleep, you probably will have an excellent dream, with her smile, with Horner music and with Terrence M beautiful poetic images. In the end she falls from a big tree...and you wake up...literally or not :)",6,1,3,18 May 2006
