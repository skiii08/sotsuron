The King's Speech," The King's Speech Speaks to All
","WARNING: Mild spoilers (unless you know some history).I've been wanting to see The King's Speech for some time now. That's based in part on the fact it's garnered more than a few awards and nominations, but also because a few people I know who have seen it have waxed poetic about just how good it is. Well, whatever superlatives they may have used in their descriptions, and whatever praise the critics might have heaped on the film, I'm here to tell you that none of it was enough. The King's Speech is even better than you've heard that it is.Prince Albert (known as 'Bertie' to his family, played by Colin Firth) is second in line to the throne behind his brother, David (Guy Pearce). His father, King George V (Michael Gambon) tries to groom both of his sons for leadership, but Albert's shyness and debilitating stutter test his patience as well as that of almost everyone else around him. Only his wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) seems to be able to look past his speech and directly at the man she believes him to be.Bertie is deeply embarrassed by his stutter, but he's not overly concerned about other matters since his healthy, vital brother will become king after the death of their father. But David, who becomes King Edward VIII after George V passes away, has a problem of his own: He's desperately in love with an American divorcée named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). No one sympathizes with his plight, not even his own mother (Claire Bloom).Despite being relegated to relative second class status among the royals, Bertie still has to make some public appearances. It's to ease those events as well as her husband's heart that Elizabeth seeks out doctors and therapists who might be able to help. As a last resort, she lands in the offices of one Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) where his brash impudence appeals to her own sensibilities. Bertie, however, is far less than convinced. Everything else pales into insignificance, though, when Edward VIII determines to abdicate the throne so that he can marry the infamous Mrs. Simpson and Bertie is forced to become what he most dreads being: King George VI.As any number of awards and nominations could tell you, the caliber of acting in The King's Speech is substantial. Helena Bonham Carter is beautifully sympathetic yet regal; Claire Bloom is appallingly cold; and Guy Pearce is the very picture of a ne'er-do-well. Geoffrey Rush is completely convincing as a speech therapist and a man haunted by a few regrets of his own. But even amongst such a superlative cast, Colin Firth stands out. His portrayal of the King is heartbreaking and courageous, often at the same time. When Firth is on screen, it feels like you're witnessing some heretofore secret event rather than just another scene in a movie. His acting seems effortless (which means it was far from that), and he's eminently believable. (Added note: If the Oscar® doesn't go to Colin Firth, it will only be because none of the voters bothered to see The King's Speech. Anyone who's seen this performance will know that nobody else even comes close.) The sets and the costumes are absolutely gorgeous, and the cinematography couldn't have been better. The direction by the Oscar®-nominated Tom Hooper is subtle and sure. David Seidler (who actually asked the permission of the Queen Mother Elizabeth to write the story, and was told he should not do so while she was still alive) has written an understated yet beautiful piece of history, and he's been recognized by the Academy with an Oscar® nomination of his own for his script.BOTTOM LINE The King's Speech offers up a view of history that many Americans don't know (or probably even care) much about despite its importance to our own country's involvement in World War II. But while you might certainly call the film educational, it doesn't offer up its lessons on history or on life in either a boring or a bombastic way. Despite the gulf between royalty and the rest of us, the characters here are sympathetic, and their problems and their courage surely bear lessons and encouragement for everyone of any station in life. What's more, all of this is wrapped up in a beautiful and utterly fascinating package. While I can't say I had fun in the theatre this time around, I can tell you I had something just as good—or even better: An entirely satisfying evening at the movies, watching events unfold in a story I still can't stop thinking about.POLITICAL NOTES None.FAMILY SUITABILITY The King's Speech is rated R for 'some language.' I actually disagree with the R rating on this one. I think that much of the story here would have great benefit for older teens, and even mature younger teens. They won't hear anything here that they don't get in school or from video games, but the movie itself has much to offer. While younger children will be bored, you might be surprised at how well a movie with no explosions or car chases can prove itself to be gripping—and in some places even thrilling—fare.",10,1,2,30 January 2011
Black Swan," Black Swan Bleak on More Than One level
","Black Swan has garnered more than a few glowing reviews and has collected a list of awards nominations to match (among others, the Golden Globes will consider Natalie Portman as Best Actress, Mila Kunis as Best Supporting Actress, Darren Aronofsky as Best Director, and the film itself as Best Drama). I made it my mission in life to see it before the awards ceremonies started. It could be that my expectations were too high, but I was frankly not as impressed by Black Swan as many critics seem to be.Black Swan is a reference to the white Swan Queen's opposite in the famous ballet, Swan Lake. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a technically brilliant dancer in a New York ballet company who desperately wants to snag the dual role. The problem? The dance company's director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) tells her she's the perfect Swan Queen, but that she lacks the passion and emotional abandon of her Black Swan twin.The pressure on Nina to prove the director wrong is considerable. Her mother (Barbara Hershey)—a retired ballerina herself—exerts considerable control over her daughter in the guise of kindness and support. The company's aging prima ballerina (Winona Ryder) is volatile and dramatic, particularly when she learns she's soon to be giving her final performance before a retirement that isn't her idea. And a new dancer from San Francisco (Lily, played by Mila Kunis), quickly becomes both Nina's friend and bitter rival.Lily, very much a free spirit, spreads her attitude wherever she goes and Nina needs it more than most. Thomas, meanwhile, is inclined to use any means necessary to inspire the performance he wants out of her. As Nina's life spins beyond her ability to control, her emotions and her sanity both begin to wear thin. But her focus on dance becomes ever more laser-like as she determines that nothing will stop her from being the perfect ballerina.Natalie Portman reportedly lost some 20 pounds from her already tiny frame to more authentically portray a dedicated dancer. She and Kunis alike spent months studying ballet as well. Their efforts show. While a few more complicated maneuvers were performed by doubles, much of what you see on screen is really done by the actors themselves. Their acting, too, is superlative. Vincent Cassel is also good, but Barbara Hershey is brilliant as the overbearing mother whose demands for perfection set Nina on her course from childhood. Kudos, too, to Winona Ryder. Her role is small, but it's memorable.Director Darren Aronofsky, perhaps best known for his previous award-winning film The Wrestler, does a credible job here. There are interesting edits and camera effects everywhere, and he does seem to know well how to elicit a stellar performance from his cast. I'm not a ballet fan, so I can't vouch for the authenticity of the dancing here, but it certainly looked lovely on screen and was a nice counterpoint to some of the seamier visions interspersed.BOTTOM LINE Despite the obvious quality of the crafting of Black Swan, I didn't really like it all that much. That may be because there were so many moments where the sheer brilliance of the acting or some technical aspect in the making of the scene actually overshadowed the story itself. I found myself all too conscious of those things rather than paying attention to what was really going on. In many ways, Black Swan was the proverbial 'too much of a good thing.' I can't fault those who claim Black Swan is a well-made movie. I just can't pretend that I personally enjoyed it very much. The quality of filmmaking alone gave Black Swan its six stars. Whether or not my interest held up throughout garnered considerably less.POLITICAL NOTES None.FAMILY SUITABILITY Black Swan is rated R for 'strong sexual content, disturbing violent images, language and some drug use.' All of those cautions are entirely too real. Black Swan is not a movie for children, or even for young teens. An R rating is entirely appropriate, and movie-goers should take note. I'd add that, while I wasn't particularly happy with my movie-going experience, I can't deny that there are reasons to see Black Swan, not least among them some very strong performances indeed.",6,18,29,30 January 2011
Walk the Line," Walk the Line is Right on Target
","Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up during the Depression and through the second World War as the son of a poor sharecropper (Ray Cash, played by Robert Patrick) on an Arkansas cotton farm. His father's distance and clear favoritism for his older son shaped the young J.R as much as did his mother's love for singing hymns. A childhood tragedy also contributed greatly to the make up of the man J.R. later became.As a young man, J.R. joins the Air Force. He's stationed at a base in Germany where he fills his spare time learning to play the guitar. He's also obsessed with his girlfriend back home, the pretty Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin). John eventually wins her hand and settles into a small apartment with his wife and new baby. Trying his hand at door to door sales in Memphis with little success, he yearns for his music even as his young wife tries to get him to settle down and be more responsible.John is finishing up another long day when he happens by a small recording studio where, for a few dollars, fledgling musicians can record their own songs. He begs owner Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) for an audition. John and a couple of his buddies have been playing casually in their spare time for months. Unfortunately, the gospel music they play doesn't impress Phillips, and he bluntly tells them so. Out of sheer desperation, John plays a song he wrote about a man doing hard time in Folsom Prison. Phillips is no idiot; he agrees to work with the earnest singer/songwriter, and Johnny Cash is born.In those days, incessant touring was the only way that singers could both make a living and get the exposure they needed to ensure radio airplay and record sales. It's on one such tour that Johnny meets pretty June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Eventually, traveling around the country, the entire troupe become friends. Waylon Jennings (who is played by his son, Shooter Jennings), a young Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), and more of the soon-to-be greats are among them.Although Johnny is successful with his music, his wife is running out of patience. Her husband isn't often home and when he is, he's exhausted. She also worries about the growing friendship between Johnny and June. Eventually, Vivian can no longer hide her disdain. Johnny's disappointment in himself only grows when he's still unable to please his hard-hearted father. He escapes his unhappy home life by touring some more, and then by sliding into drinking and worse. Cash's career  and his life  might have ended shortly after that if not for his adoration of June. Though both are married, Johnny's not inclined to give up though he runs into more than a few stumbling blocks along the way.Joaquin Phoenix has already been singled out for high praise and for rumors of Oscar as a result of his performance. It's true that Phoenix is astounding in the role. Making his performance even more amazing is that he learned to play guitar just for this part, and that he does all of his own singing (both of which he does credibly). What you may not have heard is just what a stunning performance Reese Witherspoon gives. She more than holds her own as an actress in the face of Phoenix's formidable talent, and then goes beyond that with some terrific tunes of her own. When the two perform duets, not only is the music enjoyable but the on screen chemistry is such that you've no doubt in your mind whatsoever that Johnny and June were destined to be together.Ginnifer Goodwin and Robert Patrick are both good, especially the latter. In fact, I loathed Patrick's character which is a good indicator that the actor did a fine job in the creation of a man who apparently knew little about love and even less about raising children, but who did his best despite it all. The supporting cast is also excellent.James Mangold, the director of such films as the wonderful Girl, Interrupted and the woefully underrated Identity, did a fine job directing; as the co-writer of the screenplay, his vested interest in the movie was clear and likely enhanced his direction. There are some edits that seem abrupt and effectively interrupt the flow of the story; there are a few matters that are mysteriously skipped or glossed over (perhaps these are scenes that will be returned to the film in the eventual DVD version). But as a whole, the film is well crafted, and the music, by the way, is terrific.The performances alone are worth the price of a ticket, but the story, too, is something well worth telling. Johnny Cash really was one of the greats despite his personal flaws; that he overcame many of those shortcomings only makes him an even better man. And the love story between him and June Carter Cash is at once poignant and passionate, and will likely prove inspirational as well. Walk the Line isn't perfect, but it's awfully, awfully close...FAMILY SUITABILITY: Walk the Line is rated PG-13 for 'some language, thematic material, and depiction of drug dependency.' Small children aren't going to enjoy this movie anyway, and even older kids may not enjoy it much thanks to the fact it takes place in a past they've never known and features people they've likely heard of only in passing. But for adults, Walk the Line has much to recommend it. I said I wasn't a Johnny Cash fan, and I wasn't. But Walk the Line was a film I thoroughly enjoyed, and as a result, even gained some appreciation for Cash's musical legacy. I recommend Walk the Line to movie and music fans alike. It truly doesn't get much better than this.",9,3,8,20 November 2005
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious Inglourious Basterds
","I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if a love affair with everything Quentin Tarantino isn't something that's obligatory for all movie lovers. Much like David Lynch in decades past though with a style uniquely his own, Tarantino uses extremes, foibles, twisted techniques, and editorial surprises throughout his films. This not only brings his cinematic brilliance to the fore, but takes each film and stamps it both as thoroughly unique and entirely his. That he also writes some of the most interesting and entertaining scripts in the business doesn't hurt his end product, either. Inglourious Basterds is no exception to the Tarantino legacy. In fact, I think it's one of his best.'Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France,' the film opens on the unlikely pastoral scene of a rural dairy farm. The farmer (Denis Menochet) is paid an unwelcome visit by Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who is acting in his capacity as the infamous 'Jew hunter.' Landa, who never even momentarily raises his voice or behaves with less than the utmost civility, never-the-less gets his message across.Not too many years later, the Inglourious Basterds are dropped behind enemy lines. The allied soldiers have an assigned mission that goes well beyond merely killing the enemy. They're charged with instilling fear into the hearts of those who are masters of terror propaganda themselves. That they succeed as well as they do is in no small part thanks to their commanding officer, Lieutenant Aldo Raines (Brad Pitt). Under Raines' orders, his men scalp, scar, and scare Nazis everywhere they go, and word of the Basterds reaches as far as the ear of Hitler himself.Meanwhile, a French cinema owner named Emmanuel (Mélanie Laurent) has in reasons of her own to hate the Nazis. She and her partner Marcel (Jacky Ido), concoct a devious plan of their own to terrorize a few Nazis.Meanwhile, a famous German actress named Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) is involved intrigue up to her pretty neck as she travels to Paris for a movie premiere.Meanwhile, German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) blithely enjoys the adulation of his peers and those in command alike, not realizing for a moment that his very fame will end up landing him in the midst of a plot that will likely result in infamy as well.Meanwhile...There's more. A lot more. As you may recall from Tarantino's stunning Pulp Fiction, he's a master of the simultaneous telling of multiple stories that somehow all resolve into a whole in the end. While Inglourious Basterds doesn't offer quite the disparity between scenes you'll recall from Pulp Fiction, it does have any number of plot twists and turns involving any number of different people and locales. But it's a tribute both to Tarantino's brilliant screenplay and the editing of the film that it's far more confusing to write about than it is to watch.Although it wouldn't seem so at first blush, Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as Aldo Raine. Another surprise? He's very funny. The rest of the cast is also more than up to its task. There's truly not a bad or even a mediocre performance in the bunch. But the standout here has got to be Christoph Waltz. His Colonel Landa is a horror, and yet he manages it all with an urbane, almost sympathetic mien. He's impossible not to fear and loathe, but his performance is nothing short of stellar.While I could go into depth praising Tarantino's direction as well, suffice it to say he's up to his usual extraordinarily high standards. His creativity and genius for film is evident in virtually every frame. One Tarantino hallmark, of course, is his bent for violence, and Inglourious Basterds doesn't disappoint. There's more than a little graphically shed blood in more than a few graphically depicted ways. But somehow he has the gift of displaying such things in full and gut-wrenching color even as he does so in a cinematically beautiful way. I'm not sure how he does it, but I know it when I see it and it's spectacular. Spice that up still more with some totally inappropriate (but very funny) humor, and you've got Tarantino at the top of his game.BOTTOM LINE: Only Quentin Tarantino would have the nerve to use World War II as a backdrop, but then change such well known history to suit his story. And frankly, only Quentin Tarantino could get away with it. His Inglourious Basterds won't be for everybody. But for everyone who appreciates movies for what they can be at their best, Inglourious Basterds is at the top of the heap of those that should not be missed.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Inglourious Basterds is rated R for 'strong graphic violence, language and brief sexuality.' I cannot stress enough that the rating board isn't kidding where the first three words are concerned. This is not a family film, nor is it remotely suitable for those younger than 16 or 17. In fact, those of any age who are sensitive to lots of blood on screen should go see something else instead.ADDITIONAL NOTES: There are some truly fascinating stories behind the writing and filming of Inglourious Basterds not least of which are those involving the 'movie within the movie.' If you're interested, you can read more on the Internet Movie Database Web site.",8,1,6,23 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," 'Pirates' sinks under the weight of its aspirations (mild spoiler)
","In 2003, somebody somewhere decided it would be a good idea to make a movie based on one of the rides at Disneyland. I went on that ride when I was 12. Even then, I thought it was stupid. Needless to say, I wasn't keen on the idea of a movie. I went anyway, and left the theatre with a grin a mile wide. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all time favorite movies. That's the main reason I dread writing the review for the newly released sequel.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest picks up some months after the end of the previous Pirates movie. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are just about to marry when their big day is interrupted by the smug Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander). Beckett chats with Elizabeth's father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Price) briefly, and then flourishes an arrest warrant for the couple. It seems that the British authorities haven't taken well the fact that the two helped the notorious pirate and criminal, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape.Beckett does offer Will a sliver of hope that he and his fiancée might yet live happily ever after. He tells Will that, if he can procure the compass that Captain Sparrow carries, he'll offer the couple a pardon. The Governor, who is the same dithering coward that he was in the first film, seems helpless to intervene. So Will takes the chance and, leaving Elizabeth behind in her jail cell, he leaves to track down the pirate and do whatever must be done to get his hands on the compass.Meanwhile, Captain Sparrow has some troubles of his own. It seems that he became the Captain of the Black Pearl by cutting a deal with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) himself. And now the time has come for Jack to make the agreed upon payment: his very soul. Obviously, he's not keen on this and, with his usual fluttering aplomb, schemes to find a way to back out of the deal. Unfortunately, the only way he can think of involves being able to find both a mysterious key as well as the chest it unlocks.While Jack looks for the key, Will looks for Jack. And while the Governor looks for a way to free his daughter (and not incidentally get her away from Will of whom he still thoroughly disapproves), Elizabeth finds her own way out of jail and into even more trouble. Her problems are only exacerbated when she runs into the discredited British officer under whose watch Jack escaped. The former Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) harbors more than a little ill will for Jack and Will, but he's also out of options and gets caught up in events despite himself.Oh, and did I mention that there's a mysterious witchy woman (Tia Dalma, played by Naomie Harris) who offers up cryptic advice to one and all? Or that Black Pearl crew members Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and MacKenzie Cook) are still unable to get along? Or that Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and his parrot are along for the ride? Or that the long lost Bootstrap Jack (Stellan Skarsgard) shows up? Or that there is an island somewhere in the Caribbean populated by cannibals? Or...And therein lies the primary problem with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. There's quite simply much too much packed into the movie which means that nothing gets adequate attention, and that the numerous side stories detract from the plot at best, and confuse things immeasurably for the most part.There are those critics who think that Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is best taken in small doses. I disagree. Yes, he's still apparently gay, drunk, drugged, or otherwise not quite right, but he's also still as magnetic and lovable a comic villain that ever existed (that he's also drop dead gorgeous despite himself doesn't hurt his cause, either). Orlando Bloom does a pretty good job playing the earnest hero, and his sword fighting is once again just terrific. Keira Knightley is a pretty girl, and one who holds her own with the boys. And Bill Nighy is a shuddery delight to watch, what with his wet and slurpy speech from a face wreathed by writhing tentacles.The special effects are, as you might expect, very good, but the first movie outshines this second installment in that regard as well. While I still marvel over the skeletons fighting on the ship in the original, I'd just as soon forget a few of the glaringly visible problems with some effects in this film. The sword fights are excellent, including one with some brilliant stuntwork and some special effects merged seamlessly into an exciting whole. But bizarrely, some simple shipboard scenes show obvious green screen work. Some glimpses of a sea monster are as real as can be, but others show the blurriness of composite close-ups.Director Gore Verbinski is back, and he shows his same able touch in combining action with comedy. The writers of the original penned the script for the sequel as well. That's why I'm at a loss as to why the second film is so lacking. My own opinion is that the writers tried to meet the huge expectations for the follow-up, and in so doing, simply tried too hard and went overboard.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is rated PG-13 for 'intense sequences of adventure violence, including frightening images.' I'd be more concerned about younger kids being able to follow the many needless complications to the story than with the violence (though the littlest ones will doubtless be afraid of the sea monster). Smart ten year-olds should be able to keep up. Meanwhile, you'll likely be able to keep up, too. I just can't promise that you'll want to.",5,2,4,9 July 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Pan's Labyrinth a Real Find
","Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944. The Spanish Civil War is over, but Franco's fascist troops continue to root out the Republican resistance. It's in the midst of these unsettled times that young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to the northern countryside to stay with Carmen's new husband  one of Franco's officers  Capitán Vidal (Sergi López).Ofelia is more than a little unsettled by all of this, but her mother admonishes her that the Captain has been good to them and she urges the girl to call him 'Father.' Ofelia doesn't refuse, but she doesn't agree, either. Instead, she buries her nose in one of her beloved books.Upon arrival, Ofelia reluctantly greets the stern Capitán Vidal and meets his housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). While the adults are distracted with luggage and other such details, Ofelia escapes into the surrounding forest where she chases a large insect she finds fascinating. Soon she ends up at a stone archway that leads into a ruin. Just as she would explore further, Mercedes calls her away.When Ofelia finally falls asleep that night, she wakes to strange sounds and discovers the insect  or one very much like it  fluttering about the room. She first accuses it of following her, and then smiles and asks it if it's a fairy. Surprisingly, the bug stops and sits on her legs almost as if it's considering. Ofelia pulls a book of fairy tales off the bedside table and opens it an illustration of a fairy on it. The bug promptly begins to move oddly, and then to contort itself into an entirely new shape and configuration. In just another moment, Ofelia is overjoyed to find she's right: the bug is a fairy!The fairy beckons her to follow, and with all the trust of a child, Ofelia does. Soon, she's all the way back to the ruins. With the fairy to guide her, she finds a deep well with a staircase leading downward. When she finally reaches the bottom, she's disappointed to find nothing but more stones and an ancient statue. But with a sudden startling movement, she learns she's not alone after all when a frightening creature steps forward and introduces himself as a faun (Doug Jones). And the faun has an important assignment for her!Meanwhile, Carmen's pregnancy isn't going well and she's confined to bed rest by the kindly Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo). Capitán Vidal, who is obsessed with the notion of having a son, leaves the execution of such things to others as he's occupied with tracking down and obliterating the rebels that infest the forested hills nearby. And he intends to do so, no matter the cost or the ruthlessness he might need to employ!As Capitán Vidal tries to second-guess the rebels, Ofelia works to do what the faun has asked of her. She struggles in her tasks almost as much as the Captain does in his, and both emerge from their efforts covered in filth though of very different kinds. Intent on their own focus, the two try to ignore each other as much as possible. Still, they have a surprising amount in common as they both step into danger. It's what they do next, though, in the face of that danger that illustrates how the two really have nothing in common at all.Sergi López is just fantastic as the hateful Capitán Vidal. His malevolence is so complete that I was actually shocked to read that the actor is more typically cast in light comedic roles! Ariadna Gil is just fine as the weak and fearful Carmen, while Maribel Verdú carries off very well the depiction of the efficient housekeeper with some dark secrets of her own. Doug Jones is surprisingly expressive despite being thoroughly covered with an intricate latex mask and costume, and the rest of the supporting cast is also quite good. 12 year-old Ivana Baquero (she was 11 when the movie was filmed) is a revelation. She stepped up to the plate and hit it out of the ballpark with a performance that puts many veterans to shame.Pan's Labyrinth was conceived of, written, and directed by Guillermo del Toro. His work in this film is brilliant The cinematography is utterly breathtaking, and the special effects are spot on. The sets are spectacular, and then there's the make-up which, whether it was depicting war wounds or fantastic creatures, was terrific. Adding to it all were more than a few inspired and flawlessly rendered edits.The story itself is fascinating on any level you'd care to examine: On the surface, Pan's Labyrinth is a delightfully dark fairy tale. Deeper down, the escape of the child from war and tragedy into another world is unsurprising, but the fact even the other world holds its horrors is a lesson not lost on either Ofelia or her audience. And, of course, there are the inevitable intersections between worlds...Pan's Labyrinth still isn't in wide release and, as a subtitled foreign language film (Spanish), it may never arrive in some smaller markets. But if you find it showing within driving distance, I assure you that it's well worth the time and effort. In any language and in any venue, Pan's Labyrinth is just plain one of the finest examples of movie-making and story-telling I've ever seen.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Pan's Labyrinth is rated R for 'graphic violence and some language.' The violence, including scenes of torture, is truly graphic. The subject matter is also quite adult and somewhat complex. Add to that the fact that subtitles are involved, and you can completely eliminate young children from consideration for this film. For older teens (I'd say 16 or 17 and up) and for adults, though, Pan's Labyrinth offers a truly rare experience for theatre-goers. What a wonderful  and wonderfully affecting!  film!",9,2,4,21 January 2007
The Town," The Town is the Bomb!
","In the opening moments of the film, it is established that Charlestown, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston) is the bank robbery capital of the world. It is, according to the information offered the audience, a way of life there. In some cases, it spans generations. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a man who lives up—or down—to the town's reputation.Doug and his best friend, James 'Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) head up a small gang of very professional bank robbers. Their usual thorough planning and professional execution gets them in, out, and away from their target in short order. But a series of small hitches combined with Jem's short temper changes everything when he decides to take Bank Manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. Although Claire is released unharmed, Jem obsesses about what she may have seen or what she might know. To satisfy both Jem and his own doubts, Doug decides he'll find out.Meanwhile, the FBI is obviously interested in a bank robbery, but the hostage gives Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) what he hopes will be enough information to catch the gang. With a number of agents and resources at his disposal, he begins his investigation by questioning Claire and then starts collecting information to help him identify and catch the robbers.The secrets held close by the people of Charlestown, though, won't be given up easily and perhaps not without violence. Not to the FBI for sure, and perhaps not even to one of Charlestown's own as Doug soon begins to find out as he asks some questions of his own.The Town is based on a 2005 book entitled 'Prince of Thieves' by Chuck Hogan. The book was brilliantly adapted by Peter Craig, Ben Affleck, and Aaron Stockard. Affleck also directed The Town. In some cases, actors who try to do too much do a disservice to each of their jobs. In this case, though, Affleck proved his Oscar® for co-writing Good Will Hunting was no fluke, nor was his acclaimed directorial debut for Gone Baby Gone any accident. He writes and directs The Town with unbelievable skill, and then to top it off, his acting is just terrific.Jeremy Renner doesn't play the most sympathetic of characters, but he makes Jem so real that it's difficult to judge him for his many flaws. Jon Hamm is entirely believable as a frustrated FBI agent, and Rebecca Hall meshes well with Affleck in their scenes together. The standout here (aside from Affleck, of course) is the surprising Blake Lively. In a role as Jem's troubled sister, she's nothing short of amazing. After the casting directors see her here, you can bet we'll be seeing more of her on the big screen in the future.BOTTOM LINE: Even before its release, The Town was generating some very exciting buzz about Ben Affleck. Although the rest of the cast is superb and the story itself is a gripping one, Affleck is clearly coming into his own as a multi-talented movie maker. As far as I'm concerned, The Town is must see viewing.POLITICAL NOTES: Surprisingly (especially given the FBI's extensive involvement in the storyline) none.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Town is rated R for 'strong violence, pervasive language, some sexuality and drug use,' and it should be. It is in no way suitable for children or younger teens (who probably won't like it anyway). But for mature teens and adults, The Town offers a rare movie-going experience: An extraordinarily well made and intelligent film that also offers an exciting two hours in the theatre.",9,10,19,19 September 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," The Devil Wears Prada a Pleasant Surprise
","The Devil Wears Prada I'm not a fashion geek nor am I especially into so-called 'chick flicks,' but I had a little extra time to kill before meeting a friend this weekend. Since I think that Meryl Streep is arguably the best actress alive today, I decided to occupy an hour and a half by buying a ticket for The Devil Wears Prada. Yes, it's a film focused on fashion. Yes, you'd probably call it a 'chick flick.' But you know what? I was entertained.The titular devil is Runway Magazine editor, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). She goes through assistants like some people go through chewing gum  and she treats the girls with just about as much thought as she'd offer to a used up wad of Juicy Fruit Enter Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who is applying to take the place of the most recently fired Second Assistant. Andrea (or Andy, as she says most people call her) isn't into fashion, but she needs the job and she knows it will be good experience for her. But Miranda's First Assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) isn't so sure that Andy's right for the position.Unfortunately, just as Emily is ready to send Andy on her way, Miranda herself arrives and decides that only she can hire a suitable replacement. While she also doesn't consider Andy a good fit, a brief burst of assertiveness on Andy's part wins her the chance at the job. As she jumps in to the deep end and flails around accordingly, she's repeatedly told that 'millions of girls would die for' her new job. In fact, it's not long before Andy wishes she was dead.Miranda is hopelessly demanding and impossible to please. Emily resents Andy and offers the barest possible amount of help. And Andy herself would frankly much rather be writing than hanging up Miranda's coat, buying her coffee, or delivering her dry cleaning. But she doggedly keeps trying because she's hoping her position will at least open a few editorial doors down the road.Andy's boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and her friends Lilly (Tracie Thoms) and Doug (Rich Sommer) sympathize even as they're taken a little aback by Andy's lack of interest in her job. Even Doug is excited about the designers she might get to meet, and the inside gossip she might get to hear; Lilly is impressed with the perks. But Nate and Andy's father only see that Andy is on call virtually 24 hours a day at the whim of her demanding boss, and that no matter what she does, it isn't good enough for Miranda.In a fit of despair, Andy all but decides to give up. But when she complains to co-worker and Miranda's right hand man, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), he offers her at least the beginnings of a solution. Andy determines to give it a shot. Her attitude changes and she becomes more and more competent at her job. She also, however, becomes less and less of a friend  or a girlfriend. And when she meets the handsome writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), Andy realizes that her chance may finally be right here, and right now. But can she afford all it will cost her to take it? Meryl Streep is, by virtually every account I've ever heard, a nice woman. Miranda Priestly, however, will convince you that she can't possibly be anything but cold, calculating, and downright cruel. All this, and Streep never once raises her voice! While this isn't the kind of role that wins anybody any awards, Streep apparently doesn't care. Her performance is stellar.Anne Hathaway, whose previous efforts have mostly been fluff roles (the lead in The Princess Diaries films, for example), made a point of showing her range by accepting a significant supporting role in Brokeback Mountain. With The Devil Wears Prada, she's gone back to fluff, but it's considerable fluff given her many scenes with Streep, and she does a surprisingly good job at holding up her end of the bargain. While she's not there yet, I suspect that Hathaway is capable of being formidable herself.The supporting cast is all quite good, but special mention must be made of Stanley Tucci. His character is fussy and egotistical, yet vulnerable; he seems flighty at best, yet exemplifies stolid loyalty. Meanwhile, Simon Baker is relegated largely to the role of eye candy. That being said, he's very nice eye candy which, in a movie like this one, does count.The Devil Wears Prada isn't anything other than what it's supposed to be, and that's a diverting hour and a half. It does offer up some life lessons for young girls (at the same time taking away from them somewhat by glorifying the very thin models and holding up starvation as a diet technique), but the one thing the movie really has going for it is the simple fact that most women of most ages, whether they'll admit it publicly or not, will probably be entertained.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Devil Wears Prada is rated PG-13 for 'some sensuality.' Everything is ambiguous enough, though, that I don't see a real problem with kids of age 11 or so and up. The Devil Wears Prada would be a pretty good date movie for the younger set, and a great flick for mothers and daughters. Drop your sons off at a Superman Returns screening though; as much as girls are going to enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, boys are going to hate it.",6,2,4,2 July 2006
Dreamgirls," Dreamgirls Good Enough, Jennifer Hudson Even Better
","Let me be honest, here: I'm not a particularly big fan of movie musicals, and I don't like Motown music. The good news about Dreamgirls is that the Motown sound was far from prevalent. The bad news is that I still don't like movie musicals. But that doesn't mean I don't have anything good to say about this particular musical! In the 1960's, a certain theater in downtown Detroit was holding an amateur night. Among those vying for the chance a win would represent are a trio of young girls who call themselves the Dreamettes. Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles) and Lorell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) act as back-up singers to the powerfully voiced Effie White (Jennifer Hudson, the former American Idol contestant in her acting debut). Unfortunately, the contest is fixed so despite their well-received performance, the girls don't win.The contest does result, however, in the Dreamettes' ability to capitalize on the fact that the current back-up singers for James 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy) have quit in a huff over the bad behavior of the boss. Erstwhile manager wanna-be Curtis Taylor, Jr. (Jamie Foxx) suggests that the Dreamettes fill in. Effie's not keen on the idea of singing back-up for anybody, but the girls recognize that this is likely their big break and, with support from Effie's songwriting brother C.C. (Keith Robinson), they take the job.Early's manager, Marty Madison (Danny Glover), is less than thrilled that somebody else is infringing on what should be his territory. Taylor, though, has matters well in hand. The used car salesman liquidates his entire inventory to collect enough cash to pay DJs to play some of Early's songs. In short order, Early is getting airplay, and Madison is out of the picture. But Taylor isn't done yet! He sees the Dreamettes as a group in and of themselves. He suggests they call themselves the Dreamgirls.Taylor also has one more suggestion: He wants the beautiful Deena to sing lead, and the more talented but less attractive Effie to continue being a back-up singer. It's a tough sell, but Effie eventually agrees and the trio is soon on the way to the top. But on their way there, the women fight; engage in ill-advised love affairs; suffer rude awakenings; and lose the desire for their dream even as it's coming true. Meanwhile, oblivious to all but money (Taylor) and fame (Early), the main men in their lives push the girls harder and harder until something's finally got to give.Jamie Foxx is no slouch as either an actor or singer and he does just fine as Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé Knowles is a pleasant surprise who embarrasses no one. She has a particularly notable moment as she sings the song 'Listen' to the husband who won't (Knowles wrote the song, and has received a number of award nominations for it). Keith Robinson, Sharon Leal, Anika Noni Rose, and Danny Glover (who doesn't sing, thank God) are also good. But as repeated awards nominations tell you, the real stars of Dreamgirls are Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson.Eddie Murphy takes on the persona of Jimmy Early and rides it all the way to the top. His musical performances are top notch; his acting is perfectly pitched to be arrogant or self-destructive, fragile or very much the man in charge by turns. There are people who call this a comeback for Murphy and, though I'm not so sure he ever really left, I understand exactly what they're saying and they're right: Murphy is proving in Dreamgirls that he can rise to great heights to do real justice to such a part.For her part, Jennifer Hudson quite literally owns her role as Effie White. Not only does she have the considerable musical ability needed, but also the acting skills to truly appear vulnerable one minute and then, with visibly growing confidence, triumphant later on. Her defeats are devastating, and her every mannerism shows it; her highs are stellar, and we see all that, too. Consider everything you've heard about Hudson's rendition of the show's most famous tune, 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Leaving.' Consider the myriad superlatives used by critics and audiences, virtually without exception, everywhere. And then consider this: She's even better than that. I was (and trust me, this doesn't happen often) emotionally overwhelmed and completely awed by Ms. Hudson's performance.Director and writer Bill Condon did a credible job of both (he also adapted Chicago for the big screen, and previously directed such well-received efforts as Kinsey and Gods and Monsters). In fact, there was only one moment that seemed more stage-like than screen worthy, and that frankly takes some doing. The sets were perfect, and the costuming  covering the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's  was spot on.In fact, the only thing I didn't like about Dreamgirls is that it's a musical. But that's just me. If you like musicals, you'll like this one. And if you appreciate good performances, there are several here that will keep you happy. My single best reason for you to see this movie, though, is to give you the chance to get in on a little piece of Hollywood history: there's a star being born right before your eyes in Dreamgirls, and her name is Jennifer Hudson. It's worth the price of the ticket and then some for that indelible moment alone.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Dreamgirls is rated PG-13 for 'language, some sexuality, and drug content.' That's probably about right, but parents also need to know that there's adultery, gambling, sleazy deals, bribery, and other unsavory activities depicted as well. If you don't particularly care to have your child see that sort of thing, then Dreamgirls probably isn't the movie for them. With that caveat, I think Dreamgirls is fine for girls (boys won't much like it) of about 14 and up as well as for most adults.",6,0,1,21 January 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Maybe the Goat Died of Embarrassment...
","I like George Clooney. I like comedies. I also needed a movie to see. It seemed natural, despite having the year's single most inexplicable title, I'd buy a ticket to see The Men Who Stare at Goats. Sadly, the title may have been the best thing about this movie.Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor, displaying an almost flawless American accent) is a frustrated reporter for a small town newspaper. Despite fighting to be assigned to more serious stories, Bob is sent to interview yet another nut for still one more fluff piece. His wife (Rebecca Mader), who also works for the newspaper, is his only real joy in life. But when his wife leaves him for the least likely of characters, Bob throws caution to the wind and heads for Iraq in search of some real news.Unfortunately, his adventures in Iraq prove less than exciting. Until, that is, he overhears something in a bar that leads him to believe the nut he interviewed earlier might not have been so crazy after all. As Bob tries to learn more, he targets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) for information. Cassady seems to Bob to be a character in his own right, but not one that has much credibility or who is likely to prove of much use in furthering Bob's own goals. But Cassady does offer Bob a way to get closer to the war action, and so he's able to take advantage of at least that much.On their way across the desert, Lyn talks and Bob listens. He tells stories of a hippie Army commander (Jeff Bridges) who works with a group of soldiers sponsored by a somewhat off kilter general (Stephen Lang). He describes events Bob can scarcely credit, including the tale of a man (Kevin Spacey) whose abilities prove his undoing. And there's more! Of course, the men are in a war zone and things can't stay quiet enough for stories indefinitely...I still like George Clooney, and he does a credible job here. Ewan McGregor is a little wide-eyed, but I bought into his character, too. Jeff Bridges is good as is Kevin Spacey, but I really loved Stephen Lang's General Hopgood. The supporting cast, including a mildly amusing appearance by Robert Patrick (of Terminator 2 fame), is also fine.So what's really wrong with The Men Who Stare at Goats? The script. Penned by Peter Straughan and based on the book by Jon Ronson (which I have not read), the premise is terrific. The fact that there's some basis in truth makes the notion more titillating and the potential for comedy that much greater. And yet it's quite simply not realized. When a movie billed as a comedy isn't funny (despite having one or two laugh-out-loud moments, the film is on balance mundane at best), you've got a pretty obvious problem as far as I'm concerned! Other more peripheral problems include what appear to me to be budgetary issues. For example, flashbacks showing a young George Clooney show instead a middle aged George Clooney wearing a wig. Now if Brad Pitt can look so flawlessly youthful as Benjamin Button, why on earth can't somebody take 20 years off Clooney? Special effects (most notably one late in the film, though there are others) appear rudimentary and are certainly unbelievable. These things also took away from any enjoyment I might have otherwise had in this film.BOTTOM LINE: The Men Who Stare at Goats had possibilities. None of them were realized. I frankly can't recommend you bother.POLITICAL NOTES: There were any number of people and situations that could be interpreted as offensive to the military. I won't go so far as to suggest that that was intentional since I suspect it was a ham-handed (and unfunny) attempt at humor. But one thing I can't let go is the overall disrespect for the mainstream military on exhibit here.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Men Who Stare at Goats is rated R for language, some drug content and brief nudity. The rating might be a little harsh, but I wouldn't bring my kids anyway. Actually, the truth is,, if I'd known then what I know now, I wouldn't go myself.",3,4,12,7 December 2009
Jarhead," Jarhead Brings Gulf War Home
","I remember the Gulf War all too well. It was my own initial experience with a 'television war' (those who are older doubtless remember that the Viet Nam war was the very first of those), and I was terrified of the repercussions even as I couldn't look away from the anti-aircraft tracers lighting up my TV screen.Jarhead, as many people know, is a slang term for a US Marine. One of those newly minted jarheads is Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, largely to even his own surprise, finds himself enduring the rigors of basic training and then still more brutal training for his assigned specialty. Swoff tells one drill sergeant that he's in the Marines only because he 'took a wrong turn on the way to college.' His explanation doesn't go over well. Later, he does everything he can think of to drum himself out of the Corps.Eventually, between the friendship and support of his partner, Allen Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and the tough example set by his commander, Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swoff becomes very, very good at his new job: a scout sniper. Needless to say, when the news breaks that Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, Swoff's group is one of the first to be sent overseas.The troops are welcomed to the desert by Lt. Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) who commands a large segment of the Marines deployed there, and who tells them they must maintain constant vigilance and be ready to fight at a moment's notice. But months go by with nothing to do but drills and more drills, and the boredom, anxiety, heat, and desolation of their circumstances begin to wear. The men, of course, find some very creative (and usually very naughty) ways to entertain themselves and each other during this time. But when war is at last declared, they move out like the professionals they've been trained to be.In the midst of burning oil wells and charred vehicle convoys, Swoff and his company make their way into enemy territory. They endure enemy fire and fear; fights amongst themselves and utter despair. And then, as suddenly as it began, the war is over. But despite the brevity of Swoff's experience (his own fighting war lasts only a little over four days), he and everyone else is changed by their experiences, and not all of those changes are easy to live with.Jarhead gives us the firsthand experience of one soldier in the Gulf War with all of the attendant good and bad moments. As such, it's fascinating in and of itself. But director Sam Mendes has added dramatically to the story with some truly brilliant edits, some creatively managed flashbacks, and some astounding settings (the burning oil wells are bizarrely heart breaking even as the depiction on screen is awesome; the destruction wreaked by American bombs is graphic and moving). Of course, the fact that the film is based on a book written by the real Anthony Swofford about his own experiences in the Gulf War means that even Hollywood effects can't take away from the back of our minds that much of what we see is real, or at least was.Jake Gyllenhaal has become a very good actor indeed, and holds his own with Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx, whose performance could very well garner him another awards season nod for his supporting role. Peter Sarsgaard is also just terrific. The rest of the supporting cast  who have far more limited roles  is also good. In fact, the one real criticism I have about the film is that I would have liked to have known more about each of the men who served so honorably and who were so altered by that experience.Jarhead isn't a war movie per se in the sense that it shows a lot of shoot 'em up action. But it may be one of the few war movies that actually conveys graphically the sheer boredom and hurry-up-and-wait that is the reality for many soldiers. And that the men perform so well despite the emotional obstacles of where they are and what they might have to do, and that they're a cohesive group when it counts no matter the flaws of each or any of them, is unquestionably honored here. I recommend Jarhead for virtually everybody.POLITICAL NOTES: The comparison between the Gulf War and the current conflict in Iraq is inevitable, particularly as some continue to believe that Saddam Hussein should have been deposed in that war rather than as a part and parcel of the current and ongoing War on Terror. But the very real difference between the two is that in the first, Americans were viewed as the liberators of Kuwait. In the latter, some countries look at Americans as the despots who overthrew a sovereign nation. While perception doesn't win or lose battles, it does make the difference between victory and defeat in the court of public opinion.Obviously, it's tempting to call that opinion inconsequential. But the reality of it is that such opinion can shape alliances, trade, and more for years to come thus making mere perceptions important to everything from national security to economic health. Regardless, however, Jarhead does serve one important function and that's to humanize our fighting men and to reinforce the fact that they are fighting for our country and for freedom. Whatever your opinion on anything else, I'd hope you'd remember at least that much.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Jarhead is rated R for 'pervasive language, some violent images, and strong sexual content.' Parents should be aware that the R rating is entirely warranted. But with that caveat, I'd recommend Jarhead for mature audiences who are interested in current events, the military, or just plain good movie-making.",7,24,48,6 November 2005
District 9," District 9 More than Entertainment
","District 9 takes place in South Africa where an alien space ship suddenly appeared in the skies above Johannesburg almost thirty years ago. The aliens didn't attack nor did they offer technology or trade. In fact, there was little contact at all until humanity took the initiative. But first contact isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially not if you're an alien. Humans 'rescued' the aliens from their ailing ship, but segregated them into a gigantic shantytown known as District 9 where they remain, monitored by a constant police presence.Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) works for MNU, a corporation that oversees much of District 9 and engages in most of what the rest of the world sees as alien relations. MNU has ulterior motives, of course. It wants desperately to get some version of alien weapons technology up and running. In part because humans are fearful of the aliens, MNU undertakes to move the entire population from District 9 to a location well outside Johannesburg. Van De Merwe is put in charge of the relocation effort, and that's when things suddenly get complicated.District 9 is presented as a documentary film. Some footage appears to come from news organizations while other snippets are apparently culled from security cameras. There's also video of various persons who are interviewed—of the anonymous 'man on the street' variety, MNU employees, and friends and family of Van De Merwe—and their comments woven into the rest of the material. Though there are obviously some scenes that couldn't have come from the aforementioned sources, those are also skillfully edited into the plot line here and there. Taken as a whole, the delivery is striking to say the least.Director Neill Blomkamp grew up in South Africa, and I suspect his intimate knowledge of the country during apartheid contributed greatly to District 9 (which is based on a 2005 short made by Blomkamp). Famed director Peter Jackson had originally tapped Blomkamp to direct a movie version of the video game, Halo. When that didn't pan out, Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever he liked. He expanded on his earlier idea, and co-wrote and directed District 9; Jackson is credited as a producer.I was surprised to learn that leading man Sharlto Copley hadn't acted before this, but I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, in a documentary-style film, he could probably get away with not being very good. The reality, however, is that Copley had to be far more than just another interviewee. He had to portray a variety of very strong emotions under a number of extraordinary circumstances. Copley wasn't adequate to the role. No, he was positively fantastic. I feared for him, I cheered for him, I loathed him, and frankly, I wept over him. He may not have acted before, but I sure hope he does again! It's painful to type the word 'only' in front of '$30 million,' but that kind of money for this kind of movie is a pittance. I fully expected mediocre special effects and other shortcuts which, in a film relying on at least some effects, could very well have resulted in dragging the movie down. Once again, I was delighted to see that Blomkamp (and Jackson's own WETA Workshop, which handled everything from special effects to props, and from vehicles to make-up effects) came through, and in a major way. The CGI (by Image Engine, a company in Vancouver, Canada where Blomkamp attended and graduated Vancouver Film School) is flawless, and the integration with live action is just terrific. I wasn't merely satisfied by the depiction of these aliens, I was awed. I never doubted for a moment that they were real.From a somewhat lower tech standpoint, I loved the cinematography. Some scenes were filmed with hand-held cameras, and the jouncing and jiggling were perfect touches and added genuine realism. Other shots with broader scopes were awesome, beautiful, and horrifying by turns. I credit excellent direction combined with talented cinematographers, good editing, and some more of that superlative CGI work for the cohesive and dramatic end product.BOTTOM LINE: It's obvious I recommend District 9 to movie goers as a unique new action movie. But I must confess something else as well: When the movie was over and the audience making its way out, I was still in my seat. I sat there, alone, in the dark, weeping. I've talked about movies before as 'entertaining' or 'exciting,' and this one is both. It was also, to my lingering amazement, profoundly moving. Good for Mr. Blomkamp, and good for movie fans, too.FAMILY SUITABILITY: District 9 is rated R for bloody violence and pervasive language. Because this is science fiction, though, I don't see that the violence would be too much or too graphic for kids of about 13 or 14 and up. The language (and plenty of it) is going to have to be your own call.POLITICAL NOTES: I didn't know it before I saw the movie, but the shantytown filled with shacks occupied by aliens is real. Its human population was in the process of being relocated to government housing, but people still lived there when the movie was being made. Even had it been a product of set decorators, the living conditions there were appalling. That it's real is almost unfathomable. While there are the all too obvious lessons here where poverty and apartheid is concerned, I also think it's important to point out the motives of MNU, motives which echo those of many governments, up to and including a 'the ends justify the means' attitude. The notion that some lives are considered less valuable than others is also brought home, sometimes in particularly graphic and horrific fashion. That's another lesson some could do with learning, particularly by those currently considering health care reform in this country.",9,10,19,16 August 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit is a Journey Well Worth the Trip
","It will doubtless come as no surprise to you that I'm a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (no one was more delighted than me when The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King won its Best Picture Oscar, and well deserved it was!). But while you might think that's to the movie-maker's advantage, it isn't. Sure, I'm predisposed to like the film. On the other hand, you do not mess with something as beloved as Tolkien's masterpiece! Director/Producer Peter Jackson didn't disappoint with his Lord of the Rings series, and I'm truly pleased to say that — so far, at least — he's managed to engineer the same feat with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (part 1 in a series of 3).The Hobbit takes place sixty years before the events that unfold in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. A much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is unexpectedly approached by a wizard he scarcely remembers having met as a child. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) wants Bilbo to go on an adventure, something the stay-at-home hobbit has absolutely zero interest in accepting. But when his home is effectively invaded by a troupe of dwarfs led by heir-to-the-throne Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Bilbo becomes even more certain that adventure is not for him! Suffice it to say that a combination of envy, shame, and a desire for something beyond his own environment convinces Bilbo in the end to join the quest of the dwarfs: to take back the Kingdom of Erebor stolen from them decades ago by the greedy and vicious fire-breathing dragon, Smaug.Though he knows the journey won't be an easy one, Bilbo is taken aback by the hardships of life on the road which are only exacerbated by the fact the dwarfs are less than impressed with the hobbit or any abilities he might or might not have. Gandalf, however, maintains that Bilbo has hidden depths and that he'll admirably suit the group's need for someone with the skills of a burglar (which, of course, Bilbo steadfastly denies he has).Along the way, the travelers run into any number of impediments ranging from marauding orcs to duplicitous goblins, to say nothing of mountain trolls, giant spiders, or wizards who appear to be just a little less than entirely sane. And, of course, there are the elves, led by Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and advised by the Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). But perhaps the most dangerous and important creature to surface in their travels is met by Bilbo alone: the warped and undeniably psychotic Gollum who loses his most precious possession for which he blames Bilbo.Although the script (penned by a team including Jackson himself and Guillermo del Toro, originally tapped to direct) diverges from the book (a certain Orc, for example, plays a pivotal role), it holds beautifully to Tolkien's vision. (In fairness, the added parts are also Tolkien's; they're part and parcel of extensive appendices Tolkien crafted to further flesh out his intricate creation of Middle Earth.) It includes moments of humor which are welcome, as well as some surprisingly deep emotion.In some ways, it's the special effects that make or break movies like this no matter the caliber of the acting (very good), the direction (excellent), or the editing (also very good). It's also typically my favorite part of any movie like this, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey lives up to expectation. Given the extensive use of CGI, I'm amazed to have only seen a split second or two that might have been improved upon, and I'm still lost in jaw-dropping wonder at an extended battle scene that takes place in the goblin tunnels. I'd like to say that the special effects are brilliant, but that word really isn't sufficient. Though the 3D treatment wasn't strictly needed, I can't lie: It, too, was beautifully rendered and, in my opinion, added to the reality of even the most unreal of moments. Of course, the actual location of the filming doesn't hurt, either. A trip to New Zealand is so on my bucket list! BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, you'll love seeing so much of what you've read come to vibrant life before your eyes. If you're not a fan of The Hobbit, you will be if you see this movie! I was a little concerned with the length since I'm not one to sit still for long if I'm not completely engrossed. Perhaps my best recommendation for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, then, is to tell you that the nearly three hours' run time flew by for me. I literally couldn't believe the movie was over already!POLITICAL NOTES: It's interesting, especially in light of recent debates in Washington, to see how greed can so thoroughly corrupt even previously decent leaders. It's even more heartening to see that there are those who still (as Thorin Oakenshield says concerning his rag-tag company) value 'loyalty, honor, a willing heart...' more than anything else, and who are willing to fight for what's decent and right.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is rated PG-13 'for extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence, and frightening images.' The violence, though of a fantasy nature, is sometimes quite graphic; the suspense is beyond what younger children could easily handle. The storyline is also complex enough that younger children aren't going to understand it. Most of us read The Hobbit for the first time when we're 12 or 13 at youngest; The Lord of the Rings is typically read even later than that. And that's frankly not a bad gauge to consider when you wonder if this is a movie for your kids.",8,4,9,6 January 2013
Cars," Cars a Distant Second to Previous Pixar Releases
","The general story told by Cars is a simple one  as is to be expected from a movie aimed squarely at the elementary-school set: Race car Lightning McQueen (capably voiced by Owen Wilson) is fast, but not too nice. You see, he knows how good he is, and he rarely misses an opportunity to brag. Lightning is in a three-way tie for this year's coveted Piston Cup, and he's determined to be the first rookie car to take the trophy. All that stands in his way are his two chief competitors.Veteran racer 'The King' (surprisingly well voiced by retired NASCAR champion Richard Petty) is running his last race before retirement. Not only his crown but his lucrative endorsement contract will go to the next top racer. Meanwhile, the experienced Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) will do anything to win, including some questionable moves on the track. Though Lightning has a very real chance to win, his hubris costs him and the three finish the big race in a photo finish tie. That, in turn, results in an unprecedented 'race off' to take place in California the following week.Lightning, who has just alienated yet another pit crew, climbs aboard his transport vehicle for the trip to the west coast. Mac (John Ratzenberger) actually doesn't seem to mind his passenger's attitude. But if Lightning notices at all, he's much too busy making demands to do much else. Though Mac is concerned he's too tired to make it to California in one night, he does his level best to comply with the orders. Unfortunately, Mac is right, Lightning is wrong, and a mishap on the road finds the two separated and Lightning on his own in an out of the way small town.Lightning is more than a little taken aback when the few denizens who remain living in the community don't know who he is. He's even more disturbed to discover how little they care. Doc Hudson (brilliantly brought to curmudgeonly life by Paul Newman) isn't inclined to put up with Lightning's antics or his attitude and would just as soon see the race car leave town as quickly as possible. But local innkeeper Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) determines that Lightning isn't going to take advantage of her or her friends and that he, in fact, owes them a little something.During his sojourn in Radiator Springs, Lightning meets other colorful characters including a rust bucket tow truck named Mater (Larry the Cable Guy, who is perfectly cast); low rider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and his 1950's floozy, Flo (Jennifer Lewis); a rigidly upright Jeep named Sarge (Paul Dooley); a psychedelic van (George Carlin); and an Italian tire dealer named Luigi (Tony Shaloub) who works with a sidekick named Guido (Guido Quaroni).Between run-ins with the law and nighttime shenanigans, Lightning finally gets the chance to learn that there's more to life than winning races. He sees that actions have consequences, and that others have feelings. But will the lessons sink in? And if they do, what does that mean to his pursuit of the Piston Cup? Cars is another film from Pixar Studios, so you can safely bet that the animation is superb. Although cars don't lend themselves to as much human-like expressiveness as do toys (Toy Story and Toy Story 2) or fish (Finding Nemo), the quality of the voice work does make up for some of that lack. The chrome and other metal finishes depicted are just terrific (as a graphic designer and artist, I know just how difficult it is to get a natural looking sheen on objects!), and the background scenery is nothing less than stunning in the main while the animation itself is smooth as silk.The real problem for me was a script that just wasn't funny. The relative simplicity and predictability was forgivable  again, look at the age and sophistication of the target audience  but the almost total lack of humor was not. There were plenty of kids in the showing I attended, and I didn't hear a single giggle out of any of them (on the plus side, I also didn't hear much else out of them, and over the course of a two hour movie that's actually pretty good). In fact, the only part of the entire film I personally found amusing was the little surprise appended to the end of the credits (if you do go to see Cars, be sure to stick around for that).Superlative graphics and excellent voice work just aren't enough to take Cars and raise it to the level of some of the better animated films released previously. Earlier efforts also made good use of computers but didn't rely on them to take the place of a good script. That's where Cars finishes an unfortunate  and distant  second.POLITICAL NOTES: There's one point made in Cars that will be all but entirely lost on the children who see it. Their parents, however, will find themselves almost literally beaten over the head with the overwhelmingly blunt commentary made mid-movie which concerns the building of interstate highways. The only real surprise to me is that nobody took what seems a tailor-made opportunity to talk alternative fuels and hybrid engines.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Cars is rated G. I certainly saw nothing unsuitable for even the youngest family members. I do, however, think that the script uses enough big words and marginally complicated concepts that the littlest ones will be confused or even bored by the on screen action. Cars is most likely fine for those children of age six or so and up, though the older they get the less I suspect they'll like it.",3,13,29,11 June 2006
2012," The End of It All Looks Pretty Good
","Every year, there's at least one big studio, big budget movie that features high end special effects. Will the movie's story or actors be any good? Doesn't matter, because the special effects will be awesome! That's exactly what I was thinking when I saw this summer's Transformers sequel, and I was wrong. The movie, despite its superlative effects, was bad enough that it did matter. But that's okay; hope springs eternal, and I used the same argument as my excuse to see 2012. Fortunately, this time around I wasn't disappointed.Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a government scientist who travels to India when a fellow scientist tells him there's something there he must see. Helmsley is floored by the data revealed and he rushes back to Washington where he promptly advises his boss we—the whole earth—have a problem. Helmsley's boss, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt) recognizes the importance of what he's told and promptly takes Helmsley directly to President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) himself. Big decisions are quickly made and secretly set in motion. Meanwhile...Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is an unsuccessful novelist who pays the bills as the chauffeur of a wealthy Russian businessman. But at the moment, he's far more concerned with picking up his children from his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new husband (Tom McCarthy) for a trip to Yellowstone National Park, something it's all too clear the kids don't want to do.Once at the park, Jackson arrives where his memory tells him he should be, but things look different, and the area is literally crawling with scientists and soldiers. After a brief conversation and a warning, Jackson and the kids are released. They've set up an uncomfortable camp and the kids are complaining about mosquitoes when Jackson hears something in the woods that turns out to be local conspiracy theorist, Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson). After sharing a beer or two with the man, Jackson escapes back to his own camp and his disgruntled children.Jackson's vacation is suddenly cut short when he gets a call from his ex-wife asking him to bring the children home. A spate of earthquake activity in California has her spooked, and she wants the kids at her side. Jackson does as she asks, but his mind is starting to spin and he tries to connect the dots between all of the odd things that have happened and that he's learned over the course of the last few days. Of course, it's right about then that all hell breaks loose.John Cusack isn't, by any stretch, my favorite action actor. But he was oddly perfectly cast in this action movie. He somehow has the ability to play 'everyman' on screen which makes us all relate more closely to him no matter the extremities of the circumstances in which he finds himself. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, and Thandie Newton (as the president's daughter) are also just fine (although I did find the supporting roles of a Russian businessman and his mistress to be caricatures). But the scene stealers here are Woody Harrelson (nobody can do the lunatic better), and Oliver Platt. In particular, it's impossible not to loathe Platt even as part of you secretly not only understands what he's doing but even approves just the tiniest bit.2012 was directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. Despite his reputation as an action film director, his history is a little uneven. 2012 fortunately puts Emmerich back on the positive side of movie-making once again where he does a credible job both writing and helming the film.As you might expect from the trailers, the special effects are superlative. There are a couple of moments (if you blink, you'll probably miss them) where you can see the handiwork of a computer programmer, but the remaining 99.9% of the effects are utterly fantastic. To me, the only real shortcoming involves the science. And don't even get me started on the speed of the results of those suppositions! I frankly found that distracting. But only for a second!BOTTOM LINE: 2012 is about 2 and a half hours long, and I was stunned at how quickly time passed.That might have had something to do with the fact that I spent most of my time in the theatre trying to relax all of the muscles I kept tensing as I watched the action unfold in front of me. Forget all of the other things you might consider before you decide on a movie, and tell me this: Isn't that really why you go?POLITICAL NOTES: Do I believe that the government would keep things, even deadly serious things, a secret from its citizens? Oh, yeah. In fact, I'm pretty sure it does that kind of thing on a regular basis. And did I appreciate the nod in the film to the Communist Chinese as being pretty much the only people that could have accomplished what they did as quickly as they did? Sure, largely because it's the truth. I also found it bizarrely believable when I was confronted with the methodology the government chose to determine who would go where and when. I can't go into detail here without spoiling certain things for those who haven't yet seen the film, but suffice it to say that not all of these things are good things.FAMILY SUITABILITY: 2012 is rated PG-13 for intense disaster sequences and some language. I'd have to agree with that rating, and add one more limitation of my own for the younger set: Remember that lengthy run time!",6,0,0,7 December 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men Doesn't Live Up to X-Pectations
","In X-Men: The Last Stand, Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) still runs his euphemistically named school. Some older mutants help him by teaching. Among the best and most gifted teachers are Storm (Halle Berry) and the volatile Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) was once a competent teacher himself. But the death of his love, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has devastated him.Neither Xavier nor Summers are able to get Grey off of their minds. Thinking his grief has him hearing her voice in his head, Summers runs off to Lake Alkali where Grey died. Xavier, however, fears there's more to Summers' actions than mere grief, and he sends Storm and Wolverine to check things out. By then, Summers has already discovered that Grey has somehow survived, and his joy is such that he doesn't stop to wonder how it is she lives, nor does he take notice of the fact that the woman he finds on the lake shore has changed.Meanwhile, pharmaceutical magnate Warren Worthington, II (Michael Murphy) has discovered a 'cure' for mutancy. His inspiration for the discovery is his own mutant son, Warren Worthington, III (called Angel, and played by Ben Foster). The President of the United States (Josef Summer) advises that the 'cure' is available on a voluntary basis for any who want it, and he enlists the aid of his Mutant Affairs Secretary, Dr. Hank McCoy (the Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar) to interact with the mutant community.At the same time, Xavier and his old friend turned enemy Eric Lensherr (better known as the evil Magneto, played by Ian McKellen) both try to talk to the resurrected Grey. Xavier wants to help her deal with her trauma, but Magneto wants to enlist her aid against those he believes would threaten all mutants. Grey, however, isn't inclined to listen to anyone or anything but the newly unleashed emotions in her head.No matter what Dr. McCoy says, there are more than a few mutants who believe the 'cure' won't be voluntary for long. Among them is Magneto's longtime associate, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and a mutant we've not seen on screen before, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones). Their treatment at the hands of government authorities can only make others wonder just how legitimate the offer of a 'cure' may be, and how voluntary any application will prove. Even if the 'cure' is voluntary, many more resent the idea that mutancy is anything that requires a cure in the first place.Once again, we need to remember that this is a comic book brought to the big screen. It's not cerebral drama, nor is it witty comedy. It's pure action entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. In this case, though, I'm leaning toward the 'less.' Oh, the acting is fine, particularly on the parts of Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen. And the special effects are, as is to be expected, very, very good. It is, instead, the direction and the script that are lacking.Bryan Singer, who directed the first two X-Men films so ably, chose instead to helm the upcoming Superman Returns. Bret Ratner was tapped to direct The Last Stand in his place. Ratner was simply not up to the job. There was no particularly creative camera work which, in the company of very big effects, can be forgiven. What can't be let slide, are some slow and overtly obvious edits. Edits ought to add to the excitement and suspense; these were so badly managed they actually took significantly away from it.The scriptwriters also made some big mistakes. By packing so many new mutants into a single film, nobody got much screen time and character development suffered horribly. In the previous X-Men films, we enjoyed them in part because we empathized with or envied them. In this movie, we're very much on the sidelines and trying desperately to keep up with a story that hops everywhere because it seems incapable of settling anywhere. In fairness to Ratner, I'm not sure Singer could have managed this mess much better.If you're looking for a lot of special effects, and to incidentally revisit  briefly  some of your favorite X-Men characters, X-Men: The Last Stand won't be a waste of your time and money. But if you think this film will in any way live up to the first two, well, think again. For the record: I thought it was okay, but that's largely because I really, really like good special effects.POLITICAL NOTES: Perhaps the one thing of real interest here is the development of a 'cure' for those who aren't like most. The implications here are strong. For example, if a 'cure' for homosexuality is developed, should it be offered? Would parents give it to infants or fetuses in utero? Would adults consider it? And since homosexuality is obviously a part of who any homosexual adult is, would it be ethical to even suggest such a thing let alone strongly encourage it? While the rejection of a child by its own parents is poignant and painful, there's more than family dynamics at stake here. It's the very notion that something not 'average' or 'normal' might need to be 'cured.' What's next? Skin color? FAMILY SUITABILITY: X-Men: The Last Stand is rated PG-13 for 'intense sequences of action violence, some sexual content, and language.' I can't see that there's anything in the movie that the average 12 or 13 year-old hasn't seen before, and more than once. The three 14 year-old girls I happened to be all liked it, and they made it a point to tell me that they'd not seen the first two, but had no problem following the storyline. Meanwhile, a friend's 18 year-old son informed me that he thought the movie was 'retarded.' Some reviewers have suggested that X-Men: The Last Stand is aimed at the average 15 year-old. I'm having a difficult time arguing against that.",4,1,2,28 May 2006
Children of Men," Children of Men a disappointing movie about a disappointing future
","Children of Men takes place in London, England in the near future. Civilization is falling thanks primarily to the fact that female infertility rates stand at 100%. The knowledge that humanity is doomed to extinction has resulted in extreme violence up to and including acts of war. Although Britain has avoided the worst, it's still a bleak place where Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) makes his home.Theo works for the government's Ministry of Energy, and he drinks. He drinks a lot. But one morning as he makes his way to work on an armored train through slums and unrest, he narrowly misses being killed in the terrorist bombing of a coffee shop.He's so shaken up that even booze offers no respite. He takes the day off work to visit his good friend, Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine). Not long after Theo's return to the city, he's roughly grabbed off the street by kidnappers who toss him into a van, put a hood over his head, and take him to parts unknown.When the hood is finally removed, Theo finds himself face to face with alleged terror leader, Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore) who also happens to be Theo's former paramour. Julian, recalling Theo's connections with a government official, asks him to help secure transport papers for a girl who must reach the seashore at all costs. Theo is disinclined to help, but the offer to pay him and pay him well seals the deal.Theo has no idea how important the girl and her delivery to people waiting at the shore is until she discovers that she's pregnant. The young Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) represents hope for humanity for Theo; but she also represents almost unfettered political power to others.Clive Owen fills the rumpled trench coat of Theodore Faron almost perfectly. In one dramatic scene, the pained way in which he held his body alone spoke volumes. Julianne Moore strikes me as too mild-mannered and frankly pretty to be the ruthless activist that she portrays, but she does an adequate job. Better is Pam Ferris (as Kee's mid-wife companion), Chiwetel Ejiofor (as Luke, a member of Julian's cell), and Claire-Hope Ashitey herself.The special effects are very good, but even better are the sets. So much is presented as matter-of-fact that it seems perfectly believable to see bits and pieces of futuristic technology lying amidst the dinner dishes or outside a coffee shop. And the mixture of low tech with high tech conveys the setting brilliantly. The dark and dangerous vision of the future is flawlessly filmed, and brilliantly edited. Director Alfonso Cuarón has a reputation for dark stories, and Children of Men is his masterpiece.Children of Men is based on the book of the same name by P.D. James. I've not read the book so I can't say how good or faithful the film adaptation may be. But there are some apparent remnants of the novel in the movie that appear jarring or confusing to those of us not in the know.There are those critics who have called Children of Men an unrelenting chase scene. I found myself disagreeing with that assessment rather wholeheartedly when, for long stretches of time, little would be happening. I thought perhaps I was expecting too much, but one of my two companions said immediately upon the movie's end, 'Well, that was slow wasn't it?' (For the record, their considered assessment in the end was, 'It was okay...') Children of Men is an extraordinarily well-crafted film in a visual sense. But what should have been a compelling story is rendered lackluster by some confusing elements, too many breaks in the suspense for the suspense ever to build, and characters who seem utterly despondent (granted, with good reason) rather than determined to do something  anything!  while they still lived to do anything at all. My movie experience wasn't a waste of time, but neither was it an afternoon I'd consider well spent. Too bad.POLITICAL NOTES: One of the more striking topics touched on by Children of Men was Britain's handling of illegal immigrants. Signs are everywhere noting that hiding or aiding illegal immigrants is a crime. Sturdy wire cages abound at train stations and outside internment camps where pathetic immigrants of all ages are locked prior to dispersion. What order remained in that part of the world was apparently to be found in Britain, and the British government determined to hold onto that order whatever the cost rather than to descend into the primitive violence and utter collapse of so many other places.It was obvious in the film that the point was that we were supposed to have sympathy for these illegals who were being rounded up and pushed away by government goons. One look inside an internment camp is enough to convince anybody that no one should be treated in such an uncivilized fashion! And yet I personally saw the other side of the point made just as strongly: If there's no border control, or insufficient border control, any hope of sovereignty or security will be overrun by those who will destroy those things merely by seeking it en masse.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Children of Men is rated R for 'strong violence, language, some drug use, and brief nudity.' Additionally, the storyline itself is too dark and complex for youngsters to grasp or enjoy. I'd say that Children of Men is fine for those relatively mature kids of about 14 or 15 and up. I can't recommend the film wholesale, though. Instead, if you're interested in seeing some truly wonderful film making, or if you've read the book and want to see some startling scenes on screen, Children of Men won't disappoint. The rest of you, though, may find yourself wondering just what it is that some critics are seeing that the rest of us so patently obviously are not.",5,6,11,7 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Good Night and Good Luck is Just Plain Good!
","While I was in Washington DC last week, I took the opportunity of being in a much larger city to see something that probably won't show up in my own relatively small town theatres. That is how I ended up buying a ticket to the award-winning film. Good Night and Good Luck. After having seen it, I truly can't imagine a more appropriate story for either the time or the place.Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) revolutionized both radio and television in his day. He was an electronic journalism pioneer, and a strong advocate of free speech. Murrow, who revamped his 'Hear it Now' radio show into TV's 'See it Now' in the 1950's, was a regular presence in most American households at the time. His partner and producer, Fred Friendly (George Clooney), was in on virtually all that Murrow determined to do including the greatest risk of his career: taking on Senator Joseph McCarthy.McCarthy, as most of us know, was the power behind the Senate's unAmerican activities hearings. In short, McCarthy had a jones for Communism so strong and paranoid that he saw Communists everywhere. Fear on the part of many, and a desire to share in the power for some others, resulted in damaging testimony and ruined lives and careers throughout Hollywood, politics, and the media. Murrow saw it happening, and determined to take it on; the head of the CBS networks, William Paley (Frank Langella) and of its news division, Sigfried Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) discouraged Murrow, but  to their credit  didn't stop him.Shirley Wershba (Patricia Clarkson) did research and reported stories from the print media or from political news releases to the writers and reporters; her secret husband, Joe Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr.) was also an integral member of the production crew. As the 'See It Now' crew worked to put together more shows on the subject, news anchor and reporter Dan Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) found himself attacked by McCarthy's accusations. Though Murrow and his crew are sympathetic to say the least, nothing will stop them from making public the paranoia and the unreasonableness behind McCarthy's efforts.Good Night and Good Luck is a wonderfully done story about a time in history that many of us don't even learn about any more (I certainly wasn't taught anything about it in school!). The acting is superlative on all counts, but is truly breathtaking on the part of David Strathairn. Though confident as the on screen and off screen Murrow, little tics, twitches, and the look in his eyes let you know just how frightened he is of the possible repercussions of what he's doing. Wise's Hollenbeck is first angry, then afraid, and finally desperate; his portrayal conveys all of those things brilliantly. Although those two performances are worthy of singling out, the bottom line is that there's not a mediocre or even an adequate performance in the bunch. They're all just terrific.George Clooney directed and co-wrote Good Night and Good Luck, and did a brilliant job at both. The single criticism I'd have (and it echoes precisely the comments of the friend with whom I saw the film) is this: it's never truly conveyed just how terrified people were  and with what good reason  of the McCarthy Communist juggernaut. Although bad things happen in the film, many are so peripheral that we don't get the real feeling of the horror those days were for some people; we also don't get a real sense of the bravery involved in those who took the project on since the fear isn't adequately conveyed from most.But that's really a small criticism, especially since it's the very under-statedness of the film that offers the most impact. That it's filmed in black and white and with flawless costuming and sets makes Good Night and Good Luck almost more a documentary than a storytelling, and it's that much the better for it. The icing on the cake is the insertion of various 'musical breaks' courtesy of jazz singer Dianne Reeves. They're mood-setting, entirely appropriate for the moment, and just plain amazing editing devices (kudos again to Clooney). Good Night and Good Luck is a true story that everyone should know; but it's also a truly wonderful movie.POLITICAL NOTES: In one of his on-air speeches, Murrow intones: 'We must not confuse dissent with loyalty,' and 'We will not be driven by fear.' He notes that we're not descended from fearful men, and that they in their time had the courage to speak the unpopular. Murrow, of course, was certainly heroic in the 1950's when he chose to fight McCarthy's hold on America. But it was chilling in many ways to see the film in a day and age where we're told that merely speaking against the war in Iraq is unAmerican, and that being critical of the war effort or the government is tantamount to terrorism. Lives and careers are at risk now, too, and we can only hope that the Fourth Estate will do its job as Murrow and other luminaries of the past envisioned and ensured for themselves in their day.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Good Night and Good Luck is rated PG because 'some material may be unsuitable for children.' In truth, I don't believe that any of the movie is suitable for children. That's not because of language, violence, or the like, but rather because of the nature of the story itself. Only adults will be able to grasp all of the implications of the plot; only adults will be able to appreciate what happens during the movie. I suspect that even the most mature child won't get much out of the movie, and will probably be bored out of his skull. You, on the other hand, won't be if you're there to see history, superlative movie-making, or both.",8,4,7,30 October 2005
Paranormal Activity," So Good, It's Scary!
","Paranormal Activity is a very unusual movie even when you don't consider the movie itself. It was made in 2007, but is only just now enjoying a theatrical release. It took just a week to film, starred a couple of unknown actors who used their own names in the movie, and was filmed at a cost of only about $11,000 using the director's own home as the set. The director also wrote the screenplay, and it was the first time he'd done either. But because Paranormal Activity enjoyed a tremendous grassroots fan base which demanded wider release (the publicity campaign for the movie was also utterly inspired), we're now all able to see this little film.Paranormal Activity is filmed and told entirely from the point of view of a video camera purchased by Micah Sloat. He and his live-in girlfriend, Katie Featherston, have been experiencing some strange happenings in the middle of the night, and Micah wants to use the camera to see if there's anything really there. Micah and Katie joke about the camera and about whether or not anything's really haunting them. Even so, Katie takes things seriously enough to contact a psychic (played by Mark Fredrichs), but Micah even laughs at that.The psychic doesn't think the situation is funny. In fact, he tells the couple that he's pretty sure it's not a ghost that's their problem, but something far worse. Katie is terrified, but Micah is excited. What if he can actually prove something's going on? You can almost touch his anticipation as he sets the camera up to film in their bedroom every night. But then things start to happen, and that's when even Micah realizes that the paranormal activity going on in their home is no laughing matter.The story told by Paranormal Activity isn't entirely different from things we've seen or heard before, but the way it was handled was a stroke of brilliance. By letting us effectively be voyeurs in someone's home over the course of a few weeks, we're intimately involved in everything that happens. That intimacy makes every twist and turn all the more shocking.Even what appears to be home video, however, wouldn't give us the sense that we know these people and are experiencing what they are if the script wasn't good. Fortunately, the script is more than good. It's completely and utterly believable. The people talk like real people, and they react like real people. There are no geniuses or heroes here, but people very much like you and me. It sounds odd, but the truth is that it's a whole lot harder to write 'reality' than it is to write something quite a bit more fantastic, and Oren Peli did a stellar job.In fairness to Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, even a great script couldn't have saved this movie if the acting was either too stiff or over dramatic. It was neither. I swear it was as if we really were spying on somebody in the privacy of their own home. If either actor had been over the top in their performance, it would likely have ruined the entire ambiance the director was trying to set. Neither did; they were perfect.Oren Peli's direction was excellent. How do I know? I couldn't see his hand anywhere. Everything flowed naturally. Once again, the reality of Paranormal Activity was striking, and that can't happen without careful effort. The cinematography, while reminiscent of films that have gone before (The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield come immediately to mind), was nicely done with both stationary and hand held cameras. Finish that off with some solid edits, and you've got an independent film that's better than a whole lot of what's being put out by the major studios.BOTTOM LINE: I like horror movies, so I see a lot of them. The best ones have me jumping or cringing in my seat. But a rare and notable few have me scared not just in the theatre, but after I've left. So if you want to know if Paranormal Activity is genuinely scary, well, I'll tell you this: I did everything I could to take my mind off the movie after I saw it. I even went and saw another movie. But when I got home and got ready for bed, there was nothing I could think about or do that would convince me to turn off the light in my bedroom. Nothing. Now, how good a recommendation is that? FAMILY SUITABILITY: Paranormal Activity is rated R for language. I honestly think that it should hold an R rating for the very adult and genuinely terrifying subject matter alone! This is not a movie for those who are easily frightened, nor do I recommend you take the kids. Movie geeks and horror freaks (who know enough to realize that blood and gore does not necessarily equal horror), however, will love this one.POLITICAL NOTES: None.",7,0,1,25 October 2009
Pride & Prejudice," Pride & Prejudice Does Filmmakers Proud
","Pride & Prejudice Let me state right up front that I've never read Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice (you can chalk that up to the shortcomings of a public school education if you like, but more realistically should blame the fact that such books aren't really to my taste). That, in turn, might make you wonder why I went to see Pride and Prejudice in the first place. The answer, at least in part, is that I really enjoy a well done period piece (I have as much a thing for costuming and authentic sets as I do for special effects). But I'd also heard good things about the acting and the film in general, and figured it was worth the matinée price to check it out for myself.Pride and Prejudice takes place in Georgian England where ladies and gentlemen alike endured certain expectations of them from society at large. Deviations were, at best, frowned upon and could even result in the ruin of reputations and families alike. The Bennett family is no exception to these stringent if unspoken rules. With five daughters, Mr. Bennett (Donald Sutherland) has his work cut out for him. His wife, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn), has that work well in hand as she schemes incessantly to get her five girls safely married, preferably to wealthy men.Though lacking in wealth themselves, the Bennett family is viewed well enough in society to enjoy invitations to parties thrown by others in their rural community. So when the rich and good looking Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) has a ball, the Bennett daughters are among those present. Mr. Bingley and his astringent sister, Caroline (Kelly Reilly) are also playing host to Bingley's best friend, the dour Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). Though the eldest Bennett daughter, the beautiful Jane (Rosamund Pike) finds Mr. Bingley much to her liking, the independent Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) feels just the opposite about Mr. Darcy.With misunderstandings of intentions and feelings cropping up on all sides, Jane tries to hide her emotions while Elizabeth's are all too evident. Matters are only made more complicated when the staid and stiff Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) shows up for a visit to the Bennett estate he's named to inherit. Mrs. Bennett is delighted when Mr. Collins expresses some interest in one of her daughters becoming his wife, believing the family will be safe from being turned out if he's married to one of them. But handsome British leftenant Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) and Elizabeth's good friend, Charlotte (Claudie Blakley) may have a thing or two to say about that! Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy's upper crust aunt, the Lady Catherine de Bourg (Dame Judi Dench) has some marriage plans of her own. But decisions by Mr. Collins, actions by Mr. Darcy, and the inexplicable by one of the Bennett daughters throw virtually everybody's plans and desires into a complicated and potentially catastrophic state. And poor Elizabeth finds herself in the very center of the storm.Keira Knightly is a very pretty girl and not a bad actress, but her tendency to have what my mother always called 'mush mouth' makes her hard to understand at times. Rosamund Pike and Jena Malone (as the irrepressible Lydia Bennett) have no such difficulties, while Brenda Blethyn is a tour de force in her role as the nervous Mrs. Bennett. Tom Hollander has Mr. Collins' disapproving looks down pat, while Simon Woods and Rupert Friend are both perfect for their roles. Matthew MacFadyen is all right, too, though I might wish Donald Sutherland troubled himself to have at least some semblance of an English accent.In Pride and Prejudice, though the acting is all fine or better, perhaps the most enjoyable element is provided instead by a story that should be antiquated, but somehow isn't. Kudos to the screenwriter who provided this latest screen adaptation to include the proper atmosphere even while including drama and humor that were perfectly understandable and appreciable by modern audiences. As I'd hoped, the costumes and the sets were just fabulous. There were also a few really creative edits and some very good direction to round the picture out. The cinematography, too, is spectacular.Pride and Prejudice is a really enjoyable movie on a number of levels, though I suspect it will be most successful as a date movie or a so-called 'chick flick.' In a way, that's too bad. It's honestly better than that. In fact, it's better than a lot of other movies have been this year. I sincerely hope it's broadly appreciated by audiences who will be in for a real treat when they take their seats for Pride and Prejudice.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Pride and Prejudice is rated PG for 'some mild thematic elements.' Although tales of Georgian England are sufficiently 'clean' to satisfy even the most strict of parents, the language and plot is complex enough that I'd leave the under-12 crowd with tickets to Zathura instead. I also have to admit that teenaged boys aren't much going to care for Pride and Prejudice. For everyone else, though, I recommend Pride and Prejudice without reservation. It's fun; it's funny; it's beautifully filmed; and it's just plain good.",7,1,2,27 November 2005
Inside Man," Inside Man proves a good mainstream heist film
","The trailers for this movie opened with actor Clive Owen chatting directly with the camera and claiming he'd planned the perfect bank robbery. There are only two ways a movie can go after a statement like that. Either it will prove entertainingly clever, or it will fall flat either by telescoping plot twists or being utterly predictable. It was a true movie thrill to find that Inside Man is a terrific example of the former.Remember the last time you visited your bank? It was likely just another in the list of errands you had that day. Other people, each conducting their own business and running their own errands were almost certainly there with you, though you probably didn't know each other and you exchanged nods and smiles at best. Then imagine that ordinary scene ripped apart by gun-wielding mask-wearing bank robbers, and how you might feel shivering on the floor next to those strangers with whom you suddenly have a crisis in common.Dalton Russell (Clive Owens) and his partners have planned just such a scene, and they execute it perfectly. In a matter of minutes, the four robbers have herded bank employees and customers alike into manageable bunches and are well on their way through an apparent checklist of 'things to do to rob a bank.' But it also doesn't take long for a cop to notice something funny is going on at the Manhattan bank and to call for help.With so many innocent civilians inside the building, one of those called in is hostage negotiator Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). Frazier isn't anybody's first choice  he's under investigation for the theft of some money seized as evidence  but his commanding officer has no one else who can go. So along with his partner, Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Frazier heads to the scene.When Frazier arrives, the police have the situation well in hand with blockades to keep civilians away and a mobile command center on site run by Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe). Frazier takes command on his arrival, but his efforts aren't helped by the begrudging cooperation of Darius nor by the exorbitant demands received from the robbers. His world is about to be complicated still further when the mysterious Madeline White (Jodie Foster) arrives on scene.White, who shows up in the company of no less a personage than New York's mayor himself, has been hired by the bank's owner, the wealthy Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) to minimize the PR damage that could occur as a result of the robbery. But Frazier begins to suspect that there are agendas far beyond the mere success of a robbery or the public concern of the bank's owner. As a result, he's utterly bound up in the chaos of Dalton's perfect crime as it whipsaws its course defined in part by the machinations of others.Denzel Washington is always good, and he's no exception here. What's nice is that he's allowed to be a little less serious than he sometimes is, and he carries off Detective Frazier's sass and biting humor with real aplomb. Clive Owen fleshes out his character with shades of grey that mitigate the black and white of good and bad behavior in ways that add a good deal to the plot. Jodie Foster, who is so often the heroine of a film, is a morally ambiguous character here. Though the Oscar® winner's skills can't be doubted, it was still a bit of a surprise to see just how biting and arrogant a woman she can play. The large supporting cast is also just fine.I'm not personally a big Spike Lee fan. I don't care for urban films, and I'm not impressed by Lee's politics, either. But he was surprisingly effective in his direction of this movie's more mainstream appeal, and I walked out of the theatre with a newfound respect for his abilities. The editing was superlative, particularly in its creative use of flash-forwards (as opposed to the more commonly seen flashbacks); there were a few truly creative camera angles and one inspired stop motion scene as well.While Lee ably directed the picture, a good deal of credit must go to writer Russell Gewirtz who makes his major motion picture debut with his script for Inside Man. It's entertaining; it's smart; and while it's not truly believable, it's plausible enough that audiences can be gripped by the plot and dragged along its often surprising twists and turns.As an aside, I don't typically notice the music in movies. If it's really good, you shouldn't. It should enhance scenes, not steal them. The music for the opening and closing credits of Inside Man, however, is particularly striking. It's an unusual choice to be sure, but it's somehow perfect for the job. I didn't notice a note between the beginning and the end of the movie though I don't doubt it was there; but I'm still humming the tune chosen to underlie the credits.If you're headed out to the theatre to be educated or inspired, perhaps you'll consider seeing something else. But if you're looking for pure action entertainment, Inside Man is the perfect 'now showing' venue.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Inside Man is rated R for 'language and some violent images.' I don't agree with that rating. There's no language in the film that the average 14 year-old doesn't hear in school or on his iPod on a regular basis, and the violence is far from graphic. (The single most graphic scene involves a video game  which, when you think about it, makes quite a point in the midst of an action movie.) I think most teens will like Inside Man, and as a bonus, so will most adults. I enjoyed it immensely myself.",7,2,3,26 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code Does the Job
","When I was looking for a movie to see this weekend, the fact that I really kind of enjoy a good controversy was alone enough to make me buy a ticket to see The Da Vinci Code this weekend. That I'd enjoyed the novel immensely was almost secondary.In The Da Vinci Code, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) works at Harvard as a professor specializing in symbols. His particular area of expertise involves religious symbology in an historical context. He happens to be giving a lecture in Paris on the very evening the curator of the Louvre is murdered by a mysterious Opus Dei monk named Silas (Paul Bettany).Because the body is surrounded by symbols, Police Captain Fache (Jean Reno) seeks Langdon out for help. The curator's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou) specializes in code breaking for the police, so it's no surprise that Fache and Langdon find her on the scene at the Louvre as well. But what Langdon doesn't understand is that he is himself the prime suspect in the murder.While the professor innocently helps the police with the meaning behind some of the symbols he's permitted to see at the murder scene, Sophie works along a parallel course. She's just as anxious to solve the murder as is Captain Fache, but she also knows that Langdon is not only not guilty but that he could be of crucial assistance in finding the responsible party. Interpreting the messages left for them by a dead man, the two soon find themselves on a trail followed by thousands from time immemorial: a search for the Holy Grail itself.Though of mythical proportions, there are experts who believe the Holy Grail is real and that it might actually be found. One of them is Sir Leigh Teabing, an Englishman retired to the French countryside. Fortunately, Teabing is known to Langdon, and he and Neveu contact him to learn what they can. The police, of course, are wasting no time and they're not on the trail of the two fugitives. Unknown to those on either side is the fact that representatives of Opus Dei are determined to get there first to ensure that some secrets are never told.Tom Hanks, who has won Oscars® for some of his past performances, is perfectly fine here. Playing a relatively staid (and frankly bookish) professor doesn't allow him a lot of room, though, to really show what he can do dramatically. Audrey Tatou is very pretty and also perfectly fine, but again, much of her role doesn't offer the opportunity to do more than go with the flow. Paul Bettany, who often plays the quiet, studious type, is positively menacing here, and good for him! But the standout performance comes from Ian McKellen who steals virtually every moment of every scene he's in, and does so handily.Special effects that involve illustrating historical events while the professor narrates are beautifully rendered (pay particular attention to the way an explanation of Sir Isaac Newton's funeral is handled). The sets are just; the editing was nicely done, too, especially given the fact that a great deal of information had to be distilled into a two and a half hour movie. And that brings me to commenting on the script.Writer Akiva Goldman had a tough assignment adapting The Da Vinci Code for the screen given the incredible amount of detail  some of it quite esoteric  that author Dan Brown included in his novel. Although the screenplay isn't unflawed, I also would agree that he did just about the best job possible with the material he had to use.Those who suggest that The Da Vinci Code is difficult to follow without having read the book are, I think, giving audiences far less credit than they're due. And those critics who apparently found the film so lacking when they were given a preview of the finished product at the Cannes Film Festival last week apparently don't represent regular audiences at all: The people I saw the movie with actually applauded at the end, something I very rarely see any more.The best recommendation for seeing The Da Vinci Code may not come from me, but rather from a young man seated behind me with his girlfriend. As the closing credits ran, I heard him say, 'Wow. I didn't think I was going to like it. But it was good!' It is.POLITICAL NOTES: If you haven't been living in a cave, you've doubtless heard more than you care to about The Da Vinci Code from those who'd like to see the story silenced. In my own mind, that attitude is really the only wrong one to have.If people want to use the story as a springboard for discussion, good for them. If religious groups would like to use the story to educate their followers, good for them. But if those who don't like some aspect or another of the story intend to stop all of us from hearing or seeing it, well, that's bad for all of us.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Da Vinci Code is rated PG-13 for 'disturbing images, violence, some nudity, thematic material, brief drug references, and sexual content.' Neither the nudity nor the sexual content is, in my opinion, remotely an issue here; the drug references are subtle enough that I don't even remember them. The thematic material is, however, much too complex for younger children to understand or to appreciate. Additionally, some scenes of mortification are far beyond what youngsters ought to see. I'd say that The Da Vinci Code is best suited for those of about age 15 or so and up.",7,5,10,21 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Fourth Potter Installment Falls Just Short
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire recounts the events of Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) fourth year at Hogwarts, a school for young witches and wizards. The movie begins slightly before the school year does when Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) takes his family and a few friends to the World Quidditch Tournament. Harry, and his best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are thrilled, especially when they're able to see the 'world's greatest seeker,' Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) play. But when the tournament festivities are attacked by Death Eaters, the fun and games quickly come to an end.Harry and his friends leave the abruptly terminated matches directly for Hogwarts where they're thrilled to hear Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announce that their school will be the site of the infamous Tri-Wizard Tournament this year. Students from two other schools  Durmstrang and Beauxbatons  will join those at Hogwarts for the contest which is strictly limited to those age 17 and older due to the inherent dangers involved. The magical goblet of fire spits out names from each of the schools: Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) from Hogwarts, Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) from Beauxbatons, and the famous Viktor Krum himself from Durmstrang are to compete. But then the goblet spews forth one more name: Harry Potter.Though too young to compete, the rules are clear: if the goblet offers up a name, that student must participate. Harry is terrified, and can only hope he survives the contests to come. He has some hope of doing so, but only with help from Ron and Hermione; groundskeeper and good friend Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane); the newest Dark Arts teacher, Alastor 'MadEye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson); and, strangely enough, the incompetent-at-just-about-everything Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis).If all this isn't enough, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his father, Luscious (Jason Isaacs) continue to plague Harry; Potions instructor, Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) is still no friend to Harry; and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) might just be making a comeback. Mix all of this with Harry's crush on a fellow student, Cho Chang (Katie Leung); a nasty falling out with Ron; and a true tabloid-type reporter for The Daily Prophet (Rita Skeeter, played by Miranda Richardson), and you'll begin to understand why Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was such a substantial book and such a disappointing film.I could, I suppose, blame great anticipation for a bit of my disappointment. But I think it's probably more fair to blame the severe editing needed to squeeze a lengthy book into a two and a half hour time frame. As it was, the World Quidditch Tournament  which was an absolute delight to watch  was on screen all too briefly. The unexplained attack by the Death Eaters would have been more than a little confusing to those who haven't read the book. And the necessity to pack so much into the film meant that favorite characters  such as the malevolent Malfoys, the acerbically funny Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), and the delightful Weasley twins, Fred and George (James and Oliver Phelps)  were given short shrift.The acting is just fine from all of the youthful cast. The acting is quite a bit better than fine from Brendan Gleeson and, in her limited screen time, Maggie Smith. The special effects, as is to be expected, were superlative (pay particular attention to a feisty Welsh dragon), as were the sets. The direction seemed to elicit everything it needed to from the actors, and the editing was largely well done. But so much happened so quickly that there was little opportunity to really become emotionally invested in the film, and that's unfortunate seeing as how this part of Harry's story marks a real emotional watershed for him and his nearest and dearest.It seems to me that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire would have lent itself well to a two-part series or, failing that, should have been longer. Peter Jackson (the Oscar-winning director of the brilliant Lord of the Rings series) proved audiences would sit still for three and a half hour movies provided they're good ones, and the Harry Potter movies are among the few with stories that really are that good. Did I like the movie? Yes, I did. But it could have been better...FAMILY SUITABILITY: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is rated PG-13 for 'sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images.' I read one review where it was suggested that those too young to read the hefty book are too young to see the movie, and I'd agree. There are injuries, deaths, and other assorted nasty things that simply are not suitable for small children. Older Harry Potter fans (say 11 or so and up) will be fine, though, and will love seeing everything they've imagined (and then some) coming to life on the big screen. It's no small feat that even a movie that could have been so much better was still so good!",7,0,1,20 November 2005
Lord of War," Lord of War combines political commentary with entertainment and does it well
","Based on that premise that this movie was anti-gun, I really wrestled with my conscience: But I couldn't urge a boycott without knowing more about the movie, so I reluctantly bought my ticket.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is the man destined to become the titular Lord of War. But in his early years, he's searching for a mission. Yuri and his family immigrated from Ukraine and settled in Brighton. Yuri isn't satisfied. Neither his is younger brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto).In his early 20's, Yuri remains uncommitted until the day he witnesses a hit by the Russian mafia and is stricken with the notion that people open restaurants because other people will always need to eat, and that people buy guns because people will always want or need to kill.As his business grows, Yuri brings Vitaly into the venture. Vitaly soon finds himself addicted to drugs, while Yuri, has another obsession: Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), a beautiful model he's worshipped for years.Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) isn't fooled by Yuri's pretenses. Unfortunately, he can't back up what he knows with the evidence to prove it. Yuri's business grows until the Soviet Union falls and offers him the biggest windfall he's ever had. Yuri is able to entice the bloodthirsty president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), with a buffet of weaponry.Yuri's wealth grows by leaps and bounds as does his reputation; but he stands to lose much as his lifestyle grows more dangerous both to himself and to those around him.Although the main characters and storyline are fiction, director and screenwriter, Andrew Niccol points out that almost all of the events depicted in the film have actual real life precedents, and Yuri is a composite of five arms dealers. The civil wars and violence in Liberia that extend from 1980 to the present are real. So, obviously, is the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent looting of weapons (some $32 billion on arms from Ukraine alone are estimated to have been stolen from 1982 to 1992). Although there are moments when Niccol's script does get preachy, it's based in truth and conveys that truth in a realistic and impactful way.Nicolas Cage is never less than very, very good; Jared Leto, too, is good. Bridget Moynahan is,well cast as the beautiful and naive Ava, and Eamonn Walker is positively menacing as the capricious Baptiste. Ethan Hawke has little screen time, but is just fine, and Ian Holm once again brings his considerable experience to bear as a genteel and yet ruthless international arms dealer.Lord of War is violent, to be sure, and virtually all of that violence involves guns. But in fairness, virtually all of the violence in countries such as Afghanistan and Liberia does involve firearms. The commentary offered by the film as a whole is far less anti-gun than it is against the immorality  or worse, the amorality  of those who would sell to all comers even knowing the end result will involve massacres rather than defense, and genocide instead of any noble cause. And the movie is honest enough to place blame on those legitimate political regimes that export weapons of war even as it highlights the culpability of individual arms dealers whose very business is death.The production values are superb (filmed on location in New York City, South Africa, and the Czech Republic, the backgrounds add considerably to the reality of the film); the direction and editing are good (pay particular attention to the opening sequence of the movie involving the life of a bullet from manufacture to gunshot, all depicted from the point of the bullet). The script is dramatic, but with surprising moments of genuine humor (it has a few moments where the writer is obviously trying much too hard, but thankfully they truly are few). Better still, while entertaining, Lord of War offers some educational value I've not seen available anywhere else. As such, I'm pleasantly surprised to find I'm recommending you see the movie rather than suggesting any boycotts.POLITICAL NOTES: Given its storyline, the political implications of Lord of War are many.In the least sense, there are two moments in the film that seem to address some anti-gun sentiment directly. But these two moments  one of them regrettable in its naivité  aren't enough to warrant a boycott.On a much larger scale, the political machinations behind many of these supposedly independent gun runners is shocking. Remember that the penultimate scene in the movie is based on a true. It's also ironic to note the fact that the world's five biggest arms dealers are nations, not individuals and that (here's the ironic part) those five are the five members of the UN Security Council (as an aside, does that begin to illustrate to you just what a farce the UN really is?).Those who most violate the humanity of others with their guns would do so if they had to use sticks and stones (or the machetes we see in one particularly horrifying scene). The bottom line is that getting rid of the guns would do nothing to stop the fighting. To pretend that eliminating guns will eliminate the problem is both naive and entirely ignorant of the facts; worse, getting rid of the guns would make any defense against the bad guys impossible.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Lord of War is rated R for 'strong violence, drug use, language and sexuality.' Some of the violence is graphic, as is the drug use. I wouldn't recommend Lord of War for those under 16. But the mature, Lord of War offers much to talk about. Frankly, talking a little more about political realities like these couldn't hurt anybody, and might actually improve in some small way some of the awful circumstances found around the world.",7,3,9,18 September 2005
The Good Shepherd," The Good Shepherd is a Bad Movie
","The Good Shepherd begins near the end which, in this case, is the immediate aftermath of the international fiasco colloquially known as the Bay of Pigs. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a highly placed agent of the CIA who had much to do with the battle plan and who must now fight for his very career and reputation. He's certain there's been a leak, and he determines to find it before he can be entirely disgraced. As he frantically works, he searches his own memories of how his current circumstances eventually came to be.In the form of flashbacks, we see Wilson as a young child who must deal with the trauma of the death of his father, career military man Thomas Wilson (Timothy Hutton). Later, during Wilson's days at Yale University, two things happen that will have a lifelong impact. First, he meets the pretty Laura (Tammy Blanchard) studying in the library. And second, he's invited to become a member of the secretive Skull and Bones. For awhile, he enjoys the fruits of both relationships. But his plans again veer off course when a fling with the sister of a Skull and Bones Brother (Margaret Russell, played by Angelina Jolie) results in her pregnancy.Wilson does his duty and marries Margaret. But even as he's going through the mechanics of getting married, he's propositioned by another Skull and Bones alum, the formidable General Bill Sullivan (Robert DeNiro). The general tells Wilson he's been tapped by the president to create an intelligence agency and he wonders if Wilson might not be interested in getting involved. It's difficult to tell whether Wilson accepts more to get away from Margaret's attentions or to fulfill his own ambitions, but accept he does and he's promptly shipped overseas.Wilson isn't home for the birth of his son, Edward Junior (played as an adult by Eddie Redmayne). He's too busy moving up the ranks and behind the scenes of clandestine international intelligence intrigue. And through it all, he begins to learn secrets that have a bearing on everything from his own personal life and loved ones to the very security of the country.Matt Damon is good as is Angelina Jolie (no big surprise there). My only real complaint about them is that neither ages convincingly over the course of a story that spans some 30 years. That is, of course, the result of make-up that's too subtle, but it's also the product of body language that just doesn't fly. Robert DeNiro is terrific in front of the camera (again, not much of a shock), and I really loved William Hurt's performance in The Good Shepherd. Tammy Blanchard was also particularly impressive. Eddie Redmayne, however, managed to get on my nerves in a big way with his effete over-the-top wide-eyed and eager-to-please performance. While this could also be a directorial flaw, I'm inclined to blame it on the performer here.The Good Shepherd was directed by Robert DeNiro. The project, a decade-long labor of love for DeNiro, was artistically handled, but I'm of the opinion that there was too much art and not enough substance. The inception of the CIA should be a very interesting story. Some behind the scenes tales of the secretive Skull and Bones should also be fascinating. But the combination of flashbacks and brief, often seemingly unrelated scenes evokes the effect of a strobe light at a party. It's cool to watch, but it makes everything seem jerky and some brief glimpses appear entirely out of place. In the end, while I understood what was happening, I didn't really care because the audience had simply been pushed too far aside. Perhaps the focus was too broad, and the movie should have dealt with either the CIA or the Skull and Bones.Of course, nothing so disjointed can be laid solely at the hands of the director and editors. The screenwriter is also very much to blame. This is a little hard to understand given that Eric Roth has such gems on his résumé as The Horse Whisperer and Forrest Gump, but the script here is never-the-less not as good as it should have been, and at least as far from as good as it needed to be. That's unfortunate all the way around since the possibilities were almost endless until they were dashed far too early and in a regrettably unsatisfying way.While The Good Shepherd is pretty to watch and has moments of genuine horror that ring terribly true (a torture scene involving a Soviet defector and the ultimate fate of an enemy agent who really only wants to retire to a normal life are particularly disturbing), it doesn't do its subject matter justice. In fact, it doesn't even come close. Even the moments of genuine artistry or flashes of brilliant performances can't save it. The bottom line here in my opinion is that those interested in either the CIA or Skull and Bones should read a book.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Good Shepherd is rated R for 'some violence, sexuality, and language.' I'd call the movie a 'soft' R in that the sex is far from graphic, and most of the violence is implied rather than seen on screen. What most makes The Good Shepherd suited only to mature audiences is the method used to tell the story. It would be confusing at best for those who don't pay rapt attention or for any who need a bathroom break during the course of what is a relatively long film . Frankly, though I didn't need any breaks, I had problems with the 'rapt attention' part myself. I caught myself planning a grocery list a couple of times during the evening. If anything sums up just what I thought of The Good Shepherd, it just might be that.",4,28,52,26 December 2006
The Queen," The Queen
","The Queen focuses on a few months in the reign of Great Britain's Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren). Those few months begin with the landslide election of the young and dynamic Labour Party candidate Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to the office of Prime Minister.At home, the lives of the two principals of British rule couldn't be more different. Blair, whose wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) is a strong critic of the monarchy in general and the royal family in particular, breakfasts with three boisterous children and urges his staff to call him 'Tony.' The Queen has her day rigidly scheduled and is treated with distance and deference even by those closest to her. Unfortunately, the two are soon brought together in ways they couldn't have imagined to deal with a situation neither could have anticipated: the untimely death by accident of Diana, the former Princess of Wales.Blair is wakened in the middle of the night by a telephone call giving him the news. The Queen, who is vacationing at Balmoral, has her sleep interrupted by her personal secretary, Robin (Roger Allam). Bizarrely, both watch the news unfold on television. With another call, they each receive the news that Diana has died of her injuries, and now must determine his or her next step. That's where differences between the two become a chasm Blair in particular fears cannot be breached.Blair speaks immediately to the people, referring to Diana for the first time as 'the People's Princess.' The Queen, on the other hand, repeatedly points out that Diana is no longer known as HRH (Her Royal Highness), and her death is thus a private matter (to his credit, Prince Charles seems to realize that more is required from them than the family is offering long before the elder generation grasps the fact).The growing resentment for the apparent lack of grief on their part combined with the need to express grief of their own escalated matters with the people to the point where even the Queen was forced to pay attention. What few but Tony Blair could understand at the time was that the Queen wasn't unfeeling, but was instead utterly lost in the midst of an unprecedented event for which there was no protocol she could reference and the nuances of which she genuinely didn't understand.In the end, of course, Diana was given what the vast majority of people around the world felt was her due. She was laid to rest with every bit of pomp and circumstance royalty might expect, and she was mourned by all from those in government to those with great celebrity to ordinary men on the street who wept with their wives and their children when the casket passed them by.Helen Mirren is deserving of the accolades she's received in this role. Though not overtly emotional  that's what the Queen has been criticized for, after all!  it's clear in the film at least that she's far from unfeeling. She's merely been trained to rise above her emotions and to present a calm and stoic face to her subjects no matter the provocation. That Mirren makes us actually see that without being told is an indication of just how very good she is. Michael Sheen also gives an excellent performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair, and his resemblance only adds to it.Helen McCrory, James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms (as the Queen Mother), Alex Jennings, and Roger Allam are all good, too. McCrory in particular does a fine job, but part of that can be credited to her uncanny resemblance to the real Mrs. Blair. Cromwell is fine, but the otherwise perfectly good performances of Syms and Jennings are in my opinion significantly harmed by the fact that neither look much like the person they're supposed to be playing.Director Stephen Frears (who also helmed the wonderful Mrs. Henderson Presents) does a nice understated job here. The interspersing of real news footage is a nice touch and unquestionably adds to the realism; putting it on the TV currently being watched by the Queen is especially deft. The script (by Peter Morgan, who also penned The King of Scotland), is okay, but I frequently found myself questioning various parts and pieces of it. Though I understand the story was written after a good deal of research and with the assistance of those close to the Prime Minister or the Royal Family, there are private moments that must, by definition, have involved guesswork. While I'm tempted to believe some of the guesses are accurate, I can't quite push myself over the edge into buying into the movie as a whole, and that hurt my overall enjoyment of it more than I'd like to admit.The Queen is a reasonably good movie with spectacular sets and locations, and some very, very good acting. Anyone who appreciates those things will like The Queen. Those who remember Diana's death and who, even now, suffer a twinge of pain as a result, will also find much of The Queen of interest. On the other hand, those who don't care, and those uninterested in a behind the scenes look at royal protocol, aren't going to find much else of value in this movie. I recommend The Queen, but not without some reservations.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Queen is rated PG-13 for 'brief strong language.' I don't really see much here that wouldn't be okay for the average viewer of about age 10 and up. But the story itself is sufficiently mature, and frankly the rendering of it so staid (in fairness, that was intentional and it does help to convey the stuffy and stifling history of it all) that children aren't going to enjoy themselves at all. As such, I'd save this one for some evening when it's just the adults who are headed out for an evening at the movies.",6,0,0,28 January 2007
300," 300 Makes (Movie) History New Again
","300 takes us back to about 500 years before the birth of Christ to a time when men who dreamed of conquering the world  at least what was known of it  could actually do so. At that time, the all powerful conqueror was Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), a man whose ego may have been the only thing bigger than his substantial army. As Xerxes made his way across the Mediterranean leaving subjugated peoples in his wake, he set his sights on Greece.The city-states that then made up modern day Greece had varying reactions to becoming targets. A few simply agreed to annex themselves to Xerxes' rapidly growing kingdom. But among those that refused Xerxes' emissaries was the small region called Sparta. Ruled by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his Queen, Gorgo (Lena Headey), Sparta was known for the caliber of its fighting men as much as for its pride.King Leonidas petitioned his priests for their blessing before battle, but the priests consulted with an oracle whose confusing message was interpreted by them to mean Sparta should not fight. Because Spartan law required that the king obey the priests, Leonidas gathered up a few hundred of his best men and called them his 'bodyguards.' Tongue in cheek, Leonidas announced that he was 'going for a walk,' and he and his bodyguards departed for the coastal 'hot gates' (named for the hot springs nearby) in the hopes they might funnel Xerxes' army into the narrow pass there.Allying himself with a few men of like mind (some 700 Thespians among them), Leonidas commanded a force that might have totaled 3,000 at its peak. Formulating a battle plan, he prepared to face an army whose numbers are estimated to have been anywhere from 200,000 to two million soldiers strong.Meanwhile, back at home, Queen Gorgo is doing all that she can to urge the ruling Council to send forces to bolster her husband's stand. She maneuvers with the politically-astute Theron (Dominic West) to gain his support for her efforts, but even as Leonidas faces betrayal from within, Gorgo also has to deal with those whose greed outweighs all else. She is among the few who, along with the king, knows full well that a victory for Xerxes means far more than a change of allegiance. Instead, it means the loss of everything Spartan, including first and foremost real freedom.Gerard Butler is as loud and defiant as you'd expect King Leonidas to be, and Lena Headey presents a flawless portrait of a wife who is really just as brave and stoic as her husband. Vincent Regan and David Wenham are terrific soldiers under Leonidas' command, and Andrew Tiernan manages despite substantial prosthetic effects to convey the desperation as well as the twisted greed of the deformed Ephialtes. Rodrigo Santoro, meanwhile, is transformed with the aid of make-up and computer magic to a man one might actually believe has some godhood running through his veins.Director Zack Snyder does a good job (though there are moments I felt Leonidas' mood was too instantly volatile and some edits too abrupt), particularly when it comes to some of the most amazing camera techniques I've ever seen. There are repeated instances of slow motion that are jaw-dropping, and camera angles that add immeasurably to the scope of the battle scenes. When you put that talent together with a good cast and CGI work unlike anything I've ever seen, 300 is more than a little impressive on screen. The CGI is so good, that even the water looks real let alone the stony cliffs of the 'hot gates.' The battle scenes are flawlessly rendered amidst background action you'd swear was really there; the graphic wounds and deaths are as real as can be (with a couple of lamentable exceptions which, in the midst of so much brilliance, are almost forgivable).The only real flaw I saw in 300 is a script (co-written by Snyder) that could have been quite a bit better. The dialog is often stilted in its attempt to sound something like the ancient Greeks might have spoken (though there are moments of sheer genius), and the story occasionally proceeds in something of a 'herky-jerky' fashion. 300 could have been better, I think, its message was as good as it gets.King Leonidas rallied his soldiers in the film by saying, 'A new age has come, an age of freedom. And all will know that 300 Spartans gave their last breath to defend it.' 2,500 years after the fact, we still know. That's one hell of a legacy for liberty, and one I think not enough people can know enough about.FAMILY SUITABILITY: 300 is rated R for 'graphic battle sequences throughout, some sexuality and nudity.' 300 is unequivocally not for small children. The blood and gore alone is substantial, and much of the subject matter is quite adult. Remember, though, that 300 is based on a graphic novel which is often the bailiwick of the teen-aged boy. Given their pre-existing exposure to such pictures and plot lines, I believe that most 14 year-olds would be perfectly fine.That being said, given the lessons offered up by 300, I'd hope that the movie gets a broad exposure and that you take what you learn to heart enough that you take the time to learn more. Leonidas died a long, long time ago, but his courage can still inspire. Here's hoping that it does.",8,0,6,11 March 2007
Easy A," Easy A Makes the Grade
","Olive (Emma Stone) acknowledges she's a fairly typical high school student with fairly typical high school student problems. She has angst. She feels alone. But one day, when she tells her friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) what she wants to hear, she ends up adding a reputation to her list of issues.The reputation bizarrely combines with Olive's compassion for her friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), and the next thing you know, her reputation has grown beyond control. What's a girl to do? Well, in Olive's case, she decides to grab onto the reputation along with everything it means, and ride it for all it's worth.Olive's favorite teacher, Mr. Griffth (Thomas Haden Church) knows something's going on, but he doesn't know what. Mrs. Griffith (Lisa Kudrow), the guidance counselor at the school where her husband teaches, knows something's going on, but what she knows isn't actually what it is. Crusading Christian Marianne (Amanda Bynes) thinks she knows something, but doesn't really want to know anything. Olive's parents, Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson) and Dill (Stanley Tucci) are entirely understanding of something they don't know they don't understand at all. And Woodchuck Todd (Penn Badgley)? Olive would just as soon he didn't know or understand anything at all! Easy A sounds like a fairly simplistic premise and to some extent it is. But the script is clever in ways that raise it above the basic idea, and what could be a confusing mess is actually presented with a winning combination of clarity, humor, and feeling. Much of the cohesiveness of the movie as a whole can be credited to some very skillful edits. And I loved the literary references which, far from stuffy, were actually funny and all too appropriate additions.It doesn't hurt that the acting is, in most cases, stellar. Emma Stone is perfectly cast as Olive. For all her occasional drama, I would have liked her when I was in high school and, considering that I hated everybody when I was in high school, that's saying something! I wanted to slap Amanda Bynes, and that means she did a superb job bringing Marianne to life. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci were a pure delight to watch every time they were on screen. I also really enjoyed seeing Malcolm McDowell in a small role as the school principal.BOTTOM LINE: Easy A wasn't as funny as I thought and hoped it would be, but it was somehow more moving than I'd imagined. There are laughs, but there are also tears and a few scenes where your own high school years will likely creep up on you and give a little extra kick to the happy or sad of the moment. The teens in the theatre, though, seemed to be entirely wrapped up in the immediacy of the film, and laughed more than I did. Of course, their high school memories are yet to be made...POLITICAL NOTES: None.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Easy A is rated PG for 'mature thematic elements involving teen sexuality, language and some drug material.' Because of those elements, I can't recommend Easy A for young children. Older teens, though (16 or so and up), will likely really enjoy the movie, and if you've got a sense of humor about high school, you will, too.",6,1,5,19 September 2010
The Social Network," Facebook Story Earns a Definite 'Like'
","I'd heard of Facebook, of course. Who hasn't? But it wasn't until just about two years ago that some (college-age) friends of mine convinced me to set up my own page. To tell you the truth, I didn't think a whole lot about it. Innovations on the Internet are proceeding at such a rapid pace that I can't keep up with most of it let alone all of it, so the fact that Facebook existed really didn't make me think anything of it one way or another much less do any research into it. And then I saw The Social Network.Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is a brilliant Harvard undergraduate in 2003 with far more intelligence than he has social skills. After a brutal break-up with his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara), Zuckerberg opts for some very public revenge. He begins by posting some less than flattering blog entries about Erica and then, in an all-night flurry of programming, he sets up a Website that features photos of female Harvard students where each can be rated for 'hotness.' These actions not only wound Erica but garner the attention of the Winkelvoss twins (Armie Hammer, with Josh Pence as a body double upon whose face Hammer's likeness is digitally imposed) who have a Website idea of their own.Zuckerberg meets with the Winklevosses (or 'Winkle-vi' as he amusing terms them) and their friend Divya Narenda (Max Minghella) to discuss doing programming work for them on an application they want to put together to enable girls to date Harvard guys. But Zuckerberg thinks he can do something both broader and better, and 'The Facebook' is born. With assistance from his friends Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzell), his idea takes off in a major way even as the Winklevoss twins are still trying to get him to do something—anything!—for them.'The Facebook' has such an impressive take-off that it gets the attention of Napster's mastermind, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). And once Parker and his marketing skills and ideas get involved, Zuckerberg never looks back even though his few friends are being left further and further behind him.The Social Network is based (obviously) on true events, though those involved with the movie have never pretended that parts and pieces aren't dramatized for the big screen (Zuckerberg insists that most of it is). Written by Aaron Sorkin (who was the driving force and writer behind one of what is, in my opinion, the best written television shows of all time, The West Wing), the dialogue is both witty and strangely natural when being voiced by the true computer nerds who are featured in the movie. Eisenberg says his rapid-fire lines so convincingly that I almost believe I was there when he loved, lost, and then won in a big way with his online creation.The other cast members prove they are also well up to the task of bringing these real life people to movie life. Though Eisenberg carries almost every scene on his shoulders, he couldn't be as good as he is without the very able efforts of the supporting cast. I'd also point out that the one genuine special effect in the movie—that of making Armie Hammer's face and voice an integral party to the body of Josh Pence—is flawless (and I was watching).BOTTOM LINE: The Social Network has already been touted as a potential Best Picture nominee come Oscar® time. I'm not entirely convinced that the movie as a whole is quite up to that standard, but I'd be truly stunned if the screenplay wasn't nominated, and I certainly wouldn't consider it undeserving if Eisenberg got a nod. I'm not always interested in recent American history (after all, I was there for some of it), but I also found the behind-the-scenes look at the invention of a phenomenon to be fascinating. And frankly, even if computer applications or online interactions aren't your thing, The Social Network remains a compelling exposé of what has become a huge influence on relationships in today's society. That it's entertaining, amusing, appalling, and heart-rending by turns is almost just icing on a very substantial cake.POLITICAL NOTES: There have been numerous privacy concerns related directly to Facebook. In fact, one of Zuckerberg's problems with his first 'hot' ratings site (which he called Facemash) involved what school administrators termed a violation of the privacy of Harvard students. Facebook has addressed some of the issues, and continues to say it will correct or modify others. It remains to be seen, though, just how much privacy some people will willingly forgo in exchange for the complete experience of what has become very much a real life social network.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Social Network is rated PG13 for 'sexual content, drug and alcohol use and language.' There are moments within the film where parents of younger teens may find themselves having to explain things they'd rather not, or where they could feel obligated to comment on things so their children don't think those actions are quite as 'cool' or acceptable as they appear on screen. The plot is also fast-moving, and scenes switch back and forth from several venues and viewpoints, which makes the storyline relatively complex, perhaps too much so for younger viewers. I'd recommend The Social Network for older teens (15 or 16 and up) and adults.",8,2,5,3 October 2010
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta is V for Very Good
","V for Vendetta V for Vendetta takes place in the near future (2020) in London, England. After disengaging itself from a 'war America started,' terror attacks  including an horrific biological attack that killed thousands  have resulted in a totalitarian government there. Using tools ranging from strictly enforced curfews to surveillance cameras, and from 'disappearing' political activists to government-controlled news outlets, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) is firmly in control. That control is exercised, of course, for the security and good of England's citizens.A man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) disagrees. His stance against the Chancellor's government is two-fold: he hates what the government has done to him personally, and he loves freedom. In a series of violent attacks he personally orchestrates, he sets out to prove his point to the largely oblivious population.Through no real fault of her own, a young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) meets the mysterious masked V in a dark alley where V saves her virtue from a trio of government-appointed citizen informers (aptly called 'fingermen'). Employed by a government television station, Evey doesn't occupy a place of authority but is positioned quite well enough to know that the news anchors often must relay stories that they personally know to be untrue.Evey's knowledge is only further cemented when the newscasters try to pretend that some explosions the night before were the result of a planned demolition. It's also more than enough to make her fear that a visit from the state police could be targeting her. In reality, however, it's not her the police are after. It's V himself.V is at the television station this November 5 to claim responsibility for a bombing as well as to challenge the people of London to join him on the following November 5  Guy Fawkes' Day  to destroy Parliament itself. V only narrowly escapes the police who are there to arrest him, and again by accident, Evey gets involved.Meanwhile, the ongoing machinations of the Chancellor and his minions serve to show just how far a tyrant will go to hold on to power. But when the anguish of Evey's friend, Deitrich (Stephen Fry) and a woman she'll never meet (Valerie, played by Natasha Wightman) offer a heart-rending counterpoint from the other side, Evey isn't the only one whose loyalties and motivations are conflicted! Natalie Portman proved she can really act in her superlative turn in 2004's Closer. She stays at that level here. Hugo Weaving's face is never seen, but his voice alone is terrifying, poignant, and powerful by turns. The supporting cast is also very good, particularly Stephen Fry who offers up a wonderful rendering of a publicly resigned man who slowly lets his own disillusionment grow into some brave action of his own.Though much touted as being a movie from the same men who brought us the brilliant Matrix series, in reality the Wachowski brothers are responsible for the screenplay alone (they're also credited as producers). Director James McTeigue is instead behind the cameras here, and he ably brings a complicated story to life.The sets are spectacular and the effects even more so. But I maintain that it's the story itself that makes V for Vendetta as impressive as it is. I really enjoyed my movie-going experience simply from the standpoint of suspense and entertainment; but what really got to me was the view of the near future and its horrifying plausibility. Though I had a hard time divorcing the two points for myself, I can tell you that my friend's 17 year-old son and a buddy saw V for Vendetta this weekend as well, and neither has shut up about it since. They don't care anything about politics, and yet they both loved it. So did I.POLITICAL NOTES: There is literally no moment of this film that doesn't have a political impact.In the movie, political activists are watched and sometimes punished; in America today, we know that, at a minimum, many are surveilled. On screen, we see 'for your safety' extolled by government officials; today, more than a few laws, including the freedom-stealing PATRIOT Act, are based on those very notions. In the film, 'fingermen' are everywhere to report on their fellows; today, we've been encouraged to do the same, up to and including the infamous TIPS program.There are many more parallels to name, and most of them are at least as awful as the few listed above. V for Vendetta takes place in the near future, and impossible to watch the movie, as enjoyable as it is, without wondering just how 'near' that future really is. Perhaps an early warning can help us avoid the nasty fate  as well as the very violent ultimate release from that fate  depicted in the movie. And while V for Vendetta is certainly not a movie to be taken literally, there's some very real and legitimate early warning here that I personally believe should be heeded.FAMILY SUITABILITY: V for Vendetta is rated R for 'strong violence, (and) some language.' This is not a movie suitable for young children either in its overall topic or its rendering. From its opening scenes of the execution of Guy Fawkes in 1605 to the penultimate (beautifully choreographed, I might add) fight, the blood and guts are fairly graphic. In addition, everything from Shakespeare to classic movies are quoted or somehow otherwise involved, and the politics is sometimes complicated in and of itself. This is not a film for the faint of heart or those unable to understand such vocabulary or ideals. But for the rest, whether they consider V a terrorist or a freedom fighter in the end, there's so much of thought-provoking value here that I'm inclined to consider V for Vendetta required viewing.",8,7,15,19 March 2006
