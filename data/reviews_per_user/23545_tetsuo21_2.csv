Requiem for a Dream," i want to kill myself
","This is the bleakest, most depressing and intense film i have ever seen in my life. It is also one of the best. Aronofsky=genius. Pi was fantastic, if a little particular, but this is just startling. From the beginning ('WHY DO YOU MAKE ME DO THIS, MOM?') to the nightmarish finale (the little grin on her face is too much for me), i found myself being drawn further and further into this seedy underbelly of modern tragedy. Flawless performances from the entire cast, esp. Burstyn, just add to the feeling of misery that gradually envelops you as you observe more depravity and self-torture. I subjected a group of my girlfriends pals to this. Four of them left the room before the end. Not thru boredom. They just couldn't handle it. You have been warned.",10,1,2,7 October 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," a life-changing moment in cinema
","this movie is incredible! not only does it look and sound amazing, it also makes the viewer wonder if they actually exist. the questions that are posed by Kubrick and Clarke make for a film that goes beyond merely inspiring the viewer, it makes you think about EVERYTHING! like many, i first saw 2001 as a small boy, not really knowing or appreciating the masterpiece i had just witnessed. as i got older, repeat viewings became an almost weekly part of life, and the message and impact of the film grew accordingly, leading me to the point where just thinking about this film sends me into a dream-like state of wonderment. Kubrick has created something that will be discussed and criticised until we are all long gone. i just wish i could know what people will make of it in another two-thousand years.",10,1,4,7 October 2002
