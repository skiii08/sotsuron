The Ring," The Sixth Sense meets The Others
","As I read some of the comments that are posted I notice all the negative comments about character development and plot holes and not understanding the story. Did it ever occur though that perhaps the movie is exactly doing to some of the viewers what it was supposed to, baffle you.*****SPOILERS**** If some of you are having a hard time trying to understand the plot I will break it down simple for you. The little girl herself is not evil, she is a manifestation of evil. She knows what she has done and continues to do is wrong and she says she is sorry but cannot stop as this is also explained by Aiden when he informs his mother she will not stop, she cannot sleep. A lot of you wonder why Rachel lives, its not because she heard the story fully, or because the little girl touched her. No its more simple than that. The little girl has designed the tape as recordings of her mind and that is why there is no tracking #. It is simply a chain letter effect that keeps Rachel alive as is revealed in the last seen. She wonders what she did different and realizes, she made a copy and showed it to someone else. Therefore she makes her son touch the buttons to make a recording and show it to someone. In that case the someone is us at the end as it goes full screen. Also the director has hidden several ring flashes in the movie. Perhaps the most effective is a large ring in the middle of the screen that flashes for about a tenth of a second right after the horse over the boat scene. Watch carefully.Overall there have been too many in depth opinions about this movie. It is an excellent suspense film. It was not supposed to be a drama or romance film so don't try to over critic it as such. I recommend this to only those who truly believe they can handle an intense movie and will expect nothing more than a great suspense.",9,0,0,4 November 2002
