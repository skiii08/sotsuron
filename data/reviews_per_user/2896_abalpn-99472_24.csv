The Avengers," THEY'RE STILL EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES! AVENGERS...ASSEMBLE!!!
","I remember this since 2012. Seven years ago I've watched the first Avengers and I enjoyed every scene. I love the action, effects and humor of the film. Wow!

Applause to the whole cast and crew.",10,1,1,22 October 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Huge Raiders Fan
","Well, I wasn't born when this movie came out in 1981. I've watched it with my dad and the movie completely blew my mind. Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors in this franchise. I also love the musical score by John Williams and of course the theme song. I watched the film a million times. I love all the action scenes and the special effects. I wish I had a fedora hat just like Indy. I have the entire DVD collection of Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones rules!!!",10,1,2,16 July 2017
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Humorous toons and detective work. A murder mystery. I like this film and it's superb!
","I love watching cartoons whether it's from Disney or Warner Bros. I was still a baby when the film was released in June of 1988. Now I'm an adult. When I saw this film for the first time growing up, all the toons from Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures were colliding and interacting with each other. I became impressed.I love Roger Rabbit. Bob Hoskins did a great job playing Eddie Valiant and Christopher Lloyd is excellent playing Judge Doom. I liked the film's composing by Alan Silvestri. I really wish to meet Roger Rabbit at the Toontown attraction in Disneyland. There's humor and a bit of naughtiness. Watch the film and you'll laugh along with Roger Rabbit.",10,3,3,21 September 2019

I can't wait for the sequel and the upcoming MCU films.",10,8,16,18 September 2019
Batman Returns," Another Batman classic from 1992
",I enjoyed this Tim Burton film as well. Danny DeVito did an excellent performance as the Penguin. I especially like the part when Batman drives the Batmobile and takes out the Circus gang. But I also really like the fight scene where Batman fights the Circus on the street. It's almost like Batman: The Animated Series coming to life. The story was great and even darker than the first film. Batman and Batman Returns are my favorite superhero films. Ever has and ever will be.,10,0,14,11 August 2017
Home Alone," It's still a classic and holiday film to me. Well done, Chris Columbus.
",I was two years old when Home Alone came out in 1990. I grew up watching this as a kid and I still like the film to this day. Christmas is coming and I watch it whenever the holidays are coming. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious as Harry and Marv. The greatest comedy duo of the early 1990's. Kevin's traps are awesome and funny. I laugh when Harry and Marv get hit. Kevin's the smartest 8-year-old kid and he always win by beating up Harry and Marv. Everyone needed a good laugh and I'm one of them. There are touching moments and hilarious moments.,10,3,4,1 December 2019
The Terminator," Arnold's thrilling and non-stop action film
",'I'll be back.' Arnold's classic and iconic line still triumphs the entire Terminator franchise. James Cameron is a great genius. I've watched this on TV and YouTube. The action is non-stop.

The Adventures of Tintin," Great Snakes! A great animated adventure film to watch and experience!
",My siblings and I saw the film eight years ago. We liked it and enjoyed it. I loved John Williams' composing for the film. I saw some of the episodes of the Adventures of Tintin. I loved the animation and it was almost real with real lived people. Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were great geniuses with this film. Jamie Bell is excellent playing Tintin and Andy Serkis is hilarious as Captain Haddock. Daniel Craig is great as the evil Sakharine. I wanted to watch more of it and relive Tintin's adventure. There are rumors of a sequel. Loved the film! Two thumbs up from me!,10,0,0,31 December 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A great reboot for Spider-Man!
","I've watched the original trilogy. The first two reboots with Andrew Garfield were OK though. Two weeks ago, I've watched Spider-Man: Homecoming and I enjoyed it. Tom Holland did a great performance as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. This film wanted to be fresh for newer generations. I liked the opening scene in Civil War. Although in a few scenes with Ned were a bit annoying but they wanted this movie with humor. Again, I enjoyed watching it and I can't wait for Avengers: Infinity War and the next Spider-Man sequel.",10,43,79,31 July 2017

Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America's the man with a plan. Great Marvel film.
","Eight years ago, I watched Captain America: The First Avenger and I enjoyed the film. I liked the 1940's style and art. It's just like watching a serial film from the 1940's and it's something like in the Indiana Jones franchise. Chris Evans is awesome playing Captain America. Hugo Weaving is scary as the Red Skull. There were people saying that the film was not good but I know there are true Marvel fans who enjoyed viewing the film. I like the story and entertainment of this film. Alan Silvestri composed the film's music so perfect. I also liked the Winter Soldier and Civil War.",10,0,0,2 December 2019
Justice League," It's not the ultimate DC film but still awesome
","I gave this 8 out of 10 stars. My own grading scale for this film is a B+. I still like the action and the music composed by Danny Elfman. There were mixed reviews about the film but the action sequences and performances were still great. Joss Whedon screen played the film and the fans said that he shouldn't have been on board. I agreed with that. I hope the next Justice League sequel will be even better.To me, it's not the ultimate DC film but I'm not calling it bad and I still watch for the action and thrill. That's my opinion and point of view. DC is still my favorite comic book franchise.8/10 stars

Man of Steel," Greatest Superman film to see
","I've watched the original 1978 film and the others. I've waited a long time to see a remaking of another Superman film. When I watched this, the experience was epic and thrilling. I liked the action and the emotional scenes. They did a great job of designing Henry's suit and I liked the design. Amy Adams was excellent playing Lois Lane. General Zod's character was very dark and I liked it.For the upcoming DC films, I don't know what to expect and they're casting someone else to play Superman.",10,3,3,13 August 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Another non-stop action masterpiece by James Cameron
","'Hasta la vista, baby.' Another one of Arnold's classic and iconic lines. I've played Terminator 2 on SNES but I wasn't that good on it. I liked the action of a fight and chase scene. I've always liked Arnold cruising down on a motorcycle in one of the chase scenes. There is a deleted scene where the Terminator smiled and I laughed at that scene. Robert Patrick is scary and excellent as the T-1000. I liked the special effects of the T-1000. I would usually watch this again on YouTube.",10,1,1,8 October 2019
Spider-Man," This Spider-Man film from 2002 is still my favorite blockbuster
","'With great power, comes great responsibility.' From the great Cliff Robertson.Before the MCU, I've watched this in 2002 when I was fourteen. Tobey Maguire was great playing the role of Spider-Man. Willem Dafoe was brilliant and scary playing the Green Goblin. I liked his evil laugh. The Green Goblin is my favorite villain in Marvel. Kristen Dunst is beautiful as Mary Jane Watson. The film had dark moments and I liked them. Danny Elfman's composing is beyond incredible. There were some scenes that made me emotionally sad. I still liked the action. When I watched the film it was like watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series from 1994.I saw Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. The last two films were dark with Doctor Octopus and Venom. All 3 of them are my favorite trilogy by Sam Raimi. He and his brother Ted are still geniuses.",10,1,1,11 October 2019

Ghostbusters," Reitman's classic comedy and supernatural film! Who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
",I like this film. I have the DVD collection of Ghostbusters 1 and 2. I even liked the music video of Ray Parker Jr. 'He slimed me' and 'I feel so funky'. Those are my favorite lines from Bill Murray. Harold Ramis was the greatest Egon. Dan Aykroyd is great playing Ray and Ernie Hudson is the coolest as Winston. Wow. It's been 35 years since Ghostbusters debuted in the theaters.My favorite characters are Slimer and Stay Puft in 'The Real Ghostbusters'. I've watched some of the episodes on YouTube.The special effects with the ghosts are great and superb. Reitman and the whole crew knew what they were doing with the effects and the characters.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman and Superman. It's dark and I love it!
",Ben Affleck did an excellent performance playing Batman. Although Christian Bale wasn't good enough but Affleck is even better. I've watched it in the theater and I watched it on DVD. It blew my mind away. All the fighting scenes between Batman and Superman was intense. The Man of Steel versus the Dark Knight. It's nothing like I've seen before. The first two Batman films by Tim Burton is still close to my heart but this one is superb and dark. I can't wait for Justice League.,10,66,102,20 September 2017
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," One of the best films starring Harrison and Sean
",I love Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It's one of the best father and son moments in movies. The action is great and I've seen this many times. I loved every scene in this film including the chase scenes. I even liked the part when Donovan drinks the wrong grail and turning into a skeleton. It was almost like Donovan turning into a zombie. The final boss was Donovan's skeleton in Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures and I played the game many times. The special effects of Donovan decaying and turning into the skeleton was great. The part that I liked was when Indy pushes Donovan's skeleton into the wall and it crumbles into pieces. They did a great job with the effects like always. I loved the ending when Indy and the rest ride off into the sunset. It is still the greatest classic for the franchise.10/10 stars,10,2,3,27 September 2017

Marty and Doc are the greatest duo and the best of friends. Michael J. Fox was excellent playing Marty and Christopher Lloyd as Emmett Brown. Lea Thompson was cute playing Lorraine.

There were great thrills with the T-Rex and raptors. John Williams is a pure genius when he composed the soundtrack of the entire movie. Jeff Goldblum was hilarious as Ian Malcolm. Ariana Richards who played Lex got her screaming skill from the legendary Fay Wray. I saw that from behind the scenes that Wray was on set. Stan Winston was incredible at his work on setting up the dinosaurs.I did see The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3. I also viewed the first two Jurassic World films. The third Jurassic World film is coming soon.Jurassic Park. What can I say? The greatest film in 1993.",10,1,1,2 October 2019
