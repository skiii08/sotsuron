The Devil's Advocate," A movie worth to see
","Probably, this is the best Al Pacino's movie I have ever seen. I do not guess anybody can fulfill that like Al Pacino did in Devil's role. Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are also justified in their roles. Dialogues are fantastic. In fact, the whole movie is filled with superb dialogues especially by Al Pacino. You have to be very alert at last 10 minutes to grab the whole theme of the movie. Dialogues like 'Love is Overrated. Biochemically no different from eating large quantities of chocolate' exhibit the seriousness of this movie. Overall, a classic movie to watch.",Null,0,1,24 February 1999
