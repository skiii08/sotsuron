It," just stupid
","This is just a stupid movie, doesn't have good writing scenes, most of it is just random scenes that try to be creepy and scary but they are just ugly, Pennywise is loaded with too much CGI mess that he doesn't appear to be anything that feels real or alive and in the end- not scary, the movie does not explain much about Pennywise also. the bullies are extra and are the same flatted boring characthers you saw in every american highschool movie and acted the same, well... the whole movie feels like typical american highschool movie mixed with bad horror scenes, with the motif of overcoming fears.",4,0,3,17 February 2019
