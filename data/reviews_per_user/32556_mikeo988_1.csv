Marie Antoinette," Let Them Eat Cake!
","As far as I am concern, Sofia Coppola is a genius when it comes to this movie. She took a completely dead genre and made it modern and fun. I had previously thought that such a feat was impossible. With a limited amount of dialogue and gorgeous cinematography, I couldn't help be reminded of a reality show. And it is this realism that is a true art. This realism perfectly represents what life must have been like to the young queen. I just thought it was genius. For those who say it's a shallow movie clearly didn't understand the piece. The acting was also superb. Like the film itself, they just felt so real. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful as the queen, especially in the beginning when she first entered Versailles. Jason Schwartzman was hilarious in his own shy and quirky way. Rip Torn, Molly Shannon, Shirley Henderson, and Rose Byrne were supporting standouts.Spoiler: I thought one of the funniest scenes was when they were eating dinner with the French aristocrats and everyone was judging Madam Du Barry. And then out of nowhere, she burped... hilarious.",9,1,4,2 November 2006
