Skyfall," A Mixed Bag
","Not a bad bond in the least. When compared to Quantam of Solace, this Bond seems profound and phenomenal. That being said I had some issues with the flick.For one, Craig's bond get's more broody and apathetic in each movie. While some would argue that that type of Bond reflects the Flemming Bond, I compare each Bond reincarnation to previous film versions. The direction in this movie made Craig seem ruthless and cold. It would have been suited better for a Layer Cake sequel (although that would be impossible). Some of the dialogue fell flat for me, as it was awkward and felt rushed. But what was great about this Bond was the reintroduction of classic borderline cheesy fight scene's which worked very well. TL;DR: A good flick with some odd directorial choices and writing that didn't mesh with. Lot's of fun, and a great summer rental, or download, or...... -_-",7,3,6,30 June 2013
Gravity," A visual masterpiece
","*SPOILER FREE*I loved this movie.As a film and theatre student I often find myself ruining movies by being over critical of them. Not this film.What it lacks in depth of story it surely makes up for in technical and emotional prowess that I've never seen before. This is the first movie I have EVER seen, where the 3D is not only a defend-able option, but is actually necessary to get the full enjoyment of the film. 2 great things about this movie.1) It's special effects were not only seamless, but also engaged my senses in a way no movie has done before. At times it was hard to watch the screen, because I felt as if I could actually be falling towards earth, in space!2) Sandra Bullock. As an acting student I've learned how hard it is to be earnest and real when acting with a scene partner. Bullock would have been doing the majority of her acting with nothing but a green screen. And she maintained full emotional commitment the entire time. Breathtaking. TL;DRThis film is great. It couldn't be done without the tech, but that's fine. It's a movie that WILL NOT be as good at home, so go pay the extra $20 and see it in IMAX 3D!",9,5,6,14 October 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Defies EVERY expectation
","THIS is the reason I want to be an actor, why I am taking acting as my form of higher education.Everything about this film is just about perfect. The acting (THE CASTING), the direction, the writing, the cinematography. Even the length of the film sits almost exactly at the 2 hour mark.If you are like me and you were/are thinking 'how in the world did a rom-com get nominated for so many awards' you clearly haven't seen the flick.The movie is hardly funny at all (although the parts that were funny made me burst out in tears), but filled with so much emotion. Like I said before the acting in this film was amazing. I have luckily never been diagnosed with bi-polar, but I know what mental illness can be, and this was a fine example of how one can act the part without making it contrived or offencive.This isn't the best movie ever made. Depending on your tastes it may not even be the best movie of the year, but my god, it is damn good!Go see it ASAP!",9,1,3,27 January 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Nearly Perfect
","I loved every second of Wreck-It Ralph. The jokes were spot on, the gaming references were plentiful but not overbearing.The script was tight, and the overall direction, voice acting, and animation were seamless.The only reason this didn't get perfect was because at times there were some cheesy moments and lines that were painfully obvious.But then I realized, even though I went to see a 10:30 pm screening with my buddy, this was meant to be a first and foremost children's flick. And with the exception of odd lines like that I completely forgot that I wasn't the target audience, and THAT is pretty amazing.I wasn't overly shocked to see that John Lasseter was a producer in this flick!9/10 for gamers and non gamers, children and adults!",9,2,3,4 November 2012
Prometheus," The best Sci-Fi horror movie in 20 years.
","The past two decades have brought many extraordinary pieces of cinema to the world. But as technology builds and becomes more prominent, filmmakers seem less interested in creating an intellectual and pulling film. Rather today we have movies with little to no story and TONS of explosions. Science Fiction seems to be the biggest offended of this.Rant aside, I sincerely believe that Prometheus is the movie that truly bridges the generation gap of Story Telling vs. Special Effects. The movie has everything from a dynamic storyline, to interesting characters, to fantastic music and superb special effects. Prometheus (to me) is an amalgamation of the first two Alien movies. It combines Scott's original sense of suspense with Cameron's fast paced, in your face action. Immediately contradicting myself, I do believe the main issue with most people is that when they watch(ed) Prometheus, they were expecting Alien 5. It's not, It was not meant to be!The movie is not perfect, hence the 8/10 rating. But I do whole heartedly believe that the movie deserves a solid 8 based purely on the fact that it kept me interested the whole way through, and I didn't leave feeling more stupid than I already did going in!",8,4,12,19 July 2012
