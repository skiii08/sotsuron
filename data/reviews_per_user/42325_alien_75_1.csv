Vertigo," The best Hitchcock film ever!
","This is the best Hitchcock film ever, and so far, the best movie I ever seen. It's just brilliant, all of it. The script is perfect, all those twist. The firs time a saw it i tough in the middle of it that was the end, but then it gets better, and better. It's PERFECT!! The characters development is perfect, at the end you know so much about the characters, and you know what can happen, but it take your breathe out all the time.You find out things that the main character doesn't know, I know that has been used so many times in movies, but in this one is just special, it's the best thing I ever seen.",10,3,6,8 September 2008
