Sucker Punch," Invincible Chicks On 'God-Mode' Never In Any Real Danger. Very Irritating!
","Even with millions of bullets flying through the air, dozens of swords swinging & the hundreds of punches these hotties take, not one of these girls ever gets a single scratch during the battles. After the first brawl pitting the Girls Club against steam-powered Germans & ferocious shooting planes it's so painfully obvious that none of the girls will be in any real danger that the big budget special effects are just fluff & overkill. What's the point of all the bullets & bad guys if the chicks are indestructible? By the second battle it's just so irritating watching these females punch, kick, shoot, jump & slice their way through crowds of bad guys when they could have just walked & not gotten hurt. The story is clever but watching chicks that fight again & again & can't possibly be defeated is not one-tenth as interesting as watching people who can actually die in battle.",4,179,368,26 March 2011
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Fun start to Finish
","In this modern world of bad movies we have several hundred classics which made it through that are worth remembering. This is one of those films. A+ Film for ladies who want to understand their man. Boys love this film. 'Holy Grail' and 'This is Spinal Tap' and two of the most important films of this era as far as comedy. but the Grail rules for most quotes in one film. From the start it's a scene by scene extravaganza of gags, sketches and coconuts that will leave even the most hardened heart warmed with British Cheekiness. As many of you know Monty Pythons Flying Circus was a big British hit in the late 60's and early 70's before the Python troupe made their trip into film. This is their first attempt, Holy Grail and it's their best. There's not a man upon this planet who should die without knowing of Roger the Shrubber and the Knights who say Knee. There are some questionable moral dilemmas placed before Arthur and his Knights on their quest for the Grail. All in all, one of the best films to come out of the mid 70's and one of the most influential comedies of all time. A Testament to the equivalent of America's Saturday Night Live Cast, Monty Python were much more consistently funny and remained together like the Stooges.",10,1,2,11 March 2008
