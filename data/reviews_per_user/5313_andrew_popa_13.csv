Fight Club," One of the BEST movie of 1999 !!
","I love this movie ! I have seen it only once , but I will see it again. Fight Club should won an Oscar for the best Screenplay or the best Director - David Fincher. When you read the title FIGHT CLUB , you think is another silly Karate Movie, but of course is NOT. Is a smart movie directed by a master of this kinda movies -DAVID FINCHER ( who also direct Seven , The Game and Alien 3 ).This movie stars a few GOOD actors like : Brad Pitt , Edward Norton , Meat Loaf . Ok , is a litlle bit violent , but is verry original , you will never guess the ending . The movie is based on a book , and everybody must see it !",Null,0,1,19 July 2000

Shakespeare in Love," Pretty good , but not as I thought...
","When I saw that this movie won many Oscars, I was sure that this is a ROMANTIC COMEDY , a very good one , but is not , is not funny at all , I have seen better movies , I am sure that Saving Private Ryan is much better.",Null,1,2,25 July 2000
The 13th Warrior," Yeah , cool!!
","My favourite writer is Michael Crichton, and this movie is based on the book 'Eaters of the dead' by Crichton. I have seen this movie, but I have not read the book yet.The story is pretty good, and there is a lot of action, a good ride !",Null,0,0,25 July 2000
The Terminator," Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movie !

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Great , not as good as the first but GREAT !!!!
","The first one brings some cool effects , smart story and it was really scary. This one is again based on a book by Michael Crichton (My favourite writer), and THE LOST WORLD is not as scary as the first one, but it has more action. Steven Spielberg does good work once again !!!!",Null,0,0,26 July 2000
Scream 2," The best slasher movie to date !
","I am a BIG fan of Wes Craven , and this is a very good movie from him , maybe better than the original Scream.The great team is back (Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson) and is better and smarter than ever.Kevin does a good scary and funny script, this movie stars a great actress NEVE CAMPBELL as Sidney Prescott.She has to fight with a psycho ghost killer one more time , but not for the last time. Wes Craven is the master of these kinda movie, he likes to do it , that is why is so good.",Null,0,0,8 July 2000
Scream," Brings back the Slasher Movies !
","Ohooo...This movie is great.The script (by Kevin Williamson) is so scary , funny, thrilling in the same time. The director Wes Craven is a master of this kinda movies, and I must say that SCREAM is his best work to date.Wes had a smart part in this movie ( the one is Freddy Kruger costume ).The end is perfect , the killer is smart  , and the heroine (Neve Campbell)is a next Lee Curtis (from Halloween).You don't need to like horror movies to see this one,It will make you laugh and it will make you SCREAM.",Null,0,0,7 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Pretty good ...
","I like this movie , but is not as good as I thought , is not a horror , is not even a thriller , you must see it to say what it is. Bruce Willis play really good here , I love it , he is a very good actor and I like him for many years.The story of the movie is a litlle bit interesting and the movie is...pretty good..",Null,0,0,20 July 2000
