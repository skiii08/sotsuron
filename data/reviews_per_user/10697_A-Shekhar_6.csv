Ford v Ferrari," 2Hrs 30mins Long - I honestly didn't want to watch this movie
","But boy am I glad I watched it. I did not give it a 10/10 out of impulse, this movies deserves an off the scale rating - 2:30 - not one minute was boring. Loved it!!!",10,2,3,29 December 2019
Green Room," Watch only if you're into movies like Breathe, Hush, You're Next, Vacancy
","Looking at the vast differences in how people are rating this movie, It's fair to say that this movie isn't for everybody.",7,0,1,16 May 2020
Aquaman," Over 80% on IMDB gave this movie above 5 stars
","Over 80% on IMDB gave this movie above 5 stars so I'm glad that this movie was able to make that many people happy but this movie was in my opinion made for the kids as superhero movies really was meant to be however, with the era of Marvel and it's absolute brilliance in making even the most unlikeliest of heroes such as Iron-Man, Captain America....ANT-MAN!!! as popular superheroes as Superman, Batman and Spider-man - this movie was below average - horrible shiny colorful suits - continuity errors, immensely predictable and done to death with story line, childish humor, high pitched noisy sound almost throughout the entire movie - the production, the script and the direction all seemed lazy. But like I said, I'm happy that at least others liked it.",3,0,3,6 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," I waited long to write this review but
","I kind of couldn't like it better than the infinity war at first but now that I keep finding myself going back to watch their time jump scenes and watching the final battle scenes over and over and over again, I realized something... infinity war started with a bang - Yes, Loki dies, Thor and Hulk we powerless but cut to Dr. Strange and Wong - casually going out to as happy friends before Hulk shows up - Cut to Tony - Strolling around with Pepper discussing the wedding, Peter Parker on a school bus with his friends - Scarlett and Vision enjoying freedom - You get the point - Infinity War was about the Avengers regrouping which is why the theme of the movie was bright and why we all loved it so much but Endgame was about reclaiming which is why, the dreaded dark theme in the movie makes us feel so bad - our favorite superheroes defeated and which is why, I find myself looking for scenes after they get back together in their final attempt to undo what has been done and despite what the haters say here, that final battle will remain the biggest moment in cinematic history!",10,1,5,8 May 2020
A Quiet Place," 5 only because it was Intense but definitely not an 8
","1) The husband was carrying the sick kid, the wife followed the husband and had a deaf girl and a 5 - 6 year old walking behind them???2) 6 months after the creatures and only 3 months after their youngest had been slaughtered and eaten by the creatures in front of them, they either (a) Planned to have a baby which was obviously a dumb idea OR (b) had unprotected sex which is equally dumb especially when condoms are now free and they make frequent trips to the drug store3) When your very life depends on being quiet, you don't just pull a sack full of stuff that's stuck on the stairs because the force could trip you and you could fall Good concept, good direction too many plot holes!",4,1,3,23 May 2018
The Purge," You know, If I had this family, I'd purge on them myself!
","I wanted to kill the daughter the son and later, the wife as well ... who the hell thought these characters were repeatable or someone the audience could sympathize with??",4,1,2,23 July 2018
