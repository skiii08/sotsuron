Requiem for a Dream," Incredible movie
","People make the mistake of chalking up 'Requiem for a Dream' as a drug movie.  It is a movie about different forms of addiction.  Addiction to television, drugs, hope, etc.  One of my favorite movies of all time. Excellent music too.  I am going to use some comparisons here. I hope I do this movie justice.It is relentless like 'Bowling for Columbine.'  It definitely is an assault on the eyes, ears and mind.It is visually stylistic, like 'Fight Club.'  The visual effects are always appropriate and effective.It is very un-Hollywood like 'Memento.'  Very dark and edgy.
The music is sometimes very emotional and beautiful, sometimes very cold and harsh.  Think 'Run Lola Run' meets 'The Piano.'Once again, this is an incredible movie.",10,0,0,15 February 2003
Closer," Pretty good, not great
","I am a fan of movies like Welcome to the Dollhouse, In The Company of Men, Friends & Neighbors, Happiness, etc. I often like movies that show some of the ugliness that human beings possess (I know that I am in the minority on that) and that is what I like about Closer. Relationships can be quite pathetic, and this movie explores that. I'd say that, for better and worse, Closer is a slicker, more poetic and less gritty companion to the aforementioned movies.Reading some of the reviews here, I think Julia Roberts and Jude Law drew in some people looking for Pretty Woman II or something. Trust me, there is nothing pretty about this movie. Personally, I found the language and sexuality extremely inoffensive.",8,1,2,11 December 2004
Spider-Man," Another generic comic book movie
","If you have seen any mediocre comic book movies (aren't most of them mediocre, except for Batman?) you will surely have no need to see this movie.  It is exactly the same.  Not awful.  Not good.  Nothing new.  No surprises.  If you have seen every movie on the AFI 100 or the IMDB top 100, MAYBE you have an excuse to see Spiderman.",4,1,2,2 March 2003
Moulin Rouge!," I love music and movies. This movie is annoying.
","This movie equivalent of a Las Vegas show...  it aims to be a crowd pleaser with it musical medley of greatest hits...  it seeks to overwhelm you with gaudy sets and over acting... it is not for me.  If your idea of good music is a wedding band or an Elvis impersonator, this movie is for you.  If you like visual stimulation with little substance, this movie is for you.If you like the kind of movies where actors cross their eyes before they pass out, this movie is for you.This movie is not for me.",5,0,2,28 April 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Lots of action, not much substance
","The original Matrix was a good sci-fi action movie, despite the predictably stiff acting we have all come to expect from Keanu Reeves.  It seems like this time around, everyone involved wants to give you 'more.'  You like Mr. Smith in the original?  Well now you have 100 of him.  You liked the slow motion, 3D effects in the original?  Well, now you get to see that stuff 10 times as much.  You liked the fight sequences?  Now there are twice as many and they are all three times longer. The Matrix was a much better than most generic action movies (see Vin Diesel) because there was an interesting and intelligent story.  The makers of The Matrix Reloaded forgot that. Definitely a disappointment. 6/10",6,0,0,24 May 2003
The Green Mile," For people who haven't seen it...
","I thought this movie was great (9/10) BUT I can see people not liking it for the following reasons:   1.  It is very long. 2.  It has some 'supernatural' elements to it. 3.  It takes place on death row, so there are some execution scenes that are fairly extreme.I see that some people have complained that this movie is sappy. Personally, I think there is plenty of darkness in this movie that keeps it from being sappy. All in all, I'd say it is like Shawshank Redemption meets the television show 'Amazing Stories.'",9,0,2,19 October 2003
