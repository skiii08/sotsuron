Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Could've been better....
","I'm kind of surprised to see people saying this Vol.2 was better than Vol.1. I thought part one got a lil over the top with the fight scenes (especially with the Crazy 88's) but it was still tolerable and full of surprises. Vol. 1 moved a lot better (as far as the story)and was far more entertaining.Vol. 2 totally brought down Vol.1. Its hard to believe this is the continuation of Vol.1. There was entirely too much dialouge and QT tried to give us a better feel for the characters but it ended being very boring. I thought one of the best things about Bill in Vol. 1 was his mystery. We didn't know too much about him but we knew enough to know he was one bad mofo. In Vol. 2, all that went down the drain. He seemed very mild, vulnerable and not even capable of doing the things he did. Same thing with the Bride.Also, Uma's character just didn't have the same drive she did in the first one. The list was now non-existent as well. Everything just seemed to be in slow motion as it was half way thru the movie and nothing had really happened except the Bride being buried underground.This movie had its moments, (the tomb scene, Daryl's and Umas fight scene, and the training sequence) but other than that, the movie offered us flat dialogue. It seems like QT lost his touch for interesting and good dialogue because for the first time ever, i was bored during a QT film.
Vol.1 was just so much fun and exciting. It had a good story and everything was perfectly paced. It seems like to me that QT had to compromise and added unnecessary dialogue and scenes to fill in time to be able to make this a complete film (time wise). I think he easily could've released this project as one movie by editing half of vol. 2.",Null,3,7,22 April 2004
Erin Brockovich," Good
","I actually bought this movie for my fiance and I neglected to watch it. It didn't catch my attention. So last night, after looking at my DVD collection, Erin Brokovich was the only I hadn't seen. I popped it in and it was surprisinly satisfying.It was nicely directed and the story, although a little too long, was easy to understand and follow. I don't believe Julia Roberts deserved an Oscar for this, (and probably not even a nomination) but she played her part well. Don't get me wrong, I like Julia a lot but this part was in one way Oscar worthy. At times, I wasn't convinced with her demeanor as she spewed out rude comments. Overall, this was a good movie. The only thing I didn't like was that the director didn't really define the time in this movie. It looks like we are watching Julia day to day and next to you know, a month has passed. Like when she has supposedly been gone for a week, we don't sense that. Especially when she returns and the only thing she has to offer ED is the proof of the contamination of the water which we saw her get in ONE DAY. Other than that, this was a good movie. I give it 7/10.",Null,0,0,17 April 2002
The Others," Not original but good
","The Others was one of those movies you really don't know what its about but its still appealing and interesting to you. I must admit the movie had many scary moments but unfortunately they weren't always what they seemed to be. I really enjoyed the story and the way the movie unfolded. The more it unfolded, the scarier and the more interesting it got.The acting in this movie was very good as Nicole Kidman once again delivered a superb performance. There is no one way to describe this movie other than dark and interesting. I recommend the Others for its good story, acting, and just to see that old lady say `But I am your daughter'. As for the movie's surprise endingÂ…lets just say its been done by 'others'. quik_123 gives it a 2 out of 3.",8,0,0,17 September 2001
Final Destination 2," WAY better than i expected
","Me and my fiance couldn't decide which movie to watch and we decided on Final Destination 2. I wasn't too thrilled but I ended up enjoying the movie very much. It was a good sequel. I don't remember the first one too much but this was good. The death sequences were the best. Overall, good movie. I recommened it. Good date movie.",9,0,0,11 February 2003
Hellboy," Dissapointing
","A few people had mentioned this movie before it came out and reassured me it would be good...but it was the opposite. It started out fairly interesting but it soon started to get more and more boring with every fight scene. I mean, by the time its time for him to fight the final monster, you're already had enough. Even the director seemed to feel the same way as the last fight scene seemed very rushed and irrelevant. And Hellboy's continious 'humor/cracks' eventually got very repetitive to the point where you know he's going to try and say a corny line every 5 mins. I don't recommened this movie at all and it seems the only people that actually enjoyed it were die-hard Hellboy fans who probably would praise the movie regardless of anything.",5,0,2,6 April 2004
Kingpin," Classic Comedy
","This has got to be one of the funniest movies made in a long time. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid make an funny odd couple in this original comedy. There were enough laughs in this to make my stomach hurt! And lets not forget the uncanny Bill Murray. His dry humour is like no other. He alone at times stole the movie portraying his character, Ernie McCracken. I cannot begin to describe how funny he was in this movie. With the combination of slap stick and witty gags, this movie is guaranteed to be a favorite for any one who loves a good comedy. And just to let you know, this is not one of those lame slap stick, idiotic comedies that do anything for a laugh. This movie actually has an original plot and creative and funny comedy.This truly matches up with other comedies such as 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Something about Marry'..also by the Farreli Bros. I give this 10/10.",10,2,5,15 April 2002
