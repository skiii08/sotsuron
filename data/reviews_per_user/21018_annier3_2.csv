Changeling," Another enjoyable Eastwood film
","Eastwood is a very talented movie maker. The film looks beautiful and the music is also beautiful. Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie detracts from the film by looking more like a glamorous 1920's Hollywood star than a mother who is living out her worst nightmare. I'm not a fan of Ms. Jolie, but her performance in the movie is not bad - it just seems more attention was given to her lipstick than to her acting. Both of the actresses mentioned - Hilary Swank & Reese Witherspoon - as lobbying for the part would have brought more substance to the part. Shame on Ron Howard for wanting Ms. Jolie because her look was more suited to the period. Hasn't Ms. Swank proved she's a chameleon when it comes to her looks - and Ms. Witherspoon pulled off transforming herself into June Carter! I agree with another poster who after researching the story of Walter Collins was less enthralled with the movie. Overall, though, it is a beautifully made film as are most films directed by Mr. Eastwood.",8,1,3,22 November 2009
The Ugly Truth," big disappointment
","Love Gerard Butler, but don't waste your time with this one. It goes for cheap, crude jokes and has very little romance. The story-line is weak and by the end you're left wondering what the two leads could possibly see in each other, because that is never more than hinted at in the story-line. Never a big fan of Ms. Heigl, I did not think her bad in 27 Dresses. To be fair, her performance in The Ugly Truth may be more a case of bad writing than bad acting. There doesn't seem to be any chemistry between her and Mr. Butler, which also hurts the movie. The ending is also one of the worst endings to a movie that I've ever seen. I hope that Mr.Butler will be more discerning in future roles. I know that I'll be less likely to watch a movie solely because he's in it.",3,4,8,15 November 2009
