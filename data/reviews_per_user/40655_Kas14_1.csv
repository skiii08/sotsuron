Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good film if you want to be bored to death
","I finally got round to watching Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides last week. I personally had never been a fan of the franchise, but my sister dragged me along with her to watch it.Now, the past three films of Pirates were enjoyable to watch, they were forgettable yet enjoyable. Sadly, the same cannot be said for On Stranger Tides.This film drags on at such a sluggish pace I literally almost fell asleep around 30 minutes through, and if it hadn't been for my contacts lenses I probably would have fallen asleep & be done with the whole thing.Not even Johnny Depp's impeccable performance as Captain Jack Sparrow could save this movie from being a shipwreck.Only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the little romance between Philip ( Sam Claflin ) and Syrena ( Astrid Berges-Frisbey ), they certainly had more chemistry than Johnny Depp & Penelope Cruz's forced partnership which was to be frank, simply painful to watch. Also, the last 20 minutes wasn't too bad; it was actually mildy entertaining, at least it managed to wake me up a bit. Syrena's appearance was the best thing throughout Pirates, as she gave something fresh to a tired franchise.All in all, I think the ship of this franchise has long sailed, and I sincerely hope they don't make another one, lest they churn out an even worse monstrosity than this one.",2,0,0,6 June 2011
