Your Name.," Lifechanging!
","Well,i can not use any Emotional Word to Describe This Anime and I do not Want My Review to be The Best. But Honestly This Anime Changed My Entire Life, Yeah Maybe Some Of you are Saying That : Yeah this Anime is Great, But it is not that good to Change Someones Life. But Let Me Tell You The Story of my Life Then You Can Judge me.I Was born 15 years Ago in Iran. I had a Difficult Childhood,I Mean Emotionally. In That Rough Time I Learned Nobody Cares For me, Even my parents. And Since My Parents were Religious, So I Learned That There is no One for me in this World, So I Have to Be with God To Find The Real Peace.I Was Growing with This Attitude That God is The Final Peace. But Last Summer Things Became Tough For me, And Frankly I Could not Find The Inner Peace, so One Day, Out of nowhere, I Thought Suicide Is The Best Way To Find That Final Peace. Well Thinking Of Suicide Was Kind Of Sweet. But One Day I was In Imdb website that i Saw a News About Your Name. Everybody suggested This Anime, And said This is great and you have to watch it.Well First I Thought it's like Other Animes that Finally Two People Love Each Other and That's it. But Frankly I Believed That There is a Soul Mate For Everyone but Mostly They Do not Find Each other.Anyway, I Thought maybe it,s good for my soul and it can Heal My Heart. Then I Downloaded it and started to watch it. When i Finished watching it, i was totally a Different human. there was a Hope in My Heart That Says: You will Find Your Soul Mate, Be sure. and The Strange Part is I Found Her, I Found My Soul Mate. Yeah That,s True, one Day I Was Thinking About Suicide Now I'm Thinking How Can i Marry her and Live For Her. And Also Exactly Like This Anime, When Something Happens For Her, I Quickly understand That. Yeah That,s The Power Of Real Love.I know i talked A lot and maybe My Review has mistakes, But It Was My Duty To Write This Review, And At The End, if Someone didn't find His or Her Soul mate, No Problem you Will Find It.",10,1,3,1 August 2018
