",The people in this film seemed very real to me. I could honestly say Yes I have been in stressful situations with little sleep with people just like the people in Blair Witch Project.  People can and do act like this. People use cam corders much like our students.  However the film did not scare in the least.  I wanted it to scare me like Jaws or Alien or The Shining but instead it seemed more like a MST 3k Movie. If I were you I would wait for it at the local video store.,5,0,3,20 August 1999
