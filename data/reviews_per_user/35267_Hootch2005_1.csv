Requiem for a Dream," Dark & unforgettable...
","I wasn't ready.The first time I watched this movie I was completely transfixed. When it was finally over the whole theatre was blown away. Only after a short time after the credits was everyone ready to get up and walk out. That was 4 years ago - and since then I have not been able to forget this film, and probably never will. It is truly the most heartbreaking film I have ever had the pain to witness.I am glad I watched this movie, though it will leave an impression on you for a long time. Never has a film so deeply, so painfully, and penetratingly etched itself into my memory. The music is what really makes this movie go over the top - it shines. The theme is perfect for the plot. It made me feel sad, longing, horrified, wistful...the music and direction is the simply the best I have ever seen.Ellen Burstyn gives a performance that shook me for a long time - her acting is outstanding, her portrayal of an insecure, lonely, aging mother is the best in the film. I was on a precipice between wanting to empathsize with her, to being disgusted with her and her own and/or drug-induced delusions. It was thrilling, but painfully exquisite seeing for myself what REAL insanity is.So much has been said of being ready before you watch it, and they are right. The second time, I had to mentally prepare myself. If you haven't seen this film, go out and watch it now.",10,0,1,28 November 2004
