The Blair Witch Project," Not what I expected
","I was really hoping for this movie to terrify me, and since I wanted it to so badly, it was a bore.  I understood the plot and it wasn't a HORRIBLE movie, but I just expecting it too be better!  Also, I liked how it was filmed by a 'teenager' but It was too bouncy and made me sick to my stomach. But It wasn't a bad movie, just not very scary!",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Unbelievable
",This movie was a refreshing breeze in the midst of the summer horror rage. Unlike much of its competition this movie actually had a thought-provoking plot as well as some seriously eerie special effects!  The ending was unexpected and unpredictable!  I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something different!,10,0,0,7 August 1999
