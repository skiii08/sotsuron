The Blair Witch Project," So gosh darn original!
","This movie had such an original concept.  I gave it a 9.  It would have received a ten from me had it not been for the fact that it seemed to have some parts that just seemed not so believable--this is a 'true' story, after all, isn't it?  Also, whatshername's voice screaming 'what the f--- is that!?' got very irritating.Being someone interested in cameras and stuff, I found myself more interested in the 16 mm they carried throughout the film.  But still, I thought that it was thoroughly enjoyable, being the first horror movie I ever bothered to see.  The format it was done in, they way it was filmed, and the true fear of the actors was beautiful.  SPOILER!!!!  WARNING!!!!  A SORT OF SPOILER AHEAD!!!Although I wanted to not be scared by the movie, and I wasn't at first, I can't wait till school starts so I won't be home alone all day.  The final scene in the house with all the hand prints is just too creepy.  I'm going to build a bunch of those little stick people and hang them up at my local Movie Gallery when the video is out.  ONE THING:::I have heard something about a sequel and a spinoff show...if this is true....sad and not a good idea.  The concept was beautiful mostly for its originality and how it was pulled off.  Leave it alone.  Don't beat it and squeeze it until the sour part comes out.  Overall....really great!",9,1,2,12 August 1999
