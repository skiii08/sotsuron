The Rock," If this isn't a 10.0, then I don't know what is
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my 24 years on Earth. As a Polish immigrant, I've been exposed to a lot of Polish, American, English, and Indian movies. Yet, there are very few that come even remotely close to The Rock. The expert acting, directing, and screening make this movie a 10.0 in my book without any doubt! Sean Connery (who I'm sorry to say is starting to age; but, we do miss you Sean!!!) gives an amazing performance and so does Nicholas Cage! I don't want to spoil the movie for you, but whether you like action, drama, romance, or any other major category... trust me, you'll enjoy this movie! Also... as a Johns Hopkins University graduate, I'm pleased to see that the movie recognized the school by stating that Nicholas Cage's character graduated from Hopkins! Go see this movie and you won't regret it! Enjoy :o)",10,2,3,19 August 2006
The Italian Job," An amazing movie for the dateless computer geek
","'The Napster', or Seth Green, in this movie is awesome!!! If you're like me, you'll love the scene at the CATV parking lot where Handsome Rob goes to talk to a girl and The Napster just watches him make the moves. He also does a funny-as-all dialog of what the two of them are talking about. Soooo funny! Thumbs up!!! The DELL laptop also made a good impression on me. As far as all the hacks go, they're pretty unbelievable and wouldn't happen in real life. But, the whole story behind 'Napster' was definitely believable!I didn't do the research to see if it was true or not, but it was awesome! And, no... Napster was NOT named for the creator's nappy hair, but because the TRUE creator of it was napping :o)",10,2,7,12 July 2004
