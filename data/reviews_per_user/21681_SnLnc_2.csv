Alien 3," Hated it.
","This has got to be the most disappointing Alien movie of them all. This first one was good, the second one was OK, the last one was about as good as the first, but the third was absolutely awful.  I liked all of the other films, but this one was just not the same.The other three films had a very creepy environment to them and depended on suspense to scare you.  The third one was not at all suspenseful and the only thing scary about 'AlienÂ³' was that it actually appealed to people.This movie had lots of grotesque scenes which were not needed to make the movie's point.  For instance, who wants to see or hear a little girls chest ripped open to search for an alien?  And who wants to see an alien jump out of a dog's stomach?I suppose you should see this movie if you liked the other films.  The only reason I say this is because it makes the series complete.  You have to be able to say you saw the entire Alien series.",5,1,3,23 February 2000
Scream 2," It was okay.
","I thought that 'Scream 2' had some good points and some bad points.  Some parts were better than the original 'Scream' and some were not.  I cannot say that I liked this film better or worse than the first one, but I can define some of the points I liked and disliked.First of all, I liked that this movie had more of a plot to it.  The original just kind of went along without much of a story, but the killer(s) in this movie actually had a real motive.   It was not as graphic as the original 'Scream.'I did not like this movie because it was not as scary as the first.  It tried to copy some of the original scares, but everybody was used to them already.  They tried to make the beginning better, but it did not have as much of an effect on people.All in all, I liked this movie.  If you were a fan of the first movie, and even if you were not, I recommend renting it.  You should see the first movie first, because it goes back and the mystery has to do with the original killings.  Most people did not like it as well, but I still recommend renting it.",9,0,0,24 February 2000
