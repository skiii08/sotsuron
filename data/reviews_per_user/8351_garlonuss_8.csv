The Incredible Hulk," A More Perfect Hulk
","Action packed and kinetic. This one maintains a better pace than the first one. The first attempt tried to be very cerebral and focus on the inner workings of the characters, forgetting to put in some real action. Here, that has been rectified.The action is very well done and the effects of the Hulk character are about as realistic as you could expect a giant green man to appear.However, a couple of the fight scenes -- particularly the last one between the Hulk and the Abomination -- are filmed a little too close to really be able to easily follow the action.Other than that, this one is great. Here's hoping Marvel moves forward with the same love of their characters as they produce their own movies.",8,2,4,30 June 2008
Star Trek," One Trek to Rule Them All
","Absolutely stunning! Whether you are a Trek fan or not, this is a great and exciting thrill ride for all. You don't need to know how warp drive works or what makes a photon torpedo go 'BOOM'! You barely even need to know who Kirk is at all. (Of course it's hard to imagine being alive today and not having heard of him.) Knowledge of Trek Canon only enhances the experience of this movie. It is not necessary. I repeat, it is not necessary for you to know anything about Star Trek to enjoy this movie.JJ Abrams and his production team have simply made a great action adventure movie that happens to be set in the Star Trek universe.The effects are top notch, making you actually feel like they filmed these scenes in space, and the action is very engaging, but more importantly, the character moments give us wonderful glimpses into the people who will eventually form one of the most beloved crews of all time. Top notch performances from all and plenty of humor.",9,4,13,8 May 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A wonderful slice of Hellboy
","IF you liked the first one, this is right up your alley.I say that mainly because the darker tone, the occult nature and the unusual imagery do have a tendency to put some movie-goers off. But if you simply want to see a movie about a demon who was raised by humans to fight evil, this is a great movie for you.Guillermo del Toro's direction style is very kinetic and flowing. This helps keep the pace of the movie going, keeping it from feeling like it is dragging. The scenes flow very nicely from one to the next (which is also done very nicely with some creative wipes and overlaps).The real draw for this film, however, is Hellboy and the team that has been provided for him. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is nothing short of perfect in creating an acerbic, yet ultimately lovable (as well as loving) character. He has a wry humor about him that makes the Hellboy character something that we can all relate to. We've all had times when we feel under appreciated. We've all felt like the unwelcome outsider. Yet despite all of the inducements that he has to give up defending these humans, he continues to do it because that is what his 'father' taught him to do.Of course Abe and Liz are here as well, and Doug Jones and Selma Blair each do a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. But this is not their movie. It is interesting, however, to see one of the story elements of the first movie get turned around to portray the other side of it in this one when the team encounters the angel of death.In short, as I said above, if you liked the first one, this is just your kind of movie. I look forward to seeing what del Toro has in mind for the third movie. (Of course, we'll have to wait for him to finish 'The Hobbit' first.)",8,1,4,12 July 2008
Hellboy," An amazing spectacle
","This movie is a fun watch, but mainly because of Ron Perlman. The action is well done and the story is great, but Perlman makes the character of Hellboy (a demon raised by 'the good guys') just amazingly human, with a wry sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find anyone anywhere who could do this character as well as Perlman, let alone better. The physicality seems to have been tailor made to fit Perlman's features and the delivery of the lines is just so understatedly comedic that there are few who could pull it off at all.Of course, there are a couple times when the special effects are a little weaker than you would hope, but it doesn't detract from the movie as a whole. For instance, in the final battle scene, there are a couple shots where the Hellboy character clearly appears to be GC. But the fight moves so fast that you don't have much time to focus on those shots before something else amazing happens.See it. Love it.",8,10,11,12 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Like a bat outa luck
","Amazing. The followup to 2005s Batman Begins satisfies in just about every way. If you liked the action of the first one, this one has action in spades. If you liked the mystery, this one is one puzzler after another. If you liked the gadgets, they're all back with a few new surprises.The big draw here, however, is the dance between Batman, Harvey Dent and the Joker. Ledger is getting very deserved recognition for his work creating the character of the Joker in this movie. However it is just as interesting to watch the gradual descent that Harvey Dent takes as he eventually becomes the infamous Two-Face. (And that's to say nothing about the great work they did to create Two-Face's horrific face.) Several sections are a bit loud, though, which can become a bit of an assault on the senses at times. And there are those who will be put off by the replacement of Katie Holms for Maggie Gyllenhaal. However, these things are worth enduring if for no other reason than to see Batman in action against such an anarchical foe.Even the 2 1/2 hour running time isn't terribly bad. I won't say it flies by. But you never feel like the movie is dragging. The pacing is kept up and there isn't really anything that could be cut from the show. It keeps you in the movie the whole time, and you just keep wanting to see more.One thing to remember, though. is that this movie is also much darker than the first one. At the showing I attended, several parents took their children to see the show. This is definitely not a movie for young children.",9,1,4,19 July 2008
Alice in Wonderland," Alice in the Palace
","It's definitely one of the more commercially marketable Tim Burton movies, which may be a result of doing it with Disney. But there are a few little drawbacks for me. I like Mia Wasikowska as Alice in general, but there are a few times when she didn't seem to be emoting quite enough. She seems to act out the gravity of her situation well enough, in general, but, for instance, in the scene where she finds the small door and keeps getting big and small until she can get through the door, it simply felt like she was doing the actions because the script told her to. I may have been expecting too much, but it seemed like she was just going through the steps.Also, the 3D aspect feels a bit inconsistent. At times, there are some nicely impressive shots, but at other times it doesn't seem all that different from a 2D film. I had heard that Tim Burton shot the film with a standard camera and then had the footage processed into 3D (sort of like what they did with the Nightmare Before Christmas 3D) so that may have made me more critical when I watched it and maybe I'm being a bit too harsh, but there it is.Other than those issues, the visual aspect of the movie is actually quite creative, inventive, ... um ... made-up-I've, and ... Tim-Burton-I've. Don't expect the original Alice story. (Either one, since many people are content to forget that the Tweedles are actually from 'Through the Looking-Glass', not 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'.) Tim Burton has restructured the story since he felt--and rightly so--that Alice's stories are more a series of short encounters rather than one overarching story. The restructured story now ties it all into one meaningful adventure, and I think it works quite well.On the whole, not my favorite Burton, but it's a good movie and I feel comfortable recommending it. (Though unless you feel you really have to see it in 3D, you should probably save your money and see the 2D version as it doesn't really take full advantage of the possibilities of the 3D format.)",7,1,7,5 March 2010
WALLÂ·E," It's WALL-E With the Win!!
","This is an amazing movie. Despite the fact that a large portion of the film is spent without any dialogue at all, you never really feel that you are missing out on any of the story. The animators do such a great job breathing life into this little lunch box on wheels that you feel you can actually tell what he is thinking at all times.The animation and rendering quality of the movie are just phenomenal. Very realistic aside from the decidedly cartoonish human characters. But that's just icing on the cake. Eye candy that draws you in for the full meal that the story puts forth.There is a definite message here of caring for the earth and not letting technology taking over our lives, but you will find yourself simply longing for more story between Eve and Wall-e. Their relationship evolves slowly and realistically, with a rather heart wrenching scene toward the end.Go see it. It's just a wonderful story that anyone can enjoy.",10,1,4,1 July 2008
Iron Man," Iron Man strikes Gold
","I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.",9,7,11,5 May 2008
