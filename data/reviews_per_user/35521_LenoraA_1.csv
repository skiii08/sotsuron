Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why all the hype?
","I waited in line for 1-1/2 hours to see 'The Movie of the Decade', and boy was I disappointed.  This film lacks the excitement and imagination of the originals.  Of course there were special effects galore, but what about character development?  What about a cohesive plot?  In this case, I guess the critics WERE right!  But I am sure all the 'hard core' fans will say this is good, no matter what they really think.  My advice is to wait a week or two, when word gets out you won't have to wait in line like I did!",Null,0,1,23 May 1999
