The Benchwarmers," Lights, Boogers, toots ACTION.....
","This movie delivered the gross goods. Lots of gross body humor. It was fun and the movie was geared toward the younger crowd I think. I am a huge Spade fan so I saw it on an afternoon. It had laughs. Napolean the MORMON Dynamite was in it and was a complete idiot but that's the idea. The highlight of the movie was when they were all at the mansion and number seven made a skittles sandwich. There were many other good scenes. I will never eat pot roast again. I repeat, I will NEVER eat that stuff again. That little nerd had a funny accent by the way. The cameo by Rob Zombie was excellent and the soundtrack was amazing. There were many odd lines in this movie and the feel good aspect to this movie will leave you feeling great after seeing THE BENCHWARMERS.",10,2,4,17 April 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Delivered the TARENTINO goods!
","This movie had less drama than the first one interms of BLOOD spurting out of the necks.  The characters were far more developed in this one and we were able to see a more HUMAN character in Uma's character.  Quentin is sure obsessed with Uma.  However, the bride is the ROLE that UMA WAS BORN FOR!!! As for David Carradine, this is his BEST ACTING EVER!!!  I feel that it's time for John Travolta to MOVE OVER and let DAVID CARRADINE take over!!! Quentin has a way of doing that.  The movie was good.  Darrel Hanna had a great part in this flick as the good looking BLONDE girl.  The delivered the GOODS as a no nonsense asassin.  I look forward to the next installment of KILL BILL in which filming does not start unti I am an old man.  Also, the character of the dude in the trailer was great.  I loved that snake!!  And what about Mr. White Eye Brows?  He is COOL!!",Null,0,1,19 April 2004
Walk the Line," He is the Man in Black....
","There is a new hero in town, and his name is Johnny Cash! Joaquin Phoenix was hand picked by the man in black to PLAY HIM. Joaquin Phoenix did more than deliver the goods, he delivered them SPECIAL DELIVERY! Yes, this movie, thanks to Joaquin Phoenix, is going alongside some of the greats such as Ray, Roadhouse and Schindler's List...as one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Do not expect Joaquin Phoenix to be the same as he was in Signs or Gladiator. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash. The Man in Black wore black to absorb all the sorrow in the world and then express it in his songs, much like 50 Cent does. I was astonished at how much Joaquin Phoenix sounded like John and how the incredible Reese Whitherfork sounded like JUNE CARTER CASH. I wonder if Willy Nelson saw this yet? You can forget the likes of that Austrailian dude, it's Joaquin Phoenix, as Johnny Cash, who STOLE THE SHOW. Can you say Oscar ANYBODY? And I am not talking about my Shihtzu. I am predicting that Joaquin Phoenix will SWEEP the academy, and not with a broom either. I remember me and my Dad singing 'A Boy Named Sue' many a time while driving on the lonely roads of New Mexico in the early 80s. Thank you Joaquin Phoenix, for making a great movie.",10,2,9,19 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Thank you Borat! We need you now more than ever!
","I saw Borat last night with Jake over at some casino here in Las Vegas. It was a good movie. This Borat guy looks Islamic and wears a cheap suit and travels with some fat man who looks just despicable. The movie is funny. There was this one scene where Borat is picked up by some college guys in an RV. However, they never really tell you who is driving the RV but they just show these three guys partying extremely hard with beer and whiskey. Who was driving? Where was the RV going? We will never truly know this. However, there were many gay overtones. Borat goes to a gay rally and kisses men and then is handed a device. In the highlight of the movie, he gets into a fight with his fat and disgusting producer who is very very ugly. It's a naked fight and the fat man ends up sitting on Borat's face. You can see the male body parts extremely vividly and it was a bit over the top. At one point they are in the elevator and the fat man is naked just standing there and I swear to god he had female breasts. Also, Borat really hates Jews which was a bit strange but funny. He also thought his producer was trying to dress up as Adolf Hitler instead of the fat guy from Laurel and Hardy. I liked Borat though and hope to learn one day if this movie was staged in parts or real!",10,5,19,5 November 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," I was not amused nor entertained....
","I went to this movie with high hopes. As it turns out, this movie was nothing more than pure drivel. It was simply drivel. Everybody says that this was the best of the two movies but I found myself frequently looking at my watch! Professor James Moriarty was very much a bore. When he was hidden in the room and talking from behind a curtain, Professor James Moriarty was a hopeful as an evil doer. Then he pulls the curtain back and he's simply a professor. I was hoping that he would at least have a scar or something. But there is nothing sinister about Professor James Moriarty. Now let's talk about Sherlock. For whatever reason, he is unable to be defeated in any kind of a fight. He has a 'disorder' in which he can predict the outcome by observing things. Professor James Moriarty was just smart and good at chess. But Sherlock has this weird sense of humor in which he feels compelled to crack a joke every time he opens his pipe filled mouth. He even jokes around between punches in a fight. When he talks to Dr. Watson he jokes around and poor Watson is a cheap imitation of the strait man from the Three Stooges. Yes, you read that right - he's a strait man. As for Professor James Moriarty and his plot to take over the world by killing somebody in the mansion overlooking the water fall in the mountain, I have no idea. This plot was far to complicated. As let's not even talk about the gypsy people and their role. Oh, and what is the deal with how Sherlock blow coffee beans into that large brute's eye? Can you say RANDOM? Anyway, Professor James Moriarty is nowhere near as evil as I was hoping. I give this movie TWO PIPES DOWN!",1,67,135,16 January 2012
Miracle," Kurt Russell IS HERB BROOKS!!!
","As a life long fan of Kurt Russell, I was impressed.  As always, Kurt Russell delivers the goods.  He had the attire, accent etc. of a hardcore coach in the era of Jimmy Carter, Soviet Union, high gas prices and the 1980 Olympics.  I hope Kurt Russell gets recognized.  Geeze, I had no idea tha Herb was such a mean coach!! He was a GOOD coach but he was very hard on his players!!  I loved that part where his team loses to Norway....and after the game, Kurt Russell makes them do skating drills for what appears to he HOURS!!!  I was shocked!!!  That was good.  The best part of the movie for me, was watching Kurt Russell go back into the empty hallway of the skating arena...and trying to not let his enthusiasm explode after defeating the Soviets.  Thank you Kurt Russell!!!!!",Null,0,1,5 February 2004
Mission: Impossible III," A TRIBUTE to Top Gun
","This movie had a lot of TOP GUN tributes. One was the scene where he drives a MOTORCYCLE to the airport?? That was EXACTLY like TOP GUN! Or at the beginning? When he shook the martini shaker? That was JUST LIKE - COCKTAIL!! Now, let's move on! This movie DTG!! (Delivered the Goods). I loved it from BEGINNING TO END. This movie had all the elements of a good movie: A beginning, middle and END! Phillip Seymore Hoffman (who is nothing short of a genius) was PERFECTLY CAST as a villain! He delivers more goods than any villain ever. The best part was when he instantly asks Tom Cruise if he has a wife or girlfriend and then says: 'Because I am going to hurt her.' What a great line! The scenes in CHINA were amazing also! Talk about VERTIGO! There was an element of suspense through the entire movie! Tom Cruise may have been bit by the BUG of SCIENTOLOGY but he delivers the GOODS! He DELIVERS I TELL YOU! The explosion in the girls HEAD was amazing ALSO! Talk about PAIN! the PAIN she must have felt! Her EYE looked all MESSED UP when the little explosive WENT OFF. This was a great movie and I WANT TO SEE MORE of these TYPES OF FLICKS! This better be the BEGINNING of a GREAT SUMMER MOVIE SPREE!",9,1,3,7 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky number SLEVIN delivered the goods!
","Yes, this was a good movie. Of course, what movie isn't good that has Sir Ben Kingsly in it!? Then the easy reader himself was also in this movie. Yes, Morgan Freeman. This movie was good. There were many twists. The diatribe between Josh Harnett and Lucy Liu was a little bit annoying. After you accept that Josh's accent and nose are not going away, you can enjoy this movie. This is another one of those revenge driven movies. Mr. Goodcat stole the show. The best scene was when he did the Kentucky Shuffle or something like that. Just amazing! I loved the ruthlessness that Bruce Willis put into his character. The best scene was the part where the Rabbi pulls out a shotgun and said that he would not go to hell if he killed Josh Harnette.",8,1,7,27 April 2006
Requiem for a Dream," This is what DRUGS do to you!!!
","I rented this on the suggestion of my brother.  It was very good!  I was amazed at the fast filming technique, many cuts and especially the acting. This movie depicted PERFECTLY the way a speed freak is.  What I was wondering is, that part where the do SHOCK THERAPY!!  Do they actually DO THAT?  Wow, the way Jennifer Connaly would do ANYTHING for her 'fix', even that donkey show!!  Oh my god, that was DISTURBING.  I also liked the way Jared Leto played a HERION ADDICT so perfectly.  His arm was all NASTY when it got INFECTED.  It was GROSS.  Marlon Wayons proved that he can act as well.  The movie is 90 minutes long approximately, and it goes so fast.  All I can say is that if you want to see a movie about insanity, drug addiction and patheticness, then SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",Null,0,1,18 June 2003
3:10 to Yuma," Shot in the Belly
","This was a great movie that had a decent amount of action in it. Russell Crowe plays a conflicted robber and killer who is supposed to get onto a TRAIN at 3:10 in Yuma (which is in Arizona). One of the first introductions we have to Crowe's character is when his sidekick, Charlie - appears and has a very annoying voice and facial expression. Plus, he shoots everybody he can get his hands on. Charlie, in ONE SCENE, shoots Peter Fonda in the belly at POINT BLANK RANGE for NO REASON. Couldn't he have just shot him in the head or heart? So, Fonda's character bleeds for about 10 hours and can't move. Finally, he's lugged back to town and some doctor sticks a tool into his belly and pulls out a BULLET! The bullet apparently damaged Fonda's LIVER. So, by that evening, Fonda's character hops back on a horse and is completely healed. I found that to be a TAD UNREALISTIC.",8,1,2,9 October 2007
50 First Dates," Decent flick...same actors as Waterboy
","This movie was good but I get kind of  bummed out when Adam Sandler gets a little bit too mushy.  Yet, that was ok.  This movie had lots of funny part. Even that darn Walrus who pukes in that hermaphradites face!!  Speaking of her, she was creepy!!!Drew Barrymore played herself, no big impact on my viewing pleasure.  Sean Aston, otherwise known as SAMWISE the HOBBIT was the best part of the entire movie!!!  He kept getting roid rage and saying the funniest things to Adam!!I give this movie a few good marks.  This is average but maybe I will see it again.  Ten Second Tom is great.",Null,0,1,7 March 2004
Iron Man 3," This is the best IRON MAN
","This movie had literally everything you could imagine. It followed the basic structure of a movie which is to have a beginning, middle and and end. I liked how the director (who is nothing short of a genius) went to 1999 at the beginning of the movie to lay down the foundation. Then it was all Tony Stark aka Robert Downey Jr. This movie had a great protagonist (Tony Stark). The antagonist was not Ben Kingsly but rather Guy Pearce. I could see this coming a kilometer away. But you be the judge. There are many things about the movie that were neat. I loved how Tony had tons of remote control Iron Mans to take on the bad guys. I also loved how Tony Stark was mostly without his IRON MAN for most of the movie and had to rely on his own ability to be a mechanic. This was pure GENIUS. I will say that the bad guys in this movie were basically an ARMY of weirdos who can turn their bodies into fire and that's about it. I wanted to see more of a bad guy. There was also the amazing Donald Cheetah. He was great as War Machine. As he was without his 'suit' for most of the movie, he had to rely on good old fashioned martial arts. He was trained well and was shown that the enemy will show NO MERCY. I was glad that finally somebody knows this. So if you want to see a great movie in which all the actors deliver the good, on all FOUR CYLINDERS, then see this movie. Try not to mind the 'gum chewing man' too much. As he was very annoying.",10,9,20,4 May 2013
The Ring," Yes, it was different, but I liked it.
","This movie kept my attention.  I heard that in Japan, they are saying that this is the scariest movie of all time.  I don't know if they are talking about the ORIGIONAL movie titled the RING (made in Japan).  This movie had such a strange premise (a video tape that contains eerie images and when somebody views the tape, they are supposed to DIE in 7 days).  A lot of questions were left unanswered.  Such as HOW THE HECK DID THOSE IMAGES GET TO THE TAPE?  Also, WAS THAT GIRL POSESSED BY SATAN?  I don't know what her deal was.  What about that spooky little boy Aiden?  He gave me the creeps!! I thought his role should have been a little more on the EVIL side.  The female lead was good and the scenary was incredible.  It was all shot in Washington.  The ending did surprise me.  It was a very DARK and DISTURBING ending.  All in all, I would say this movie delivered the goods.  It's not in my top 20 horror movies of all time, but it's still worth a viewing.",Null,2,5,24 October 2002
Minority Report," Tom Cruise's best since Vanilla Sky!!
","Tom's movies keep getting better!!  If you are going to see this movie and expecting The Matrix meets Timecop, don't get excited.  This movie is more like Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive with some Blade Runner mixed in for good measure!!  The effects are very good with some hints of Attack of the Clones in a few scenes.  I really liked the movie.  It even borrows from The Fifth Element (Leeloo was like Agatha).  It also borrows from Judge Dredd.  However, Speilberg takes all these failures of movies and makes the movie it was meant to me like!!  There are some great scenes.  Like when a cop gets cattle prodded and pukes like the Excorcist!  Or when the husband almost kills his wife and then gets arrested.  Many plot twists keep you on your toes.  It's true, you always run when you have precops out for you!! There are a few unanswered questions.  Such as this:  What really did happen to Sean?  Tom Cruise's son?  Also, why didn't that guy (the killer in Fargo) let Tom Cruise live?  What's the deal with his assistant who made Tom Cruise a Sandwhich?  Many strange plot holes.  Yet a great movie!!  Tom Cruise and Steve S will be the next John Wayne and John Ford!!  Ten cheers of 'Delivers the Goods!'",10,0,0,7 July 2002
Training Day," My Niggah!
","When I first saw this in the theater I was amazed.  I was so happy the day I heard that my boy, Denzel, was nominated for the Oscar.  When he won it, I was right there with Sidney clapping.  He deserved it!  He ad libbed a lot of this movie!!  I mean, Training Day was shot using real ese's and vato's from the Imperial Courts in LA!  No cameras have ever been allowed into that hood!  This is the best ONE DAY movie ever!  Ethan Hawke is great and should have won the award for best supporting actor.  However, his time shall come. The best parts about this movie were that everything Denzel said was true (the director points this out).  The tension with the ese's at the kitchen table is authentic.  I was surprised that the Vato Smiley, is the same dude as the WOLF from Collatoral Damage.  He is a New Zealander in real life. However, he plays a very good ese.  I bought this DVD and love it so much. This is the best Denzel movie since Riccochet!!   9 out of 10 stars!!!",9,3,14,10 April 2002
Gravity," George Clooney was so calm
","First of all, I loved this movie. I am a science fiction fan and love movies about space. This movie was so wonderful for the visuals alone. But when everything went to hell and debris started hitting the space shuttle, George Clooney did not panic or anything. He just kept doing his space walk and was super calm. Even in the scene where George Clooney cut his line so Sandra could live, he was very calm. I would have been screaming!!! Also, when that one astronaut had a piece of debris crash through his helmet, his face froze instantly and a rock crashed through his face? I know how it is in space, and it is NOT that way. Also, fire in space? You can't have fire in space. No way. And Sandra's hair never lifted and her tears were not frozen. When George Clooney knocked on the window and opened the hatch with Sandra completely exposed in her pajamas, she did not suffocate or freeze/burn. And is it me? Or was the Chinese space station just a little bit too similar to the ISS? Hmmmm. Jake won't see this but he should be aware that it has a beginning, middle and and end. I enjoyed this more than the Tom Cruise IMAX movie titled SPACE. What about when she used a FIRE HYDRANT to thrust herself to another space station? That seemed very unlikely since fire extinguishers can't work in space. But heck, people seem to love Star Wars and all of that stuff happens that is literally IMPOSSIBLE. Such as a green dwarf lifting a space ship out of a swamp? I mean COME ON!! So, if you can look past that kind of stuff, you will LOVE Gravity as I did. I noticed that there were some Obama suggestions in this movie. That did not bother me though. Oh, I forgot! What about going to the bathroom? They never showed that!",9,2,6,7 October 2013
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman delivers the goods
","When I was listening to Rush Limbaugh a couple of weeks ago, he ranted about this movie. He stated that you could not take your eyes away from the screen. Let me tell you, he was right! From the opening scene of the British Parliment when that one guy was screaming about how much he hated Neville Chamberlain, I was hooked. There was not a lot of action in this movie, but more of a focus on Winston's mannerisms, humour, temper and overall demeanor. There were some very touching scenes, such as when he took a moment to be with his wife when she fretted about their finances. A big part of this movie that some people will not have known, is that in 1940, England was considering 'surrendering' to Hitler. Could you imagine? I hope that everybody goes to see this movie. It should be mandatory viewing for ALL.",10,8,24,7 January 2018
Monster," The perfect movie, in terms of it's successful attempt.
","Charlize Theron sure did nail her character.  There was not a tinge of Charlize that was visible through the terrific make up job that turned HER into this BEAST of a WHORE/MONSTER/KILLER.  I can't believe how whacked she was.  It's so sad that the movie was based on truth.  I wonder how many hookers there are out there who simply kill their customers out of desparation to get money/exact revenge on the men they hate as a result of their cruddy childhoods?  Anyway, the best part of this was when Charlize Theron's character, Lee, tells Christina Ricci that she wants to be a VET. Haha....yeah right.",Null,0,0,8 February 2004
Underworld," If The Matrix breeded with Interview with Vampire..
","You would have UNDERWORLD.  This movie was shot COMPLETELY IN THE DARK. It was good though.  I didn't buy theBLACK LYKIN was a little too DEEP VOICED. I mean, when he played JOHN COFFEE, he didn't have such a deep voice. What also bothered me, was when Michael Clark Dunkin was fighting the VAMPIRE with whips.  Why did that guy show off so much with his whipping technique instead of fighting Michael Clark Dunkin??  Oh well.  Or how about MICHEAL!! He is having a hard time as it is...then he gets TURNED INTO A LYKIN!!??? To make it worse, he gets bit by a bloodsucker???  Where is BLADE when you need him.  If The Matrix had sex with Wesley Snipes of Blade, you would have the UNDERWORLD...of course, there is no WHISTLER TYPE in this movie. This is more of a LOVE STORY with definate SHAKESPEAREAN overtones.  In fact, there are little SHAKESPEARE quotes jarbled up in certain scenes.  I was surprised how much Kate Beckinsale looked like TRINITY from the MATRIX...right down to the SKIN TIGHT LEATHER!!  The dude who played LUCIEAN looked like SNAKE PLISKIN on a DIET.  And what about VIKTOR?  He was obviously influenced by DARTH VADER..and I am NOT KIDDING.  There are many scenes where he grabs somebody by the neck...and lifts them UP!!!  Just like DARTH VADER.",8,0,1,20 September 2003
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Corny in parts but good. Mainly for kids.
","I went to see Rogue one not knowing what to expect. It takes place immediately before Star Wars and the entire crawl on Star Wars is the synopsis of Rogue One. there are a few things I noticed about Rogue One. The Storm Troopers may as well not even have armor. The armor is completely ineffective against even being punched much less shot at. My friend Jason Houston saw it and agrees. Also, I noticed that Darth Vader in his Bacta Tank was a neat scene but I was hoping that we could see the tank empty and then look at Darth without his costume. I was also hoping that the guy who plays Hannibal Lechter would have had more of a role. Forrest Whitaker's character was really funny. The way he spoke will be imitated for generations. He reminded me of that villain from Mad Max - Immortan Joe. When he had that blob like octopus read the pilots mind, I thought it was Jabba the Hutt at first! The Death Start was really neat looking. I liked all of the graphics. I am sorry I had to go to the restroom when R2D2 and 3PO made a cameo, ugh. I thought that Felicity Jones's character was so so. All of the accents bugged me. Danny from Bloodline was a so so villain. The scenes on the 'beach' like planet reminded me of the D-Day invasion to an extent. Darth Vader only has 10 minutes of screen time. He sounded more like James Earl Jones than ever this time around. Grand Moff Tarken was silly looking as CGI and so was Princess Leah. Like I said, one thing that is good about this movie is that it's good special effects but overall, it's a a little hokey. Lenny said she liked how they resurrected Grand Moff Tarkin and the movie kept her attention more than the others. I like the Darth Vader light saber scene at the end.",6,9,17,24 December 2016
Dawn of the Dead," Fast Running Zombies
","This was a great movie!!  Mickeye Pfifer was great (no relation to Michelle) as the man who would not reveal!!  Also, Ving Rames was good as the COP who talked 'ugly'.  I liked the way the ZOMBIES moved fast and were much more aggressive than in ANY OTHER MOVIE.  In fact, they were almost super human. I mean, these ZOMBIES ran fast as CARS!!!  What I can't figure out is why they don't eat DOGS?  Aren't ZOMBIES just interested in BRAINS?  Also, a ZOMBIE should never be a 'twitcher.'  That part was kind of weak.  The best part was the Jay Leno/Burt Reynolds part!!!  That was great!!  CJ was super good.  He reminded me of Christopher or that guy from Saturday Night Live named Norm McDonald.  I hated STEVE.  He looked like BRUCE CAMPBELL but I don't think it was him.  What about that part where CJ turns into a GOOD GUY in the sewer?  Or what about that great scene where that BABY (yes, you heard me right, INFANT), turned into a ZOMBIE?  All in all, a great movie. One question remains NOT ANSWERED THOUGH....that question is -Can Zombies Swim?",Null,0,0,28 March 2004
Iron Man 2," Time to hang up your suit - IRON MAN
","This movie was everything that Iron Man 1 was not. Yes, it was terrible, predictable and irritating. I was so mad how they essentially didn't even show any super hero stuff for 90% of the movie. The children in the theater kept asking their mother's: 'Mommy, where is Iron Man? I thought this was Iron Man mommy?'. The mothers had to calm their children. It was so sad. What was even more irritating was how conceited Tony Stark was. I was kind of amused by how the senator kept harassing him. For 55% of the movie - Tony Stark was pompous and an ass. He was not even remotely amusing. Then of course there is the villain who was played by an obviously uninspired Mickey Roark hoping to cash in on the success of his hit The Wrestler. He basically had a horrible Russian accent and had LIGHT SABER BULL WHIPS as a weapon. This movie was terrible. I want to sue the makers of this movie for the two hours I wasted by watching it. How am I able to get this time back? It was painful to watch this.",1,28,61,16 May 2010
Lords of Dogtown," Rebecca De Mornay steals the movie
","Rebecca De Mornay was very good in this movie about some skaters in Venice! I knew Stacey Peralta (not a Mexican) was a good skater, but not this good!! Rebecca De Mornay was the mother of the vato skater named Jay. I always thought Rebecca De Mornay's son was going to stick to skating but he didn't. He got involved in gangs for some silly reason. Rebecca De Mornay was sure swanky looking in this movie as the Crystal meth addicted mother of Jay. However, Rebecca De Mornay did deliver the goods.The best scene was whew Tony hit that one guy in the face. Rebecca De Mornay was not in that scene.I just hope that nobody decides to try and skate too much these days because it's just so dangerous when you try to do too many tricks.Look out for cameos by Tony Falcon and Eddie Van Halan.",9,2,14,5 June 2005
World War Z," Brad Pitt delivers the goods
","When I went to see this movie, I was expecting pretty much what I saw in the previews. In otherwords, I saw Brad Pitt saying stuff in a soft voice while the zombie's run rampant. What sets this movie apart is how the Zombies are so fast and never run out of breath. It was amazing to see some of these special effects. There are many unanswered questioned such as the nuclear blast that caused Brad Pitt to lose cell phone reception. There was a lot of good stuff in this movie though. If you can overlook the plot holes, you will love this movie. You will have to get past the David Morse cameo and why his teeth are grinded into fangs. Great movie.",8,4,10,23 June 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Fish and then more fish
","OK, this was a good movie. Granted, there was not a lot that I could totally understand about Davey Jones and the reason he was part fish etc. Still, the movie was fun. I liked the first one a little bit more. The end of this movie was a huge shocker. I can't spoil it, let me just say ARRRGG!! Also, the highlights of this movie were all those gross fish pirates. That was very weird. Whoever thought of this movie must have taken a TON of LSD because that was just a bit trippy. Also, I could not understand why and how Jack arrived at the island for the Natives and was thought to be a GOD. That was just weird. However, the effects were good. So, would I suggest this? Yes, I would. The fishpeople were disgusting and freaky. They didn't scare me too bad. That sasquatch of the sea was amazing, the CRACKEN or whatever it was. In otherwords, a huge octopus that has bad breath. I give this movie two tentacles up.",8,0,2,9 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Delivers the goods
","I saw Pirates of the Caribbean last night at Cine Capri.  I was impressed and enjoyed it despite it's run time of 2.5 hours.  Yes, there was a bit too much swashbuckling, but it was Geoff Rush and Depp who made the movie so enjoyable.  Johnny Depp is a really good actor.  I heard that he used Keith Richards as an inspiration for his character.  After watching his performance, I believe it.    I really liked Geoff.  He said 'Arrrhhhhgggg' constantly!!!  He played a very good pirate.  I also thought it was a nice touch that they included several scenes that were directly from the Disneyland ride, such as the jailed pirates trying to get the key from the DOG!!!  There was a little kid sitting next to me.  He kept saying he was scared.  So, I don't know if kids will like it.  But I am sure if your kids love disneyland, they will like this movie.   A couple of things that bothered me were 1) the female who always looked perfect, despite the horrid situations she found herself in.  Her makeup was always perfect etc.  That was a tad bothersome.   2)  Some of the hokey one liners delivered by Depp and the female lead.  They didn't bother me THAT much, but there were a few lines that were definitely CORNY.The cinematography was nop notch and the most enjoyable part of the film. It made me yearn to return to the Caribbean.  However, now the Caribbean is all cruise ships and tourism.  the Pirates were awesome. I loved the way they turned to skeletons when the moon light shined on them!!  They were comical more than fierce.
All in all, 8 dollars well spent.",Null,0,1,17 July 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," This movie had me screaming PAIN and SUFFERING!!
","I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Jake has been ranting about it. But instead I hated it. This movie had no darkness it it for being called INTO DARKNESS. It was mostly warm and fuzzy. There was absolutely NO GORE in it. The part where Spock talks to 'Future Spock' on the computer screen was never explained. And then there is the KLINGONS! They looked cool but only had about 60 seconds of screen time. Why was Kirk's hair always messed up? Doesn't he have a comb?Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of Khan very well but everyone else is pretty lame, especially Spock who always has his lips pursed together. What I didn't like about Kahn is that he was not as evil seeming as the Ricardo Montablan version. I think this movie is targeted mainly for children. The action sequences look like action figures in space and it's very obvious that it's CG. Every story ever written for TNG, TOS is better than this. J.J. Abrams's version of Star Trek has absolutely NOTHING in common with the ideas and visions of Gene Roddenberry. It has none of the MAGIC. Oh, and having Dr. Carol Marcus change uniforms in a shuttle while Kirk is asked to turn his back, is just a pathetic excuse to see a hot chick in her underwear, and is completely unnecessary to the story. Having Kirk die while saving the ship instead of Spock and having Spock yell KHAN instead of Kirk was laughable and these parts were just swapped from The Wrath of Khan. This drivel doesn't boldly go anywhere, it's a face paced action adventure film without any real star trekking involved.

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Saw this on NEW YEARS EVE
","Yes, I saw this on NEW YEARS EVE. Instead of going out and getting drunk, I saw this movie! It was quite a movie. That is, if you can stomache the idea of four kids, all under 10 years of age, conquering the EARTH (that is Narnia). It was still good. I was impressed that good ol Liam Neesom played the Tiger. Sure, he was Jesus, we all know that. Lucy was Mary Magdelane and God was the PROFESSOR. I am so tired of all the commentary on how the BIBLE is similar to this novel. I was impressed with the way the BUFFALO SOLDIERS kicked butt!! Yes, there were soldiers that literally had BUFFALO HEADS. That was actually quite funny.",9,1,2,2 January 2006
Public Enemies," Jack Sparrow as a Gangter?
","What can I say about this movie? I can say I liked it, that's for sure! There were a lot of great scenes in this Johnny Depp movie about John Dillenger. This movie delivered the goods, that's for sure. I liked that part at the beginning when Pretty Boy Floyd was running through an apple orchard and was shot by Christian Bale at long range. I was surprised he died so soon though. Of course John Dillinger was very classy and clever to boot. I liked that one part where he was standing in the hotel near the coat rack and the patron wanted his coat. Johnny Depp slapped him on the back of head! What about that part where he is in jail and escapes? That was pretty cool also. I am a fan of the old gangster movies and this one did not disappoint. If you are going to this movie expecting to see major violence, don't get your hopes up. Also, I hated that fat boy that beat up Johnny's girlfriend with a phone book! How dare he did that! I was hoping that he died.",8,0,0,17 March 2010
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Decent flick - not as good as part one
","I saw this on Easter Sunday and was a little tired believe it or not. This movie was good but it seemed like all the characters did was walk for about 10 minutes and then listen to a rumble of ice melting. This repeated at least 6 times. Of course, that goofy chipmunk was a nice addition. I wish he would have given up on the stupid acorn though. There are many foods that are much better than acorns. The best part was the fire king part. I mean, those imitations of the FIRE KING were very cute. The fish were not THAT scary and in fact, the scariest part was trying to figure out how much Ray Romano was paid for this role! All in all, decent movie. I liked Toy Story better though. OK, time to go back to 24. Oh, nice cameo voice by David Lee Roth in this movie.",6,1,2,17 April 2006
Spider-Man 2," Spiderman lost his POWERS!!

I am also a little peeved that he conveniently build the sun above the water!!  That was too convenient!!Spiderman whispers a lot in this movie.  He also looks a little bit like Timothy Dalton for some reason.The scene which was the best, was the fight between Ock and Spiderman on the CLOCK TOWER!!  That was good.  It seems like when I read this comic book as a kid, Doctor Octopus was the ultimate evil dude and super powerful.  Only the SANDMAN can beat up SPIDER MAN!!All in all good!!

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," 75% of this was funny
","I liked all of this movie except for the predictability.  Yes, we all know how it ends.  Yes, there is some cheese in this movie, like when Matthew M. chases Kate Hudson to tell her he loves her.  Gag!  Anyway, the best parts of this movie were when Kate's character was being a psycho to Matthew M. She was calling him TONS OF PET NAMES and doing basically ANYTHING that would 'ANNOY' him.  Yes, I chucked out loud when she brought that strange looking POODLE to his condo in a bag.  Yes, I did laugh when made him go get her a COKE during the basketball game.  However, the ending left me feeling a little TOO chick flicked out.  Speaking of CHICK FLICKS, wasn't that great when she took him to a CHICK FLICK MARATHON?!?  Haha.  Definately WORTH the price of about 4 dollars.  Had I spent 8 dollars, I would have felt RIPPED OFF.",Null,1,2,15 February 2003
Troy," Brad Pitt puts Russell Crowe to SHAME
","Great movie this was!  Brad Pitt was good as Achillies. He made his last stand and fought well.  The two armies both had good people.  Eric Bana and Legolas were on one side.  Sean Bean (Boromir), Brad Pitt and friends were on the other side.  Actually, Pitt was more of a freelance kind of warrior. The only evil man was the pig of a king played by BRIAN COX.  I liked his evilness.I liked it when Pitt killed that one giant by sinking his sword into the shoulder.  It looked like butter being stabbed by a warm KNIFE!!!All in all, a great movie that was even better than Gladiator mixed with a little Braveheart.Ten out of Ten.",Null,6,12,1 June 2004

There are some great scenes in which Jake and Heath act a little intense in terms of how much they like each other but still, great movie. That part where Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie) sees the two of them messing around and rolling in the snow, was Oscar WORTHY for sure. I just hope that the ACEDEMY remembers this movie as the most daring movie of ALL TIME, yes ALL TIME. The actors were asked to do things that are unheard of in Hollywood.

Insomnia," This movie made ME interested in INSOMNIA!!
","I have suffered from insomnia for a long time.  I enjoyed watching Pacino. He looked soooo tired by the end of the movie.  All the characters were good.  There were a few odd scenes, such as when Pacino barfed in the alley and then looked at a dead dog.  One thing that bothered me was this: Why didn't Al Pacino just tape some black plastic bags over those windows to make it dark?  Shoving tons of furniture doesn't cover all the WINDOW SPACE. Trust me, I've been there before.The plot was decent.  Robin Williams did a good job and didn't overact at all.  Good extras on the DVD as well, including a documentary on insomnia...the SLEEPING DISORDER.It's hard to miss with Al Pacino.  I am glad I saw this.  I am now very curiuous what it's like to live in a place where it's either light or dark for 6 months at a time.  Plus, the scenery made me yearn for another Alaskan vacation.",Null,0,0,21 October 2002
The Prestige," Not THAT Presgious
","I went to this movie expecting to be blown away. After the amazing movie with EDWARD NORTON, I was expecting too much. This movie was OK, don't get me wrong. The scene at the end when Wolverine is talking to Christian Bale was Oscar WORTHY to say the least. However, I grew tired of the cockney accent that Bale had through the entire flick. The ending was a bit contrived. Sure, this movie had a good ending but it was a little too strange with the entire TWIN thing. I didn't see that coming. I guess I should have read the book, no? Oh where should I begin on the plot? It was very strange to see Tesla being portrayed by David Bowie. That was a very weird part of this entire movie. Did Tesla really build stuff in the mountains of Colorado? Who knows. All I know is that Michael Caine was so so in this movie and the plot was not that great.",1,16,63,21 October 2006
The Terminator," This is a stupid movie
","This movie is about some kind of robot who lands in a puddle of light whenever he comes to earth.  He is so muscular that clothes do not time travel or something like that.  He has skin on him and is naked when he goes to Earth.  He is a mean robot who has limited speaking skills.  I would think that in the hear 2034 that they would have some better schools where they could teach the scientists how to make the robots speak more clear. The Robot, played by former Mr. Universe, Arnold Schwartnegger, is a TERMINATOR.  I mean, that's all he can think about is killing this one lady so that she doesn't have this kid who grows up to kill the Terminator.  The chases are always frustrating because the robot doesn't get tired.  He is kind of like the paste.  The Paste will never get tired but the humans will. The Robot punches people in the guts and also says that he will be back a lot.  One of the huge mistakes that James Cameron made when directing this movie, was that he forgot to give the Robot any emotions.  Without emotions, the robot can't decide what is wrong and what is right.   If he would have had that ability, he would have killed better and would have killed that lady who was going to give birth to Jack Connor.  The Robots are going to kill anyway, so why not make it so that they can kill in a better method rather than just killing killing and killing.  I think this is the worst movie of the 1980s and perhaps of all time.",Null,0,2,3 August 2003
Silent Hill," Classic horror with a death by barbwire touch
","If you want to see tons of blood and barbwire, see SILENT HILL. This movie delivered the goods though. I loved it. I have never seen this video game but I might go see it now. Sean Bean did a good job for as little time as he spent in this movie. I loved that cop who wore the leather. She looked like the legend of Billy Jean girl. The monsters with no faces were amazing looking. There is a lot to this movie and I can't piece it together. There were two dimensions going on and I am not sure hot to feel about that. However, the amazing BORG from Star Trek was in this as the female witch hunter. She was good. All the aspects of this movie hit the mark.",8,2,5,26 April 2006
We Were Soldiers," Worst Movie of the Year so far
","I was hoping that this movie would deliver the goods.  All it delivered was corny and sappy.  I mean, was Mel Gibson drunk when he decided to take part in this pile of tripe?  Nobody has used the phrase 'Tell my Wife I loved her' (like that Chinese Man) than Hollywood.  If I hear that dang line one more time, I will throw up!!  What's the deal with Sam Houson?  Everytime somebody said good morning to him, he'd just say 'What the hell do you know about good morning.'  THAT made me IRATE!  And what about how Mel Gibson too a CAB to his house!!  He couldn't just call his WIFE ahead of time and LET HER KNOW!?  She could have given him a RIDE!  That was way off base.  Mel Gibson prayed TOO MUCH!  What's worse, is that his prayers were supposedly from the top of his head, yet the sounded as if they WERE FROM A BOOK!!! This movie totally rips off THE GREEN BERETS with John Wayne.  There are too many sappy lines and the wife, family, meaning of war theme is overused.  If you want to see this, trust me, DON'T!!!  See The Green Berets or Hamburger Hill.  Those are REAL war movies!!",1,3,6,4 March 2002

For the most part, there is not THAT much racism in that LAPD. Matt Dillon sure did deliver some goods though!!

Blade II," The Return of Whistler!
","This movie was good because Whistler was in it!  Sure, Blade was good but Whistler stole the movie.  Whistler had all the good lines and fought really good.  What I liked most was when Whistler would get mad at Scud or that one Vampire and call them names like NIPPLEHEAD.  Whistler questioned Blade a few times but that was just because he was like a father figure and just looking out for him.  What I liked about Blade 2 was that the bad vampires looked like Nosferatu.  It's been way too long since we've had a good Vampire flick where the blood suckers truly look like Nosferatu.  That is where Blade 1 lacked.  If you're going to make a movie about Vampires then make them look like monsters, not some GQ person from the makeup department. Whistler never fails to deliver.  Kris always plays that role well.  Too bad he didn't get nominated for a best supporting actor award in Blade 1. Perhaps this will be the year for Whistler.  Also, what's the deal with that good looking Vampire dying at the very end?  It was too emotional and made me think of Kirsten Dunst from Interview w/ Dracula.  All in all this was an ok movie.  Whistler made it watchable.",5,2,5,31 March 2002

I just didn't stop laughing. I was not able to stop laughing during that part where Nacho was singing about Ramses at the party!! Also, those corn chips were a little strange the way the way they are served with every single meal. Also, that was a Penelope Cruz LOOK ALIKE BIG TIME!!! I just saw that it was some other actress. Or, the other part I loved about NACHO LIBRE was the skinny sidekick. He was very SKINNY. His TEETH were all messed up. This had a lot of Napolean Dynamite humor also.

Shutter Island," Alcatraz meets Hitler

However, aside from the hat that Leo wore there was not much to this, ya know? The movie subject is interesting. I was expecting this to be some kind of Ghost movie but it was more of Alcatraz meets Titanic. Robert DeNiro has a very brief cameo as one of the prisoners in the civil war wing. There is a fair amount of violence but it's mostly where you have these flashbacks about Hitler's Germany. All in all not bad. Good cinematography. If you are expecting to see Goodfellas I would suggest renting that movie or Casino. This movie is not quite what I was expecting but it was still good,",7,1,5,20 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Not bad..
","When I walked into the theater to see this movie, I had no idea of what to expect. But what I was treated to was a very strange plot involving a new world order and something called Hydra. This movie started off with a very strange scene involving Captain America jumping out of an airplane with no parachute. This movie had a decent cast but each actor essentially played themselves. Robert Redford was very miscast in this mess of a movie. They didn't let the winter soldier have enough screen time and they certainly didn't ask for that. What happened is that the Winter Soldier was never fully explained and he never really spoke. He said a line or two in what sounded like Russian and then a few other lines. I was very disappointed in Samuel L Jackson's lackluster performance as Nick Fury. He was also very irritating when they brought out the character he once played in that movie called Pulp Fiction. Did this movie have a beginning, middle and end? I would not call the END a true ending. Also, I am getting sick and tired of Stan Lee's cameos. The special effects are over the top in this movie to the point of making me sick. The CG effects are all very OBVIOUS. I was not happy with the way just about everything was CG. And what's the deal with Nick Fury in that car chase? He could have done better in that chase but he didn't.",6,3,7,4 April 2014

","Phillip Seymore Hoffman played the high pitched, lispy Truman Capote with great conviction. Then again, Phillip Seymore Hoffman is nothing short of a Genius. I was sickened by that scene where he mixed whiskey with baby food and ate it with a SPOON. That was gross. The convict looks like one of my friends which was strange. However, Phillip Seymore Hoffman delivered the GOODS in this movie. Whe Phillip Seymore Hoffman first started to SPEAK, I was surprised. I was surprised because Phillip Seymore Hoffman's voice is usually so LOW. However, Phillip Seymore Hoffman made his voice very high in this movie. There was not too much gore. Phillip Seymore Hoffman played a crabber but there were no Brokeback Mountain scenes by any means. Phillip Seymore Hoffman should get the Oscar for this. Phillip Seymore Hoffman was nominated this morning on the news for BEST ACTOR. I just hope that Phillip Seymore Hoffman realizes that his next movie is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THREE with Tom Cruise and that he needs to concentrate on the publicity for that.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The PERFECT movie thanks to YODA!!!
","Ok, I have to admit, I loved this movie.  I hope Jake watches it.  He would like it.  Attack of the clones was great.  The plot was well crafted and not as silly as the Phantom Mennace.  I liked the movie for many reasons. Everything George Lucas did wrong in TPM, he did RIGHT in this movie.1. OB1 Knobie was perfect.  Ewan is starting to sound more and more like Alec Guiness (the actor).  He looks more mature and is very convincing in his role.  His fighting skills are also very good.2. Queen Amidala was hot.  However, it was a little far fetched when they were in the GLADIATOR ring and a monster tore her shirt off from the chest down exposing her belly.3.  Anikan was the ONLY thing I didn't really like.  The actor who portrayed him was too pretty and had a face that reminded me of the kind of kid who would simply annoy me.  However, his fighting skills were good.  When ever he would feel like giving into his anger, he would make this unconvincing frown.  However, I liked when he slaughtered the sandpeople (even their kids and wives).  The chemistry between he and Natalie Portman was not really to strong.  When he hugs Senator Padmé Amidala on Tatooine, the shadow of Anikan on the brown igloo was of Darth Vader (which was eerie.  My friend Morgan would like that).4. Jar Jar Binks was in about 2 minutes total which was perfect.  It makes us all like Jar Jar again.5.  Senetor Palpatine was as mysterious as ever.   He was only in a few scenes.6.  Mace Windoo played by Sam Jackson was amazing.  He did some wonderful fighting!!!  He even had BMF on his lightsaber.  (Bad Mother F*cker) in homage to PULP FICTION!!!7.  Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus played by Chirstopher Lee reminded me of his EVIL character in LORD OF THE RINGS!  He was very good a a Jedi turned BAD!!!ENTER YODA!!!!  Yes, Yoda was amazing.  He had more roles in this movie and lines that SO MANY other Jedi's!!!  In fact, there is a scene at the end where he goes to TOWN on Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus!!!  He kicks his ASS with a light saber!!  This was odd because just before the fight, Yoda was wobbling around with a cane.  Perhaps this is because he uses that as a trick.  Anyway, Yoda does this amazing fight scene and moves around with the agility of Keanu Reeves and Bruce Lee combinded.  I actually almost laughed until I saw how serious this fight scene actually was!!!  I loved that part!!The effects were amazing and NOTHING was done half fast.  Sooo many aliens!!

The Godfather: Part II," Great sequel
",This movie was great!! Just as good as part 1. I was amazed at how long this movie was and how good it was. The GODFATHER is now Al Pacino's character. He was menacing. It's amazing how innocent he was at the beginning of part 1 and then he became more dark and ruthless toward the end. He even did unspeakable things. That dude who played Fredo was also in DOG DAY AFTERNOON. I am sure that he and Al were friends. Nobody can make movies like Francis. The best parts of this were the flashbacks to Bobby DeNiro as Vito Corleone. That was just amazing. I have seldom seen a movie as good as the GODFATHER. Way to go Francis.

Oblivion," Tom Cruise strikes gold yet again
","When I went to this movie, I was not too sure what to expect. I know that Morgan Freeman is one of the actors and a supporter of Obama. And Jake says Tom Cruise is a supporter of Obama as well. But I decided to leave my voting card at the door and enjoy the movie (which I did).This movie had it all! I starts off with some great visuals of what Earth looks like after an alien invasion. There is a lot of neat stuff like the top of the Empire State Building and you can even make out some other landmarks. Tom Cruise steals the show as Jack Harper. He is part of the mop up crew. There are these scary little 'drones' throughout the movie also. They look like mean Pac Man characters and they fly and shoot. The flying scenes with Tom Cruise are just amazing. I could not hope but notice a nod to George Lucas with the chase scene in the canyons. I wonder if that was intentional? Anyway, I also liked how this movie paid homage to the one and only Matrix. That scene where they are in the space ship and see tens of thousands of Tom Cruise's being 'made' in capsules of water was just amazing!Of course there was the obligatory shirtless scenes with Tom Cruise. For 50, he sure has a good physique! But then again, he trains all the time. I liked that chase scene where he was running. I like the way he always runs like his arms are made out of dolphin fins. I call that move the 'Tom Cruise Run'.Will this be an Oscar winner? Perhaps for visual effects. This movie was a true visual treat and a pleasure for my eyes to watch. Kudos for the director for making sure this movie had all of the ELEMENTS of a good sci fi movie: 1. A time setting in the future, in alternative timelines. 2. A spatial setting or scenes in outer space and 3. Characters that include aliens, mutants, androids, or humanoid robots! (drones). This movie also had the main elements of a good movie which is a beginning, middle and and end.Contrats Tom Cruise! Keep these good movies coming!",10,3,8,20 April 2013

It was a great suspense flick and if you can look past the klee shays, it's easy to find yourself gripping the movie theater seat (or the person's hand you went with).   Matt plays Jason Bourne, a man who can't remember who he is yet he has all these terrific fighting skills.  The fighting scenes in this movie rivaled those Gladiators and Them!  I was very impressed.  Has Matt Damon been practicing to take over the aging Peirce Brosnan??  The girlfriend he has is great (run lola run).  Also, the chief is really convinving as the man who wants to get Matt Damon.  He's played be Col. Fritz of American Beauty.  All in all, a good movie.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I saw it at the THEATER and bought the DVD
","I heard mixed things about this movie.  I loved it.  It was a three hour movie that delivered all the goods.  Frodo is the role that was made for Elijah Wood.  Mr. Wood was BORN for that role.  Gandalf was created for Sir Ian McClellan.  It is amazing how well they act.  Cate Blanchette is the beautiful elven queen.  This movie delivers all the goods on all fronts. Viggo plays Strider.  Strider is a well trained swordsman who steals the action.  The struggle between good and evil is there.  However, as Peter Jackson says, what makes this movie more interesting than a typical good vs. evil movie, is the HOBBITS.  Yes, you heard me right, THE HOBBITS.  The hobbits are a simple people who are not used to action and adventure. That's about all I can say about this movie.

The actor from BLOOD SIMPLE was excellent in the role as the barbershop customer.  He was great when he yelled at FRANK toward the end of the movie.  Also, RADIO'S older brother was really good.

I know it's trendy to shake the camera around but it got old after 2 minutes. Of course, Robert Carlisle delivered the goods. He always does though. The ending of the movie was a little silly but then again, it's a fun horror movie. I liked the way the zombies in this movie THREW UP BLOOD at FIREHOSE PRESSURE. That seems to be a COMMON THEME in these ZOMBIE movies. Will there be a 28 years later? I sure hope so. I hope that Walt from LOST doesn't fly a helicopter in that one.

This sasquatch is very different in that it has claws that can tear you apart. In one scene, Bigfoot is running around in the forest and the kids try to test how BRAVE they are by standing on a platform and taunting the yetti. I won't reveal what happened. All I can say is that there were torches lit on fire for a special effect. The yetti turns out to be much more than we expect. To say that there is a twist in this film is a gross understatement. You will never look at Sasquatch again in the same way after seeing this movie. I would kick bigfoot out of the village if he came to my town.",6,1,1,22 July 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," last half of movie is good
","This was a 'deliver the goods' style movie. It was good. However, when the Dad was burning against a tree, you would think that the fire extinguisher would have been a big more effective. This was not as good as the original but it was close. The most shocking scene was obviously the part where the guy wakes up in a box filled with bodyparts. I would have thrown up. Also, the shotgun suicide scene was amazingly IN YOUR FACE. I was shocked at how that girl from LOST played a ditz without an accent. Of course, the JUPITER character at the end is the 'your friend died like a pig' thug from the Untouchables. FOr such a famous actor, he had a SMALL PART all things considered. Great cameo from Bruce Campbell in this movie as Ash.",7,1,2,12 March 2006
American Psycho," Very well done
",This was very scary and suspenseful.  Bateman's face was so sweaty the entire time.  I liked it.  There were many good scenes.  One of them was where Bateman ran after a call girl with a chainsaw naked!!  Naked and covered with blood.  That was a very disturbing scene.,Null,1,2,23 June 2002
Little Miss Sunshine," Good and disturbing
","This was a great movie and the little girl who played Olive was delightful to watch. She was cute with a capital C!!! There were many parts of this movie that were slightly odd, in particular the final dance scene in which it is hard to watch. I was not expecting that at all. There were many funny parts. The horn honking scenes were among the best and I know that this movie will get an Oscar nod if all goes well. I have to admit that I really liked the dynamic between that kid Duane and the 40 year old Virgin. There was great chemistry. Toni Colette was beyond amazing and proves once again that she is far better of an actress than Kate Hudson. I will have to watch this again. Alan Arkin was amazing in this movie also. I give this movie a perfect ten because it was sooooo good.",10,1,4,9 September 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Move over Edward Furlong,,,,Nick is in TOWN!!
","This movie was entertaining.  It was not a SUPER GOOD action movie though. There were a lot of good points.  I didn't mind that kid who played John Conner.  I don't think he looked like Reese at all.  I did like the way he stayed STRONG even when the CHIPS were down.  What I did like about this movie was that ARNOLD didn't seem to need any steroids.  He still looks STRONG and said he worked out for THREE hours a day to TRAIN for this movie. That's odd, considering that he was only exposed for 30 seconds with no SHIRT.  However, since it's Arnold, I don't mind.  What I hated, was that Arnold didn't ask for himself to be made a better CYBORG.  If he is a TIME TRAVELER, he could have gone way forward into time and asked for the scientists to make him STRONGER so that he could beat the Terminatrix.  That was a HUGE flaw in the movie.   The OTHER flaw was CLAIR DAINES.  Is she supposed to marry JOHN CONNER and HAVE KIDS?  I hate to say it, but Reese already had a child with Sarah Conner.  The odds of a child being produced after a NUCLEAR WAR are very minimal.  The fallout alone would KILL all the reproductive organs.  I was SHOCKED to see how much Clair Daines has AGED. She AGED very well though.  It was EXACTLY LIKE Linda Hamilton when she became angry with the Terminatrix.    What about where Arnold carried a coffin?  Did you find it STRANGE that the bullets didn't penetrate his LEATHER JACKET?  That was not well thought out.   Also, when The Terminatrix was attracted to a LARGE MAGNET, she got a circular saw out and SAWED the magnetic tube.  The tube would have been so MAGNETICALLY strong, that the circular saw would not have worked!!  Why didn't they show how she got out of that PREDICAMENT?  I found it strange that Termintrix was able to drive that CRANE as long as she did.  I have seen CRANES and they don't go that fast.  They also do NOT have the power to go through as many buildings as it did.  The Terminator girl was good though.  She could have become invisible and been way more effective.  If she has the ability to copy anybody, she should copy INVISIBLE,,,,that would have been the way to go.  Sure, a few flaws in this movie, but ARNOLD delivered a few good lines and the best line was when he said 'DON'T DO THAT'.  What I am wondering, is who will play JOHN CONNER in the next TERMINATOR?  My money is on Rick Schroeder or Paul Reiser.  Noodle Juice man would be good. also.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
"I, Robot"," This is Will Smith at his...uh best?
","Well, it was a good sci fi movie.  The tunnel chase was really the only good scene in this entire movie.  The transport robots turn red in their bellys when they get evil.  When they are not evil, they are blue.  Also, the robots have a lot of talent cuz the are able to jump all over the place while they are driving a transport vehicle at 100 miles an hour.The chick, who was also in the RECRUIT, was a good addition to this wonderful movie.  I was so shocked to see that the amazing Will Smith was so built for this movie.  That nude scene was lame.  Has he ever heard of a shower curtain?All in all, a so so movie.",Null,0,0,21 July 2004
Warrior," Move over Karate Kid, Warrior is in town...
","This movie has it all!! It was brilliantly directed and has all the components of a great movie. There is a beginning, a middle and and end. The story line is great!! There are these two main characters who are brothers. One of the brothers is Marine and really mad at the world. The big brother is a school teacher who is about to lose his home. They can both fight. Tommy is the younger brother and hits people so hard that he knocks them out with one punch! The older brother - Teacher, is good to but he is not that mean an angry. They both have Nick Nolte as a father - can you say Oscar? Nick was awesome as the father that for some reason they both hate. That is never really explained. I think it's because their Mom died of cancer and Nick was too busy drinking booze to care. Anyway, there is this one great scene where Nick can't take it anymore so he drinks booze and listens to Moby Dick with his walkman. He is crying and screaming the words to Moby Dick (the novel, not Led Zeppelin song). So, the fights are great. Teacher is at one point fired from his school for being a fighter by the principle - Mr. Z. One thing leads to another and in a match called Sparta - the two brother do so well that they eventually have to FIGHT Each other!!!! This final fight was better than Bloodsport, Enter the Dragon and Karate Kid all combined!! The two brothers also hate each other for some reason. Actually Teacher doesn't hate Tommy as much as Tommy hates Teacher. I can't figure that out either. All you need to do is watch this movie and be entertained with the great fighting scenes! I give Warrior TWO UFC's UP!!!",10,0,3,20 January 2012
Dreamgirls," Fun Movie
","I am not the biggest fan of the genre by any means but this was a great movie. Beyonce, in many scenes, did not have makeup on. She still looks great. She looks better then what you would expect. I guess that heavy girl was an American Idol contestant. She had a wonderful voice! It was just amazing. I was shocked and amazed how great Eddie Murphy was as well. He was very believable in his role. I was shocked how his character developed through the movie. He had feelings yet Jamie Foxx, who was very 'evil' did not seem to care. There were many times during this movie when you would expect a bit more drama. However, the drama never really came as much as the MUSIC came to the forefront. I also did not know that this was a musical from the old days.",9,0,0,28 January 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Now, THIS is funny
","I rate this up there with Wedding Crashers, something about Mary and various other funny movies. I loved all the scenes where Steve Carrel was talking about nailing and what not. The timing is so perfect. Especially when he screams to that black guy in the night club. The movie shows how it's not really that bad to be a 40 year old virgin. Yes, you heard me right, this movie is kind of aimed, in a slight way, to virgins to show them that it is not something to be ashamed of if you're a virgin. The last scene was great and the comedic timing between the pals and Steve Carrel was perfect. I just hope that Steve Carrel continues to make a TON MORE movies that are in this vein. Never before have a laughed so hard that popcorn literally came out of my nose. Morgan.",10,3,6,5 September 2005
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Move over James Bond - TOM CRUISE is in town!
","First of all, let me say this was a good movie. Second of all, anything with Tom Cruise is good (at least to me). This was the 5th movie in the saga. I just loved everything about it. Some people are complaining about the length of the movie. What do you expect? It's a great plot and at times was confusing as a dinner party. Then again, these films are no longer about the story or the acting, they're about Tom Cruise and his death-defying acts. The story doesn't matter. There were some things about this movie that I noticed:1. When Tom Cruise was handcuffed to a support beam in the basement. What's the deal with that? It doesn't go all the way to the ceiling. That way Tom Cruise was able to 'hop' up it and escape.2. How come Tom Cruise led Lane on a 'chase' through out the city and even jumped through a window to get into the basement of that office building? You would think that he would have maybe had the front door unlocked of that building.3. How did Tom Cruise push over the glass cage so easily?4. Why was the main villain whispering the entire time? When he found out that the girl gave him a blank disc, he put his hand on her head as if he was trying to control his temper.5. The sight of Ethan Hunt hanging on to the side of taking-off airplane is an unbelievable one to behold - and it's only made more impressive when you remember that Tom Cruise actually performed the real stunt himself!! Also, when the side door opens and he gets BLASTED inside the airplane, how did he not get knocked out? That looked painful.All in all, this movie was great. It had a beginning, middle and an end. Thank you Tom Cruise. You're a legend.",10,0,2,10 August 2015
Spider-Man," Spider Man is an Amazing movie
","Ok, I liked Spiderman, eventhough the computer generated superhero was obviously computer generated.  That worked thought for the web slinger. Toby Maguire was great and much less an amature as he has been in his previous movies.  The chemisty between him and Dunst was wonderful.  I also liked the Green Goblin played by the wonderful Willem DeFoe.  However, the costume that DeFoe wore was kind of silly.  His laugh was intense.   I also liked the person that played Jonnah Jameson!!  His way of talking was cracking me up!!  They sure didn't have him enough in it.  I am sure he will be a character in the upcoming sequals.  What's the deal with Harry?  He was saying that he will avenge his father's death and kill spiderman. Does this mean that Harry will become a super villian?  I wonder who he will play? Dr. Octopus?  I also liked the music by Danny Elfman in this movie.  It fit Sam Raimi's directorial style very well.  The movie had tinges of darkness in it.  This movie delivered the goods.",9,0,0,16 May 2002
Jarhead," Thank you Jamie Foxx
","To say this movie Delivered the Goods is a gross UNDERSTATEMENT. I saw this movie on a Saturday at 10:30am, which is early for a MOVIE. I loved it. It reminded me of the days at New Mexico Military Institute and how tough Marine Boot Camp it. I suggest seeing this movie. I was not in the gulf war but I am an era veteran. I was fully aware of all that was going on. What the deal was is that it was VERY BORING to sit in the desert for 150 days with nothing to do. Jamie Foxx is a great S/SGT and did a first rate job. His HOORAH line is destined for the shelves that house 'I don't give a damn' and 'Luke, I am your father'. This will go in my inventory of must have movies. Jake Gyllanehall was good also. He must have worked out a lot. President Palmer also did a good job when he took his morning glory. All in all, a great flick with a lot of memories for somebody like me, who went to New Mexico Military Institute with Owen Wilson. Was this movie PROPAGANDA AGAINST THE YOUNGER GEORGE BUSH? No, but who needs that propaganda when George is now digging his own grave. He started out good, now he's just a stooge.",9,5,11,6 November 2005
Collateral," good
","Cruise was excellent as VINCENT THE ASSASSIN!!! He was so ruthless and mean that you actually FORGOT he was TOM CRUISE!!! His hair was gray! They only strange part was when Cruise went to the NIGHT CLUB and pretty much took out anybody he wanted. I was surprised at that. The acting on Jamie Foxx's part was almost as good as if Will Smith would have been cast. Jamie Foxx is a poor man's Will Smith, but he's still good. Hard to transition for this poor guy (from a comic to a ACTION STAR).Anyway, the goods were delivered and the suspense NEVER LET UP. The ending was good but ended a little to strangely and no climax either.Believe it or not, I rooted for Cruise the ENTIRE TIME.",Null,1,3,5 August 2004
American History X," Say Goodnight!!
",This movie was about how RACISTS are MEAN!!!  The character played by Edward Norton was very mean to blacks.  He even poured milk on one just to MAKE HIM LOOK WHITE!!!  There was a LOT of hate in this movie and the hate was just the beginning.  IT made blacks hate whites and white's hate blacks!!!  The scene on the basketball court was very interesting.  I thought that there was going to be a bullet shot at least once before the game was finished. Good and intense movie.,Null,0,1,31 January 2004
Saw III," Move over Hannibal Lechter, Jigsaw is in town....
","First of all, the gore and pain in this movie was very intense. Saw part 3 is pain personified. The fact that Jigsaw came up with so many new ways to torture and torment is proof that there is indeed...a God. A horror masterpiece this is. Jigsaw never gets out of bed the entire movie due to his illness. And the man with the robe is very angry. I have to admit that the grossest part of this entire movie was the Sow's being dropped into a blender and then the sow goop going all over the judge. I almost puked. Also, the black man who was being tortured was a little gross. They actually showed part of his bone snapping out of the lower leg. Donnie Walhberg's role in this was minimal but it did show his crushing and cutting his left foot. I was grossed out. All in all, Jigsaw is the best villain of all time.",9,1,4,5 November 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Ocean's 11 is a THUMBS UP!!
","I really loved this movie.  Sure, it has an A cast and I do get tired of Julia Roberts.  Still, the prowess of Clooney is incredible.  I am just so amazed at how he manages to carry the entire cast if not the movie.  There are many great scenes of the Vegas Casinos.  The only thing one must remember is that it's just a movie.  There is no way somebody could break into the Bellagio (trust me on this one).  That place is very secure.  The movie delves deep into the constructs of it.  Andy Garcia plays his boss character superb!  He was the 2nd highlight next to Clooney.  Brad Pitt delivers the goods as well.  Then again, he always does when it comes to being the 'cool crook'.  I rate this one VERY high!",10,1,2,21 January 2002
Spirited Away," No Face's 'eh eh eh eh', was kind of annoying...
","Other than that, this movie was great.  I loved the music and loved all the images.  The way in which the Japanese see various things is very interesting.  Far more interesting than we American's see things.  I loved that old lady and her baby.  In a way, it gave me the creeps, but then again, it was very interesting.  There was so much to see in this great movie that it certainly warrants a 2nd viewing.",Null,0,1,15 June 2003
Jackie," Good movie
","I went to see this movie because I am big fan of that era and I love time period pieces. I thought this was a good movie focusing almost entirely on how Jackie handled herself the day of the assassination. What so many people don't realize is that after the bullet hit, Jackie had blood all over her for the rest of the day. We see the scene at the end of the day where she finally peels off her blood soaked clothes and washes the blood out of her hair. The movie also shows Jackie and how she felt super sad and panic stricken yet she had to pull herself together act 'poised'. She essentially felt lost. She kept thinking she would go to the poor house like Abe Lincoln's wife did. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes that era and has an interest in the Kennedy's. You never see ANY scenes of the rest of the nation mourning and freaking out. You only see what's going on in Jackie's immediate world, in the quiet emptiness of the Whitehouse.",8,1,6,23 December 2016
Tropic Thunder," I don't read the script, the script reads me
","Tropic Thunder was funniest movie of the year!! I liked the scene where they were walking through the jungle and the director blew up!! Ben Stiller's character thought it was a stunt and that the decapitated head was a PROP!! Haha! So he starts LICKING the stump of the head as the Vietcong looked on! I laughed so hard that my hair stood on end! I also like the fake previews at the beginning! I especially liked the Jack Black trailer of those gas passers!! That was so funny, OMG! Or what about that odd scene where Jack Black bites the bat? That was a little weird yet FUNNY! I also liked all those deep and philosophical lines that the Robert Downey Junior character uttered throughout the movie! They were so deep and silly. Haha. Also, Tom Cruise as the incredibly ANGRY agent or producer was so amazing! When he yelled at those Vietcong on the phone, I laughed so hard that I started to whistle Dixie!! My eyes rained like Simple Jack!!",10,2,6,18 August 2008
Resident Evil," Milla Jovovich good, movie bad.
","Wow, this film was bad.  I mean, the best part was watching Milla Jovovich!! She looked good and hid her accent well.  This performance on her part was fine and she shows good moves (way better than that pile of dribble called TOMB RAIDER).  The movie starts off ok with a cool shot of where the scientists work in 'the hive'.  Then something goes wrong and the computer locks down the lab and kills everybody.  Then, a SWAT team shows up lead by some man who looks like the CANDYMAN.  There's a scene where some laser beams slice some of that team.  That was a rip off from the Cell.  Then suddenly all these makeshift Zombies show up after five hours of being dead! It was Alien's meets Return of the Living Dead (especially since The Candyman is in it) with a little bit of OUTBREAK thrown in.  What you get when you mix those three together is a movie that appeals to only little kids with candy.  In fact, I was embarassed because I was the only adult in the movie theater!  I wanted to see that hispanic girl DIE the entire time. I also wanted for Milla Jovovich to have more speaking parts.  Milla Jovovich is one of the best actresses of our generation.  I hope that Milla Jovovich learns that she can do more than just these sell out movies.  Ugg. And what's the deal with that stupid Red Queen?  As if any artificial intelligence (another stupid movie) could be all nice and then start screaming 'KILL HER!  KILL HER NOW!'  Many things were wrong with this movie.  Shame on you Milla Jovovich.  I will give you another chance though because you're the best looking actress since Andie McDowll.  I rate this movie a 2.",2,0,1,17 March 2002
No Country for Old Men," Great Coen Brother's movie with no music
","I loved this movie except for the two folks sitting two seats away from me who were probably high on meth because they were laughing hysterically through the entire movie and text messaging with their cell phone!!That being said, Josh Brolin plays the perfect cowboy type character. He is a man who finds some money in a drug deal gone bad. The person who apparently wants to get the money back is played by the older brother in Everybody Loves Raymond. He is a psychopath who kills people with some kind of shotgun that has a SILENCER on it. He also uses an AIR COMPRESSOR to murder folks and also removed locks with it. Very strange if you ask me. Again, there is NO MUSIC in this entire movie. Just a lot of good dialogue and character development. I was very impressed.There was blood. Oh yes, there was indeed blood. Tommy Lee Jones is a very introspective sheriff in this flick. I will have to see this movie again. I noticed that some scenes were shot in Albuquerque because you can see the Sandia Mountains in the background.",10,4,11,2 December 2007
Batman Begins," Give it up tim burton
","This movie was sooo BAD for many reasons. I just got back. My friend Jake said it was the best superhero movie of all time. I beg to DIFFER? 1: The fight scenes SUCK. They all cut way too fast, and too much to know what's going on.2: Hypocrisy. Bruce Wayne doesn't want to KILL a murderer...but has nothing against KILLING about 50 guys two seconds later who fight injustice.3: While it was DARKER, it still wasn't a 'Dark Knight'. They should have made Batman a killer, much like he was when he first came around (in the first appearance of Batman he threw a baddie into a vat of toxic waste) 4: The new BATCAR is completely stupid. It's kinda cool...but logically WAY too much for any man (even a bat man) to need. The pivotal Batmobile is from Tim Burton's BATMAN.5: Still no explanation how the Wayne family is SO rich. A business, yeah...but still no reasoning why they're so rich.6: Scarecrow was HEAVILY under-developed. Barely in the movie enough. Not to mention Scarecrow's 'defeat' at the end of the movie is the FUNNIEST thing I've ever seen in a Batman movie.7: I didn't feel any connection between Bruce and Rachel. They were childhood friends...and that's where the connection stops for me. Did I mention the fight scenes were bad? 8: When I first heard Christian's voice as Batman, I laughed. Not a good sign. He seemed to be trying too hard to try to become a different person when in the suit. He also did not look like a Bruce Wayne to me. I know there's much more than looking the part (George Clooney comes to mind), but it's a factor. He seemed too emotionless, detached. Christian is a good actor and I saw it...but it seems he fell short. Michael Keaton still holds the reigned for the most intense and perfect Bruce Wayne AND Batman.BONUS: The ending seemed a bit pushy. But it was confusing for my friend. He was questioning if it was to show that it was a prequel to the Batman '89 movie. I explained that they were starting over. But still, I can see how people could be confused. Personally I'd leave the first two Batman movies in the timeline and redo Forever and Batman and Robin.Even looking back, I don't' know what to say. One thing, IT SUCKS!!",1,25,55,17 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Meet the Good Movie!!
","This movie was OK, I mean, it wasn't THAT good. It has the amazing Barbara Streisand, who is not nearly as talented Joaquin Phoenix. Then again, Joaquin Phoenix was not in this movie. The good thing about this movie was the way Bobby DeNiro behaved toward the AMAZING Dusty Hoffman. Yes, their chemistry was great. I got a little annoyed at the constant was Dusty was obsessing with sex non stop with the democrat Streisand, but deferment, it was part of the movie. Ben Stiller delivered the goods as he always does. That kid who was his 'kind of kid' was a dead ringer for Ben 'the great actor' Stiller. I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to lose my temper! Yes, this movie was good. Not as good as the FIRST one, but still it was good. Joaquin Phoenix was not even CONSIDERED to do this role. Apparently Joaquin Phoenix is not much of a comedy actor. My other FAVOURITE PART of this MOVIE was when Ben Stiller walked in on Dusty and Barbara, and Barbara had whipped cream on her breasts and Dusty's face was covered with it. Strange, but odd. Also, great cameo in the wedding scene by George W Bush.",6,0,0,19 November 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," God Bless you Peter Jackson. Thank you so Much!
","As a HUGE Lord of the Ring trilogy fan, I was looking forward to going on my own 'great adventure' to the movie theater to take in The Hobbit. I was not disappointed as this movie delivered all of the goods and them some!This wonderful movie was a 'visual feast' from start to finish. One of my friends really dislikes all of the JRR Tolkien works. He hated LOTR. But that didn't stop me from going to see this wonderful movie. There were so many great parts to it. All of the dwarfs didn't really seem as small as Gimli did in LOTR but they were all wonderful and captured my heart and gave me so much inspiration. The Hobbit himself was amazingly well cast for the part. The animated Hobbit had Bilbo appear as a fat sort of a hobbit with a huge nose. The movie version cast Bilbo Baggins perfectly!The monsters in this movie were so amazing! The Goblin King with the gross flab of flesh for a beard was beyond sinister and of course his legions of goblins were gross and wonderful! The dwarfs and Gandalf sure did kick their asses in the caves! There were only 15 of them vs. 1000s of Goblins and they did wonderful.That leads us to Gollum. Oh yes, 'my precious' is enhanced in this movie and has superb facial expressions thanks to the animators at Digital Domain!!! I can't say enough how good this movie is. I am just forever in debt to Peter Jackson and thankful he is making two more Hobbit movies. This movie is 'perfect' from beginning to end and there is no 'filler' or one single wasted second.Thank you Peter Jackson - you are nothing short of a genius and we are forever grateful to you.",10,9,22,19 December 2012

Yet, he continues to survive by having people help hide him.  This movie was much more graphic, in my opinion, than any other HOLOCAUST MOVIVE EVER!!  Yes, you heard me right.  This includes the brilliant SCHINDLER'S LIST.  If you have a hard time seeing innocent Jews being killed left and right, then you owe it to yourself to SEE THIS MOVIE. Yes, you heard me right.

He does a good job at playing a cool dude.  He always keeps his cool no matter what.  I am pleased that he and that Chinese girl didn't get too involved.  That almost happened.  The martial arts were great.  The OIL scene was something right out of a JACKIE CHAN MOVIE.  In fact, that fight scene between the transporter and the bald man was a nod to DRUNKEN MASTER'S final fight scene.  All in all, a decent flick.",Null,1,2,8 May 2003
Seabiscuit," William H. Macy steals the MOVIE!!
","This movie was about a horse, named, SEA BISCUIT.  However, the REAL HERO of the movie is William H. Macy's announcer character.  It is through the magic of Macy that we come to appreciate all of the harsh realities that Sea Biscuit faces.  Macy tells the story as it was meant to be told in the early part of the last century.  He did get the great scoop (with hot fudge and a cherry on it) when he learned that Sea Biscuit was going to run the 6 furlongs.  I was amazed at how well Macy captured the essence of an announcer, complete with a gap in his mustache!!  The woman that Macy was with was never explained, neither was how Macy came to be invited over to Jeff Bridges house.   But whenever we feel that the country needs some cheering up, it's not only the horse who comes to the rescue, it's William H. Macy.  I really anticipate an oscar nod for his stellar performance.  I am sure he will get it.  He nailed this role so perfectly that finally, the great Macy will be placed on the hollywood map!  Go MACY!!",Null,0,0,13 August 2003
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Move over JAMES BOND - Ethan HUNT is in town!
","First of all, this was the best Mission Impossible out of the franchise. The other ones were too complicated to understand. This was was simpler. Basically it was Tom Cruise trying to stop a nuclear war. I really loved how this movie embraced a beginning, middle and the end. There was a protagonist and an antagonist. I loved how Tom Cruise kept his cool no matter what. He was in that Russian Prison yet didn't fall victim to pressure or dogmen. I was impressed how Mr. Hurt Locker was in the movie. From the second I saw him I was certain he would be a 'bad guy'. However, he turned out to be pretty cool. That once scene where he reminded Tom Cruise that his line was too short and Tom responded by saying 'no sh*t' was funny. As Jake mentioned, Hurt Locker should have told Tom Cruise that he was just trying to help. I also liked that sand storm. It was neat when Tom was chasing the bad guy through the storm and was unable to catch up to him. I also loved how the Secretary was shot in the back of the head right in front of Tom. The one thing about the movie that bothered me was how quickly Tom drew a picture of a man on the palm of his hand. He drew a pretty good image of a face in about 4 seconds. That was kind of weird. Also I was not sure why Hurt Locker fell 25 feet just to hover across a spike shaped fan. Was he doing something while down there? I was not sure what it was. As for the guy who owned the satellite, he had quite the Pompadour haircut. It was around three inches high. The best part of the movie was the appearance of Ving Rhames. I was expecting him to reply 'ugly' when asked how the retrieval of the satellite out of the San Francisco bay went. LOL. Tom Cruise continues to be the 'perfect actor'. His hair was perfect the entire movie.",10,3,7,27 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Move over Charlton Heston - James Franco is in town!
","I saw the Planet of the Apes back in the 70s when I was a child and it was good then and it's great now. Granted this one was more of Cesar's character development. about 80% of the movie was build up and only the past part was the 'action'. However, that didn't mean it wasn't a good movie. If you are going to this movie expecting to see apes with shotguns and flying airplanes, you will be disappointed. James Franco was excellent as the scientist who developed the stuff that makes apes smart. James's Dad played by the ingenious John Lithgow was good as well as the father with dementia. However, it was Cesar who stole the show. Cesar is played by the Gollum guy from LOTR and he delivered the goods. He started out cute but then became wise yet not evil. For the entire movie, I was on the side of the apes, not the humans. All of the apes seemed really cool actually and none of them were pure evil. It will be interesting to see what happens in the sequel when all of them speak fluent English. I give this movie TWO chimpanzee thumbs up!",Null,0,1,13 August 2011
Django Unchained," God Bless you Quinton!
","This movie is an 8.7 on the IMDb thus far. This is a great score because I would say that's just about where I would place this film. Of course, QT is a genius and continues to prove himself with each film. I don't much care for the one that are produced or inspired by him. Let's face it, this is the best filmmaker of all time. Now onto this movie which my friend refuses to watch because he feels that it's an 'attack on the white man'. I tell this friend - 'The civil war is over and this is a film' Yet he still says that it is anti - white and won't patronize it. I say to him - 'this is your loss'.Sure, there was a lot of use of the N word in this movie. But let's face it, this was a movie set in 1858 and the use of that word was not uncommon. I would love to say to you that the stand out performances were Samuel Jackson (who is famous for Star Wars) and all of the other actors. There were a few big names like Don Johnson and that guy from all those funny movies who is fat - that are in for just a few minutes. But let's face it, QT has the power to get whoever he wants! I just have to say that this movie was not a revenge movie of blacks against whites. The great actor Walton Goggins was amazing. He is from 'The Shield' (another series my friend hates) and he accuses Michael Chickless of being a lime green shirt kind of a guy. I want everybody to see this movie. Spike Lee is voiding it because he feels slavery is not a subject to be made into a movie. I have one thing to say to Spike (who is a fool). See Roots!Thank you Mr. T, you have made my day. I have ambitions to see this movie over and over although it is over 3 hours long. This is on par with The Hobbit (my friend refuses to see that).",10,2,12,26 December 2012
2012," The End of Days meets Woody Harlson
","First of all, this movie was not meant to be taken seriously. There is no way that a person could drive a limo all over town while the world was crumbling underneath. That was a very unrealistic scene. I thought it was almost amazing when John Cusack drove his limo through a building and then somehow made it to the airport and took off while the Langoliers were closing in behind him. Yes, you hear me right. This movie reminded me of Stephen King's The Langoliers. Of course, Woody Harlson was the highlight of the movie as that person in Yellowstone where he was able to predict all of these events. I was shocked at the outcome of him. I was also noticing that when the Washington Monument crashed, a ton of ash and debris flew all over the place and landed on Danny Glover's face. He looked identical to his Predator Character in that scene. Speaking of Predator...that was a terrible Arnold Shcwartzeneggar actor pretending to be him.",7,1,1,14 March 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," ANOTHER MASTERPIECE!!!
","I saw this on OPENING NIGHT and it was WORTH IT.  Thank goodness nobody dressed up as a hobbit for the premier.  Anyway, this movie was incredible. The THREE HOURS went by so fast.  I was not surprised though being that I loved the first one.  This movie was more action driven (amazing battle scenes that make Braveheart's battle scenes look like a playground fight) and the special effects were even more amazing.   This movie has some great highlights.  One of them is Gollum.  He was a cross between Yoda and a heroin junkie.   He was a big part of the movie and definitely `acted' well. I know it was computer generated but that doesn't matter, he LOOKED SO REAL.   Then of course there is FRODO, the role Elijah Wood was BORN FOR. He was good in this as well.  In this movie, we start to see the darker side of our HERO HOBBIT.  The ring's dark power begins to take hold of FRODO. Frodo is not in this movie nearly as much as the first.   Then there is ARAGON (brilliantly played by VIGGO MORTENSEN).  He continues to show bravery and heroism while every now and then, showing his personal side. He kills about a thousand orcs in this movie.  I saw in an interview with Viggo, that he was so immersed in the movie making, that he actually felt as though he was a real character in middle earth.   The new characters introduced in this movie are all very good.  The acting is superb.   Even then ENTS delivered the goods.  Yes, the ENTS.  The ENTS are these HUGE TREES that are alive.   The way TREEBEARD speaks is so interesting.  He sounds like this wise old man and speaks in wise phrases such as `Gandalf asked me to keep you safe and keep you safe I will..'

I Am Legend," Move over 'The Stand' - I am Legend is in town
","This movie was everything that The Stand tried to be. The Stand was a great book but the made for TV movie was not quite as good as this. I did like the Will Smith character in this and he did a great job. Interesting scene were he was trapped by the Zombie and almost munched by the dogs! I liked how he walked around New York and that there were weeds everywhere, especially coming up from the cracks in the pavement. However, the highlight was that main Zombie who was incredibly angry. He was seething anger and even took it out on the other Zombie's toward the end. I have to wonder what the rest of the world was like. I am getting tired of all the great movies centering around New York City. Why not Albuquerque or Phoenix? Anyway, great movie and the eerie vacant NYC was great visual eye candy! Not too much in the way of gore which surprised me. I wonder why there were no zombie cats?",8,2,4,14 January 2008
School of Rock," Jack BLACK is Angus Young!!
","Jack Black is actually like this in real life from what I am told.  He loves to rock and is no less talented than John Belushi or Chris Farley.  He has the song writing skills of Angus Young with some Tommy Iommi mixed in.   He is the reason we all like to ROCK.  I am more into METAL and ROCK now that I have seen JACK BLACK perform with the kids in the SCHOOL OF ROCK!!  I loved it at the end when the ending was good.  I loved the way the bass player played.  What about summer?  She's going to be a goddess when she's a bit older.  I thought that NED was really good as well as the GEEK who was going out with that girl from PERFECT MIND and THE ROCKETEER...Jennifer Connaly is her name I believe.  Man, she was a BIT*H!!  I would never let my woman TALK TO ME that way!!!",6,0,2,5 October 2003
The Hurt Locker," Three Kings meets Platoon
",This was a really good movie. I liked the part where James and the black guy had a fight. It was funny when they were doing this thing where you hit each other. James got onto the black guys chest and it really hurt. The black guy got mad and yelled at James. There was also this part where they come up on a bunch of bad guys and shoot them like snipers. I didn't realize it got so hot in the desert of Iraq. They were in full battle outfits and had to lie there and kill these bad guys while getting thirsty. I also liked that part where James finds that kid who has a bomb buried in his chest. That was gross and it seemed to make him upset.,8,1,10,10 March 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," Great Submarine flick!!
","There was not a lot of action in the movie in terms of combat etc. Essentially this movie is told from the Eyes of the RUSSIANS!  The Russians, led by Harry Ford (who delivers the goods in this movie despite the accent), are on a mission to demonstrate their NUCLEAR power.  They do this by LAUNCHING a test missle.  After the test missle is launched, they have a reactor leak in the ship.  Radiation ensues and tention mounts.  Liam Neeson is great as the XO.  I would suggest this to ANYBODY who is interested in HISTORY and MARITIME movies.  Great flick!!",Null,0,0,9 February 2003
The Longest Day," Better than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN!!
","Yes, you read that RIGHT.  My Dad was in WW2. This is WAY better than SPR. Why?  Because it focus's on OPERATION OVERLORD and the D DAY INVASION.  A lot of planning went into D DAY and SPR failed to show that.  I loved SPR, don't get me wrong, but it's not the kind of movie you show in HISTORY CLASS.  This movie showed SWORD BEACH, UTAH BEACH and even a scene with IKE!!  The man who played Dwight D. Eishenhower looked EXACTLY like him. John Wayne played a GENERAL in this movie and was great as a TOUGH MAN who REFUSED to quit.  He didn't even have the lead role.  There was a lot of death in this movie. The beach smelled of death!  The man played by Sean Connery was very lowkey and had perhaps a couple of lines.  Robert Mitchum was great!  In one scene he made one of his men go back to the beach to grab his rifle!!

Moulin Rouge!," Moulin Rouge is EXCELLENT ROUGE!
","This movie was so wonderful.  The scenes were breaktaking and reminded me of dreams that I used to have as a child.  The songs were far better than I had anticipated.  I feel that Nicole Kidman completely delivered the goods in the wonderful musical about what this normal man played by Ewan will do to prove his love to Nichole.  What else can I say?  The movie was without a doubt the best musical I have seen since Jesus Christ Superstar.  The way they used songs from Madonna and U2 were simply magical.  I hope that in the future more movies are like this.  There are simply NOT ENOUGH musicals anymore.  I will never forget the feelings that watching THE MOULIN ROUGE! brought fourth in me.  This movie gets some thumbs up from me.  If I had three thumbs, I'd give it all THREE THUMBS UP!",Null,0,1,2 February 2002
The Illusionist," Move over David Copperfield EISENHIEM IS IN TOWN!
","This movie delivered all sorts of goods. I was shocked at how good of a magician he was. There was some great chemistry between Eisenhiem and the Dutchess. They were so good together. Paul Giamatti never fails to deliver the goods and this movie is no exception. The way he laughed at the end and looked all strange as he realized what happened was Oscar worthy. There were some great facial expressions in that scene. I hope that one day they explain how the magic in this was actually done, especially the sword scene. That was just amazing. Oh, and that evil CROWN PRINCE!! He was SO EVIL!! However, the end of this leaves me questioning why the Crown Prince did what he did in the study in front of Paul Giamatti.",7,0,1,1 October 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The Silver Sufer Delivers but....
","If know saw the movie only, then you might not know that The Silver Surfer wields the 'Power Cosmic,' absorbing and manipulating the universe's cosmic energy, and is almost totally indestructible. He can navigate through space, hyperspace, and dimensional barriers, and he can fly at near-limitless speeds on his board, entering hyperspace when he exceeds light speed. He has even proved capable of time travel on occasion. The Surfer, who sustains himself by converting matter into energy, does not require food, drink, air, or sleep. He is immune to extreme temperatures from the human torch and most radiation, and he can survive in vacuum environments such as outer space and hyperspace. He can analyze and manipulate matter and energy, and restructure or animate matter at will, even transmuting elements. I am sad that he was tortured by that one man. He can heal living beings such as Mrs. Storm and he has proved capable of revitalizing and evolving organic life on a planet-wide scale. He can alter the size of himself or of other matter, cast illusions, fire energy blasts, form manipulate energy constructs, absorb and discharge most forms of energy, and phase through solid matter!! His senses enable him to detect objects and energies light years away and to perceive matter and energy in subatomic detail. Trust me, he can beat up Spiderman and Superman. The Surfer can even see through time, and with concentration he can achieve limited perception of past and future events in his general vicinity. He has demonstrated limited telepathic ability on occasion and has proved able to influence human emotion and sensation. The Surfer's board in this movie is composed of the same impervious, cosmic-powered silvery material as its master's skin and is mentally linked to the Surfer as we see in the forest. It moves in response to his thoughts even when he is not in physical contact with it. The board is almost totally indestructible, but on those rare occasions when it is damaged or destroyed, the Surfer is able to repair or even re-create it. The Surfer can attack opponents remotely by directing the board against them, and the board is capable of absorbing and imprisoning other beings, at least temporarily. I wish he would have done that on Dr. Doom. Obviously, Galactus exiled the Surfer to Earth, his means of imprisonment was linked to the board. When Surfer and the Fantastic Four realized this, Surfer put it to the test by leaving the board planet-side and entering space in the Four's spacecraft. Once he was free of Earth, the Surfer remotely converted the board to energy, recalled it to him, and reformed it in space! All in all, a good movie.",Null,3,6,17 June 2007
Transformers," Not a BAD movie
","First of all, the movie was not bad. It was a little slow in the beginning. The special effects were all pretty much in the previews. What I didn't understand, was why Herbert Hoover was brought into the storyline? Did Michael Bay stop to realize that we didn't have the technology to move Megatron from the South Pole to the United States in those days? Heck, airplanes barely existed. Also, what is the deal with that City that the battle took place in? It sure as heck wasn't Las Vegas, Nevada! If you go from Phoenix to Las Vegas you go right THROUGH Hoover Dam. Also, remember when the Decepticon's activated and said 'All Hail Megatron!'? It seemed like only 10 minutes before they all DROVE from various parts of the globe and ended up at Hoover Dam. Shame on you Michael Bay! You should have used shots of Las Vegas if you were going to use the CITY as a battleground just out of Hoover Dam!",6,2,6,15 July 2007
Men in Black II," Men in Black = Cash for Tommy Lee Jones
","This was the best of the two that have been done so far.  The main aliend is played by that good looking lady from Law and Order.  She is mean and has tentacles that kill people.  They even tease that man from the Jackass show. He is a bad guy also and tags along with the Law and ORder girl.  They are looking for some light that was hid on the Earth a long time ago.  So, Wil Smith goes to get the memories back from Tommy Lee Jones so he can help find the light.  Once they get some clues the deal with a lot of aliens that have some short screen time that is not really interesting other than to simply look at.  There is no sex in this an no violence either.  No blood and nothing that is shocking or scary.  The best part of this movie is the manner in which Tommy Lee Jones and the Wil Smith play off eachother.  The part I hated was that black girl who was the token obviously.  The highlight is the PUG.   This talking PUG was the best part of this movie!!  Way up!

Clint delivers more than the goods as the coach of the female Hillary Swank!! Hillary was actually really cute in this flick and kept calling Clint Eastwood BOSS. I was afraid that at one point, she was going to punch somebody out of the ring. If she had DONE THAT, then whoa!!! I loved that dude DALLAS who was retarded. He was innocent and although he called Morgan the N word, Morgan kept being nice to him. Oops, his name is Danger, not Dallas!!

While there, he trips on on drugs, hangs out with a dude who smokes pot with his Mom and meets a girl at a hospital.  As it turns out, he and the girl fall in love and hang out.

Evil Dead," Sam Raime would be proud
","When I read all the 1's and 2's on the IMDb I was hesitant to go see this movie. After all, I am a huge fan of the original Evil Dead directed by my hero, Sam Raime (who is nothing short of a genius). This movie delivered the goods and in a big way at that! Sure, was gore but the scene where a tree raped Mia was not too over the top as Jake said it was said to be. Instead, it was scary and grotesque in the tradition of a horror movie. This movie had all the elements of a good horror flick. First, the movie has to have some realism to it which it does!! Secondly, mystery builds suspense. A lot of horror movies make the mistake of giving the movie watcher too much background information. Not in the Evil Dead! Third, strong characters make the best victims. The character of Mia in Evil Dead was strong and crazy when she became possessed. Fourth, don't give me a chance to take a breath. Horror movies without action are dull pieces of crap. But the Evil Dead doesn't let up. Of course the nod to Bruce Campbell was amazing when she shoved the chainsaw on her stump. There were other good nods to such as the 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 in the beginning of the movie. The only thing I didn't like was when that girl threw up on the other girls face with blood coming out of her mouth at fire-hose pressure. Then she stabbed that one guy in the eyeball about 100 times but his glasses protected him. I would have had the glasses shatter. One of the best parts was at the beginning when they burned that lady ALIVE! She was screaming and you could tell she was in a lot of pain and probably not even acting. If you want to see the best horror movie of 2013 so far, go see this movie - and I will personally guarantee that you will leave the theater feeling like you just saw a really good movie.",10,9,54,6 April 2013
The Evil Dead," Move over JASON, ASH IS IN TOWN!

A man named Scotty is the male friend to ASH who is played by BRUCE Campbell (the new horror movie hero of the century).  The rest of the movie is a GORE FEST and HORROR with many scenes that have SHEMP of the THREE STOOGES in it.  This is the perfect movie for ANYBODY to buy.  Sam Raimi took HORROR to the next level and paved the way for HORROR DIRECTORS such as WES CRAVEN to make great HORROR for all of us!!

8 Mile," Good but NO depth
","This was an ok flick.  The rap scene in 1995 was taking off and I guess they had lots of 'RAP OFFS'.  That's where people have 45 seconds to make up a good rap that disses the other rapper that you're competing against.  That was one of the plots of this movie.  The disappointing part to me was the role that BRITTINY MURPHY played.  I mean, come on!  She had about 4 lines in the entire movie.  Then she gets asked to HOST Saturday Night Live?  Oh well.  As for the movie, there were your typical gansters that drove huge black suv's.  Yes, they packed guns to.  Yes, there were also your typical N words being said all the time.

","I saw it last night.   Wow!  Really amazing. Wow! Like..... cinematic opera. The sets, the style, the colors, the music -oh man the music-, the characters.  It's like he took a comic book, a Bruce Lee movie, a foreign film, Akira, Samurai Jack, MTV, and Mothra; threw it in a blender, then painted it on the screen.  These characters would be so 2 dimensional if it wasn't for this stone-in-your-stomach reality of revenge and retribution. And it's short, only 90 minutes.  Never thought Uma was much of an actor until now.  Wow.  I was amazed at the FIRE HOSE PRESSURE of blood getting squirted out!! Also, it is good to see that martial arts expert from Crouching Tiger back. She could really kick butt in that school girl outfit.When Boss Takamoto had his head cut off, I laughed right along with Sophie and the schoolgirl.This was the best MOVE LITTLE TOE movie I have ever seen!!

Saw II," I saw this movie
","This movie was OK, and it delivered a few goods. Just about as good as the FIRST ONE. I liked the part where that guy almost burned to death in that incinerator. The odd thing is that the guy was 1/2 way out of that burner and for some reason, the others got scared and refused to pull him out? And the DEATH MASK! Oh yes, that part was gruesome. I loved the way they are leaving it open for a third installment. Donnie Wahlberg delivered the goods a a COP. That dude from 24 was good as JIGSAW. He was so intelligent yet very evil. His booby traps were obeying reproach. They were ingenious!! That stupid Hispanic drug dealer, Xavier, could have just asked for the back of the neck numbers instead of acting like Jack Nicholson from THE SHINING. And what about that stupid girl who got her HANDS TRAPPED in the glass? She could have used her OTHER hand but instead a bad case of the stupids got a hold of her.

Anyway, on to the MOVIE.This movie is not as good as the first one. It is BETTER. Yes, it is good and better in SO many ways. I loved the Johnny Depp Character based on a series of celebrities including Barbara Bush. I just hope that President Bush loves this movie as much as I did. Deep Roy was great as the ONE and ONLY Oompa Loompa. Also, that gum chewer? She was, uh. Shall we say, ODD? And what about the braces that Wonka had to eat?

Black Hawk Down," I left the theater feeling 'exhausted'
","This was a good war movie, period.  As usual, Tom Sizemore did a good job. And Tommy Lee Jones Jr. (Josh Harnett) did a good job and didn't have to be a 'pretty boy' to pull off a convincing roll as a SSGT.  I noticed many good things in this movie.  The key theme was that 'nobody get's left behind'. This was proven when that one soldier placed a hand in his bag.  Let's face it, this is war!  Lots of men died in a very violent way.  This movie was true and it wasn't sugar coated.  Ridley Scott didn't use too much of his SKIP FRAME PHOTOGRAPHY which was a relief.  However, he did use some strange techniques.  Like the hand in bag scene.  I guess he's trying to come up with some new techniques that will place him in a unique catagory along with Marty S and Stanley K.   Oh, I was surprised that Ewan McGregor pulled off such a good act.  He is good at changing his accent.  There is a scene at the end where an old African Man is carrying a baby and walks RIGHT BY THE CONVOY.  I thought for sure that the old man had a bomb inside the baby or a gun hidden behind him, but no.  Ridley Scott wanted to keep true to this story as possible.  One thing I did wonder is what they ever did to that POW.  That guy was really messed up!  The Somalian that was interrogating him said it all when he mentioned that war is just a way of life for his people.  Make me feel fortunate to even be able to sit here at my desk in front of a computer.  We are so much more fortunate here in the US than Somalians.  This is a good movie, but be prepared to feel tired when the credits roll.",8,1,1,20 February 2002
Prisoners," Hugh Jackman is nothing short of a genius
","When I went to this movie, I was not sure what to expect. There are a lot of twists and turns. But the highlight of the movie is how angry Hugh Jackman became when his daughter went missing. Hugh Jackman decided to do what he felt was right and abduct the weirdo he thought was responsible. Let's just say I would not want to be on the receiving end of Hugh Jackman's fist. Hugh Jackman was torturing this guy (the weirdo from There will be Blood) for the entire movie. Jake G was good as the cop and where ever this was filmed had a really gritty feel about it. It rained all the time. What bothered me was how Terrence Howard cried or was watery eyed during the entire movie. Hugh Jackman had to convince him to not be a cry baby on more than one occasion. The lady, Ms. Jones, was played by a young actress which was really good to. Hugh Jackman and she get into it on more than one occasion. Was this movie long? yes. Was it good? Yes. Will Hugh Jackman get an Oscar nod? I sure hope so. This movie had a great plot and a protagonist and antagonist. Hugh Jackman started off the movie as a nice person but transitioned into a mad man. Good going Hugh Jackman. I look forward to more of these kinds of roles. Your Wolverine character is played out. Oh, and the ending? Well let's just say that the ENTIRE movie theater moaned. It was the most different ending ever. Very similar to how the Sopranos series ended. Jake Bass would like this movie. Hugh Jackman is awesome.",10,8,17,20 September 2013

Yes, you heard that right.  In this movie, he proves that he can out act just about any other actor in his particular age group.  The giant is the same giant from the BILLY CRYSTAL movie and has a crick in his neck or something.  I can't understand that part.  Also, Albert Finny delivered some goods as the older version of Ed Bloom.  What I loved was the town of Spectre.  This town is like NO OTHER TOWN EVER!!!  I want to MOVE to Spectre!

The Dark Knight," The Joker was better in the first one
","This movie was so so. The Joker was played by Heath Ledger who died in real life afterwords. But what most movie buffs wonder is why was the joker so powerful? He was beaten in the face by The Batman repeatedly but never really was hurt. I would think that so many punches in the face would result in a major injury. That was very strange. Also, what happened to the joker to make him that way? Jack Nicholson's Joker was made that way when he went to a plastic surgeon or something like that and had botched dental procedure. This joker gargled with razor blades and everything was somehow related to how he was beat by his Mom. I can't understand why The Batman hated the Joker so much.",2,7,18,3 August 2008

Singin' in the Rain," The Best Musical I have ever seen
","This was simply amazing.  When Roger Ebert mentioned that this was one of his favourites, I knew I had to see it.  I bought the DVD for a meager 10 dollars and watched it.  This was great.  Gene Kelly is just one hell of an amazing dancer.  No wonder he was such a ladies man.  He was very slick! There are so many great numbers in the movie aside from the title track 'singing in the rain'.  Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the love interest of Gene Kelly.  The plot of the movie is interesting.  It involves scandle and intrigue and romance.  However, the singing/dancing numbers stand out above all other musicals I have seen.  This movie left me feeling great (which I need from time to time).  I found my face fixed in a grin throughout the entire film.  Few movies have forced my face to contort that way without me realizing it.  Ah, if only there were a way I could go back to that magical time when film noir was more in fasion.  Now that I have seen my first Gene Kelly movie, I will have to have a Gene Kelly movie marathon!  Go see this movie.  Better yet, BUY IT.  It's a must have for any musical buff, trust me on this one!!",10,1,4,20 April 2002

Well, if you're looking for Jim Carey to be like he was in that ANIMAL DETECTIVE MOVIE, then this is the MOVIE NOT FOR YOU.The movie is about a very emotional Jim Carey and his weird relationship with that girl from TITANIC. It was a good movie but FRODO did not deliver the goods as he did in the Lord of Rings movies. His character was lame. The doctor was good. He is the same dude who played Francone in BATMAN STARTS.I liked this movie however, and just have to emphasize, it's very odd.",7,1,3,9 July 2005
Alice in Wonderland," More for kids than adults
","This was an OK movie. I wish Tim Burton would make a good movie because after all, he is very morbid. However, this movie plays out more like a kids movie than anything. Gone are the days of Beatlejuice and the like. I like the part of this movie where there were special effects. In otherwords, most of the entire movie. I hated the way the white queen moved around gracefully and I hated the cards who looked like Cylons. I did like Tweetle Dee and tweetle Dumb because they looked so expressive. I liked the way the queen had a big head and that one scene where the Catapillar blows pipe smoke was funny. I didn't think Johnny Depp's character was dark enough. There were a few scenes where his voice changed but there was really no violence. I mean, that queen yelled OFF WITH THEIR HEAD over 10 times but I never saw any blood.",7,2,4,15 March 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," Move over Evil Knievel, Burt Munro is in town!
","This was a good FEEL GOOD movie. It was sooo feel good that I was shocked. There was not a single scene of animosity other than when the biker hoods at the beginning tossed drinks into folks faces who were at Burt's birthday party. That was the only major scene. The rest of the movie was about Burt's inner journey and outward journey to achieve this dream he has of riding a motorcycle over 200 mph. I would like to see a Harley do that! Many good scenes were in this movie and the friend's that Burt made along the way, such as Jake the Indian were only adding to the wonderful tone of TWFI. Yes, Hannibal Lector was the main character. However, you could not see any resemblance to him. There was one scene which was a nod to Silence of the Lambs but it was very subdued. I would suggest that everybody sees this movie. The way he rode that motor sickle was just incredible. I just hope that soldier didn't die in Vietnam man!",10,0,0,22 July 2006
La La Land," Reminded me of the Golden Age of Hollywood
","First of all, this movie is not a complete musical. There is a lot of singing and dancing but the movie has a lot of normal dialog as well. The opening scene is very neat and is basically one long shot that takes place on the LA freeway, with everybody singing and dancing. It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie though.I liked how the opening also had the 'Filmed in Cinemascope' at the beginning. That gave you that 'old school' feeling right away. There were many great locations in the movie that make you want to travel to LA and just hang out in jazz clubs. Speaking of Jazz Clubs, I really liked how J.K Simmons had a small role at the jazz club, considering he played a jazz instructor in WHIPLASH. I really love the chemistry between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). It was such a nod to the old Hollywood classics. Emma is such a wonderful actress and captivating on screen. She will probably be playing great roles for many years to come. The ending was actually very very well done and had a bittersweet twist to it. Finally, at the VERY end, they show the words 'THE END' which also bring back great memories of movie watching days gone by.",9,7,12,30 April 2017
Saw," Good movie, if you like DEATH.
","I have always LOVED the way that they never make a BLACK MAN the bad guy in these HORROR MOVIES. Danny Glover was just that!! He was a COP!! I loved this movie though, despite that. The blond doctor was good. Much better than he was in his role as the blond guy from FAST and the FURIOUS!! He has aged well, and that kid he was trapped with (the CSI nerd) was good to. The screaming was EXCELLENT. However, I would have escaped from the RAZOR WIRE.The razors detach from the wires making it easy to escape from. TRUST ME, I know. Don't ask me how. Also, that creepy TOILET was all nasty. How come CSI nerd never washed that FECAL MATTER off his hands!!?? That bothered me for the ENTIRE MOVIE!!!!",Null,0,1,14 November 2004
The Last Samurai," Akira Kurosawa, eat your heart out!!
","Ken Watanabe is amazing in this wonderful movie about the Samurai.  As a student of the Samurai ways, I can appreciate the character of Katsumoto. No other character in the history of film conveys the samurai ways more than Katsumoto.   No, I do not fight with swords etc.  But I do live my life in the same thread as Katsumoto!!  I am an actual, real-life samurai who follows the code of the BUSHIDO!!! (Jake doesn't know this that I ama in a way, Samurai). Samurai affiliation is not limited to race, so Tom Cruise being one does not fall into the realm of impossibility. I am a white man and am a samurai. Of course, this amazing movie was shot in Japan, specifically Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan!!  Many of the scenes were shot in California as well.  Anyway, the movie was good.  Sure, it was kind of like Dances with Wolves in a way.  Tom Cruise, as always, DELIVERS THE GOODS.  This is right up there with the best of Cruise.  He looked kick ass in his samurai outfit.  Sure, I know all about Akira Kurosawa and how great he is.  I am the first to admit that I am a student of his methods and have watched the Seven Samurai in great detail.  I have seen the commentary as well.  But let's get something strait, Akira Kurosawa is Akira Kurosawa. Akira Kurosawa is not Ken Wantanbe or Edward Zwick.  The goods were delivered in this movie.  The performance of Ken Watanabe is pure Samurai. I mean, he looked like one.  This movie delivered on all counts in terms of how the Samurai are.   The movie was very accurate.  Samurai do not die in shame.  Samurai are proud.  Samurai devote every waking moment to perfecting their chosen craft.  The Samurai are a very noble people.  It's too bad that the Samurai's values are not more prevalent in today's world.  As for the role of Omura, effortlessly played by Masato Harada, it was nothing short of miraculous.  I was impressed to see how scared he was to get killed by Katsumoto at the end.  In fact, when Katsumoto took his own life at the end, Omura was kind of mad, because in a way, Katsumoto won.  I thought that Tom Cruise was going to kill himself at that moment also.   Yes,  this movie FOCUSED more on the character of Katsumoto than anything.  Katsumoto has the oscar nod this year, not Tom Cruise.   Sure, Cruise was great, but Katsumoto was amazing.   I also liked when Tom Cruise screamed for Sake.  And that fight scene with the wooden swords was great.  Tom Cruise would not give up fighting the amazing Seizo Fukumoto who played the silent Samurai.  That was great.  It was cool how they eventually became friendsand Fukumoto even made sure Tom's armour was on correctly.   If you ever get the chance to VISIT JAPAN, I suggest you DO IT.  Also, look for a cameo of Jackie Chan in the Japanese Army.",10,0,1,20 December 2003
How to Train Your Dragon," Odin would be proud of this movie!!!
","This was such a great movie!! The animation was amazing and the characters were all very real!! I was so impressed!! The dragon's in this movie were just out of this world. The funniest dragon was this gross looking INSECT WINGED dragon which reminded me of Watto from Star Wars - The Phantom Menace. The coolest dragon was of course Toothless. However, I could have chosen a better name for him. This is just a feel good movie about family, courage and fitting in. There were a few moments in the movie where tears welled in my eyes! I was surprised to see that Jonah Hill was doing one of the voices (I thought it was Jack Black at first). One of the best parts of the movie was when the dragon trainer hammered a rock into his gums as a tooth. Great movie. All mighty Thor approve of this movie!! Move over Shrek - HICCUP is in town!!!!",10,1,3,8 May 2010
The Great Raid," Great flick
","I listened to Ghost Soldiers on the road, about a 7 hour Book on CD. Just amazing how much these POW's suffered. It's impossible to do the story justice in two hours but this movie managed to get the point across. What it did not show is what the soldiers who were prisoners did during their three years. They apparently would do baseball make believe etc. to make the time pass and avoid Reality. Benjamin Bratt was amazing as the LTC. Benjamin Bratt did not act that much in this movie. However, Benjamin Bratt did deliver the goods. Joe Fienes was good also as Gibson. I was sad at how he suffered on the day of the rescue. Those darn Japs were so cruel!! They hated us for surrendering. However, they got their act together when we nuked them in August of 45!",10,5,7,10 February 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," My Eyes never shut the entire movie!
","I have seen this movie three times.  Once was at the theater.  The next two times were on television.  I believe that this was in true Kubrick fasion. It's rumored that Tom Cruise was so into his character that he insisted that people called him by his character's name.  He even LIVED on the set.  The movie follows the character by Tom Cruise and his obsession with sex and the underworld that it's taking place in.  There is a lot to this movie.  The only irritating thing about this movie was the dang piano.  The soundtrack was a little strange but hence, Stanley.  That's how Stan prefers to direct. He likes to tease his viewers with strange sounds that lure the viewer into the world that he creates.  In EWS, the goods are delivered mostly by Tom Cruise.  Nichole Kidman's character was forgettable as her character in To Die For.  If it's strangeness that you desire, I would suggest seeing this movie.  It's especially good for Tom Cruise fans.  Seven out of ten  thumbs up.",7,0,1,12 February 2002
The Descent," Gollum's Family meets Coyote Ugly....
","This movie reminded me of going into the MOANING CAVE in Northern CA. This movie is basically about 8 girls who decide to get together and explore a cave. Why? Because one of the girls needed to recover from her HUSBAND'S DEATH...yes, the same husband who was in LAND OF THE DEAD. He had pretty much no part in this movie which was odd. That entire sequence was strange. So, these girls go into some random cave in Tennessee where they encounter a ton of 'crawlers' that can't see and look a lot like Gollum from Lord of the Rings but with more of a pasty appearance and they are all wet. So, these girls are very good at killing them but while they are killing them, they are each dying. One strange and meaningless scene was where Sarah tries to would Juno's leg with her pick Axe. Why? Because Juno ACCIDENTALLY killed some other chick in the cave. Doesn't Sarah realize it's a innocent MISTAKE? Anyway, this movie was basic and had surface qualities only, nothing meaningful and zero character development. But it does give you that creepy Claustrophobic feeling the entire time.",6,3,6,5 August 2006
Inside Man," Denzel delivers the goods
",There is one thing that Denzel can't do - make a bad movie. He delivers the goods in this heist movie about the PERFECT BANK ROBBERY. there are a few twists and a great line in this movie about a Pina Colada. Denzel just always delivers the goods no matter what! The part where the execution took place was a great scene. Denzel was on some sort of cart and was thrust forward in anger. Hard to explain but it was a very interesting scene to say the least. I saw this just after eating at Rubios and missed a few minutes. Jodie Foster was amazing in this movie and has become quite good looking in her ripe old age. This movie is a great SPIKE LEE JOINT.,8,2,4,14 April 2006
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise delivers the goods
","There are those who say that this Tom Cruise movie should have been a 'made for TV movie'. But I am not one of those people. Tom Cruise is the best Hollywood actor of all time in my opinion. I have been a big Tom Cruise fan since Top Gun. Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher in this movie. He is literally hard to reach. Nobody can ever really determine what's going on with him. Tom Cruise is a detective kind of a guy in this flick. I love the way Tom Cruise acts. There are those who say Tom Cruise needs to keep on his shirt. Well, slap me with a crayon noodle and call me crazy, but I thought his build was good. Heck, if I look like Tom Cruise at 50, I will be happy! The scene where Tom Cruise pops out from behind the wall and perfectly kills the black cop was a little over the top. There are those who say the writers were lazy at that point but I think that Tom Cruise was just a good shot. The shooter (Charlie) played by the guy from Gladiator was really good in this role. Tom Cruise was very convincing when he had that telephone conversation with him. Tom Cruise called him like three times and during one of those times - he said 'I think I want to kill you'. Tom Cruise had a lot of tough guy lines in this movie, that's for sure. When Tom Cruise kept bringing up the quarter and the parking meter, I was confused. Why was he so obsessed with the quarter? The black guy at the end told Laura Dern that he had no choice. I was confused about that as well. What was the deal? Did Werner Herzog have his family held hostage or something? Tom Cruise told the black guy toward the end something about the quarter. I still don't get it. I also don't understand why Tom Cruise never did his famous 'fin run'? That's his famous style of running! But I do like how he fought those five guys in the street. That was classic Tom Cruise! 'Remember, you asked for this.' That was funny. It would seem that Tom Cruise has a 'certain set of skills' similar to Jason Bourne and Liam Neison from Taken. That girl who played Sandy was very attractive according to my friend Jake. Yet I have never seen her before. Let's see, what else? I guess I will just say that the scene where Werner Herzog told that guy from True Blood to chew off his fingers was pretty original! Good going Tom Cruise! I have never read a Jack Reacher book and have no idea about him but as far as I am concerned, Tom Cruise IS Jack Reacher.",9,5,18,23 December 2012
Titanic," I liked it but now I don't.
","It's strange, I really liked this movie BEFORE Leonardo because famous.  Now that he's famous and hanging out at all the local hangouts in Hollywood and causing trouble, it's thwarted my opinion of his acting skills.  I will review this movie as if I saw it without knowing about Leo.  Ok, it was great.  I loved the scenes and the character portrayed by Billy Zane (who people say I look like) was perfectly evil.  I have seen lots of movies which involve love but this movie happened to really capture the intensity of love that exists between Kate Winslet and Leo.  I admit, the scene in the car was goofy.  But the scene in the dining room was splendid.  I hated the part where Leo screams that he's the king of the world.  Movies like this and Saving Private Ryan make us so much more interested in History.  I agree that this movie was good.  But heck, I just love history movies.  Three thumbs up!",6,1,4,5 February 2002
The Godfather: Part III," This is not what I WANTED!!!
","But it IS what I wanted. What I wanted was a good GODFATHER movie and as usual, the genius, Francis Ford Coppola delivered the goods. The breakthru of his daughter was a great performance. I was amazed at how good Andy Garcia was. That man is a true actor and a credit to his profession. I was surprised at his amazing performance and how cruel he was as Nick. This was not as good as the first two but much more different. This is the movie that brought an end to the saga. This movie will forever be in my heart. I am a TRUE FAN of these three movies and will watch them all again and again. I loved that part in this movie when Garcia is riding a horse.",7,0,1,9 June 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," This movie was way off and boring
","The love scene between Neo and Trinity was the fall.  They should not have had that.  It made no sense.  Neo doesn't love her.  He is not able to so why would he?  And those twins with the dreadlocks?  What's their deal? They would turn into clear ghost like folks with menacing faces!?  That had nothing to do with the matrix.  The Matrix is the world.  The Architect explained it ALL THE WRONG WAY.  Also, the cavemen of Zion?  Who cares. That is not about the matrix.  The matrix is about computers.  I could care less about this movie and am very upset that I wasted my time on it.",6,0,1,20 October 2003
Mystic River," Clint the Eastwood delivers despite the democrats
","I loved this movie, however, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn are so democrat that it's insane. It was so painfully obvious that their characters were trying to tout their political views on how the Republican's like Rush Limbaugh are bad people and that Clinton is the hero.  don't forget, Sean Penn went to Iraq and inspected bunkers for weapons of mass destruction...and did not find any.  How dare he try to become a weapons inspector!!!!  Anyway, the movie was good.  The story was a tad slow but the acting was very good.  The facial expressions of Sean and Tim were classic and possibly oscar material. yes, you heard me right...OSCAR MATERIAL.  Clint Eastwood did a good job,,,I just hope he's not going to get too leftist on me.  I get sick of the DEMOCRATS acting like REPUBLICANS in the movies...it makes me mad.   I liked the story and the twists were ok.  If only they would have showed more scenes of when Tim Robbins was in the cellar getting his torture.  They didn't deliver on that count to my satisfaction.",Null,0,0,26 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," It's OK, not THAT good though...
","I saw this movie expecting to see Ron Howard at his best. Instead I got him at his NOT SO BEST. The movie was good, don't get me wrong, it's just not THAT good. I was really shocked that (enter spoiler here) Ed Harris and that English dude were not real. That was surprising to me. Also, I heard that Mr. Nash is a gay man kind of? Or at least he 'experimented'? That was LEFT OUT of the film. I liked the way Russell Crowe didn't play a TOUGH GUY in this. Instead, he played a quirky kind of nutcase. He jitters, he mutters and he rambles about stuff. The makeup to make him look OLD was very interesting. I was astonished at that!! All in all, I wish I had seen this earlier. I was in Tulsa all weekend and am kind of woozey as I write this.",5,1,4,2 October 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Dobby vs. Gollum
","The new craze in fantasy movies is to have lovable CG characters such as Jar Jar Binks, Yoda, Gollum and now.......DOBBY.  Yes, Dobby was a highlight of this wonderful adaptation of J.K.'s book.  I finished reading the book this morning at around 9am and swiftly grabbed the news paper to see when the first showing was.  I was not disappointed.  The actors do indeed have lower voices now and they are obviously growing up.  The action is good in this movie also.  I agree with other comments the Draco Malfoy's father is wonderful.  He played a villian in THE PATRIOT and he plays an equally as EVIL person in CHAMBER OF SECRETS.  The movie is long but very good. Hagrid, Dobby, Professor Snape and the gang are in good form in this movie. Quite a performance by the late Sir Richard Harris as well.  I am suprised that the credits didn't mention that this movie was in loving memory of Sir Richard.  Year 2002 will be heralded as the YEAR OF THE FANTASY MOVIES.  I am so thankful that there are two more Harry Potter movies in the COOKER and one more Lord of the Rings.  Thank you Chris Columbus and Peter Jackson.",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Move over Jack Bauer, Mr. Smith is in town!
","This was OK, the best part was when Brad Pitt suspected Angelina of 'knowing' just before the POT ROAST SCENE. That was great. Brad Pitt used his good acting skills to make his way through this movie. Brad Pitt was more lethal than Keifer Sutherland's JACK BAUER. I sure do know that CTU could not have touched Brad Pitt or his wife. Brad Pitt was killing one person after the next. That kid, SETH from The OC was lackluster at best in this movie. I see that Brad Pitt may do a sequel to this movie called 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith Return'. Is this true? I also heard that Brad Pitt met Angelina on this movie. Vince Vaughn must have met JENNIFER ANISTON on the side. Did this movie deliver the goods? I would say it did. It was corny. Still, Brad Pitt is a good action star and could beat up anybody if he wanted - or if he was scripted to do so. Good cameo by Keifer Sutherland by the way.",5,0,4,8 January 2006
Glory Road," good movie
","I saw this movie in Arizona with the actors there and Jerry Bruckheimer. it was a great movie about black people overcoming racism. I went to one of the schools, Eastern New Mexico University - that the team played. I can tell you that it is serious business to play ball at those schools. Josh Lucas has proved himself to be more of an actor than he was in The Hulk. He is good and perhaps will be the next Charlie Sheen if he plays his cars right. The best scene in the movie was when that one white guy was eating chitlins and the black people were laughing at him. I would suggest this movie to anybody who like Remember the Titans. Josh Lucas may be no Denzel, but is is a runner up, that's FOR CERTAIN!",8,5,17,13 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Spray the Blood
","This was a good GROSS movie. The aliens were gross and made FOG HORN SOUNDS just before they would start zapping everybody in sight. I was grossed out and creep-ed out how sinister the tripods appeared to be. Miranda Otto was a great actress in this movie and proved herself to be way more versatile than the Miranda Otto of LORD OF THE RINGS.The Aliens were really mean. They would SCOOPE UP humans and eat them and then spray them all over the earth as kind of MANUER. It was a fertilizer of sorts. Very nasty. Also, when the ALIENS would shoot humans, the HUMANS would instantly turn into ASH (after being mutilated of course). There is no way I would have done what TOM CRUISE DID THOUGH, and drive a car through a crowd of mean people. There are some great CAMEOS in this movie. Look for Joe Satriani as a homeless man. An uncredited SNOOP DOGG can be seen in the fields during one of the attacks.",10,1,6,3 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Move over Abbott and Costello, Vaughn and Owen are in town.
","This movie kicked tail. We saw it this morning, yes, you read that right, we saw it in THE MORNING at the 10am showing. It was so good. There were many good scenes that I can't even start to begin. The part where Vince got raped by crazy lady was priceless. Or the naked painting that was done? Or how about the part where Vince asked Owen if he did the motorboat? Haha. I laughed so hard during this entire movie that I forgot that I even went to New Mexico Military Institute with Owen from 1985-87. He is the next action/comedy star of the earth. After the movie, I had a good salad and played Donkey Kong at Buffalo Wings and Things. I suggest this movie to anybody who wants to laugh, cry and scream at the same time.",10,1,6,17 July 2005
Ice Age," Great movie
","This movie was 80 minutes but very good.  I liked the way Ray Romano played the Mammoth.  I mean, the Mammoth just worked so well with Ray Romano's voice.  The movie is kind of predictable but has a lot of funny moments between the sloth and the mammoth.  I also like Scrat, the saber toothed chipmunk.  He was in this movie as pure comic relief! Great flick and Dennis Leary delivered the goods as the Saber Tooth Tiger.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
Man on Fire," I sure do like Denzel
","Denzel is so good in this movie. He never reveals what He and Walken did. However, walken said that Denzel's charactor is a artist who's works in the art of death...and is about to PAINT HIS MASTERPIECE. I imagine that he and Denzel did some kind of covert activity in VIETNAM and shot a bunch of innocent civiliams or something. The way Denzel seeks his revenge is good. The rapport between he and South Dakota Fanning was really nice. It was so sad when that one SPOILER event surfaced at the end (toward the end actually). I heard that Mexico City is becoming so corrupt. It is so sad if that's Tue. I loved the scenes in this movie that were in the mountains. I was surprised that the main dude (The Voice) lived in such poverty. I guess it's cuz he wanted to keep a low cover. Tony Scott directed this. His brother is Riddle Scott - who also directed Hannibal. The pan who played PATSY in Hannibal played the Mexican FBI agent in this movie...a small bit of TRIVIA.",Null,0,2,1 May 2004
Downfall," The perfect portrayal of The Fuhrer
","This movie was LONG, yes you read that right. It was interesting to see so many different things about The Fuhrer that I did not realize. Who knew that he was so polite to his SECRETARY. Also, the way he was CRAZY to his own GENERALS!!! The Fuhrer was always shaking his hand also. Did he have PARKKINSONS? The characters in this movie were all right on. There was NOT A SINGLE American!! The Fuhrer was the main character. Boy, those Generals were sure LOYAL to The Fuhrer. He was so mean and hated Jews. This is the FIRST movie I have seen, other than the movie with Robert Carlisle, that portrays Fuhrer, The. The entire movie was in SUBTITLES but that did not BOTHER ME. The women were great. That one lady was ruthless who killed her own kids though. This movie was MUCH LESS VIOLENT than other NAZI movies. As, it shows The Fuhrer (who never really killed himself).",10,1,9,18 March 2005
American Gangster," Move over Don Corleone, Frank Lucas is in town
","If you are looking for a movie that is fast paced, this is not it. This movie was really show but don't worry, it was a good slow. Denzel Washington keeps making great movies. This time he was a rich man who sold heroin on the streets of New Jersey and Harlem. I loved Russell Crowe's amazing ability to move out of his Aussie accent and into a Jersey accent. Then there was the corrupt cop played by Josh Brolin. Geeze, he sure was mean wasn't he? And he was just in that movie called No Country for Old Men which was also excellent. I sure hope that the commentary is interesting on this movie when the DVD release comes out. One of the climactic scenes was when Denzel and Crowe were pushing the coffee back and fourth across the table. The tension was so thick, you could have cut it with a razorblade!!",9,0,2,15 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Way to Go George!!!
","This movie will be heralded as the best Star Wars Prequel ever!! This was better than the first two. I thought that Anikan delivered a good performance and that he was not wooden at ALL!! Of course, General Greivous stole the SHOW!! He coughed a little too much, but THAT IS OK. Also, Yoda had very interesting EYE EXPRESSIONS. That one scene where he approaches the Sith Lord was INTENSE!! He fought so hard that his ROBE FELL OFF!! That reminded me of when I would take of the ROBE OF THE ACTION FIGURE when I was a KID. He had the SAME KIND OF FRAIL BODY!!! Also, what about MACE WINDU!? That is one mean JEDI!! The worst part of the movie was that that DARTH VADER SHOULD HAVE TALKED MORE. The Death Star and the green uniforms that were being worn toward the end were a great transition to 'A NEW HOPE.' I loved this movie and I saw it ALONE at the SCOTTSDALE MALL!!! I even ate a TACO BEFORE HAND!!!",10,0,7,22 May 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," I enjoyed this movie THEN and NOW.

Disney was a GENIOUS!  I loved the music in this movie.  I always whistle while I work anyway.  I was surprised to recall how SCARY that witch was!!  She was CREEPY!  And those DWARFES were so cool!  There were a few strange scenes.  Like when the dwarfs all go to sleep and uses eachother's BUTTS as pillows???  Regardless, this movie DELIVERED THE GOODS.",Null,2,4,6 March 2003
Lord of War," This was a great movie, and true!!
","I saw this at the Scottsdale Mall because I was bored on a Sunday afternoon. I sure don't regret it! Nick Cage didn't want to HURT anybody. He just wanted to make money. It's too bad that he got on Ethan Hawke's bad side. It's amazing how cool Nick played everything when he was gun running. He sold guns to that Muslim dude from OZ. That was intense!! It was also intense the way He snorted cocaine mixed with gun powder! I have never heard of that before. All in all, I would suggest this to all my friends, even Jake. This movie was not an ACTION movie per say, but more of a narrative on the gun running business. Look out for Jaret Leto as the brother. And the cameo by Owen Wilson was odd, but fair. All in all, I loved THE LORD OF WAR. I prefer it to other movies that are currently out.",8,0,6,26 September 2005
1408," Well done Mr. Cusack
","This was a great HORROR movie. Yes, you read that right. John Cusack delivers the goods in this Stephen King MOVIE about a man who thinks he can stay in a HOTEL ROOM that is evil for one night. He does so in order to PROVE that it is not really HAUNTED or EVIL. However, the joke is on him! Yes, as he is trying to tough it out in this HOTEL ROOM, many strange things happen. Not the least of which is when the CHOCOLATE APPEARS on the PILLOW! I was really SCARED when the WINDOW slammed down on John's hand as well. Oh yes, this was a CREEPY movie. There were many CREEPY moments. I wish Samuel L Jackson would have had more of a role though. If you want to see a good HORROR movie where the main acting is all done by ONE person, then see 1408!",10,1,4,22 July 2007
The Iron Giant," The Vin Diesel Effect IS HERE!!
","Vin was totally right for the voice  here.  The movie is animated and very emotional.  There were times when I was reminded of the way I felt when watched ET for the first time.  There are many similarities between this movie and many other NON ANIMATED movies that portray racism and isolation. The poor robot was so likable.  I mean, this is the first time I have ever been so touched by a cartoon and I am 31 years old!  Rent this, or better yet BUY it.  It is a huge success in my book.",8,0,1,23 January 2002
Vanilla Sky," I really liked this movie.
","I saw this movie because I like Tom Cruise.  I feel he is a terrific actor. I never know that Keith Campbell was the actor who was in the scenes where Tom wore a mask and interacted with Kurt Russell.  Anyway, this movie is a love story intwined with some serious sci fi.  Tom Cruise plays a cocky 30 something year old who falls for Penelope Cruise (no relation to Tom......yet).  However, at one point Tom Cruise is in a horrible accident and must learn to live with his face all scarred up and disfigured.  The twists turn like crazy after this.  Jason Lee from DOGMA is superb as Tom's carefree friend.  The acting is great, the music is wonderful and the photography is unbelievable.  The end was criticized by many but I actually liked it.  Yes, this movie does deliver the goods.  7 thumbs up!",8,20,35,22 February 2002

","Iron Man was a pretty good movie. It is obvious that Robert Downey Jr has found his true calling. He is a very convincing super hero. I am not a comic book fanatic and don't really know much about the history of Iron Man. However, you don't need to know this to really enjoy the movie. A barely recognizable Jeff Bridges plays a big part in this movie. His head is shaved yet his voice sounds pretty much like ol' Jeff Bridges. There are a few corny scenes in this movie that include Terrence Howard. Yes, there is a scene where he looks at a very shiny Iron Man outfit and says 'another time'. In other words this movie is being set up for a SEQUEL! Movie purists will scoff at the scene when Iron Man FLEW from the United States into Afghanistan beat up a few people and then came back. Purists will question how HE DID THIS? How did he go to the bathroom while flying that distance? Or how about when he was testing out his flight suit and was body slammed against the wall at about 70 MPH? He didn't even get INJURED? Also, that funky looking FAKE HEART that was installed in his chest was not fully explained. All in all, a great movie. Not enough special effects. This isn't like Batman when there is a lot of crime fighting. There were a few scenes when it would have been appropriate for Jack Bauer to show up, especially when that bald terrorist was going to make that one guy CHEW on a RED HOT ROCK. Sheesh, talk about a horrible method of torture!! Two thumbs up!",10,3,8,5 May 2008
Bruce Almighty," Alrighty THEN, this was good but corny!!
","The best parts of this movie were WHEN BRUCE was acting like GOD.  I didn't like the romance factor that was there between Jennifer Aniston and Bruce. That was just plain corny...especially that speech,,or should I say 'prayer', he gave God at the very end.But heck, each scene that was acted by Carey was brillian in spite of the corny lovey dovey scenes.    It's no CABLE GUY but it still delivers some goods.",Null,0,1,13 June 2003
Signs," The sign says 'GREAT MOVIE!'
","When Ebert and Roper said that they wish Night would direct all movies, I have to agree.  I saw Signs last night and it was the perfect movie.  It had all the elements of suspense that rival even Hitchcock.  The movie depended on good acting, directing and realism.  There was no gore or special effects that movies sutch as Indep. Day and ET used.  One of my friends warned me that the alien looked like somebody who stumbled into a costume shop and purchased an alien outfit.  Let me tell you, my friend was mistaken.  The bump in the night stuff that this movie has is great.  Mel Gibson does a great job a a man who lost his faith in God after his wife dies a horrible death.  Then there are more signs....not just the crop circles but other signs.  I will not tell you what these signs are or it would ruin the movie. I maintain that Night will indeed be THE next Spielberg if he continues making movies like this.",Null,0,2,31 July 2002
Identity," A good thriller with good acting
",It's nice to see John Cusac return to his ROOTS of acting in a serious roll. He does a good job in IDENTITY.  I liked this movie a lot. The acting was great and the fact that the entire movie took place at NIGHT was also a good touch.  I like Ray Liotta's character and liked the MULTIPLE PERSONALITY aspect to this movie.,Null,0,0,12 May 2003
Amélie," Amelie is a woman I would marry!
","First of all, this is a great movie.  It has Amelie, who is a little different and nobody can relate to her.  That's something that really struck me.  I saw that despite the lack of friends etc. that she has in life, she really made an effort make life INTERESTING.  Heck, she even pretended that certain things were happenening when in fact, they were not.  The scenary in France was so awesome.  It was only a few minutes before I forgot that this was a subtitled movie!  Can you say DELIVER THE GOODS?  This actress that played Amelie blows many American actresses out of the water!  I would consider this to be on my top ten foreign films of ALL TIME!",7,0,1,3 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Peter Jackson is a Genious
","This movie captured the imagination.  Sure, it had Gollum in it, but heck...what's to not like about that little creature!!??  I loved this movie and saw it four times at the theater.  Samwise the great was excellent. Sean Astin was snubbed for the oscar in that role.  Of course, Frodo was played by Elija Wood.  He was BORN for that role.  Every single person in this movie was BORN FOR THEIR ROLE.  The visuals were great.  The cameo by Eddie Van Halen was very strange.  However, the movie was hardcore.  Viggo apparently was so into this role as Aragorn that he forgot who he really was and thought that middle earth was a real place etc.   How much more into a ROLE can you get?  Peter Jackson, you are a GENIOUS!!!",10,0,1,27 January 2004
Munich," Long movie
",This movie was pretty long but good. I was not aware the the amazing Eric Bana played the main character. He was very good and has once again proved himself to be the poor man's Tom Cruise. The violence in this movie was very real and the plot was very hard to understand. I didn't love this movie and it is the least good out of all the Oscar nominees. I ate a veggie burger after seeing this movie by the way and was reminded about how ironic it was that we were watching the Winter Olympics on the TV and how there could be another attack. You never know though. The amazing Palestinian's are very bizarre in this movie and the female from Holland was a bizarre sub plot that went nowhere. Those bizarre guns were very interesting....that looked like air pumps!!,7,0,0,12 February 2006
Godzilla," The worst movie
","I thought I had seen some bad movies, but the new Godzilla takes the cake. Spiderman 2 was terrible but not nearly as awful as Godzilla. All the things you see in the previews are fake. Bryan Cranston dies early on and has a role that is demeaning for such a brilliant actor. If you are expecting to see Heizenberg from Breaking Bad, don't get your hopes up. There is no similarity between the two characters. Oh, and the moth monsters? They were so obviously fake looking that my nephew could have made them on his iPad. The CG these days is just terrible. I am not sure who directed this movie but the way it was directed was extremely poor. The casting for the movie was awful as well. Whoever those two main characters were, were very miscast. Oh, and about Godzilla? Did he knock planes out of the sky? No he didn't. That was an EMP. I am furious that this movie was made. The Godzilla monster screamed and it was so obviously a rip off of dinosaurs that I laughed. When Godzilla started breathing fire like a dragon, I laughed my ass off. How much of a rip off is that? Can you saw SMAUG? The ending was terrible also. Godzilla just swims off in the ocean. Oh, and the Ocean turned into a tsunami when Godzilla appeared? Yeah right, there is no way that would happen. Everything about this movie was beyond terrible. I should have skipped this movie. Shame on the director for making this movie. My life is truly a tad worse for having experienced such trash.",1,22,47,20 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Neat Movie
","This is a neat movie about these two robots who get into some trouble in outer space.  One of them is golden and very smart.  He hangs out with a little robot who can't talk but just beeps.  They seem to be best friends and stuff.  Anyway, they try to get found because they are always lost. They make friends with most people including a sasquatch type of monster and his friend who is like an outer space cowboy.  They have adventures and eventually meet up with this black robot who wears a cape.  I think he is part vampire or something.  Like a space vampire, ya know?  They also are friends with this blond guy who gets mad at his uncle because he can't do fun stuff with his friends in the desert.  His uncle wants him to do chores but the blond guy wants to do space stuff and be a super fighter like his father.  The Golden robot and his little friend who rolls around make their way to the desert where the blond guy buys them from some monks who are only like 4 feet tall and squeak at eachother.  A lot of space stuff happens after this.  They all get thrown into a garbage compactor and snakes attack the blond man.  At the end, the blond man shoots rockets into this little hole that is on a large plastic planet.  The planet blows up and the robots stand with the blond man and look at the stars.  Pretty neat movie overall.",Null,0,0,28 July 2002
Get Him to the Greek," Jonah Hill delivers the goods
","This was another good movie by the amazing Jonah Hill. Well, Jonah Hill didn't really WRITE it but he had a funny character in this movie. Basically it was about how Jonah Hill and this English POP STAR buddy up in an effort to make it back to a concert in LA. I like Jonah Hill and how he has such a subtle sense of humor. Jonah Hill really made me laugh when he smoked that amazing joint. Without Jonah Hill this movie would have fallen flat. Puffy's character was really funny and he interacted with Jonah Hill in a funny way. Jonah Hill was constantly being bitched out by Puffy. That was funny when Jonah Hill looked at his cell phone and Puffy texted him that he was going to kill him :). So, if you want to laugh and are a fan of Jonah Hill I would suggest seeing this movie. Jonah Hill must have gained about 40 pounds for this. As if Jonah Hill wasn't already heavy enough.",6,1,8,13 June 2010
Fantastic Four," Fantastic to an extent - Vic Mackey
","It's just one thing, Vik Mackey as THE THING. He talked just like Vik Mackey which was really cool. There was no character development AT ALL. The entire traffic scene in which pure carnage was unleashed, was ALL THE FAULT of The Thing. He should have let that guy JUMP to his death. And then there is Dr. Doom, or shall I say, Doctor Van Doom. What kind of weirdo CEO has the last name of DOOM? I guess a Marvel Comic Book character does, that's who!! And what was the deal with the Invisible Girl? She has a force field that bent light? That was odd. This movie was so so. What you see is what you get. Tedd Gilbert's wife is expecting a child. I wonder if this child will grow to like The Fantastic Four?",6,0,5,9 July 2005
John Wick: Chapter 2," The Wick on this movie candle is burning out...
","I have always liked Keanu Reeves and this movie was a movie in which I did not know what to expect. But the bottom line, there was excessive shooting. WAY too much. Here is what I took away from the movie:1. For some reason, he kept his suit in a safety deposit box. 2. There is not a SINGLE police officer in all of New York City. 3. Keanu Reeves was 'The Warriors'. As he walked around the city, everybody (literally) tried to kill him for a reward. 4. In the catacombs at the beginning, he was running and shooting with perfect aim and killing literally everybody chasing him (in the dark). It was like watching a PS3 game. 5. 'Consider it a professional Courtesy' was a cheesy line by when Keanu Reeves stabbed Common the rapper in the aorta so he wouldn't bleed to death.(he left the knife plugged in). 6. When Common and Keanu Reeves were walking down the mall and Common was on the top level, he and Keanu Reeves kept aiming their guns at the other person from the HIP and firing shots. They missed each other every single time and neither person tried to take cover or run. Non of the other customers even noticed the gunfire. 7. Keanu Reeves meeting with Lawrence Fishburn was obviously a nod to The Matrix 8. In a lot of scenes, the victim would scream and fall down BEFORE getting shot. the director should have done those kill scenes again.All in all, it was a decent movie but seriously, can you have less killing in part three? John Wick was shooting and stabbing people for almost the entire movie with not much of a break. According to somebody who actually COUNTED the people Keanu Reeves killed, it was 128. Like I said, my candle for Keanu Reeves has a wick that is slowly burning to the end. I might have to ask Keanu Reeves to make another movie as John Wick but to put a little more effort into SLOW KILLS and not Modern Warfare style kills.",5,1,5,16 June 2017
Jackie Brown," My favourite performance by Sammy Jackson
","This movie was over two hours long.  It was not like Pulp Fiction but it was great.  The chemistry between The Bail bondsman and Jackie Brown was one of the highlights.  Robert Forster is becoming one of my favourite actors to watch now.  The first movie I saw of his was DIAMOND MEN.  This was the second.  Also, Samual L. Jackson sports a very odd long hair getup with a strange goatee.  He is pure evil in this movie.  I mean, he's more evil in this movie than his character in PULP FICTION.  He uses the MF word and the N word in literally EVERY SENTENCE!!  He is intense!!  Bobby DeNiro was also good.  He played a doofus who was kind of like Sammy's side kick.  If you want to see a movie was terrific dialogue and writing, see JACKIE BROWN!!!!",Null,0,1,29 September 2002
Sin City," Yellow Bastard Rules! Benicio Del Toro!!
","All the folks who DIED in this movie DESERVED IT!!! Benicio Del Toro delivered goods in this. Benicio Del Toro was really evil. Of course, Benicio Del Toro did not compare to MARV, the deformed COP!!! Yes,that dude could FIGHT and his skull was made of STEEL! I would have LOVED to have fought that guy with Benicio Del Toro watching!!! The action in this MOVIE was GOOD. It was ABOVE BAR!! Since there is no carpet in my house, the ECHO made for a good effect!!! Benicio Del Toro died in a strange way!! The VIETNAMESE girl who was swift with the weapons was SYMPATHETIC to Benicio Del Toro. Yes, Benicio Del Toro should get an award for this role. However, Benicio Del Toro and Frodo Baggins will have to wait. Benicio Del Toro will resurrect his role soon!!! Benicio Del Toro, WAY TO GO!",7,0,3,16 October 2005
Gangs of New York," Terrific sets and costume design!!!
","This movie was so intriguing to me because of Daniel Lewis.  He was so credible as Bill Cutting, Bill the Butcher.  The clothing that he wore, the way he spoke and the rage that consumed him made for a very memorable performance.  He should get nominated for this easily come the Oscars.  As for Leonardo, he was good also.  Cameron Diaz was, as always, forgettable. But I can't stress enough how Marty S. pulled this one off.  I have always been very interested in New York history.  There is a lot that I didn't realize went on in New York in those days..such as feuding between fire departments and the immense hatred of Irish immigrants.  Also, the hatred of Lincoln!  I had no idea he was so hated by those opposed to the draft. There were also scenes when as soon as the Irish immigrants got off the boat, they enrolled for the DRAFT!!  In any event, this is a three hour movie and it's good.  Sure, it's violent but it's also a historical epic.  I give this two thumbs up BIG TIME.",Null,0,0,5 January 2003
Coach Carter," We all need a Coach Carter
","If only I had a Coach Carter in life. I should as hell would not want to LET HIM DOWN. He makes his players do tons of PUSH UPS and SUICIDES. I remember when I played hoops, I had to do more pushups than I could ever imagine. Mr. Carter pretty much looks like Mace Windu with his hair all shaved off and stuff. There was a lot in this movie other than just basketball. This movie had some guns and stuff that shot bullets. I mean, I am sitting here right now and some guy just got shot!!!! I guess shooting can have more to do these days that just basketballs through a basket, now it's bullets through a gun. Dang Ya'll. Jake never shoots hoops.",5,0,0,9 August 2005
Mad Max: Fury Road," If you like action, this movie is for you
","This movie was really big on action and had a lot of explosions and violence. I read that all of the stuff in this movie was actually stunts and very minimal CG. I just hate it when a movie hides behind CG. Now onto the movie. There are a lot of things I wonder about. Like the warboys and what their deal was. It seemed like the really loved Joe. How did Joe get his first name? What does immortan mean? I am so curious also as to the back story of Joe. I'd like to see the next movie maybe be a prequel and talk bout what Joe's back story was and what he used to be like. Could be really be Goose? I am not sure. But his horse tooth mask was really neat. As for Max, well let's just say he didn't talk too much. I like his way of speaking though. Kind of reminded me of Bane from Batman actually. haha. The rest of the movie was good. I noticed that they never really stopped almost ever. Even to fix the vehicle they would just keep driving. This was really neat. Did you notice that there was a big difference in color between night and day shooting? This was a nod to the old school which I really appreciated. So, if you like your movies packed with action, you will like this movie. There are also some new techniques of fighting introduced into the fold in Mad Max. I am talking about the pole vault fighters. That was neat. So was the scene were the motorcycles were jumping and throwing bombs. So much action. I give this movie to gas tanks of guzzling up!",7,3,11,7 June 2015
Donnie Darko," Wierd and Wonderful!!!
","When I saw this on sale for 9 dollars, I knew I had to purchase DONNIE DARKO.   This is a terrific movie about an oddball named Donnie who is far more intelligent than most of his counterparts.  He is tormented by a person dressed up in a BUNNY SUIT.  The person in the suit tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days.  The rest of the movie is highy psychological.  Patrick Swazey's character was interesting.  I would suggest that everybody see this movie, espcially those who feel that they've never really fit in.  Strange folks.  This movie is fun to watch and one of the few that I plan to watch again and again.",Null,1,2,23 February 2003
Hustle & Flow," Move over Denzel Washington, Terrence Howard is in town
","Terrence Howard was very good as the pimp in this movies. Terrence Howard is amazing and his acting is accompanied by ANTHONY ANDERSON who also delivered the goods. The best part was when Terrence Howard was talking to Skinny Black in the bar. That was a great scene. I won't say what Terrence Howard did. He is a great actor and WHOOP THAT TRICK stuck in my head for days after seeing this movie. Terrence Howard is a rapper in disguise. He was able to pull off the Terrence Howard shuffle with no problem at all. Terrence Howard is not Denzel yet, but he is well onto his way. Terrence Howard is the next big black thing to come out of Hollywood. I hope that Terrence Howard decides to continue making great movies because he is up there with Forrest Whittaker now!",10,0,0,18 January 2006
Cinderella Man," Good movie
","This movie was so good. I had no idea that Max Bear was so mean and liked to kill people. I am glad the Ron Howard portrayed Max Bear as the evil beast he is. There is no better fighter than John Braddock. Russell Crowe is good. Russell Crowe, as always, delivered the goods. There are few Russell Crowes in this world. Russell Crowe can really fight!! I liked that part when Russell Crowe was almost challenged to a fight with Mike in the street. Russell Crowe should do more of these kinds of movies. Russell Crowe and Ron Howard and the John Wayne and Jack Ford of this century.Rush said it best:A modest man from Mandrake Travelled rich to the city He had a need to discover A use for his newly-found wealthBecause he was human Because he had goodness Because he was moral They called him insane Delusions of grandeur Visions of splendor A manic depressive He walks in the rainEyes wide open Heart undefended Innocence untarnished...Cinderella Man Doing what you can They can't understand What it means Cinderella Man Hang on to your plans Try as they might They cannot steal your dreamsIn the betrayal of his love he awakened To face a world of cold reality And a look in the eyes of the hungry Awakened him to what he could doHe held up his riches To challenge the hungry Purposeful motion For one so insane They tried to fight him Just couldn't beat him This manic depressive Who walks in the rain",10,3,6,5 June 2005

However, I did LAUGH at a lot of the scenes.The funny parts were when White would TALK and say STUPID things that really MADE NO SENSE.The NOT FUNNY PARTS were the 'mushy' parts that were played out between the love interests.  However, with THAT being said, this movie delivered a laugh or three.  I would not cast Ben Stiller in this role because it was just not real.  How did they MAKE HIM SO SHORT?  I like VINCE VAUGHN in this role.  He had a few good laughs.  I hated that pirate.  However, the movie was STOLEN BY STEVE ROOT!!  yes, the man who plays BILL from KING OF THE HILL!!

He must also like Peter Jackson...because there are a few scenes where somebody gets shot...and 100 gallons of blood spray out at FIREHOSE PRESSURE!!!  This even happens when a HAND is shot...yes, you heard me correct, a stand alone hand.   Way to go Tappert, Ramie and Campbell!!  You out did yourselves again!!!  Yeah!!!",Null,1,2,21 December 2003
Up in the Air," a sad sad and depressing movie about being all alone
","Don't get me wrong, I love George Clooney. It was refreshing to see him in this role. He is basically a man who company's hire to fire people. During most of the movie he flys from town to town with this girl and tries to show her THE ROPES. There is a great scene toward THE END with Sam Elliot where he is some kind of CAPTAIN. It was a strange scene because GEORGE reached 10 million miles. As a reward, the captain of the airplane left the COCKPIT and sat down next to George. That CAPTAIN was played by SAM. He had a huge mustache and the conversation he was making with GEORGE seemed strange and forced. It was very strange to see him. In fact, he looked like he was made out of plastic. The rest of the movie was good and the fact that George Clooney didn't try and act tough or funny was a nice touch.",8,0,1,28 February 2010
V for Vendetta," Zorro meets Lord or the Rings
","This movie was actually very good. It's interesting how Hugo Weaving played a character whose face you never saw. Hugo was the ELF KING in the Lord of the Rings. There were many good scenes in this movie such as the orchestra scene. Yes, there was a scene in which V conducts an orchestra where the sounds are from Hell. Was V good? I am not sure. Was he evil? Perhaps. All I know is that there is a new Hero in town, and his name is V. It's always great to see Natalie Portman deliver the goods. She sure does in this movie. There is a great deal of violence. V is ruthless and has no mercy for those who wronged him. He was messed up in a nuclear kind of experimentation and fire. I am still unsure of why he became so powerful. All I know is that I want to see a sequel to this.",9,0,1,18 September 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Ron Burgundy is funnier than Ricky Bobby
","This movie was good, don't get me wrong, but I feel that Anchorman was better. The plots are similar. Just like when Ron Burgundy went from a hotshot anchor to a nobody - so does Ricky Bobby from Nascar hero to pizza delivery boy on a bicycle. Then they rebound to stardom. Anyway, this was a good movie. I loved the way that Ricky Bobby and his friend constantly said SHAKE AND BAKE to each other to get hyped up. The best part was at dinner when they had tons of fast food and were saying grace to the Baby Jesus. Yes, you read that right, Ricky Bobby was profusely thanking 'The Baby Jesus' for all the food they were about to receive. Then the other folks at the table became upset because Jesus was an adult with a beard....haha. Then Ricky Bobby kept on saying that he prefers to think of Jesus as a baby!! This reminded me of my cousin David saying that he found a piece of driftwood that was used to beat up the baby Jesus. The rest of the movie was fun. I would see this again. But there will never be another RON BURGUNDY!!!",7,1,4,7 August 2006
The Godfather," The Godfather is a good movie
","I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also.",10,7,13,5 May 2006
