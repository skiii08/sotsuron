The Legend of Bagger Vance," Magical...gives you a sense of humanity towards the game of golf.
","I liked the movie, very much. It had this magical feel to it. It kind of gives a person a sense of humanity towards the game of golf. I think it was the best golf movie I've seen. Matt Damon did a wonderful job, along with Charlize Theron. I believe this is the 2nd best performance by Will Smith, after Ali. The visual look to the movie was fantastic. It's got a good humor to it as well. I loved the background music for this film. It was a great work of art.",Null,0,1,6 April 2002
