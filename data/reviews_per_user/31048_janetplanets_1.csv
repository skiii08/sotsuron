Changeling," An okay Eastwood movie
","I was kind of disappointed in this movie because it turned out to be much more of a melodrama than a thriller. There were a few good scary moments, like when Angelina Jolie realizes that the kid is not hers at the train station. That was great Eastwood directing. While Angelina Jolie delivered one of her most believable and moving performances, I still could not help feeling that she was somehow miscast. As for the story, it had some good twists but overall it got pretty predictable mid-way through when we realized that most likely this crazy killer had kidnapped walter and other kids. The rest played like a made-for-TV movie, but higher caliber because Eastwood is the directing. I also didn't like the ending, it came across as much sillier than I think it was intending to. Kudos also go out to John Malkovich who was great (as usual) in this movie.",4,4,12,6 February 2009
