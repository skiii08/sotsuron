The Blair Witch Project," Un-Scary Movie of The Year
","The movie,The Blair Witch Project,was two words,Pure Genius.  I liked this movie because it wasn't scary. Everyone said this was the scariest movie of the year. All they would do was scream whenever they heard some scary songs. The only scary part of this movie is when they all go into the house and disappear. Most of the time they all would run around screaming and swearing. Another good part of this movie was when the Witch leaves things all around for the people to find. It wasn't scary when all they would do was cry all the time and swear at each other. They tried to make it scary by having the people who lived in the town,act like they all knew about the 'witch'. And some of them said they had seen the 'witch' before. They would tell the film-makers stories about the witch..to try to scare us as an audience.  So, in conclusion this movie was NOT SCARY at all. This was a real original in the way it was made, and don't get me wrong I liked this movie, its just it just wasn't scary enough for me.BY: K.M.B.G",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
The Blair Witch Project," A scary sensation
","The movie The Blair Witch Project was an outstanding movie. It was so scary that you were on the edge of your of your seat the whole time. the thing that I didn't like about it was the camera never stopped moving around.	This movie is so scary that it made it seam like you were the one being chased. One of the most scariest parts of the movie was when of the guys was found missing. Through that whole night, you could hear things that were very scary. The next morning the girl found a bundle of sticks outside of the tent and inside the sticks was the guys fingers. 	The bad thing about the movie is that the movie was shot by and eight millimeter camera. Throughout the movie the camera is shaking. One time it was really bad was when they were being chased by the Blair Witch at night. You couldn't even see anything, once in a while you could see a tree. Some people say that they got motion sickness. 	In conclusion, I think that the Blair Witch Project was a great movie, even though it had a down side. However, the scaryness over came the shaking of the camera.				By SRVHS student, 					Ed",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch Project
","The movie Blair Witch Project was a supense horror that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The movie was excellent from the acting to the special effects.  The movie was based on three student filmmakers who wail doing a documentary on the Blair Witch get lost in the woods.  The legend of the Blair Witch states that Elly Kedword lured several children into her home and drew blood from their bodies.  She was charged with witchcraft and sent into the woods to die.  A year later at least half of the town's children vanished, while the town's people feared that they should never say the words Elly Kedword again. The one thing that stands out the movie was the special effects.  One of the best special effects of the entire movie was how they set it up for  the students to be the ones filming the movie.  The way the camera always moved during the movie is what made it so good; they set the seen with it.  See, that just gave the movie life.  It makes you thinks like you are in the movie,like you are running away.  You do get scared by watching the camera shake in fear like you are. The second thing that stands out in the movie was how they set the scene.  How it was so dark in the woods ans the Witches were able to hear the charter hearts beat fast as possible.  This will make you look at camping in a whole other way.  This movie had it from beging to end.  The way they started the movie by their tape and ended in a last breath. Further more I recommend this movie for it's originality, and suspense. I guarantee you will be able to hear your own heart beat by the end of the movie.    by Katy S.R.

The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch Evaluation
","The eerie tale of three college students entering the woods where the Blair Witch, supposedly lives. The very recognizable plot also the theory emphasized, the un-seen equals scarier. The simplistic tale probably had many directors in Hollywood, kicking themselves pondering why they didn't think of it first. A film I fo one say should be awarded for for well efforts and acting. Bringing the film into a well perspective on how a true human acts. 	Immediately seeing the commercial it is recognizable what the plot is, three average college students that are goofing around want to make a documentary on the Blair Witch. Trying to gain further imformation they set out for the woods to find out what really lurks in the deep foliage. as the plot thickens the audience knows that their in the woods, loose their map, and lost. Pressing on farther into the woods, they slowly under go phases of a mental breakdown. On top of their stresses to keep a steady mind, they are introduced to many incounters they wish not to see. Examples of piles of rocks around their camp site, stick figures that mimic a human body. All these visions and phases, slowly tears the group apart. from then on they know something is following them. Another day passes and the students are never seen again. 	Is the seen or un-seen scarier? The un-seen from my perspective seems a tad bit scarier. Not to know where this so called witch is in the night as the strange noisese fill the night air. Not knowing how far or near she/he is they sit in silence scared out of their minds. 	From beginning, middle and end, these actors expessed themselves on how a true person would act in this kind of situation.",Null,0,1,17 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," i did not enjoy this film
","Unfortunatly the movie Star wars lacked in 2 things, Acting and story.something that makes a good movie come alive is acting. The acting in star wars was not very good. Like when they found the boy anakin in the shop and he was talking to the jedi's. He sounded unnatural and his movements were stiff and not very fluint. Also when he was trying to escape from the inside of the enemy ship. The way that he acted and spoke was vey unrealistic. When waves of droids appeared he had a calm voice like there was no real danger in the enemies ship, making it not match with the intesity of the movie. The most important thing that makes a good movie is an enjoyable story. I did not enjoy star wars story. The use of robots as their army did not match the original story line because the original did not have robots but real soldiers. Also when the jedi's are heling the naboo natives escape they were chopping the robots in half and destoying them with their own lasers. I think tha the scene was kind of corny and unrealistic because of the over use of enemies. in conclusion i thought that this movie was not good enough to carry on the famous starwars movies and should have been better worked out than it actually was. the movie had no real story and poor character development and acting.",Null,0,1,17 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The force is not strong in this one.
","I think that Star Wars Episode: ONE rates at a 5 out of 10. I think this because of two things. First is it's excellen graphics and second on its lame plot. This movie I consider a good movie to see if you like star wars a lot but otherwise it's not quite worth your time. I have to congratulate Lucas on his excellent computer generated graphics. I waoul say that this is the break though incomputer graphics for movies. Throughout the entir movie there is something that is computer generated. This seems hard but what is even harder would be the scene when an actor has to tackle a computer-generated character. If you want to see good graphics and special effects then this is the movie to see. However it seem s that Lucas spent so much time on the graphics it seems that he neglected the rest of the movie. The two main characters have this thing they do which is complete trust in there ablities to know the right spot to stand to not be shot. Seeing a droid miss them for the fourtieth time is just to much. The plot is also lack with two jedi sent out to stop the evil trade federation doesn't quite appeal. Last luck is always with them even in all logic they would be killed. one example of this is when Anakin accidently fires a torpeoe that accidently sets off a chain reaction that saves the day. Luck just acts funny in this movie. All this considered this is a better than average movie so if you have the time then see it but otherwis there probably is something better for you to do. The graphics are the best, and the acting isn't horrible. Last the plot to describe the plot 'Its Star Wars'.Byron SRVUSD",Null,0,1,17 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, children of all ages would love this movie!
","I think Star Wars episode I, the Phantom Menace was a good Sci-fi fantasy movie. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, children of all ages also would like this action packed movie. This prequel. explains many things about episodes 3, 4, and 5.                 Anakin Skywalker is growing up and Obi wan is a Jedi in training.The Special effects in this movie were great. One great scene was the trip to Ottogunga. It had big fish and the underwater area was great. Of course the lightsabers area still really cool. Darth Mal has a double bladed lightsaber which is quiet cool.Action is one thing you'll not miss in episode one. From pod racing to lightsaber battles, you'll love it. A BIG battle was the Gungans versus the trade federation's troops, the battle droids. A big battle with of course high tech weapons and armory. Ah...lightsabers. Darth Mal has quiet a few battles. With Obi wan and Qui-gonn junn, this movie isn't boring.So overall episode one is still a great movie with plenty of action and special effects. I would give this movie four and a half stars especially for the special effects. I just wish Jake Lloyd wasn't in the movie. This is one of the best movies you'll want to see.

10 Things I Hate About You," Through a teens eye view!!!!!
",A take off from Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. This romantic comedy goes beyond the stereo-typical teen movie.  the story will take you back to what some would call 'The best four years' of their  life.  Things like; will the new guy (played by 3rd Rock From The Sun's Joseph Gordon-Levitt) steal the popular/conceited rich chic(Nickelodeon's marisa cleyenik) or will she stick with her snooty football player boyfriend(7th Heaven's Andrew Keegan) get to keep her...

Notting Hill," A boring and used concept.
","I found this movie to be dry and predictable.  You can always tell exactly what Julia Roberts's character is going to do.  What's the point in watching something, sweet and unbelievable as it may be, if no one in it ever says ANYthing original? 	For example, how inevitable was it when: Roberts (Anna Scott) decided to stay with the bumbling Thacker (Grant) 'indefinately'?  Or when Grant had to wear those hideous goggles to the cinema, only for the audience to discover that Spike had them?  God. 	And how pointless can a movie be?  We all know how it's going to end from the middle if not beginning. 	My conclusion is, only very sad people over 30 with an even sadder love life would waste their time to see this.  And my advice to them is, get a cat or a life.Emily SRVHS",Null,2,5,17 September 1999
American Pie," this movie rules
",Over the summer I saw many movies but the best might have  been American Pie. This movie is a laugh out loud split your sides movie. The thing that really drives the movie are the fantastic characters . This was a good movie. American Pie  was so funny it was  unbelievable. In one part Jim asks his freinds what third base felt like and they reply by saying warm apple pie then Jim waits a minute and responds with mcdonalds or home made. Some times the comedy is almost a little raunchy like when Jim's parents walk in on him masturbating . Overall  though the movie is hilarious.,10,1,2,17 September 1999
American Pie," very interesting and realistic
","This movie was one of the most funniest movies this summer! It included realistic scenes where-as some movies try to create something realistic, this movie actually does. This movie was about four high school teenagers making a pact to lose their virginity before senior prom. The outcome is pretty surprising too. The reason I say that this movie is so realistic is because it completely relates to teenagers today. Same problems, same way of thinking, etc. 	Some people say that the gross-out humor is what makes the movie bad, but in my opinion, it's what makes the movie fun. The reason that it's so funny is because it's gross-out humor. I know that this isn't 'gross-out' humor but, it's the only example that I give. I  remember that in one scene, they were at a party and this one guy, Jim, walked up to the girl that he liked and didn't know what to say so he just started to laugh with the girl and her friends and then walked away. He didn't even know what they were laughing at. Over-all, I think that this was a good TEENAGE movie.       By,Ana",10,1,2,17 September 1999

The Sixth Sense," Edge of your seat suspense!
","This movie get's an A for good acting and suspense. It's a great movie for teens and adults. At times it's scry, suspensefull, and mysterious. To make it even better, it has a twisted ending.The acting in this movie was very good because it was realistic. When the boy by the name of Cole said that he saw dead people it was belivable by the way he acted. I also liked his reactions when he would see or hear dead people. Another good actor in this movie was the psychologist played by Bruce Willis. He was especially good when he convinced the young Cole to stop running and hiding from the ghosts and find out what they really wanted and why were they haunting him.This movie was full of suspense because you never knew what was going to happen next. When the doctor was shot I was in suspense wondering if he was going to die or not.Other parts that demonstrated suspense were when the ghost came, because you don't know what they are going to do.My opinion is that this was a great movie, an A+. The acting and suspense were just two of the many talents that stood out. This movie was definatly worth seeing. I would recommend this movie to teens and adults every where!By: Lacey-SR Student",Null,0,0,17 September 1999

The Sixth Sense," Great thriller....says teen
","The movie 'The Sixth Sense' was a very good and scary movie. The criteria for a movie like this one is that it has to be scary, full of surprises, have a good plot, make sense, and have a good ending. This movie had it all!The main thing that made this movie especially scary was the ghosts- not just one or two, but a whole army of zombie-like ghouls who haunt the gothic streets of modern Philadelphia. The ghosts follow this boy named Cole, because they seem to want something from him. The thing that makes that scary is that you as the viewer or him as the person don't know what they want from him until the end. It is very suspenseful. The other thing that makes this movie scary was that you didnt know if Cole was crazy because he was the only one who could seem them. But then you find out that he's not crazy, and that all the ghosts are really there to him, and that they need his help.I think that the movie was good because of the fabulous ending. The ending really got you thinking. Not just about  how it ended, but the whole movie. It just made you reflect back and go through the movie to see if the ending matched up to the movie. Another thing that made the ending really good was that it was very scary. The movie was extremely good and scary, The whole movie was made very well, and it was obvious it had a lot of time and effort put into it. The ghosts were great special effects and gave the movie and eerie feeling. The end just tied up the whole movie, like movies should. But this endng was especially well done. The suspense  was absolutely  great, it had you on the edge of your seat waiting for another event to occur. The movie was very well made. I give it two thumbs up! by Aja",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great movie, great ending
","This summer I saw the movie,'The Sixth Sense'.This movie was filled with horrifying scenes and the story was great.I loved it because it made sense.The movie had lots of twists that were added to it and they made it interesting to watch.In the end I found out something that I wouldn't of even thought would happen and that took me by surprise and made the whole story of the movie better. This was the absolute most scary movie I have ever seen in my whole life.There were so many parts where dead people would just pop out of nowhere.There was one part where the little boy was totally frightened, and that made me feel so scared and so bad that the little boy in the movie had to experience the ghosts and terror the ghosts brought. These parts kept me on the edge of my seat, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie.I want to go see it a few more times but I feel I wont be able to forget the horrifying scenes when I go to bed at night.

The Sixth Sense," Edge of your seat suspense
","I thought that this movie was excellent.  They had a wonderful cast of actors.  Especially the 8 year old.  The writers really knew what the were doing. This movie gets an 'A' for being so scary and creative.  There were so many good parts in the movie, but one stood out at me.  It was when the littler girl showed the part of how her mother killed her with the poison. This was definitely part of my criteria being scary. The was another part that I thought really stood out at me.  Great acting. The was good acting by the adults, but the 8 year old kid was excellent.  I think he should get an Oscar for his performance.  He made it seem real when he had to use his emotions.  By having a child in this movie it brought back memories to me and I'm sure to all the adults.  Memories of ghosts that they thought they saw.  I know it brought chills to me every time that I am alone. If there could be one more thing that I wanted to see more of it would be how he interacted with the dead people.  I still loved this movie.  It really meet my criteria.By: Jarryd SRVHS student",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," A very unique movie with a great scary twist!!!
","Movies, movies, movies they can be so happy, sad, and exciting. Yes there are scary movies , and yes there are disgustiing movies that make you want to leave but they can be so intresting to go and see. Sixth sense is a great movie to go and see. I basically liked Sixth Sense because of its weird wacky ending. Sith sense was a movie that you might have to go and see twice if you are slow like me but you  didnt mind seeing it twice at all. I think this movie is highly recommended and I suggest that you go and see it but you should make sure that you bring a friend with you. One reason because your going to need someone to grab there hand for the scary parts then you might want that friend with you for asking questions at the end of the movie.

","This film was a number one horror. This film will leave you hanging as the suspense drives you crazy. As a 5 year old child goes through scares as ghosts haunt him, and as they freak him out you are getting freak out your self. I would rate this movie a 10 on horror. Throughout this film at the most unexpected moments you will jump right out of your seat.

The Sixth Sense," Great Summer flick!
","A good movie is well through out beginning to end.  A good movie keeps you hooked eyes glued to the screen hands gripping the armrests and feet plastered to the ground.  A good movie sets you up throught the whole thing then surprises you with a shocking mind boggling ending.  The sixth sense delivered all this and more The key to a truely intriguing movie is in the acting.  Bruise Willis gave a wonderful performance as usual but Haley was shockingly better probably the best child actors I've ever seen.  When Cole (Haley) gets locked in the attic by two of his schoolmates and was beat up by the ghost you could feel his pain it was almost real.  Cole helping us find out how the young girl really died.Throughout the whole movie you wondered about Malcome's relationship with his wife, for example when she sat waiting for him at a restraunt on their anniversary when he finally showed up and tried to pay the bill but she took it from him ( that was harsh).  Scenes like that keep the movie going and hinted around a future occurrence.  but it was the part when the little boy told his mother that grandma said hi and that she did go to her daughters dance recitle years ago when they had gotten in a fight.  That was when you knew the mother believed him. In my opinion this movie The Sixth sense is very good worth every penny and more.  Its powerful cast and plot came to gether to make a good movie that you and your family can see.  It will keep you talking about its ending for days.  This movie definitely gets four stars and two thumbs up from me!!",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," The spectator says...Best Movie EVER!!!
","This summer I went and saw the awesome movie the Sixth Sense! It had an awesome plot,great casting and acting!! This movie was very easy to follow with many twists,turns and cool make-up. This movie kept me glued to my seat!
Some of the best scene that showed the most amazing acting was when the little boy woke up in the middle of the night and wandered into the kitchen only to find a dead woman looking for something in the cupboards.When she started to talk to him  the poor boy got frightened(as would most any one)and ran back to his little red tent and began to shiver and cry. This scene was amazing because of the great make-up.The little boy acted like he had really seen a ghost! Another time that the little boy showed great acting was when he first told Bruce Willis about his terrifying secret. This was an amazing scene because he cried like he really could see ghosts.
When you see some really good make-up it makes the movie much better and more life like. When you see this awesome make-up is when one of the dead people talks to the little boy and then turns around you see a bloody head. The had been shot off by accidental gun fire. This make-up made the movie more life like and seem like the ghosts were actually there. The best scene though, is when the boy is talking to a woman she moves so you can see the other side of her face to realize that she is actually dead. The one side had been burned to a very crispy person. This was the best make-up I have ever seen in this kind of horror flick.
In conclusion I think that this is a must see movie, not only for the theaters but a good one for keeps!This summer I have also seen the Haunting of the hill house and that movie was lame compared to  this brilliant move. This year if you see a movie see  THE SIXTH SENSE!!

The Sixth Sense," Kellie says The Sixth Sense is best movie of the summer!
","The Sixth Sense was an awesome movie, and by far the best of the summer. It had all key elements that make for a great movie. It was creative, original, and above all completely terrifying. A part in the movie that got to me most was when Haley Joel Osmit says, 'Ya know those prickly hairs on the back of your neck? That's them.' He's referring to the ghosts and what makes it more scary is that we have never had any explanation for hairs standing on end; except for the fact that we are cold. The movies uses that and says that when ghosts are around the temperature drops, making us cold, and giving us goose bumps. In fact, almost anything pulled from the movie could and would be considered both scary and creative. The movie was undoubtedly scary. It was the type that made the whole theater scream with terror and gasp at anything interesting. It captivated the audience. But what made it do that was it's unpredictable horror. In most horrors you only see dead people at night; whether they're just being killed or rising from the dead. In this movie dead people show up in broad daylight. Also, you see the dead after whatever it was that killed them. In one case, you see a little boy that was shot in the head. The suspense is endless and the surprises are non-stop. One thing can be said about it, it will make you grasp your neighbors arm as your mouth drops wide open.The Sixth Sense made for a great summer movie because it had creativity and originality. The Sixth Sense defies all rules for your average horror film. First off, most horrors have a killer that pops out and scares the audience. The Sixth Sense does not have a murderer and is still tens times scarier than any thriller. You never seem to know when another dead person will show up. Some can even come in a matter of seconds and we don't even see them. Also, the shocking end to the perfect movie. The end alone would have been enough creativity and originality for the whole movie. (Don't worry, I won't spoil the ending, even though it was wonderful, but I called it!) The ending and plot alone show how The Sixth Sense doesn't follow the guidelines set for thrillers and goes off to explore uncharted territory, that turned out to be a gold mine!Kellie, a San Ramon High School student",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Megan thinks it is a scary, disturbing drama!
","This summer I saw the movie The Sixth Sense. It was a scary, disturbing drama. the movie was a sure fire Oscar award. The criteria for that kind of a movie should be good acting and a great ending. Bruce Willis starred and played a psychiatrist and Haley Joel Osmet played a little boy who can see dead people.I thought this movie had excellent acting. Both actors should be nominated for an award of some sort. Willis, for example, was in a scene where he was listening to a recorded conversation. He had to find out if there was some one else in the room that he didn't see. He acted some what scared, surprised and deep in thought,        when he faintly heard the other voice. I thought it was good acting because he had to portray so many feelings at the same time. Another scene where great acting skills came in, was when the Osmet was running into his tent to hide from a dead person. They showed him sitting in the corner of the tent crying with the most terrified look on his face. From the look on his face it made you feel as terrified as he was. These two examples show the fine skills of the actors.
The Sixth Sense had absolutely the best ending any movie has ever had. It made the entire movie theater full of people say, ' Oh, my gosh!' I won't give away the ending so as not to spoil a great surprise. This ending made you go back and rethink the whole movie. It was a story that made sense because of the ending. I really liked this ending because it wasn't 100 percent happy, as so many movies are. It left you thinking about the movie the entire night long. The ending of this movie was full of different emotions: it was scary, it was smart, it was sad, it was happy, it was unusual.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes superior acting and a movie that makes you think twice, along with a magnificent ending. These two criteria make up a disturbing drama. In a summer full of supposedly scary slasher teen movies, The Sixth Sense is a rare combination of variety of emotions in a well- acted, smart plot movie.

The Sixth Sense," A Great Suspense film that will leave you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie.
","Let me tell you something. This summer am I glad I got out to the movie theaters and saw The Sixth Sense. This action-packed thriller certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. The suspense is incredible and the dead people popping up where ever will definately give you the chills. Bruce Willis and the child actor who played the 10 year old boy do a wonderful job in this picture trying to scare you half to death and be pleading for more. Like I said before, the suspense is incredible. Like when the girl who gets poisened haunt the 10 year old boy, you're dying to get to the bottom of the story. Even if the horror isn't scary enough or the blood isn't gory enough, the suspense will keep you in the theater until the credits. Before I go any further, let me just say that the child actor does the best child acting I have ever seen. His cleaver imagination makes you believe that he really can see dead people. For example, when he is playing a little mind game with Bruce Willis, he looks up and down at the end making it seem like there is someone there standing next to him. But just the way everything fits together, it's like a puzzle. The kid is simply just amazing. Therefore I conclude that The Sixth Sense was certainly a well put together film that will wow you. The suspense will keep you hanging on until the end. Not to mention the acting. By, Sarah, San Ramon High School",Null,0,0,17 September 1999

The Matrix," Teenager thinks movie was hella tripy
","The matrix was a good movie because it was twisted and had lots of wierd speacil effects. One of the really cool effects was when these two guys were shooting each other. It was cool because it made it look like every thing was slowmow cuase they were moving so fast. Another thing about the movie was it as confusing in a weird way. No other movie wil make you think like this one.The thing that made this movie cool was the plot. The plot was that the world was a computer program. Like nothing was real it was all a computer fanticy. With out the computer you couldn't live a normal life. It says you are not born by a mother you are grown like in a corn field.The other thing that made this move good was the speacil effects. I liked them so much because they were a fat trip. One of the tripiest thinds was when thet shoot at each other. That was cool because they could move so fast they could doge the bullets. And when they did that every thing would get all wavey and mest.In my conclution this movie was the bomb. It had every thing you want in a action flick. Tripy stuff lots of shootig and agood looking chick in a tite suit. So take my advise and go see the matrix and enjoy the trip

If you don't know what the Matrix is, it is the world that has been pulled over our eyes to make us think that we are living a great life but in the 'real world' we are actually being harvested to power robot type things. Confused? That's what I thought. You will have to see it for yourself to fully understand what the Matrix is.	As far as the storyline goes, I thought that the writers had done a fair job. It was well written in most parts but a little hard to follow in the beginning. I'll have to disagree with the critics when they say that the actors did a just ok job with carrying out their parts. I think it was well acted. The discussion between the characters was genuine. It was almost as if the discussions were made by real people instead of just robots programmed by the writers to carry out a story.	If you are looking for sensible action then this is the movie for you. It has enough action to keep you awake but still isn't non-stop carnage. Blood and gore wasn't a problem since there was only one scene with blood. However, there was quite a bit of gunplay. I thought the rating in The Matrix could have been a PG-13 instead of an R.	The special effects in The Matrix were awsome. Trying to find out how the effects were made isn't a bad idea. When the people in 'the Matrix world' change into agents (or vise versa) is always a good effect. This movie is another example of how technology is changing the way we watch movies.	Overall, I highly recommend this movie. With only a few slight flaws, The Matrix is destined to become a favorite to many people. Why the critics didn't like this movie is a mystery to me. It has four stars in my book.

The Matrix," Non-stop action packed movie.
","The non-stop action packed thriller called the Matrix! The normal average bussiness man suddenly turns into someone who has to save the world. Now, what does a good action movie have in it. Action of course. And that is exactly what this Sci- fi movie had in it.This action packed thriller is one that will definitely go into the books.	The most action packed scene of the movie was over 15 minutes long. The star of the movie (Keanu Reeves) has a karate scene with this enormous black guy. Every minute you see a flying fist here and a huge kick to the head.Definitely one of the best action scenes I have ever seen.This was my favorite scene of the movie. You can't tell me that this doesn't fall into the action cattigory.	Now for the ending. I can not give it away. There is a little bit I can say though. The ending involes all of the characters from the whole movie. There are a lot of guns, a lot of suspense, and a lot of action. We cant leave out the special effects though. So sit back and watch the action packed thriller of the summer of (1999). This definitely was the movie of the summer.	Written by Jordan of SRVHS",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
