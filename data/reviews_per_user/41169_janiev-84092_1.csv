The Lobster," Different and weird but not bad.
","It's a bit slow but I like the idea of this movie. It's very different which I liked. I feel like they could have gone a little bit bigger or maybe a little bit more drastic with the idea. However, it's not bad. The concept is intriguing. I didn't quite understand the ending until I read about it and now it makes sense. *Kind of a spoiler* It talks about how that society has made people believe that in order for you to have a successful relationship, you and your partner must have a defined common characteristic that you both share. For example, nose bleeds that occur out of nowhere, nice hair, a limp, bad eyesight, etc. Again... a little slow but intriguing and different.",7,0,0,28 June 2020
