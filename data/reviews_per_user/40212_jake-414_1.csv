Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Real Comedy at its finest
","I feel the people that hate this movie with a fiery passion cannot just handle humor as raw as this is. I'm not saying they don't have a sense of humor. I'm saying they have a mild, weak sense of humor. They can't handle real comedy. But they enjoy harmless movies such as Date movie and Little man because there to afraid to see real. And they don't want to show people from America that are like them, close-minded and ignorant about whats going on in front of them with one of the funniest men of this generation, Sacha Baren Cohen. Some scenes were so raw and shocking i could not believe at what I was seeing on the movie screen. He crosses boundaries were probably no other comedian will ever go again. This guy will do anything to try and get a laugh out of someone. Maybe take a dump by the Trump building in NY or make cheese from his wife's breast milk for a very important man. Surprisingly, the story for the movie fits Borat's character perfectly, tying in all his small crazy antics he does on the side. But still on search for his man prize, 'the lady in the red under-panties.' Stopping at nothing to get her to marry him. And boy did I ever laugh my 'back p***y' off during this one. :)",10,1,12,4 January 2007
