The Blair Witch Project," creepy and original horror film
","'The Blair Witch Project' succeeds where so many horror films fail because of the sheer simplicity of its conception and design, allowing it to tap far more deeply into a wide range of primal fears than the conventional 'fright' films churned out regularly by major Hollywood studios.  While the latter films tend to dilute their terror through overplotting, over production and over reliance on special effects, 'The Blair Witch Project' eschews all that for creativity, visual inventiveness and an admirable conviction that what is left unseen is often more terrifying than what is visualized.The film presents itself cleverly as a pseudodocumentary tale of a group of fictional college students who become lost in the woods while endeavoring to film a study of a local scary legend.  With this structure, the film creepily conjures up many of the basic anxieties and dreads humans are prone to such as fear of the dark, of being hopelessly lost in an isolated environment, of unidentifiable noises on which one can project one's greatest terrors, of total loss of control against an unknown and malevolent force.Even more impressive is the way the film expands to become a study of the human psyche when it is placed into a situation of unspeakable fear and desperation.  As the characters begin to grasp the gravity of their situation, the forced jocularity begins to be stripped away revealing the childlike terror, guilt, need for recrimination and eventually despair and hopelessness that overtake them.  The actors are brilliant in capturing the full gamut of emotions these characters must go through before the preordained tragic end.  The film also provides a slyly satirical spin on the obsessively cinematic tone of modern life, wherein every event must be captured on film or videotape, so much so that, even as death is breathing down the necks of these characters, the cameras continue to roll to record it.  As one of them says in justification,  'That's all I have left.'  That is her piece of the comfortable world of familiarity that helps her, at least momentarily (if futiley), evade the harsh reality of her situation. Also, these characters pay a high price for the superior tone of cavalier indifference and almost mockery they display towards the tales of the legend they have come to 'investigate.'More than any horror film of recent memory, 'The Blair Witch Project' gets under the viewer's skin and gives one that feeling of creepy vulnerability that only the best horror films can do.",9,3,6,11 November 1999
The King's Speech," a treasure-trove of great performances
","Earning Oscars for itself as well as for its star, Colin Firth, 'The King's Speech' is an entertaining historical drama whose intelligent writing and superb acting allow it to triumph over its conventional theme.In this real-life version of 'Pygmalion,' Firth plays Prince Albert (aka the Duke of York, aka King George VI), the British royal whose severe speech impediment haunted him throughout his early life and made being a monarch difficult in a time when a new little device called radio made speaking in public a necessity for anyone serious about being a respected leader on the world stage. Geoffrey Rush costars as Lionel Logue, the unlicensed speech therapist and part time stage actor who helped him overcome his affliction.Written by David Seidler (who himself suffered from a stammer as a child) and directed by Tom Hooper, 'The King's Speech' is very much in the mold of all those fusty, do-gooding, inspirational biographies that always seem to grab the lion's-share of trophies when awards season comes around. However, this particular one avoids some of the pitfalls of the genre by being less about the physical affliction and more about the psychological issues underlying that affliction. Indeed, in their numerous sessions together, Lionel turns out to be more psychotherapist than speech coach for a man who - due to his position as a member of a tightly circumscribed and stiff-upper-lipped monarchy - has no one but this comparative stranger to confide his innermost thoughts and feelings to. Clearly wise in the ways of human nature, Lionel rightly determines that Albert's affliction has less to do with any kind of physical ailment than with his bottled-up feelings towards his father, the unforgiving taskmaster King George V, and his older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, whose own dalliance with a divorced American commoner leads him to abdicate the throne after only a short period, thereby clearing the way for Albert to assume his rightful place as England's king. Lionel determines that, more than anything else, it's fear – of humiliating himself in public, of failing to live up to the standards set by a demanding and uncompromising father, of not being able to fulfill the duties his royal birth has thrust upon him – that is the real underlying cause of Albert's problem. And Lionel, commoner though he may be, isn't shy about confronting the king with some frank truths about himself when he deems it necessary. He even insists on addressing his royal pupil as 'Bertie,' the nickname only his immediate family could previously use. And, of course, the stuttering itself becomes a part of a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle, as it continually eats away at not only Albert's image of himself as a man but his confidence as the individual who's just been handed the heavy burden of leading a beleaguered and frightened nation through the perilous days of World War II.Firth and Rush are both magnificent in their roles, establishing an amazing chemistry between them, as the royal and the commoner brush aside the arbitrary distinctions of division and class to meet on the ground of their common humanity. Firth never overplays the stuttering, and the expressions of pain and frustration that periodically flit across his face when he's trying so desperately to be understood make us empathize with his predicament entirely. Likewise, Rush has never seemed more relaxed and confident than he does here, providing a perfect foil for the king's faltering self-confidence. In lesser hands, the role of Lionel could easily have degenerated into low comedy buffoonery, but Rush never gives in to the temptation, giving us instead a richly shaded and thoughtfully understated portrayal of the character.There is fine work too by Helena Bonham Carter as Albert's devoted and supportive wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York; an English-accented Guy Pearce as Edward, Prince of Wales; Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury; Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Claire Bloom as Albert's mother, Queen Mary.But the film is Firth's and Rush's all the way.",8,1,2,26 April 2011
Despicable Me 2," Fun sequel
","'Despicable Me 2' provides us with the further adventures of Gru, the arch villain who, at the end of the first film, had given up his evil ways to become a doting dad and a respectable business man. However, because he has insider knowledge on how evildoers work, he's been tapped by a top-secret spy organization to go undercover and help save the world from bad guys who are not quite as reformed as he is. Gru teams up with Lucy Wilde, an attractive agent who also becomes a love interest, to find out who absconded with an entire research laboratory in the Arctic with the use of a giant magnet.While it's true that Gru, as a character, is probably more interesting and fun when he's plotting a crime rather than fighting it, 'Despicable Me 2' is still an entertaining and colorful diversion for audiences of all ages. Steve Carell, Kristin Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan and Ken Jeong are some of the better-known actors who provide the voice work for the film.",7,0,0,21 January 2014
Insidious: Chapter 2," Solid filmmaking triumphs over the clichés
","Haunted house movies have become so similar and generic in their content and style, that's it's getting harder and harder to tell a good one from a bad one these days. 'Insidious Chapter 2' strikes me as a fairly good one - at least up to a point. It's not that there's anything particularly groundbreaking or new about it; it's just that the level of filmmaking is a notch or two above what one frequently finds in the genre.Written by Leigh Wannell and directed by James Wan, 'Insidious Chapter 2' follows the standard blueprint for films in this genre: a couple with young children finds itself bedeviled by restless spirits in an old Victorian house that, just from the looks of it, practically screams 'Haunted.' We're already familiar with most of the characters from the original 'Insidious,' including Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson as the distraught parents and 'Entity' star Barbara Hershey as the grandmother. There's the usual calling in of ghost-hunters and the standard mumbo-jumbo about 'the other side,' but at least 'Insidious Chapter 2' goes that extra step by actually entering into that alternate world and confronting the spirits residing therein.'Insidious Chapter 2' is a bit too derivative of 'The Shining' in the dad's seeming descent into madness and possession and his posing a threat to the safety of his family (a baseball bat and a fire extinguisher have replaced the ax in the earlier picture as the weapon of choice here). And even though the movie wanders off into some pretty goofy territory in its second half, the excellent cinematography, imagery and sound effects manage to keep the fright meter in the red zone for most of the duration.And credit those who made the film for having the good taste to include a brief clip of Herk Harvey's seminal 1962 classic 'Carnival of Souls,' one of the creepiest horror films of all time, playing on a TV nearby. Now THERE was a groundbreaking film!",7,0,0,19 April 2014
Moneyball," Top-notch sports drama
","Billy Beane has a problem. As general manager for the cash-strapped Oakland A's, Beane is having a hard time recruiting quality players, mainly because, with the limited budget the owner has given him to work with, he can't possibly compete with the multimillion dollar contracts being proffered by A-tier teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox. To add insult to injury, those teams keep pilfering the few decent players Beane's already got. Into the breach steps Peter Brand, a 23-year-old numbers-cruncher straight out of Yale who's devised a complex algorithm out of players' statistics that will allow recruiters to focus in on the less obviously flashy - and thereby far less expensive - players whom the Big Boy franchises have managed to overlook. The skeptics question the wisdom and efficacy of reducing team-building to mere mathematic formulas and science, but Brand's method winds up working so well that it forever revolutionizes the way major league baseball teams recruit their players.Based on the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, with screenplay by Steve Zaillion and Aaron Sorkin and direction by Bennett Miller, 'Moneyball' provides a literal inside-baseball glimpse into the inside of baseball. In many ways, 'Moneyball' is a kind of grownup version of 'The Bad News Bears' and every other tale of a coach who pulls together a motley crew of misfits and second-stringers and, against all odds, transforms them into a winning team. The difference is that this story has actual history behind it, recounting the 2002 season in which the A's won a record 20 games in a row (yet still lost in the playoffs). Plus, the movie finds its drama more in the behind-the-scenes wrangling among the highly skeptical managers, owners, coaches and staff than in the action on the field (indeed, most of the ballpark scenes appear as grainy clips from actual games). The intelligent screenplay avoids most of the clichés inherent in the genre - and those it doesn't avoid it somehow manages to make seem fresh and vital again. The writing also adds depth and dimension to Beane's character by occasionally flashing back to his own somewhat underwhelming career as a player in the big leagues, showing how that disappointment helped to mold him into the man he is today.Despite the sterling quality of the writing and direction, 'Moneyball' is clearly an actors' picture, and the filmmakers have recruited a first-rate cast to carry out the drama (I wonder if they used a similar algorithm for that). Brad Pitt has probably never been better than he is here as the Quixotic visionary who's such a bundle of nerves that he can't even bring himself to watch his own games. A mixture of pragmatist and romantic when it comes to the game of baseball, Beane is the perfect person to serve as iconoclast for a game whose roots lie deep in the American psyche but a game that has lost its way in recent times with its huge salaries and uncompetitive money advantages among teams. Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, as is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the A's highly skeptical and understandably disgruntled manager, who initially balks at what he believes is the disastrous direction in which Beane is taking the team. Chris Pratt ('Everwood,' 'Parks and Recreation') and Kerris Dorsey ('Parenthood') also score in small but important roles.There's drama and suspense aplenty in this film, with literal edge-of-the-seat excitement generated by its re-creation of the nail-biting 20th game that got the A's into the record books. But 'Moneyball' never overplays its hand, never indulges in corny melodramatics or cheap sentiment to win us over to its side. In fact, it is its very restraint and subtlety - both in performance and execution - that draws us so deeply into the tale it's telling.",9,1,2,26 June 2012
The Avengers," Top-notch action movie extravaganza
","In Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers,' three Marvel Comics superheroes - Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) - are recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to do battle against Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has come to Earth with an alien army to claim the world for his own. But can three such distinctly talented yet strong-willed individuals put aside their differences and egos long enough to function as a team - as the Avengers - to save the planet? There's no question that gathering three classic superheroes into a single film was a stroke of marketing genius, as well as a considerable treat for fans. The movie itself is lively, loud, and epic in scale with just enough character delineation to keep us engaged on a human level. Plus, it culminates in a spectacular jamboree of destruction in New York City that turns into a veritable Valhalla for CGI aficionados.All the above-mentioned actors enter into the spirit of the enterprise, as do Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Powers Boothe, Jenny Agutter, and Harry Dean Stanton as the pure humans in the cast.Good fun.",7,1,4,28 March 2014
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," fast-paced but hollow puzzle-drama
","In 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets,' the 2007 sequel to the original 'National Treasure' from 2004, historian Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) finds himself in the distinctly unenviable position of having to clear his great-great-grandfather's name from the charge - being leveled by a black market antiquities dealer (Ed Harris) - that his forefather played a major role in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In order to prove the accusation wrong, thereby restoring not only his ancestor's reputation but his own in the process, Gates must uncover the whereabouts of a treasure map leading to the fabled City of Gold built by a tribe of pre-Columbian Native Americans. (And don't bother asking how those two things are related because, even after watching the movie, I'm still not sure I would be able to tell you).'Book of Secrets,' produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Jon Turteltaub and directed by Turteltaub, is a giant Rube Goldberg contraption about a series of Rube Goldberg contraptions. In terms of the story, there are more twists and turns, leaps in logic, conspiracy theories and contrived red herrings than even the most astute puzzle-solver should be required to keep up with. Luckily, the action moves along at a quick enough pace - including an impressive car chase through the streets and alleyways of London - that one doesn't have much time to question the sense of it all.The actors certainly do throw themselves into the spirit of the enterprise, running around like mad through an assortment of colorful, touristy settings - from the Eiffel Tower to Buckingham Palace to the White House to Mount Vernon to the Library of Congress to Mount Rushmore - but the film, taken as a whole, is a pretty soulless exercise overall. Most grating is the stereotypical love/hate relationship between Ben and his ex-girlfriend, Abigail (Diane Kruger), an archivist at the National Archives, who are obviously still hopelessly, madly in love with one another and only need one more epic, life-threatening adventure to bring that truth home to them - which puts the audience one step ahead of the sleuthers to begin with. And as if that weren't enough, we're treated to a second bickering couple - Ben's divorced mother (Helen Mirren) and father (Jon Voight) - to parallel the first and double our displeasure.The problem with a movie like this one is that, no matter how well it's put together on a technical level, finally, after what feels like the thousandth uncovered clue and the millionth hairbreadth escape from a fate-worse-than-death, the viewer simply exhausts himself trying to keep up with it all and stops paying attention.",5,0,0,7 March 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," even better than Vol. 1
","Unlike its predecessor, 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1,' which was basically a triumph of style over substance, the follow-up, 'Kill Bill, Vol. 2' is a triumph of both style AND substance - a no-holds-barred action film that turns into a thinking man's thriller in its climactic scene. This installment picks up where the earlier one left off, with Beatrix Kiddo, the former assassin attempting to go straight, still seeking revenge against the people who killed her fiancé and friends, and left her for dead on the eve of her wedding. Beatrix, an expert at swordsmanship and martial arts, follows an inexorable path of destruction, culminating in a brilliantly choreographed showdown with the Bill of the title, her former lover and hit man boss who decided to turn his gun on her when she ran off and left him. But the surprise - and triumph - here is that the showdown turns out to be one not of bullets and blows, but of words and ideas.The plotting could not be more simple and direct, a series of cat-and-mouse fight scenes, periodically interrupted by flashbacks showing how Beatrix got to where she is today. Quentin Tarantino's trademark dialogue is sharp, imaginative and witty, and the violence is a fascinating hybrid of the cartoon-like and the graphic. Tarantino is a lover of movies and this is reflected in the stylish look and sound of the film: the beautiful compositions, the bizarre camera angles, the razor-sharp editing, and the glorious soundtrack, all of which make this an eye-filling and ear-caressing experience for the viewer.Uma Thurman delivers a pitch-perfect performance as Beatrix, bringing a mixture of steely-eyed ferocity and warmhearted tenderness - as well as an amazing athleticism - to the role. She is more than matched by Keith Caradine as the terrifying yet strangely likable Bill - and their final confrontation scene, in which these two natural born killers sit down and discuss both their love and hatred for one another before squaring off in their battle to the death, is amazingly compelling in its complexity and depth. It is here where the 'Kill Bill' saga finally becomes a work of art. As a result, this second film is a more satisfying work overall than the first. But, taken as a whole, this is certainly Tarantino's best work since the seminal 'Pulp Fiction' from ten years earlier.",8,0,1,11 October 2005
Black Swan," Artful variant on Jekyll and Hyde
","A bizarre combination of art-house drama and psycho-sexual thriller, Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is really an allegorical account of a young woman's descent into madness. It's also a variant of sorts on 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,' exploring the evil twin that lurks deep inside each and every one of us. Nina (Natalie Portman) is a sheltered, intensely disciplined and sexually repressed ballerina who's just landed the role of a lifetime – that of the Swan Queen in a major New York ballet company production of 'Swan Lake.' Yet, while her innocence and formal perfectionism make her a natural for the part of the White Swan, she may lack the fiery, hot-blooded temperament and life experiences needed to convincingly portray the Black Swan. Or so the company director (Vincent Cassell) tells her, a man with an obvious interest in Nina beyond the purely professional. But Nina clearly has more pressing issues to deal with than just a lecherous dance instructor and a mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer herself, who clearly wants to control every aspect of her daughter's life. Nina seems to be losing her grip on reality, as she begins to hear muffled voices, starts bleeding mysteriously from various parts of her body, and appears to be two different people when peering into a mirror. In fact, the idea of dopplegangers becomes a major visual motif throughout the film – reflective of the White Swan/Black Swan, Jekyll and Hyde, Good vs. Evil dichotomy - with one minor character even at one point assuming that Nina and a fellow ballerina are sisters because they look so much alike - as most ballerinas, almost by definition, have a tendency to do. Subtly at first, then with greater intensity as the story progresses, Nina begins to reflect a person deep in the throes of a nervous breakdown. With a screenplay by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Andres Heinz, based on a story by Heinz, 'Black Swan' borrows quite liberally from earlier movies. There's a touch of 'All About Eve' in its tale of an up-and-coming newcomer (Mila Kunis) seemingly intent on usurping Nina's lead in the production; there's a hint of 'Carrie' in the dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship; and the whole young-woman-slipping-into-madness scenario is eerily reminiscent of Roman Polanski's film 'Repulsion' from 1965. That being said, Aronofsky brings a great deal of his own to this work, keeping the horror movie hokum down to a minimum (though some does creep in from time to time) and effectively plunging us into a dizzying alternate reality in the bravura, brilliantly shot and edited scenes towards the end of the film. In fact, the closing stretches of the movie represent cinema in its purest form, as the pacing builds to a frenetic crescendo, perfectly reflective of Nina's mental state at the moment. Nina ultimately finds it in herself to truly become the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself and those around her? The movie is obviously intended as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and of avoiding life, and about the way in which single-mindedness when carried to the extreme can lead to psychological damage and even insanity for the individual involved. And who is more single-minded, disciplined and obsessed than a prima ballerina? To say that Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in this role would be to minimize her accomplishment; she throws herself so deeply into the character that it's hard to decide which is more impressive: the sheer overwhelming physicality of it all or the wrenching emotional conviction. This is clearly her movie, and she has given her whole heart and soul to it. Kunis is equally impressive in the Eve Harrington role of the far more easygoing, but clearly manipulative soubrette whom Nina is convinced wants to take her place in the show. And Hershey brings a compelling mixture of jealousy and concern to the role of a mother who's been where her daughter is now but whose influence over her seems to be waning over time. Like Nina, we like to show only the White Swan aspect of our personalities to the world at large, choosing to hide – whether consciously or unconsciously – the Black Swan side from public view. Yet, as Nina soon discovers, the Black Swan will at some point insist on having its day, perhaps going so far as to kill off the White Swan in an effort to assert its preeminence. Freud would have had a field day with this movie.",9,1,3,13 February 2011
Changeling," jaw-dropping true story
","If 'Changeling' didn't tell us right up front that it was based on a true story, one might be easily forgiven for dismissing it as nothing more than far-fetched and implausible melodrama. But since truth so often IS stranger than fiction, we can but sit back in openmouthed disbelief as this most bizarre of bizarre scenarios unfolds before us.Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother living with her nine-year-old son, Walter, in 1928 Los Angeles. When Walter goes missing one day, the frantic mother pleads with the police to find him. After five long months of grueling suspense, Christine is finally reunited with her child. Or is she? For while the police, eager to close the case for publicity purposes, insist that the boy they've found is indeed her missing son, Christine knows otherwise and spends the next few months attempting to convince anyone who'll listen that her real son is still out there somewhere and that the boy living with her is an imposter. John Malkovich co-stars as a crusading radio preacher who takes up the cause of this understandably distraught mother against the increasingly disreputable and malicious LAPD.Written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also wrote the musical score), 'Changeling' is a gripping human drama that keeps us on tenterhooks every step of its narrative-shifting way. Going well beyond the surface fascinations of the plot, the movie broadens out to become a compelling study of police corruption and of one woman's battle for justice against a totalitarian, bureaucratic system. Throughout, the audience is buffeted back and forth between utter frustration and heartwarming uplift and just about every other emotion in between. It's true that the movie does have a few too many false climaxes towards the end and there are individual moments when it veers dangerously close to exploitation, but, for the most part, this is a first-rate, riveting drama, solidly directed by Eastwood and beautifully acted by Jolie, Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan, Amy Ryan and many others.Director Eastwood triumphs again.",8,5,8,16 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Less chaotic and confusing than some of the earlier entries in the series
","Currently a captain without a ship - the Black Pearl having been shrunk and placed inside a sealed bottle, at least for the time being - the inimitable Jack Sparrow finds himself impressed on a vessel, captained by the Spanish pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), that is hot on the trail of Ponce de Leon's famed but ever elusive Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, a British contingent, led by peg-legged 'privateer, not pirate' Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), is on the same mission, though he claims to be doing it not for personal enrichment but for king and country.'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,' with a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rosio and direction by Rob Marshall, keeps the storyline fairly simple and streamlined this time out, avoiding the overstuffed, convoluted plotting that often made the earlier installments all but impossible to follow. Even Johnny Depp himself, in the spirit of the enterprise, seems to have toned down some of the more flamboyant qualities of his earlier performances and appears to be relishing playing a pirate who is less in charge of his own fate and more at the mercy of the other characters this time around. Yet, he's still able to land a sharp-tongued barb with the best of them, whether it be against Blackbeard, Barbossa or Angelica, the feisty love interest played by the beautiful Penelope Cruz.As is par for the course, the movie runs on far too long, padding out its length with a sappy romance between a preacher-man and a mermaid and a few too many distended swordfights for the movie's (and the audience's) good, but, overall, this turns out to be one of the less top-heavy and heavy-handed of the 'Pirates' films.",6,0,0,6 June 2012
The New World," an hypnotic and mesmerizing work of art
","When you see Terrence Malick's 'The New World,' you feel as if you are watching an exquisite poem coming to life on the big screen. This achingly beautiful work is only the fourth film in over thirty years by Malick, one of the least prolific and most talented directors in American movies. As with his previous films, 'Badlands,' Days of Heaven' and 'The Thin Red Line,' Malick eschews storyline and action for artistry and mood.'The New World' is a haunting evocation of that moment when two alien cultures met for the first time face to face. The year is 1607 and a fleet of ships dispatched by King James of England arrives on the shores of North America to establish a new settlement called (what else?) Jamestown. There to greet them is a beautiful young Indian princess known to us as Pocahontas who winds up captivating and falling in love with John Smith, the future leader of the settlement. Along with the expected clash of cultures, Malick showcases the heartbreaking story of two people who fall in love but are ultimately kept apart by their differences.Nobody captures the sheer exquisiteness of the natural landscape better than Malick, and every shot here is a masterpiece of composition, form and lighting. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has wrought endless miracles with his camera in terms of both movement and the framing of his subjects. Although the film is extremely studied and slow-moving, it is never static or boring, so enthralled are we by what it is showing us. Malick reminds us here that for all the advancements made in the art of special effects, it is good old-fashioned photography that can really make the jaw drop and the eye pop when it is done this well. Moreover, Malick has used natural sound beautifully, weaving it into the fabric of his love story, much as he has done with the exquisite and haunting musical score composed by James Horner ('Titanic').Even though the characters say little to one another - much of the dialogue comes in the form of voice-over recitations of journal entries or interior monologues - the filmmaker is able to convey romantic yearning with extraordinary force, primarily through facial expressions, bodily movements and lyrical camera-work. As Smith, Collin Farrell provides just the right combination of brooding introspection and wistful tender-heartedness to make the romance work. 15-year-old newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher turns Pocahontas into an almost ethereal presence, perfectly matching the dreamlike nature of the film.It would appear that the Motion Picture Academy has chosen to snub this film in most of the major categories (with the exception of cinematography). What a shame, for even though some people might dismiss 'The New World' as just Art with a capital 'A,' this is actually one of the most enthralling and cinematically beautiful films of recent times. It has the rare ability to transport you to a different world and leave you aching for more.",10,7,15,4 February 2006
Frost_Nixon," an epic battle of wills
","Never having seen Peter Morgan's 'Frost/Nixon' on stage, I can't speak to how much it may have gained or lost on its way to the big screen. I can, however, state that, in its latest incarnation, this is one humdinger of a political drama, as poignant as it is suspenseful, as intimate as it is wide-ranging. The story centers around the famous series of interviews that David Frost conducted with Richard Nixon in the spring of 1977, nearly three years after Nixon had been forced to resign in disgrace from the office of President of the United States. This is the encounter in which Nixon famously declared, 'When the President does it, that means it's not illegal' - as clear-cut and unabashed an acknowledgement of the corrupting influence of power as one could possibly expect from a politician. Morgan and director Ron Howard have taken full advantage of the new medium, giving the material room to breathe by opening it out beyond the restricted confines of the interview setting to the world at large. We go back and forth between London and Los Angeles, visiting key points of interest - The Beverly Hills Hotel, Nixon's home in California, etc. - along the way. This also means that more time can be devoted to the earlier stages of the story, including Frost's often desperate attempts to secure financing for the project, and the efforts both sides expend on brainstorming and strategizing for the final showdown.And what a showdown it turns out to be, for at its heart 'Frost/Nixon' is really an account of a fascinating, take-no-prisoners duel between two evenly matched opponents with diametrically contradictory goals. For Frost - a British entertainer who had, up to that point, made his name as a variety/talk show host in England and Australia and who was known primarily for his international-playboy antics off the set - these interviews would be his big chance to definitively establish, before a worldwide audience, his bona fides as a serious journalist, hopefully by making a disgraced ex-President wither under the glare of hardball questioning. For Richard Nixon, this seemed the golden opportunity to finally begin what would be a long and grueling process of rehabilitating his reputation and his legacy in the eyes of the public and of burnishing his place in history.Thus, with so much at stake, both men are seen throughout the movie trying their best to manipulate the interviews and indeed each other to their own advantage. Keenly aware that only one of them can ultimately emerge the 'victor' from their encounter, these two intellectual prizefighters jockey for position and power, sniffing out their opponent's weaknesses and vulnerabilities while playing intricately developed mind games on one another in the hopes of gaining the upper hand. Yet, oddly, as is usually the case in such situations, these two opponents actually discover that they have more in common with one another than they have differences that separate them.For all its excellences of cinematography, editing and direction, 'Frost/Nixon' is still, at its core and in deference to its theatrical roots, an 'actors' picture,' with Michael Sheen and Frank Langella brilliantly reprising the roles they created on stage. Langella never falls into the trap of relying solely on mimicry to capture the essence of a well-known and easily caricatured public figure. Instead, he allows us to see the subtle machinations of a man long adept at pulling the levers of power by manipulating events and individuals to his own advantage. Yet, at the same time, he shows us the gentler, more human side of a man wracked by loneliness and an innate lack of likability, who certainly didn't set out in life to become a tragic figure but who, through a lack of a clear moral compass, ended up that way anyway. Sheen more than fulfills the promise he demonstrated playing Tony Blair in 'The Queen,' making of Frost a good-natured but shrewd creature of the limelight who learns right quick that he needs to be wary of how a trapped beast will react when he's pushed into a corner with no way out. The beauty of the film is that, for all its emphasis on competitiveness and antagonism, it still manages to convey the mutual respect and even camaraderie that eventually came to define the relationship between the two men.These two towering performers are complemented by similarly impressive work from Kevin Bacon as Nixon's loyal aide, Rebecca Hall as Frost's latest girlfriend, and Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as anti-Nixon zealots brought in to help Frost craft the questions he's going to ask.Of course, as with most docudramas, it's often hard to tell which events are strictly factual (i.e. docu) and which have been made up or distorted for the sake of the drama. There is one glaring anachronism, for instance, when the filmmakers show Frost heading off to the premiere of 'The Slipper and the Rose' - a movie he helped finance - on the eve of the first interview in March 1977 when the movie was actually released in late 1976. And I'm sure there are plenty more, much less innocuous fabrications that those closer to the subject could easily point out. Yet, no matter how much liberty it may take with the facts, 'Frost/Nixon' turns relatively recent history into a riveting drama that has many pertinent things to say to the world today.",9,3,6,3 May 2009
Howl's Moving Castle," glorious visuals
","What do you get when you combine the master Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki ('My Neighbor Totoro,' 'Spirited Away') with the British sci-fi novelist Diana Wynne Jones? The answer is 'Howl's Moving Castle,' an enchanting (if not altogether understandable) animated feature, filled with beauty, imagination and magic.Sophie is a shy young girl, working in her family's hat shop, who falls under the spell of a witch who turns her into a decrepit old woman. At a loss as to what to do, Sophie decides to leave home and try to find a cure for her condition in the mysterious land of wizards and witches that lies just outside her city. Not long after she arrives, she encounters the mysterious 'moving castle,' owned by the enigmatic wizard known as Howl, that not only roams freely around the countryside but seems to exist in any number of different dimensions at the same time. It's when she passes through the castle door and discovers what awaits her inside that the really surreal adventure begins.There's little point in trying to figure out all the fine details of the story, which often feels as if it is being made up as it goes along - and not always in a way that is completely satisfying to those of us who are trying desperately to understand it. Yet, there is a certain fascination in the way the film chooses to defy all the rules of time and space and feels no real compunction to explain how all of it is supposed to work. The movie asks us to merely accept what we are seeing at face value and to go along wherever it is it wants to take us. This is an easy thing to do, primarily because the film's incredible beauty seduces us into accepting the slightly weird alternate reality the movie has set up for us. Although the animators are all Japanese, the characters themselves are Occidental and the film appears to be set sometime in the late Victorian or early Edwardian era of a century ago. The visuals are so exquisite in every detail that it is virtually impossible for us to turn our eyes from the screen even for a split second. Like the best animated films, it transports us to a world that is both utterly fantastic and strangely familiar at the same time.In bringing the characters to life, the English-language version employs an impressive cast of voices, including veterans Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner, along with Billy Crystal, Emily Mortimer and Christian Bale.With its occasionally incoherent storyline and deliberate pacing, 'Howl's Moving Castle' may disappoint and frustrate those accustomed to the more simple, hectic and frenetic animated films churned out regularly by Hollywood. But if you're in the mood for a calmer, more relaxing trip to a world not your own, 'Howl's Moving Castle' provides just the right vehicle to take you there.",8,4,6,27 August 2006
Walk the Line," great acting overcomes standard storyline
","Because it is based on two of his own published memoirs ('Cash: the Autobiography' and 'The Man in Black'), 'Walk the Line' becomes, in many ways, the 'official' movie biography of musician/singer/songwriter Johnny Cash - and it isn't really the movie's fault that it arrives so close on the heels of 'Ray,' the equally critically acclaimed film about Ray Charles. The similarities between the two stories are, at times, positively amazing: the meteoric rise to stardom, the unhappy marriage, the serial philandering, the substance abuse, the arrest for drug possession. Heck, there's even the death of a beloved brother in a freak childhood accident that comes to haunt both the men for the rest of their lives. Yet, 'Walk the Line, ' written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold and directed by Mangold, triumphs over its biopic clichés thanks to solid writing, toe-tapping musical numbers and superb performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in the key roles of Cash and singing superstar - and future wife - June Carter.Phoenix pours his whole heart and soul into his performance both as an actor and as a singer, reproducing Cash's sound and vocal intonations with uncanny accuracy. Witherspoon captures Carter's sizzle and spunk perfectly, yet brings a real sensitivity and thoughtfulness to the character. Their romantic scenes together are some of the best in the film and it is as a romance, rather than as a cautionary tale of the perils of show business, that the movie really connects with its audience.We've seen a lot of this stuff before, but all credit to the actors, we don't mind watching it again.",8,0,0,16 February 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Candid Camera for the 21st Century
","The pseudo-documentary 'Borat' resembles nothing so much as a 'Candid Camera' episode on crack. Like Allen Funt, the originator of the format, Sacha Baron Cohen - along with his co-writers, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham and Dan Mazer and director Larry Charles - generates laughs by tricking unsuspecting people into making complete and utter fools of themselves on camera. Only, in this case, Cohen ventures much further into the realms of vulgarity and crudeness than Funt could ever have imagined or the television censors of his time would ever have permitted. As embodied by Cohen, Borat is a fictional character who hails from the very real West Asian country of Kazakhstan. Convinced that he can learn some valuable lessons from the West that he can then bring back and share with his own people, Borat says goodbye to his impoverished village and heads to the United States to experience first hand the accoutrements of American culture. The film chronicles the many absurd encounters he has with the folks he meets, mainly in Middle America, as he wends his way westward across the continent in search of his dream girl, Pamela Anderson. Some of the 'skits' the filmmakers have come up with are sidesplitting and hilarious, some merely amusing, and others downright offensive (and all the funnier for being offensive, I might add). The movie is least successful when it breaks away from the strict 'Candid Camera' formula and shows us Borat on his own, out of sight of anyone not in on the joke, still carrying on the fiction. In other words, the more 'scripted' the movie appears, the less authentic it feels. It should also be noted that there are times when one gets the impression that the people on whom the deception is being played are not quite as ignorant of the ruse as they appear to be, primarily because the placing of the camera often feels illogical if the spontaneity were truly real and genuine. The one element that made 'Candid Camera' utterly believable was that it was careful to keep the camera completely hidden throughout the course of the bit. Here we wonder why it takes people so long to realize that they are indeed the target of a colossal joke (a prime example is when the old Jewish couple is walking up the stairs to bring food to the visiting Borat and the camera is filming them from OUTSIDE the room rather than sticking with Borat and his cohort within).However, what gives the movie its gravitas and heft, and takes it far beyond the level of mere 'Jackass'-type gimmickry is how Cohen manages to use his shtick to expose the bigotry and xenophobia that lie just beneath the surface of a certain segment of American society. Yet, one should also point out that quite a number of these people are actually more tolerant and indulgent of Borat's inane antics than one might except any reasonable person to be (or than we ourselves might be if we were put in a similar situation). Indeed, there's a certain cruelty to the film in that the individuals and groups he is mocking are actually treating him rather nicely at times. The audience is allowed to feel superior to the people on screen in a way that might not be entirely justified. 'Candid Camera' always seemed innocent and harmless in its intentions; 'Borat' definitely does not, which is both the strength and the weakness of the film.Still, love him or loathe him, one cannot help but sit back and admire the sheer courage and chutzpah Cohen displays in placing himself in what are, in actuality, some pretty hairy situations. That he isn't ridden out of town on a rail, the outraged citizenry chasing close behind him with torches ablaze, is, perhaps, the most astonishing aspect of the movie. It's the bald-faced audacity with which Cohen throws himself into his work - rather than the quality of the individual sketches themselves - that ultimately makes 'Borat' so much fun to watch.",8,5,12,14 April 2007
The Incredible Hulk," big and loud but with a certain amount of heart
","Louis Leterrier's 'The Incredible Hulk' dispenses with all the how-Dr.-Bruce-Banner-became-a-hulking-monster stuff in the opening credits (the result of gamma ray poisoning from an experiment that went terribly awry, for those who don't already know), thereby making the film more of a sequel to the Ang Lee version from 2003 than a remake of it (even though all the parts are played by different actors). Though far from perfect, that earlier 'Hulk' was, I believe, unfairly pilloried for being just a tad too brooding and a trifle too thoughtful for a mind-numbing, feel-good summertime blockbuster (it WAS an Ang Lee film, after all). Well, most of that 'problem' has been eliminated in this new version, which has streamlined its story into a virtual nonstop orgy of chase sequences, exploding vehicles and general CGI mayhem. The good news, though, is that 'The Incredible Hulk' boasts the highly gifted Edward Norton as Bruce, who gives the film a human heart anyway.For the most part, 'The Incredible Hulk' is one big long chase story interrupted by occasional romantic interludes between Bruce and his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Live Tyler), the fellow scientist who accidentally helped to make Bruce the man/monster hybrid he is today. Bruce's main nemesis is Betty's father, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), the military officer who wants to capture the young man - who has spent the last several years in hiding, futilely searching for a cure - so that he can replicate the experiment and turn out a veritable army of indestructible incredible hulks.Norton and Tyler make a fine romantic pair, and Tim Roth does his usual superlative job as the villainous (are there any other kind?) former KGB agent who wants to be first in line to volunteer to be 'hulked.' The filmmakers, moreover, manage to fork over a little screen time to Lou Ferrigno in a cameo appearance (he also provides the voice for the Hulk) and even the late Bill Bixby who shows up in a brief clip from TV's 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father.' The controversy over which of the two 'Hulk' films is better (i.e. more faithful to the spirit of the original) is sure to rage on for years to come. I have no real desire to either enter the fray or belabor the point (I like them both about equally), but let me just say that this latest 'Hulk' is really all about the action and, for the most part, it delivers on that level. But thanks to Norton and Tyler, like the Lee version, it has some much-needed soul as well.",7,2,5,7 July 2008
The Monuments Men," Fails to do justice to its story
","There's something almost refreshingly old-fashioned about 'The Monuments Men,' one of those Very Important Pictures that Hollywood used to produce with such abundance in its heyday. It's one of those World War II pictures in which a motley group of strangers is recruited by the United States Army to carry out a mission behind enemy lines. Dubbed the Monuments Men, this group of art experts was assigned the task of rescuing some of the world's greatest art masterpieces from the grasping hands of the Nazis who were busily absconding with the works with the intention of displaying them in a museum of their own after the war. Lt. Frank Stokes, who spearheaded the mission, is portrayed by George Clooney, while the men he recruits are played by Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bib Balaban, Dimitri Leonidas and Hugh Bonneville ('Downton Abbey'). Cate Blanchett co-stars as a curator who is also a Resistance fighter working for the French Underground, and who is initially suspicious of the Monuments Men's motives for rounding up the treasures.The movie is interesting enough as an unusual slice of history, I suppose, but the screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov, based on the book by Robert M. Edsel, never finds a way to make this true life tale come alive as drama. The characters are dull and under-developed, and, as a consequence, we find ourselves strangely uninterested in their back stories and unmoved by their fates. There is also way too much emphasis placed on the comical and the sentimental, and the movie comes replete with a gratingly frivolous score that seems woefully inappropriate to the subject at hand.Despite the all-star cast, the movie is weighed down by over-earnest acting, with Murray and Balaban seemingly on hand mainly for the comic relief they provide. Clooney has directed the film with hollow competence, and there's some discussion about whether or not lives should be risked for the sake of inanimate objects, no matter how valuable, but it's hard to make anything particularly memorable out of a story where the artwork has more personality than the players.",4,3,4,1 June 2014
Miracle," not a single original moment
","Those who made 'Miracle' seem to think that none of us have ever seen a movie about a sports team before. Even though it is based on a true story, the film is so derivative and formulaic that you could practically write the screenplay yourself (had scenarist Eric Guggenheim not already done it for you, that is). Despite the best efforts of Kurt Russell in the lead role, there isn't a single original or surprising moment in the entire 134 minutes that the film takes to drag us through its story.Russell plays Herb Brooks, a hockey coach from Minnesota who fulfills his dream of leading an American team to a gold medal against the Soviets in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. Brooks is the ultimate sports film stereotype: a coach driven to extremes to make his team the best that it can be. More drill sergeant than coach, he pushes his players almost to the breaking point, carrying his 'tough love' philosophy nearly to the level of sadism. But, of course, this uncompromising taskmaster is just what this ragtag collection of hockey players needs to achieve cohesion and discipline, break through their underdog status, and pull off a 'miraculous' win on the ice. And this is also what eventually earns him the undying respect and allegiance of his players, fellow coaches and financial backers, all of whom greet Brooks with initial skepticism until they see the miracle he is able to perform. It's hard to overestimate just how vapid and corny most of 'Miracle' turns out to be. The boys have so little personality that they quickly become both interchangeable as teammates and indistinguishable as individuals. Patricia Clarkson plays the stereotypical loving wife who nevertheless whines and pouts endlessly because her hubby is devoting all his time to the team and none to the family at home. Much of the dialogue is of the rah-rah, pep talk, we-are-family variety, made all the more mawkish by a lugubrious symphonic score droning on incessantly in the background.The raison d'etre that is supposed to separate 'Miracle' from all those countless films that have come before it is the fact that this team beat the Soviets at a time when not only was the Cold War at its height but the Russians had just invaded Afghanistan, the Iranians were holding American citizens hostage, and American motorists were stuck in long gas lines during the peak of the 'energy crisis.' We even hear a snippet of President Carter's infamous 'malaise' speech to underscore just how badly Americans were feeling about themselves and how much of a moral boost this victory gave to the beleaguered nation. The film, however, despite its good intentions, is simply not rich or resonant enough to sustain this broader theme. Thus, even with all the swelling music and inspirational speeches, 'Miracle' can't overcome the triteness at its core. 'Miracle' is a feel-good movie for the easily impressed.",Null,0,3,30 September 2004
Requiem for a Dream," powerful anti-drug drama
","Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing `Requiem For a Dream,' a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison. This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking. The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start. Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.  Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, `Requiem For a Dream,' though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored.",Null,1,2,11 January 2002
Captain Phillips," Action the Greengrass way
","Based on an event that garnered worldwide attention in 2009, 'Captain Phillips' tells the tale of two total strangers, both hailing from opposites corners of the earth, who are brought together by circumstance and fate.One of those individuals is Richard Phillips, the captain of an unarmed cargo ship sailing through international waters off the coast of Africa en route to Mombasa, and the other is Abduwali Muse, the leader of a band of Somali pirates who are determined to board the ship and hold its captain and crew hostage for ransom.Billy Ray has based his screenplay on the book 'A Captain's Duty' by Steven Talty and Phillips himself. The movie, directed with his usual taut precision by Paul Greengrass, relates the story in step-by-step detail, exploring the relationship between these two wildly disparate but equally desperate captains, as a thrilling real-life drama plays itself out on the high seas. While Phillips' self-sacrificing heroism - and that of the Navy Seals who successfully took out three of the four pirates - takes center stage in the drama, Ray is still able to give Abduwali his due, making it clear that the young man has been driven to this action as much out of desperation as out of greed or criminal intent, since illegal fishing and the dumping of toxic waste on the part of foreigners in that area have pretty much depleted the Somali fishing grounds, leaving men like Abduwali without any viable means of supporting themselves and their families. Sadly, piracy becomes the next obvious step in the struggle for survival. It would have been easy to have turned Abduwali and his cohorts into one-dimensional villains, but, to their credit, Ray and Greengrass have chosen not to do so. This complexity of character is attributable in no small measure to the outstanding performances by veteran Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his work here. Together, they create a human dynamic that carries the film far beyond the heart-stopping, race-against-the-clock surface aspects of the drama. Not that the visceral is in any way slighted, for in true Greengrass fashion, the film moves along at a breakneck pace, rarely slowing down to give the audience a chance to catch its breath along the way.By far, the most effective scene in the movie comes right near the end, after Phillips has been rescued and is taken to the ship's trauma center to ascertain his physical and mental condition. Unlike the vast majority of movies and TV shows in which characters who are subjected to horrifying circumstances seem to bounce back from them almost immediately, 'Captain Phillips' shows us the true human response to a life-shattering, traumatic event (thanks in no small measure to Hanks' magnificent acting). It is just this type of insightful verisimilitude that informs each and every moment of 'Captain Phillips.'",Null,13,17,7 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," passable prequel
","One of the most tricky obstacle courses through which many films must maneuver is the one known as 'the expectations game.' Some films, for one reason or another, find themselves hyped beyond the level of any possible human realization and risk crashing and burning when finally unspooled before an impossibly demanding audience.  Certainly, no film in history (with the possible exception of 'Gone With the Wind') has ever met with move prerelease anticipation than this longdelayed prequel to the most beloved movie series of all time.  That 'The Phantom Menace' survives this buildup at all is, perhaps, testament to the vision and technical skill of its creator George Lucas.  For this newest installment, though lacking the novelty and homespun charm of the original 1977 classic, emerges as a reasonably entertaining and enjoyable summertime action film. What distinguished the first film, in particular, was, of course, the complete novelty of the experience.  Certainly, no one had ever seen anything like it before.  Now, twenty-one years later, and after two sequels and countless imitators, it has become impossible to recreate that feeling of newness and freshness that so imbued the original film.  In fact, a bit too much of the plotting and imagery echoes the first (or fourth, if you prefer) installment of the series: the strongwilled, but endangered princess, the final attack on the enemy spaceship, the climactic gathering of the main characters as they are showered with kudos by a grateful society.  Indeed, the final scene is actually emblematic of some of the failure of this film.  In the original, since we were made to care for the main characters through their sharply drawn personalities and sophisticated wit, we left the film feeling exhilarated.  Here, since the characters (each of them acted with stodgy seriousness) have not registered deeply as likable and recognizably human compatriots in adventure, the scene falls flat, and we leave the theatre feeling strangely let down.  In addition, Darth Maul is completely ineffective and even inexplicable as the film's main villain. So, given all these flaws, what makes 'The Phantom Menace' a relatively entertaining film?  Essentially, it is Lucas' ability to create such fantastic worlds and to respect the audience's ability to connect this story to the future tales with which we are already familiar.  The heavy reliance on exposition, which might sink another action film, actually lifts this one because we feel we are watching a puzzle slowly coming together and wait eagerly for the entire picture to emerge.  In addition, Lucas takes a dramatic risk by only hinting at the evil propensities hidden within the seemingly angelic boy we know will grow up to be Darth Vader - and these hints only come through the concerned statements of the Jedi masters around him, not through any of the statements, actions, or even mannerisms of the child himself.  This provides an arc to link this installment through the next two films to the fourth episode.  As to the special effects, many are extremely impressive (especially the pod race), but the space battles seem strangely bland and not much more technically advanced from the originals. In fact, for a movie with 'Star Wars' in its title, this film takes place surprisingly little in space.  Moreover, it is not always unnoticeable when an effect is actually an effect.  Many of the CGI effects seem less seamless than say those in 'Jurassic Park'.  The photography also appears a bit blurrier and more washed out than one might expect.  All in all, 'The Phantom Menace' probably will not hold up upon repeated viewings as well as most of the other installments do.  But, for its narrative thrust and its often dazzling special effects, this is a film worth seeing at least once.",7,0,2,22 July 1999
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," action washed away by suds
","If you're developing cold feet at the prospect of tying the knot - especially if you happen to be human and your intended a vampire - you may want to avoid watching 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,' written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Bill Condon. And if you are contemplating having a baby with a vampire, then you REALLY don't want to catch this fourth film based on the series of phenomenally successful novels by Stephanie Meyer.In this installment, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her dreamy vampire boyfriend Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally get hitched, but happiness is fleeting for the newlyweds as the still-human Bella finds herself coping with the most disturbing and problematic movie pregnancy since 'Rosemary's Baby' (or 'Alien,' if you want to count that as a pregnancy).In purely narrative terms, this is a fairly static entry in the series, as Bella wastes away to skeletal status through the ordeal, and everyone sits around discussing the moral implications of having an unprecedented cross-species child, especially when the birth experience itself will likely spell death for the mother. There's a halfhearted attempt at revving up the action when the werewolves threaten to intervene by killing Bella, but the star-crossed and loyalty-divided Jacob (Taylor Lautner) defuses the situation in quick order (it also leads to a ludicrous voice-over conversation among the wolves that provides some unintentional laughs for the audience).Still, Stewart gets to do more intense acting than she has thus far in the series, and Bella's transformation plus the addition of the child offer new story possibilities for 'Breaking Dawn - Part 2,' due for release in November 2012.",5,5,6,31 March 2012
3:10 to Yuma," flawed but generally compelling Western drama
","Set in the years immediately following the Civil War, '3:10 to Yuma' is a rip-snortin', old-fashioned Western whose characterizations and performances compensate for an occasionally muddled plot line and a tendency towards implausibility.Christian Bale stars as Dan Evans, a struggling rancher who, for a $200 fee, agrees to help escort a cold-blooded killer to the train that will take him to prison in Yuma, Arizona (at that time a territory, not a state). Russell Crowe is Ben Wade, the gang-leading outlaw whose very name strikes terror in the hearts of the local populace. Based on the short story by Elmore Leonard ( as well as the 1957 movie derived therefrom), '3:10 to Yuma' is a thoughtful Western drama that nicely balances its requisite shootouts and tough-guy posturing with just enough psychological insight to make the whole thing interesting and worthwhile.The two stars bring a great deal of intelligence and conviction to the roles they've been assigned to play. Bale's reticent stoicism is placed in direct opposition to Crowe's world weary cynicism and outward charm - and the match-up is a good one. The men they are portraying may have an entirely different view of morality and of what it takes to be a man, but they are still able to establish a genuine, if somewhat shaky, rapport on the common ground of mutual respect and understanding. The climax of the story may feel a trifle contrived and artificial - we really don't believe that Wade would do what he does at the end - but it isn't enough to spoil the overall effectiveness of the film.James Mangold ('Cop Land, 'Walk the Line') has directed the movie with sufficient gusto and energy to counteract some of the verbosity of the screenplay. Fortunately, the dialogue generally avoids platitudes and clichés - although the action itself is frequently confusing and often geographically inconsistent (i.e. characters who don't have horses seem to arrive at destinations almost as quickly as those who do).In addition to Bale and Crowe, Mangold has elicited excellent performances from Ben Foster as Wade's wiry but creepily bloodthirsty henchman, Charlie; Logan Lerman as Evans' too-big-for-his-britches older son, William; and screen legend Peter Fonda as the hard-bitten bounty hunter, Byron McElroy, who may finally have met his match in the wily Mr. Wade.On a final sour note, the cinematography by Phedon Papamichael is surprisingly dull, muddy and lifeless, an especial disappointment considering the gorgeous Southwestern landscape with which he was given to work.All in all, however, a very fine Western.",7,9,20,15 September 2007
Ali," superficial study of the title character
","`Ali' runs an impressive 157 minutes  yet we don't feel as if we know much more about Muhammad Ali THE PERSON at the end of the film than we did at the beginning.  Sure, we may know more facts and details about his life than we did before but not about what really makes him TICK.  Of course, any film that attempts to record the life of a man is, by necessity, going to have to pick and choose which of the many events of that life to leave in and which to throw out.  Granted.  But the cursory nature of the screenplay causes a serious problem for this film.  The story picks up Ali's life in 1964, back when he was still known as Cassius Clay, de-throning Sonny Liston to become heavyweight-boxing champion of the world. The time in his life before this event is dealt with in elliptical fashion. We see virtually nothing about how he was raised, what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.  Without this crucial understanding of his formative years, the Ali we see in the film seems a very superficial version of the undoubtedly more complex real life figure.  For all the screenplay's devotion to the minutiae of Ali's career as a boxer, his travels to Africa, his experiences with women, his world-famous bouts with Joe Frasier and George Foreman, the Ali of this film remains a frustrating enigma from first moment to last.  Worse, he remains static as a character, never undergoing the kind of mental, emotional or psychological growth one would expect a biography to show us.  Even his trademark egotism comes across as just a front for public consumption since he doesn't exhibit any undue arrogance in his dealings with those around him when he is out of the limelight.  Perhaps that might be the point the film is trying to make, but if it is, it is never clearly or effectively exploited to any thematic or dramatic purpose.That is not to say that the film does not provide some ancillary pleasures. Certainly, its strongest asset is its ability to recreate a fascinating time in world history.  Since Ali's life seemed to touch on so many of the key events of that era  racism, Black Pride, the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.  his story actually becomes emblematic of the times in which he prospered.  Director Michael Mann manages to capture the flavor of that moment in bold, telling strokes, in large crowd scenes and in glimpses of protest riots and the brutal slayings of unarmed men. Yet, when necessary, Mann proves himself the master of both understatement and subtlety, as in his almost indirect depiction of King's killing.  In terms of their editing, the boxing scenes seem somehow less dynamic  and thereby perhaps a bit more realistic  than those in many other films on the subject.  Will Smith does an excellent job in bringing Ali to life, even if the script doesn't always provide him with the material he could have used to get at the core of the man's being.  Jon Voight does an effective job under all the makeup impersonating the inimitable Howard Cosell, yet, here too, we are never really shown just how this obviously symbiotic relationship between the boxer and the sportscaster ever came to develop.  It is crucial details like these which seem to be missing all throughout the movie.  Thus, despite the wonderful time capsule aspect of the film, `Ali' emerges as a disappointingly superficial study of its subject.  For whatever reason, the lives of boxers remain prime grist for the moviemaking mill.  In just the last few years alone, we have had films made about both `Hurricane' Carter and Muhammad Ali.  My only question is this: can `The Mike Tyson Story' be far behind?",Null,0,1,12 July 2002
The Longest Yard," undistinguished remake
","In what is fast turning out to be one of the biggest years ever for cinematic retreads (doesn't anybody out in Hollywood have any NEW ideas anymore?), 'The Longest Yard' is the second remake of a Robert Aldrich film to hit theaters in the past six months. The first, 'Flight of the Phoenix,' was released last December. Now all we can ask is, can the 'new and improved' version of 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?,' starring Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, be far behind?.In this new edition of the '70's hit, Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, an ex-quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers who was banished from the league six years earlier for allegedly shaving points off a game. When he is arrested for stealing his girlfriend's car, Crewe is sent to a Texas prison run by a diabolical warden and his cadre of sadistic guards. The warden, a football fan from way back, enlists Crewe's expertise in putting together a team of convicts to take on the guards in a 'friendly little game' of intramural football. The caveat is that this ragtag team must be good enough to make a decent show of things but not good enough to beat their opponent or there will be hell to pay. Thus, the game becomes an inverted, high stakes encounter pitting the forces of good (the prisoners) against the forces of evil (the penal authorities).Thirty years have elapsed since I saw the original version of this film, so I don't feel particularly qualified to evaluate how this new one stacks up against the old. I will say, however, that this 'Yard' faces some serious problems at the get-go with the casting of Sandler in the lead role. Burt Reynolds, who played the protagonist in the original film and who gets a fairly good-sized role in this one as well, was at least credible as a man who might have been a professional football player. But Adam Sandler!? Come to think of it, Sandler is probably more believable as an NFL legend than he is as a hot underwear spokes-model, an absurdity we are also asked to swallow - but the less said about that the better.There isn't much to recommend this latest edition of 'The Longest Yard.' The plotting is predictable, the characters mere two-dimensional stereotypes and the humor obvious and lowbrow. And the final showdown - i.e. the big game - goes on for so long that most of the tension inherent in the material simply drains away long before the closing credits.Perhaps the saddest aspect of this movie is watching Cloris Leachman making a complete and utter fool of herself playing a grotesque, beehive-coiffured sex maniac obsessed with seducing the young Mr. Crewe. Some sights we should just not be asked to face in this lifetime.",4,0,2,9 July 2005
Skyfall," Bond grows up
","Seems James Bond, aka 007, ain't quite as young and as spry as he used to be. After years of chasing the bad guys and suffering one too many injuries and wounds on the job, the world's premier secret agent is beginning to feel his age.In this outing, a noticeably creakier Bond goes in pursuit of an ex-agent who's targeting MI6 and particularly its chief, M, for wrongs he believes he's suffered at their hands.In addition to providing a more relatable Bond - replete with autobiographical back story - and M, 'SkyFall' is that rare action movie that actually finds time to probe some surprisingly heady themes amid all the obligatory shootouts and chase scenes (which are excellent, by the way, especially the tour de force opening scene).For instance, the script ponders whether MI6's old-school reliance on secret agents has become a hopelessly antiquated business model for a world in which technology has begun to replace time-consuming footwork and in which the enemy is no longer out in the open but operating in the shadows.The movie also questions M's practice of cutting loose her most loyal and valued agents (Bond included) - essentially treating them as disposable assets - when a greater goal is to be achieved through their sacrifice.The dialogue between Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M is some of the best in the whole Bond series, and there is a genuine connection between the two individuals who, although they're working for the same team, often seem more like adversaries than allies.'Skyfall' also provides us with one of the most effective villains we've come across in quite awhile, in the person of Javier Bardem as the former operative who's decided to exact his revenge on the people and the organization that he feels have done him wrong.Director Sam Raimi even manages to achieve some genuine lyricism in his direction, something one almost never finds in an action film.It seems to me that the Bond franchise has really upped its game since Craig hopped aboard in 2006's 'Casino Royale' (despite the stumble of 'Quantum of Solace'). Happily, 'Skyfall' restores that upward trajectory.",9,3,9,1 March 2014
50 First Dates," uneven romantic comedy
","In '50 First dates' - which might well be subtitled 'When 'Memento' Met 'Groundhog Day'' - Drew Barrymore plays a young woman whose short term memory has been destroyed in a car accident a few months prior to the time of the story. As a result, Lucy wakes up every morning still believing it is the day of the accident, while every night her memory of that current day is wiped away while she sleeps. Her father and her brother have devised an elaborate charade to avoid her finding out the truth, assuming that she will live a much happier life if she is kept in blissful ignorance of her condition. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a veterinarian who's deathly afraid of commitment and figures Lucy is the perfect woman for him. He can woo her afresh every day, secure in the knowledge that their relationship will never have to advance much beyond the getting-to-know-you stage - though this doesn't make for a very logical plan since winning her over day after day requires a lot more work and effort than a conventional relationship ever would. Nevertheless, this seems to Henry to be the ideal setup, until, of course, he begins to actually fall for the hapless young woman, revealing that he is not quite the callous rogue he appears to be on the surface. Your enjoyment of '50 First Dates' may be predicated on just how willing you are to accept brain damage as a source of mirth and high comedy. If you are somehow able to quell the queasiness that comes with the premise, you might be charmed by what happens in the film. This is basically a gimmicky, one-joke comedy that indulges in far too many distractions to be very successful. There is, admittedly, a certain sweetness to many of the scenes involving Barrymore and Sandler as they try to make a go of this highly unusual courtship. The final scene, in particular, has a kind of offbeat poignancy that feels both daring and satisfying. However, the film is populated by a whole host of annoying characters who work overtime to deaden the charm: Lucy's steroid-obsessed brother, Henry's creepy co-workers, and even an anthropomorphic walrus who high-fives his trainer, mugs for the camera, and vomits on cue - and whose sizable genitalia serves as the source for one of the many lowbrow gags that run through the film.In 'Punch Drunk Love,' Sandler proved that he has the potential to stretch as an actor. Barrymore has yet to make that case. Her wide-eyed, innocent ingénue shtick has become a trifle threadbare by now. It's time for her to take a leap of faith into more challenging roles and show us what - if anything - else she can do.",Null,2,3,9 October 2004
The Young Victoria," Blunt scores as the young queen
","'The Young Victoria' takes us back to the 1830s, when England's future queen was a mere princess of seventeen - yet all set to take her rightful place on the throne, soon to be vacated by her ailing and childless uncle, King William. However, such an ascension was easier said than done, for there were those who believed that the sheltered young woman was just a bit too naïve in the ways of the world to successfully carry out the duties of a leader of the British Empire. The movie also focuses on the romance between the princess and her German cousin, Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), who sees in Victoria a woman of independent thought and strong will - a quick-witted individual who has the ability to see through much of the palace politics and behind-the-scenes machinations going on around her. Yet, the fly-in-the-ointment comes in the form of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), Prime Minister of England and a first-class manipulator, who charms his way into becoming the young queen's personal confidante and helper, largely in control of the people she sees and the decisions she makes - a relationship that ultimately threatens to bring on a constitutional crisis for the nation and that finally comes to a head once the queen has chosen Prince Albert to be her husband.Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, 'The Young Victoria' is a visually opulent costume drama that, nevertheless, manages to keep its characters relatable and life-sized. This is due, in large part, to Emily Blunt, who makes of the queen a modern, forward-looking young woman who takes her royal duties and her commitment to her subjects, especially the downtrodden ones, with the utmost seriousness. The always reliable Jim Broadbent also scores as the aging and irascible king who precedes her on the throne. Still, the screenplay by Julian Fellowes could probably have done with a little less fawning over the royal couple, as I'm sure their romance was not quite as idyllic or their lives and personalities quite as unyieldingly noble as they are depicted herein.Stylistically, the movie may be elegant and stately, but it's rarely stilted or stuffy. The royal stratagems and political power plays can sometimes be hard to follow for us plebeians in the audience, but armchair historians will find much to whet their Victorian Era appetites here.",7,1,1,10 July 2010
Catch Me If You Can," entertaining, if minor, Spielberg
","From childhood on, we are taught that honesty is a virtue and dishonesty a vice.  We have that message pounded into our heads and branded into our psyches by parents and teachers, by law enforcers and lawmakers, by clergymen and civic leaders.  Yet, at the same time, society as a whole, especially in our entertainment, has always had a certain soft spot for the scoundrel and the rogue, a kind of running love affair with the con man, the shyster, the rascal who can pull the wool over everyone's eyes and get away with it.  It is this paradox of human nature that Steven Spielberg celebrates in `Catch Me if You Can,' the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., the huckster supreme who, at the incredible age of 17, left home and family, and managed to pass himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and to swindle the banks out of millions of dollars in bad checks into the bargain.If the film didn't say that it was based on a true story, no one would ever believe it, so absurd and unlikely is its premise.  The story certainly proves that old adage that fact is indeed stranger than fiction.  In many ways, `Catch Me if You Can' is essentially a lighthearted, comic version of `Les Miserables' (or `The Fugitive' if you prefer), with Tom Hanks as the Javert-like Carl Hanratty, a by-the-book FBI agent who becomes personally obsessed with bagging this one particular lawbreaker, who somehow manages to deftly evade his every attempt at capture.  For Hanratty, apprehending Frank becomes the quest that gives his life meaning and purpose, the focal point of his existence.  Hanks does a splendid job capturing the deadpan seriousness of this single-minded but constantly put-upon individual, never allowing him to become a mere buffoon or caricature as he might have become in less capable hands.  Leonardo Di Caprio does a first rate job turning Frank into a world-class charmer.  We understand how so many people could allow themselves to be duped by his charismatic personality.  And it is nice to see Christopher Walken NOT playing a creepy villain for a change, but rather a father who loves his son but who simply can't find it within himself to be either a successful person in his own right or a moral role model for his boy to follow.Spielberg does a fine job pointing up the parallels between Frank and Carl, the lawbreaker and the law enforcer.  Despite the fact that they are antipodes apart on the legal spectrum, both are living lives of loneliness and emptiness, and they develop a strange sort of camaraderie on that basis. For one thing Frank learns is that, although he may be able to dupe people into believing all sorts of untruths about him and live high in the process, there is no substitution for the real things in life like love, marriage and family that money cannot buy.`Catch Me if You Can,' though it is a very entertaining film, ultimately feels a trifle incomplete, as if it were lacking just that touch of depth that would make it truly outstanding.  It's fun on the surface, but it never seems to dig much beneath that surface.  Perhaps, it is in the nature of the story itself that the trouble lies.  Once we catch on to the novelty of the plot, the story doesn't really seem to have anywhere to go except to keep showing us the same thing over and over again.  For all the bravura performances, the characters never quite show us what makes them tick.  This is particularly true of Frank, whose motives remain obscure throughout most of the film.  Oh well.  `Catch Me if You Can' is intended primarily as a lark, I imagine, and on that level it is generally successful.This latest film certainly does not rank up there in the Spielberg pantheon. It is, in fact, a minor work by a major filmmaker, who is merely marking time, perhaps, till his next true masterwork.  It's Spielberg in a relaxed, kick back, sunny mood, not as great as when he is really pumping away hard, but good enough for the time being.",Null,3,7,6 January 2003
Iron Man 3," RD Jr. as always saves the day
","A sequel to both the earlier 'Iron Man' movies and the multi-character 'The Avengers,' 'Iron Man 3' finds Tony Stark suffering from panic attacks after his close brush with death during the traumatic battle of New York that took place in the latter film. Now he's up against an evil techno genius played by Guy Pearce who's created an army of exploding warriors he plans to use to take over the world.Written by Drew Pearce and director Shane Black, the plot isn't all that compelling this time around, but as usual, it is Robert Downey, Jr. who keeps the super hero relatable and life-sized amidst the crassness of the movie's multi-million dollar production values and special effects. Downey's greatest achievement is that he manages to be wisecracky and smart-alecky without becoming cynical. This is enhanced by the chemistry between him and Gwyneth Paltrow as his erstwhile ladylove and company CEO Pepper Potts.The special effects are predictably spectacular - with a jumping-out-of-an-airplane scene an eye-popping, heart-stopping standout - but, as with the earlier films in the series, it's the humanity of the title character that makes it all work.",7,0,1,7 November 2013
Marie Antoinette," understated historical drama
","Perhaps unfairly, the name Marie Antoinette has become virtually synonymous with the upper class' indifference to the sufferings of the poor. Even all these centuries later, many people still believe that the much-maligned French queen actually uttered the words, 'Let them eat cake,' when confronted with the news that her subjects were starving (the phrase actually comes from a play popular at the time). Writer/director Sofia Coppola's new film, 'Marie Antoinette,' based on the book 'Marie Antoinette: The Journey' by Antonia Fraser, seems determined to clear her name and change that perception.In this film, Marie Antoinette is seen as a sheltered, somewhat frivolous young girl unprepared for the role history was about to thrust upon her. The movie begins at the moment when the Archduchess of Austria, aged 14, has been promised in wedlock to France's Prince Louis XVI as part of a treaty between the two countries. She is quickly whisked away to her new nation and new role, becoming a virtual prisoner to the proscribed rites and regulations of court life at Versailles in the late 18th Century.In a wise move artistically (if not commercially), Coppola has seen fit to bleed the film of most of its potential hyperbole and melodrama, choosing instead to concentrate on the gossipy pettiness and mind-numbing rituals of royal life at that time. We see Marie completely stripped of any sense of personal privacy, as she endures the indignities of a virtual cast of thousands having a hand in her dressing herself in the morning and being constantly under the watchful eye of moral advisers on the lookout for any breach of etiquette or protocol deemed unbecoming of a queen. Coppola immerses us in all the finery and opulence of the glittery setting, while the drama ever so subtly plays itself out. Even though Marie clearly resents the restricted life she is forced to endure, she rarely whines or wallows in self-pity, choosing instead to accept her role with an uncomplaining, almost fatalistic, good grace. Even when her husband refuses for years to consummate their marriage, she remains generally sympathetic to him and understanding of his 'problem.' There are those who will find this movie slow-moving, stultifying, and boring because it doesn't go over-the-top by focusing on major moments of crisis or by overplaying the queen's famed cruelty or self-indulgence. She is, instead, seen as a woman neither actively engaged in the outside world nor entirely dismissive of it. Some have objected to the fact that the filmmakers have stacked the deck in her favor by showing us so little of what life was like for the suffering populace of the nation. But it is just that insularity that helps us to see how a woman with such an apparently good heart could have been so badly misunderstood by those in her own time and by generations that followed. At the end, when she and her family are being carted off to certain doom by a mob thirsting for rectification and vengeance, she seems genuinely bewildered, yet also strangely heroic in her stoicism and grace. Much of this is due to the tour de force performance by Kirsten Dunst, who never overstates the obvious but allows us to see the complex woman trapped beneath all the jewel-encrusted trappings of pampered French royalty. Marie may not display an interest in world affairs or the arcane machinations involved in running a nation, but she is shrewd enough to know how to maneuver her way through the often absurdly arbitrary power politics of court life.The movie has garnered perhaps its greatest notoriety for employing an anachronistic rock music soundtrack (a la 'A Knight's Tale'). For me, this worked fairly well (though I don't think it is indispensable to the film by any stretch), mainly because it brings a more contemporary sensibility to a film that might otherwise feel weighted down by period piece stuffiness. History-obsessed purists may object to the choice, but even they may find compensation in the relatively understated and historically accurate approach the screenplay has taken towards her life as a whole.'Marie Antoinette' is, more than anything else, a study of repression, of what happens when human beings are locked into figurative gilded cages and then are expected to go about their daily lives as if anything really mattered. Seen in that light, this is a very sad, very poignant - though often quite funny - movie indeed.",8,3,7,7 November 2006
The Ring," ho hum thriller
","Like so many horror films of recent vintage,  `The Ring' is far more effective in its setup than it is in its execution.The film starts off with a promising premise.  A group of teenagers watch a mysterious videotape that predicts that each of them will die in seven days. When the prophecy turns out to be true, Rachel, the aunt of one of the victims, decides to do some investigating of her own to uncover the facts behind this strange supernatural phenomenon.  The problem is that not only has Rachel herself seen the tape (which looks for all the world like outtakes from `Un Chien Andalou'), but so also have her ex-boyfriend and little son.  Her search for answers thus becomes a matter of life-and-death not merely for herself but for her loved ones as well.`The Ring' has some nice moments of suspense right up front, but the more Rachel unravels the mystery the less mysterious and terrifying the film becomes.  This seems to be a common failing in many horror films and `The Ring' finds no real way to overcome it.  Naomi Watts is energetic and attractive as the feisty heroine of the story, but the clues she uncovers just aren't very interesting or compelling.  `The Ring' is competently made and nicely atmospheric at times, but it doesn't get under your skin the way the best horror films invariably do.  Perhaps it's because the tape itself ceases to become a threat early on once the three main characters have all had a crack at watching it.  All we are left to do is watch Rachel racing against the clock looking for answers, turning `The Ring' into more of a whodunit mystery than a tale of terror.  This might be acceptable if the `solution' weren't a hackneyed bit of Grand Guignol idiocy that we've seen hundreds of times before.`The Ring' is a watchable little time waster but it won't keep you up at night and it won't make you think twice before popping that next videotape into your VCR.",Null,1,2,13 March 2004
Stop-Loss," brilliant expose of the 'backdoor draft'
","On the day he is to be honorably discharged from the service, decorated army Sergeant Brandon King is ordered to return to duty in Iraq, the latest victim of 'stop-loss,' a term for when soldiers who have fulfilled the terms of their military contract are denied permission to leave the service under penalty of court martial and imprisonment. Brandon, caught emotionally off-guard by the news, impulsively decides to go AWOL, leaving his fellow troops to head back to the Middle East without him. Brandon becomes a fugitive from justice, as much on the run from the memories that haunt him as from the authorities looking to bring him back.A searing expose on the 'backdoor draft,' 'Stop-Loss' is an extraordinarily powerful drama that shows how men and women who have bravely served their country on the field of battle (along with the loved ones they have left behind) are being betrayed by the very government they fought to defend. Yet, 'Stop-Loss' is no star-turn polemic like 'Lions for Lambs,' but, rather, an intensely personal drama that illuminates its issue in starkly human terms. The grim realities of post-war trauma - both physical and psychological - are vividly dramatized in the persons of Brandon and his buddies, all of whom have returned to their small Texas town radically changed men. But the film is also about that special sense of camaraderie and group cohesion that develops among soldiers who have fought side by side under hellish circumstances - and the lifelong bond that results.Despite the wide-ranging nature of the theme, writer/director Kimberley ('Boys Don't Cry') Peirce and co-writer Mark Richard keep the drama modest in scope and intimate in scale. It's true that there are times when the screenplay threatens to fall victim to its own contrivance, but the quality of performance and authenticity of detail always bring the movie back into line.Long a fine but under-appreciated actor, Ryan Philippe truly comes into his own in this film, delivering a performance of such raw truth and emotional complexity that we literally cannot takes our eyes off him for the duration of the movie. Ditto for Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Victor Rasuk, all equally superb as men who served alongside Brandon in Iraq and who now have their own personal, war-related demons to wage battle against. Abbie Cornish is also excellent as the friend who accompanies Brandon on his panic-stricken flight across the country.There are those who will object to 'Stop-Loss' on strictly political grounds, seeing it as yet another anti-war diatribe designed to make the Bush administration look bad. Yet, the film transcends politics, honoring the bravery and valor of the soldiers while reserving the right to question the wisdom and morality of those in power who would send these fine young men on such a fool's errand in the first place - and then insist on doing it over and over again. I frankly can't imagine anything more pro-American or pro-troop than that.",Null,4,9,12 April 2008
Minority Report," another indication why Spielberg is one of the great movie artists
","`Minority Report' is the latest audacious triumph from America's premier filmmaker, Steven Spielberg.  Unlike most successful directors, who are content to rest on their laurels and keep producing works of similar theme and content, Spielberg is not afraid to test the limits of his medium by producing works that are both spellbinding and visionary.  He is even willing to risk alienating a mass audience unequipped or unwilling to come along with him on his journey of discovery (which partly explains the relative box office failure of his masterful `A.I.' in 2001).  It is ironic that Spielberg, who is often charged (falsely) will being largely responsible for the `dumbing down' of American movies over the past several decades, is now making more intelligent and adult-oriented films than virtually anyone working in Hollywood today.The theme of `Minority Report' is very similar to the one found in `A Clockwork Orange':  just how far are we willing to go in trading away a person's civil rights in order to achieve a society devoid of the threat of crime and violence.  In `Orange,' the society of the future attempted to head criminality off at the pass by `reprogramming' potential criminals before they had the chance to actually commit the crimes.  `Minority Report,' based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, creates a future society that has managed to find a way to do virtually the same thing, only, in this case, scientists have enlisted the aid of genetic mutants who have the ability to witness murders before they happen and can then pass that information on to the authorities.  Law enforcement now becomes a matter of apprehending and imprisoning criminals BEFORE they have even committed the crime.  The problem arises when John Anderton, one of the `Pre-Crime' agency's top cops, is himself shown to be a future murderer.  The plot of the film becomes, essentially, the classic chase story, in which an `innocent' man must elude his pursuers while at the same time unraveling the clues that will ultimately lead to his proving his innocence.  From this material, writers Scott Frank and John Cohen have fleshed out an intricate and fascinating plot that keeps us guessing all the way to the film's finale.In many ways, though, it is not in the narrative details that `Minority Report's true greatness lies (after all, this story is basically a redo of this year's earlier, abysmal `Imposter,' which, by the way, was also derived from a Dick story).  It is the vision that Spielberg brings to the material that sets it apart.  Rarely have we ever seen a future world brought so vividly and believably to life as it is here.  Set in 2054, the film is a total visual masterpiece.  Aided by astonishing production design, cinematography and special effects, Spielberg has created a universe unlike any we have seen before.  One of his most triumphant moves is to not try and imagine the future in totally unfamiliar terms.  Most of the clothes and furnishings seem strangely similar to what we have today.  The effect of this is to help us identify with the characters in a way that might not have been possible had everything been made to seem alien and unrecognizable. What the filmmakers do emphasize in their vision of the future world is the constant barrage of audio/visual stimuli that come in the form of things like personalized holograms and animated periodicals which pinpoint just how close our own world is moving towards this sort of all-encompassing sensory overload.In a day and age in which even the most elaborate special effects can elicit a yawn from the audience, Spielberg still shows that he has the ability to dazzle us.  There is a chase scene done on a vertical superhighway that far surpasses anything in this summer's `Spiderman' or `Attack of the Clones' for sheer breathtaking ingenuity and excitement.  In fact, on the visual/special effects level alone, `Minority Report' makes those other two films look like first-year film school pikers.  It's also impossible to convey just how extraordinarily brilliant cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's work is on this film.  With his muted color scheme and emphasis on glowing whites, Kaminski brings a true otherworldly quality to Spielberg's vision.Like all great Spielberg films (and there are so many we can't even count them anymore), `Minority Report' packs a wallop both in the overwhelming intensity of its action sequences and in the quiet moments of subtle reflection where the filmmaker affords us glimpses into the workings of the human heart.  The director is helped immeasurably in the first case by the brilliant editing of Michael Kahn, and in the second by the outstanding performance of Tom Cruise in the lead role.  Cruise has rarely brought such dramatic intensity or such emotional depth to any character the way he does to John Anderton.  The long delayed and long anticipated collaboration between one of the world's greatest directors and one of the world's most charismatic stars has resulted in a film worthy of both of their talents and reputations.In a time when filmmakers like George Lucas seem mired in the successes of their past, Spielberg continues to move ahead and to develop ever more as an artist.  Even if he were to stop making movies today, Spielberg's oeuvre would put him in the pantheon of the world's greatest film artists of all time.  But let us hope he will continue to make films for a very long time to come.  We eagerly await all those future masterpieces.",Null,2,4,8 July 2002
Finding Neverland," strong performances
","Johnny Depp gives one of his most subtle performances to date in 'Finding Neverland,' a film about the creative process that has a thing or two to say about the part imagination plays in all our lives. In this adaptation of the play by Allan Knee, Depp plays J.M. Barrie, the author who, in 1904, introduced the world to Peter Pan. According to the movie (though not necessarily reality), Barrie gleaned the inspiration for his creation from a beautiful young widow and her four sons whom he met one day in the park and with whom he forged a deep and lasting relationship (there are a few factual errors in that synopsis, but in the interest of keeping your confusion to a minimum, I'll recount the story as the movie presents it). In his endeavors to entertain the children, Barrie brought them into his world of magical make believe, eventually weaving the story of Peter Pan out of those experiences.When we first meet Barrie, he is already a well-known and successful playwright in the London theater world - although his latest work has bored his audience and critics so thoroughly in its premiere performance that it is forced to close on opening night. Suffering from creative stagnation and stuck in a stifling marriage, Barrie eventually finds surcease and an outlet for his creativity with his new-found 'family' from the park. However, even though the film technically takes place in the Edwardian Era, the iron hand of Victorian Era morality still holds England firmly in its icy grip. For soon rumors are flying not only about the 'unseemly' relationship between Barrie and Mrs. Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, but even about the questionable and potentially sinister nature of Barrie's relationship with the boys.Written by David Magee and directed by Marc Foster, 'Finding Neverland' offers a touching, fascinating glimpse into the mind of a man in the process of creating one of the most enduring tales of modern literature. One of the marks of any 'classic' work of inspiration - be it art, music, literature or drama - is that we are never aware of the nuts-and-bolts process that has gone into its creation. The greater the work, the more we are inclined to believe that it dropped fully formed from heaven, a rare gift from the gods that seems somehow always to have existed somewhere. That is certainly the case with 'Peter Pan,' which is why 'Finding Neverland' provides such an invaluable service. It forces us to acknowledge that even the greatest of creations, which we tend to attribute to that mysterious and intangible entity known as 'genius,' are really the product of one part inspiration to two parts fortuitous timing and hard work. 'Finding Neverland' flows effortlessly between the events as they happened in real life and the fantasy scenarios that Barrie eventually wove out of them to create his masterpiece. As a result, the movie itself has a kind of heightened fairy tale feel to it that works well in the context of the story. The movie also affords us an entertaining behind-the-scenes view of the creation of the play itself and a breathless recreation of its opening night.In addition to Depp, the film is filled with fine performances by Kate Winslet as Sylvia, Julie Christie as her stern, disapproving mother, Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's sympathetic theater manager, and Radha Mitchell, as Barrie's cold, status-conscious wife. The four young actors who play the boys are also excellent, with Freddie Highmore, as the precocious and too-cynical-for-his-own-good Peter, a particular standout.Historians may find room to quibble about some of the liberties the film takes with the facts. Sylvia was not a widow at the time of the story and her husband resented the intrusion of Barrie into their lives. Even one of the sons has been dropped. This is acceptable, however, since an over-cluttered plot would likely have robbed the film of the simplicity it needs to sustain its fairy tale ambiance. Moreover, the movie telescopes a number of key events to enhance their dramatic impact (i.e. his wife's affair with writer Gilbert Cannan, which is shown as being a contemporaneous event, actually occurred a number of years after this part of the story). But such nitpicking seems fruitless in the overall scheme of the film.Was Peter Llewelyn Davies the real inspiration for Peter Pan or was it J.M. Barrie himself? The film doesn't answer that question, but it certainly hints at the distinct possibility of the latter. For Barrie was clearly a man who much preferred the warm fantasies of carefree childhood to the cold cynicism of responsible adulthood. And that, of course, has always been the heart and soul - as well as the life's blood - of his own paean to eternal youth, 'Peter Pan.'",8,2,2,17 November 2005
Training Day," So What Was His Second Day on the Job Like?
","Denzel Washington earned his Best Actor Oscar in 'Training Day' portraying a veteran LAPD narcotics officer who has become every bit as hard, amoral and corrupt as the mean city streets he patrols. We've seen plenty of 'bad apple' cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place. Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants. For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the lowlifes at their own game - employing their tools, using their methods - the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner. Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner. Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flauting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves. Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such 'unconventional' actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations. Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking? The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.'Training Day' is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting. The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from. Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre. However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness. This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable. Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world. The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us. However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake. Washington, generally relegated to 'good guy' roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character. In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer. Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life. As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows – or thinks he knows – is right. These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move. Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), 'Training Day' provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie – and much, much finer acting.",Null,18,55,6 July 2002
In Bruges," Brooding in Bruges
","One of the outstanding movies of 2008, 'In Bruges' is that rare cinematic high wire act that manages to juggle any number of seemingly contradictory moods and tones simultaneously without ever once dropping the ball. Alternating between the absurdly funny and the deadly serious, the movie, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, offers a wise, witty and surprisingly touching take on friendship, guilt, redemption and the strange code of ethics that guides the behavior of the professional killer (those who appear in the movies at least).Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are superb as Ray and Ken, two British hit men who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out after Ray accidentally kills a young boy in an assassination gone wrong. Stuck in this strange Medieval city, the two men make the best of a bad situation, Ken by taking in the sights and immersing himself in the rich history and culture of the place, Ray by moaning about how bored and homesick he is, all the while trying to work through the guilt of having the blood of an innocent child on his hands.In a screenplay crackling with irony and wit, McDonagh paints the portrait of an unusual friendship between two men who seemingly have little in common beyond their chosen profession and a mutual respect for one another. Ken is mature, well educated, even-tempered and pragmatic, while Ray is unbright, hot-headed, and easily provoked by the words and actions of others. Yet, somewhere beneath his rough-and-tumble, sometimes rather befuddled exterior beats a giving heart and an appreciation for the good that can be found in certain people. Gleason and Farrell give performances of immense sophistication and depth, with Farrell, in particular, creating a fully rounded portrait of a 'loveable' killer. His body compressed down into a perpetual slump while a host of conflicting emotions flutter across his expressive face, Farrell demonstrates that he has the physicality an actor needs to make a character come to life on screen. In a much smaller role, Ralph Fiennes also makes his mark as the mob boss who has some strange notions about what constitutes morality and honor when it comes to killing.Add to all these various virtues lyrical direction by McDonagh, beautiful cinematography by Eigil Bryld, some colorful minor characters, and architecture guaranteed to knock the viewer's eye out - and you have one of the true movie going pleasures of recent years.",9,2,5,16 February 2009
Friday Night Lights," Friday Night Lite - but enjoyable anyway
","The best thing about 'Friday Night Lights' is how it exposes the small town obsession with high school football. In Odessa, Texas, where the story is set, businesses shut down and radio sports commentators opine with the pretentious air of political pundits when the Permian Panthers take to the field. Now this is some serious football country, as the mood of the town fluctuates with the win/loss record of the team and family dynamics follow along with the ebb and flow of the season. It may be that somebody down there in Odessa just seriously needs to get a life.Based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, the film recounts the 1988 season when Coach Gary Gaines, despite the loss of his best player, still managed to carry his team to the state championships.Unfortunately, the storyline and characters in the film are not always as interesting as the setting and milieu. The drama is occasionally lacking and many of the characters rank as little more than hoary sports movie clichés: the supportive coach's wife; the abusive, alcoholic father trying to relive his high school glory days through his son; the cocky star player humbled by the exigencies of a cruel fate. Yet, the film has assets that help it to overcome some of the weaknesses of the script. Billy Bob Thornton plays Gaines as a thoughtful, even-tempered individual who knows what it takes to win but understands that life does not begin and end on the football field. His inspirational locker room speech towards the close is restrained, pointed and well delivered. In fact, the coach seems far less obsessed with winning than many of the ordinary folks he runs into - and has to take unsolicited advice from - on a daily basis. It is that pressure to win at all costs - placed not only on the boys but on the coach as well - that the movie dramatizes so effectively. The film also makes it clear that, for many of these boys, football is the only ticket they will ever have out of small town America.'Friday Night Lights' isn't nearly as compelling and involving as 'Remember the Titans,' but die-hard football fans won't be complaining.POSTSCRIPT (2014). Little did I imagine at the time I wrote this review that 'Friday Night Lights' would one day become my favorite TV series of all time.",6,2,4,19 October 2005
Kung Fu Panda," derivative storyline bolstered by decent execution
","As voiced by funnyman Jack Black, Po is just your average Chinese panda with dreams of one day becoming a world-class kung fu fighter (isn't that what all pandas living in China want to be?). When he's chosen by The Master to become the new Dragon Warrior, a position that brings virtually unlimited power to the individual who holds it, Po is thrown into round-the-clock training sessions to help groom him for the role - kind of like Eliza Doolittle on steroids.The plot of 'Kung Fu Panda' - with its echoes of 'The Karate Kid' and even of 'Star Wars' in its portrayal of teacher/pupil relationships - is fairly derivative in nature and lacks the kind of strong secondary characters we've come to expect from computer-animated films (no slam intended on the voice-over work by Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan).Still, there is sufficient energy, wit and visual inventiveness in the movie to captivate the little ones while keeping the rest of us from actively storming the box office and demanding our money back. This is most definitely not one of the 'great ones,' as animated features go, but it is short and pleasant enough to at least earn it a spot in the recommended column.",6,1,2,12 May 2009
Gravity," a one-of-a-kind visual experience
","'Gravity' is that rare movie that, while a tour-de-force on a technical level, also happens to come with a great deal of its own - pardon the pun - gravitas.Sandra Bullock, in a bravura, near-one-woman performance, plays Dr. Ryan Stone, an astronaut on her first mission into outer space, sent there on Space Shuttle Explorer to perform some much-needed repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. While she's space walking with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), the shuttle is hit by debris from a missile strike the Russians have launched to take out a non-operational satellite. Things go from bad to worse when the two astronauts are torn away from the now-destroyed shuttle and are cast out into deep space with little hope for a safe return to earth.Director Alfonso Cuaron has gathered together a team of technological wizards to replicate, as closely as is humanly possible, the experience of floating adrift in outer space: the weightlessness, the uncontrollable spinning (warning: take your Dramamine beforehand), the immense size and grandeur of Earth as seen from hundreds of miles above the surface. The purely visceral nature of the movie goes a long way towards mitigating any qualms one might have as to the plausibility of every single thing it is showing us.The screenplay by Cuaron and his son Jonas does well within the admittedly restrictive parameters demanded by the narrative, which is why the performances of Bullock and Clooney ultimately play so crucial a role in the success of the movie. They make us care about the people to whom this is happening - and, without that, all the special effects in the world couldn't make this concept work. Even from inside a space helmet, Bullock runs the gamut of emotions from queasiness to fear to anger to despair to resignation to hope to determination. It's all there, packed within a taut hour-and-a-half-long running time.In a way, a film like 'Gravity' makes movie-reviewing almost superfluous, since it's virtually impossible to convey in words the true nature of the experience. Go watch it for yourself.",9,4,6,19 November 2013
Erin Brockovich," dazzling performance by Julia Roberts
","In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground.  Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath.  All the above five films expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities.  In the case of  `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&E electrical plant located in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California.  It seems that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that PG&E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at their site.  The company has even brought in medical professionals and toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears.  Almost by chance, Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&E's gross malfeasance in the process.Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must concede that there really isn't much that is new here.  However, thanks to a pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph.  This may, in fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine.  First of all, she is often abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor.  Dressed more like a fashion devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion.  Yet, it is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the people she is trying so desperately to help.  A twice-divorced mother of three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in the defense of her case.  Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of internal contradictions.  Much as she loves her children, she has made a shambles of her life in recent years.  Rootless and lacking the skills necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a traffic accident case.  Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down her rhetoric or her temper  or to adopt the more `professional' attire of the business world  even if it might mean that she would be taken more seriously by those around her.  She assumes that no man would be willing to consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is fighting begin to drive him away  and her children as well.  Most fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an issue.  All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of believable paradoxes.  Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality, wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth.  Grant, by making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may be.And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly.  Never before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action and statement.  She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this complex woman.  This is definitely Oscar-caliber work.  Equally brilliant is Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial, easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&E but the seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case.  One of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity harridan  a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does us.If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door.  He seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting and believable part of the tale.  We feel we are being too often distracted from the meaty center of the story.Still, this is a minor quibble about a film that works so beautifully on so many levels.  As Erin Brockovich, Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night.",Null,43,68,12 August 2000
Meet the Parents," a truly marvelous comedy
","Funny as well as touching, `Meet the Parents' blazes forth as one of the outstanding comedies of recent years.  Co-writers Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, along with director Jay Roach, have managed to make a film that is often laugh-out-loud hilarious without ever becoming overbearing or obnoxious, the style of choice for far too many other comedies made in this day and age.  Although the film overflows with madcap situations and even outright slapstick at times, these comic elements are always tethered to the reality of the premise and to the emotional states of the characters involved.  The foundation for any great comedy must, first and foremost, be its ability to connect with its audience on a personal level.  `Meet the Parents' does so from the very start by tapping into the universal dilemma we all face at one time or another of desperately trying to make a good impression on someone we feel holds nothing less than the fate of our lives in their own two hands.  For some of us this person might come in the form a boss or a potential employer or, as in poor Greg Focker's case, those most dreaded figures of all  the prospective in-laws.  The comedy arises from seeing the chain of ever more preposterous events and circumstances that come along to sabotage his efforts.  Greg is a goodhearted, well-meaning nebbish who wants nothing more out of life than to marry Pam, the girl he loves.  First, however, he must climb over the rather formidable barrier of her eccentric father, Jack Byrnes, played to perfection by Robert De Niro, who certainly has his own offbeat way of looking at the world.  The triumph of this film is that it never overdoes anything.  The people in Pam's family and in their coterie of friends are all twisted it's true, but twisted in sly, subtle ways that knock both Greg and us slightly off our balance.  Like Greg, we never quite know where these people are coming from and this greatly enhances the comedic quality of the film.  Tone is everything in comedy and here the tone is just right.  Byrnes can seem at one moment to be a reasonable loving father, then turn immediately around and make the most unbalanced comments about the most trivial matters.  Even when the movie is at its most outrageous in terms of plot complications and slapstick, it never veers off the scale into incredibility.  Part of the reason is that we feel so much empathy for Greg, the best Everyman character I have seen in a movie in a long time.  Ben Stiller gives a beautifully understated comic performance in the main role.  Greg's completely understandable feelings of nervousness, intimidation and growing frustration help to keep the film anchored in reality, even as the story threatens to spiral off into undisciplined absurdity.  Luckily, the filmmakers never let this happen.  They are also blessed with the genius of Mr. De Niro, who never makes a false move as the seemingly crazy ex-CIA agent who may or may not be harboring a few secrets of his own. Above all, De Niro never lets us bank on the extent of his character's eccentricity, which brilliantly enhances this `weekend from hell' scenario.   For crazy and maddening as he can be at times, we can't help loving this character.Finally, unlike in many other romantic dramas and comedies, the relationship between the young couple in this film is both believable and touching.  Greg and Pam are so likable - and the odds against them seem so staggering - that we find ourselves rooting them on from first moment to last.  Their moments together are genuinely touching at times, particularly in the film's closing stretches.Kudos go out to everyone involved for making `Meet the Parents' one of the slyest, wittiest and flat-out funniest movies to come our way in a long, long time.",Null,20,29,19 August 2001
I'm Not There," original and imaginative
","In making a movie about the legendary musician/songwriter/poet/social activist Bob Dylan, filmmaker Todd Haynes could have hired a single actor to impersonate his subject and then related the key events of his life in standard chronological order. But Haynes clearly had something deeper and more complex in mind when he envisioned this work. The result, 'I'm Not There,' is a boldly original movie that is part truth and part deliberate fiction, part straight-forward narrative and part pseudo-documentary, part stark realism and part surrealistic fantasy. And while all of the elements don't work equally well together, the movie as a whole still provides a fascinating portrait of one of the key artists and musicians of the second half of the 20th Century.Haynes breaks one of the cardinal rules of biographical storytelling right off the bat by having no fewer than six actors - Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Richard Gere, Ben Whishaw and Marcus Carl Franklin - portray Dylan at various stages of his career and life. And, in an act of even greater audaciousness, he has assigned each of these roles a different fictitious name (and it isn't because Haynes feared he might be sued for his efforts since Dylan himself okayed the movie). Haynes, with the assistance of co-writer Oren Moverman, then arranges the various pieces into a time-shifting mosaic that allows us to see Dylan at all those discrete moments in his life virtually simultaneously. Finally, he incorporates many of Dylan's songs on the soundtrack to serve as a sort of running commentary on both the character and the times in which he's living.Haynes makes it clear that Dylan was as much a product of those times as he was a shaper of them. The film shows us his early days as an idealistic young singer/songwriter (here named Woody after Dylan's boyhood hero and role model Woody Guthrie), who has just escaped from a juvenile detention facility and is now riding the boxcars, his guitar in hand, strumming out protest songs in defense of the underprivileged and working classes. We then follow Dylan through the various stages of his life: first, as Jack (Bale), a rising young folk singer in Greenwich Village; then as Jude (Blanchett) an anti-establishment pop culture hero, singing and speaking out against social injustice and the Vietnam War; later (still as Jude), as a press-hounded 'celebrity' often denounced as a 'sellout' for adopting the very elitist lifestyle he'd earlier railed against in his works. The roles assigned to Ledger and Gere provide even more radically oblique takes on the Dylan persona. Ledger plays Robbie, a Hollywood actor who's portraying Jack (i.e. Dylan) in a film on his life, while Gere represents an aging version of Dylan, envisioned here as Billy the Kid, living in the wild west and taking on the legendary Pat Garrett in an effort to save a small town from being subsumed by an evil corporation (this is definitely the most 'out there' of all the story lines in the film and, without a doubt, the least compelling and effective).Of the actors, Blanchett gets to play Dylan at what is probably the juiciest and most provocative period of his life (at least from a character standpoint), the time when he alienated many of his earliest fans by 'reinventing himself' as it were - turning away from traditional folk music in favor of a much edgier rock'n'roll sound, and transforming his own image from that of a jeans-wearing man of the people to that of a sunglasses-sporting, Carnaby-clad - and now quite remarkably cynical - pop culture celebrity. Blanchett's vivid performance captures the tormenting self-doubt of a man caught between being a 'spokesman' for a social movement and a simple human being trying to survive in the very world he's being called upon to denounce. The movie raises the question of whether it is ever possible for an artist to remain a social iconoclast after he has attained the level of a cultural icon - with all the attendant compromise that comes with such a status.Next to Blanchett, Ledger gives what is probably the most fully-rounded performance in the film, fleshing out the domestic side of the public figure in his thoughtful portrayal of Dylan as husband and father.Haynes' eclecticism involves the mixing together of not only various time periods but of wildly varying film-making styles as well. For instance, some of the stories are shot in black-and-white while others are done in color, just as he uses a traditional narrative technique in some sequences yet documentary-style reportage in others.The film does suffer from a number of serious, though nowhere near fatal, flaws. As noted earlier, the Richard Gere section comes across as too arbitrary and tacked-on to feel fully a part of the rest of the film. And the movie does run on a trifle longer than it needs to in order to make its point. Moreover, the overly objectified style of the movie, impressive as it is, nevertheless, has the perhaps inevitable effect of distancing us so much from the subject matter that the heart, as opposed to the head, is never really fully engaged in what it is showing us.Still, for the sheer unadulterated love Haynes demonstrates for his medium and the insight the movie offers into a beloved cultural icon, 'I'm Not There' is a work very much worth savoring, faults and all.",8,0,0,13 July 2008
Unbreakable," a stylish dead end
","As both a writer and a director, M. Night Shyamalan is attempting to bring a whole new sensibility to American moviemaking.  Unlike most filmmakers who dabble in the `horror film' genre, Shyamalan eschews sensationalism and gore in favor of understatement, subtlety and indirection, preferring that we, in the audience, be given room to conjure up our own demons rather than having the filmmaker do it for us. The characters in his films drift like somnambulists through worlds drained of sound, color and emotion - and where the fine line between the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the supernatural, the real and the surreal is vague and easily crossed.Shymalan scored a major critical and commercial success in 1999 with `The Sixth Sense,' a film so brilliantly conceived and executed that it cried out for multiple viewings  the first time to be amazed and dazzled by the sheer ingeniousness of the multileveled plotting, the second to study retroactively just how intricately each plot element fell into place, catching us unawares the first time around.  It is natural that Shyamalan should have tried to duplicate that success in his next film, using virtually the same stylistic elements and the same leading man, Bruce Willis, as he did in `The Sixth Sense.'   Unfortunately, `Unbreakable' fails to live up to the quality of the earlier film. For one thing, `The Sixth Sense' really WENT someplace  it built and built to an infinitely satisfying resolution.  `Unbreakable,' for all its admirable stylistic flourishes, simply leads us to a dead end  nay, worse, a conclusion that is absurd, undeveloped and thoroughly unsatisfying. 
Shyamalan's subdued narrative and visual style needs a solid dramatic core to attach itself to.  Here, however, he never finds it.  Willis plays a character almost too similar to the one he portrayed in `The Sixth Sense'  a brooding, taciturn man who seems to wander through life in a perpetual emotionless fog of detachment and depression.  David Dunn, a man caught in what appears to be a loveless, deteriorating marriage, is the sole survivor of a Philadelphia train wreck.  Already we are alerted to `Sixth Sense' parallels, so much so that we begin to subconsciously suspect that this might indeed be a sequel of sorts to the previous film.  Actually, it isn't, but rest assured there is something `not quite right' about this man, although the revelation of what it is has no where near the kick provided by the earlier work.  After his miraculous escape, David is contacted by Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, a man suffering from a strange genetic illness that causes his bones to shatter like glass and who becomes convinced that David may be his alter ego, i.e. a man immune from injury and disease.  This premise, based on a builtin dichotomy (just as `The Sixth Sense' was built on the dichotomy of life and death), also tries to explore the twin dichotomies of good vs. evil and hero vs. villain, but the context in which the filmmakers launch their exploration  the world of comic books of all things  robs the film of much of its potential profundity.  We just can't take Willis very seriously when he is wandering stoically around the city, clad in a hooded sweatshirt, like some sort of `super hero' on Prozac, saving innocent victims from the clutches of evildoers whose purposes he senses when he brushes up against them in crowds (the tag line for this film could well be `I see criminals').  Thus, without a decent story to tell, the film turns out to be all style and no substance.  What was artistry in `The Sixth Sense' becomes artiness here. Even clever visual motifs - like showing us many images upside down first, then right side up or having only the bad guys dressed in bright colors so that they stand out against the muted grays of everyone else - become sheer artifice with no thematic purpose behind them.  `Unbreakable,' for all its beauty of atmosphere and tone, leaves us bewildered, frustrated and unsatisfied.  Shyamalan is definitely a talent worth nurturing.  Let's hope next time he can once again find that perfect marriage between form and content that he hit upon so brilliantly in `The Sixth Sense.'  We need adventurous filmmakers like him around.",Null,0,1,22 September 2001
Star Trek," a whole lot of fun
","The 2009 version of 'Star Trek' is a 're-imagined' prequel to the famed Gene Roddenberry TV series from the 1960s. In this outing, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a hell-raising 23rd Century Iowa farm boy who's tired of living in the shadow of his father, a Starfleet captain who died a hero's death, sacrificing himself to save the lives of his crew (the infant James and his mother included). Yet, after just a single pep talk from one Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), the hotshot Kirk figures it's time to hang up his motorcycle - or the futuristic equivalent thereof - and follow in his hallowed father's footsteps by becoming a member of Starfleet himself.Meanwhile, on the planet Vulcan, a young Spock suffers persecution for being half-human on his mother's side and, thus, opts to sign on to become a commander with the Earth-based Federation rather than serve in the Vulcan Science Academy, as any decent, civic-minded Vulcan with his kind of aptitude is expected to do.Soon, Kirk and the famously emotionless Spock (Zachary Quinto) are serving together on the maiden voyage of the spanking new Starship Enterprise, along with such familiar faces as Bones (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) in their younger years, with Scotty (Simon Pegg) getting a chance to hop aboard later on. Before they know it, the Enterprise is locked in battle with the Romulans, led by a villain named Nero (Eric Bana), who are trying to make a black hole out of Vulcan, with Earth as their next target.If none of this sounds particularly familiar even to die-hard Trek fans, it's probably because scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have concocted a time-shifting/alternate-reality version of events that goes against much of what we've previously been told regarding the back story of these characters. One of the benefits of this approach is that it allows Leonard Nimoy to join in on the proceedings, playing Spock as an older incarnation of himself.The script has some fun parodying Kirk's reputation for one-upmanship and serial womanizing, but a little of that does go a long way. Still, the tension that develops between the cocksure Kirk and the similarly adamant Spock (both well played by Pine and Quinto) is nicely balanced against the camaraderie of two equally skilled professionals working at the peak of their abilities in a common cause.Special kudos go to director J.J. Abrams for the tremendously exciting action sequences he has created for this film, including one amazing scene atop a giant drill platform located miles above the planet's surface. No surprise, the art direction, production design and special effects are all first-class, and editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon have assembled all the pieces together for maximum impact.This latest incarnation is good fun for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike.",7,3,11,18 January 2010
Fight Club," flawed but brilliant film (some spoilers)
","The `machismo factor,' though it lies at the root of virtually every shoot-em-up war film, western and action picture Hollywood has ever produced, has, strangely enough, gone largely unexamined in films as a subject itself.   `Fight Club' becomes one of the first movies to actually address the issue, bluntly and directly.  Before it eventually spins out of control, this provocative film audaciously confronts a disturbing, but truly pertinent anthropological issue:  in a society that, for purposes of its own survival, actively discourages violent behavior, is it possible for a man, conditioned by eons of innate but ever increasingly repressed `hunter/gatherer' instincts, to ever cut himself loose and be true to his real nature?  And if he doesn't, can he be said to ever be a `real man,' or is he simply a hollow shell allowing society to determine what he values and how he lives?Edward Norton stars as Jack, a man so softened by the amenities of a modern technological culture that he has even replaced pornography with the IKIA catalogue.  As far from his barbaric ancestral roots as any man worthy of the label can be, Jack has turned to haunting feel-good support groups to fill the void his empty life devoted to meaningless culture-driven values has created for him.  Suddenly, into his life walks Tyler (Brad Pitt), a sardonic, tough talking thug, the total antithesis to Jack and a man completely in touch with his male-based instinctive need for simple hand-to-hand physical confrontation.  Together, the two set up an underground club designed to give men like Jack the opportunity to beat the living crud out of each other and therein find their way back to their true primordial selves.Not only does `Fight Club' explore a fascinating and long-overdue theme, it insidiously lures us in to the glamorous excitement of the fight scenes themselves.  Much as we may resist their pull, we are so appalled by the alternative we are shown in the form of Jack's drearily routine office environment, the stifling conformity of his decorator-influenced, perfectly coordinated apartment and the self-aggrandizing emotionalism of the many support groups he visits that we feel as liberated as he does by the simple physical aggression of the unregulated bouts.  This is the genius of the film:  it makes us just as cognizant of the compromises we ourselves routinely make to social norms as it does Jack.  What is most impressive is that the film could easily have turned into just another cautionary tale, a violent tract warning us of the dangers of allowing these instincts to run amok.  Instead, the filmmakers have been careful to keep most of the activity in the realm of self-contained mano-a-mano confrontations.  In fact, the club members do not employ guns, and, for the most part, scrupulously avoid hurting innocent bystanders or killing anyone.  (Just for the record, this controversial work is actually a much less violent film than most of what passes for benign action cinema these days).  Although there are a few steps taken by the group in the direction of involving outsiders in provoked fights and eventually detonating some empty buildings Â– these are, by the way, the least authentic sections of the film - the violence really doesn't extend much beyond the confines of the club itself. Thus we are spared the tiresome moralizing one might expect from a film exploring this theme.Where, then, does the film ultimately come out on this issue?  Is `Fight Club' a socially irresponsible call for the unfettered use of violence to create societal chaos, or is it a sly black comic vision of a world gone crazy intended to highlight the dangers of just such a situation?  The answer to that question is really not an easy one to come by, for the film itself loses its way in its final half hour.  Having set up this fascinating premise, `Fight Club' decides, rather inexplicably, to go the sci-fi route, setting up a Jekyll and Hyde situation that both undercuts the seriousness of the theme and spells the message out in far too simplistic terms.  Also, unlike in `The Sixth Sense,' the surprise turnabout ending doesn't make sense in the logical context of the story.  Are we to actually assume that Jack has been fighting HIMSELF all this time?  It is true that the dark comedy flavor that runs throughout the film does create a world where the improbable can be made possible.  But the suspension of disbelief required by the final acts of this film places far too heavy a burden on the audience to make the drastic shift in tone truly work.Special note should indeed be made of the extraordinary performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.  Pitt, in one of his finest roles to date, conveys the macho hard-edged physicality and sardonic charm necessary to lure these men to his way of thinking.  Norton always keeps his character focused and life-sized, allowing Tyler to exploit these inner yearnings yet remaining enough on the outside to continually question the validity of his actions.`Fight Club,' for all its imperfections and moments of confusion, deserves credit for finally attempting to explore a theme too often exploited but rarely examined by Hollywood.  The film provides some real food for thought and, in all honesty, how many movies can you truly say that about?",Null,0,1,4 June 2000
Monster," 3-dimensional portrait of a serial killer
","Despite the harsh judgment implied in the film's title - 'Monster'- Charlize Theron accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of turning a convicted serial killer into a sympathetic figure with whom we can identify and relate. Aileen Wuomos, a hooker in the 1980's, was executed in Florida in 2002 for the premeditated murders of half a dozen or so unsuspecting 'johns' with whom she came in contact. Writer/director Patty Jenkins sees Aileen more as a victim than as a perpetrator, an individual more sinned against than sinning. We are told, from the outset, that Aileen grew up, like all of us, yearning for the good things in life: stability, love, a bit of fame, fun and fortune if they happened to come her way. Unfortunately, due to an abusive and troubled family life, she ended up selling her body at the tender age of thirteen. When we first encounter her in her 20's, Aileen is a beat up, down-on-her-luck prostitute with barely a penny to her name. Lonely and desperate for companionship, she wanders into a gay bar one night and meets up with a shy young lesbian named Selby who is, herself, just looking for someone to connect with and talk to. Though Aileen claims to be straight, she finds herself drawn to the genuine niceness and warmth emanating from Selby. A tender relationship develops between the two, with Aileen believing she has finally found a person whom she can truly love and who will reciprocate that love. Feeling herself on the road to better things, Aileen even attempts to give up prostitution and get a 'real' job, but the legit world is a far from welcoming place for an untrained, uneducated woman whose social skills leave much to be desired. Desperate to get money to support the two of them, Aileen returns to hooking. When one of her johns rapes her in the woods, Aileen shoots him dead and steals his car. The success of this endeavor leads Aileen to kill a succession of men whom she deems, for the most part, to be morally bankrupt, psychologically abusive scum. It's when Selby discovers what Aileen is up to that the real trouble begins.Theron won an Oscar for her performance in this film, a complex piece of work that goes far beyond the surface aspects of the much-publicized changed appearance she underwent to approximate the bruised-up look of the actual Aileen. Even without the de-glamorizing makeup job, Theron is in total command of the screen from first moment to last, showing us the multi-faceted nature of this hurting, troubled woman. Christina Ricci, in a much less showy role, is equally impressive as Selby, providing an understated contrast to her far more flamboyant companion. Together, these two fine actresses explore the complexities of both their characters and the relationship between them. In a way, the film is really a love story between two lonely, troubled people who express that love in the only ways they know how. Aileen goes on a murder spree to provide 'her girl' with the comforts and necessities of life, while Selby, though at first disturbed by Aileen's homicidal tendencies, manages to come around to Aileen's way of thinking, knowing full well the grim alternative of a life lived unwanted and unloved. There's an undercurrent of macabre humor flowing through the film as we watch Aileen heading out the door to kill another victim and steal another car every time the girls run a little short on spending money.The nice thing about 'Monster' is that we can't always sort out our feelings about these two women. They both have characteristics that we simultaneously abhor and admire. Aileen, despite the horrible acts of violence she commits, does appear to have a conscience of sorts, occasionally sparing a potential victim whom she believes doesn't 'deserve' the fate she has mapped out for him. Unlike Hannibal Lecter, Aileen does not murder out of madness, but rather out of practical necessity. This makes her both easier and harder to identify with and understand than the average serial killer. Selby, likewise, is a woman inexperienced in the ways of love who discovers that the person with whom she is trying to forge her first romantic relationship may, indeed, be a bit more than she bargained for. 'Monster,' though it isn't afraid to deal with the complexities of its characters and situations, sometimes feels a bit too one-sided in its presentation, a bit too sanitized and nonjudgmental for its own good. Maybe because Aileen's victims tend to be pretty much ethical scumbags to begin with, it becomes easy for us to detach ourselves from what we are seeing and to overlook the horrendous moral implications of the acts she's committing. Perhaps, Theron is a bit TOO successful at making her character sympathetic, of letting her off the hook a mite too easily. That, in a lot of ways, may be the single most disturbing aspect of the film  that we in the audience don't feel more anger and outrage at the things she's doing. That effect might be the result of either hidden genius or inadequate development on the part of the filmmaker. Who knows, perhaps the title of the film is actually meant to be ironic. I'll leave that up to you to decide.",Null,0,1,5 July 2004
The Rookie," another sentimental baseball fable
","When women feel the need for a `good cry' at the movies, they usually seek out some tragic tale of unrequited love to do the trick.   When men feel the same need, they turn to a film about baseball.  And what could be more guaranteed to convert a grown man into a shamelessly blubbering fool than a true-life account of a middle-aged baseball fanatic who gets to fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the major leagues?  How many men can fail to identify with that?   Indeed, most men may not want to admit this, but the baseball movie genre has, in many ways, become the male equivalent of that category of film known, derisively by many men, as the `chick flick,' for they both serve roughly the same purpose.  Apparently, even we stoic males have the need to clear out the tear ducts every now and then - for purely medical reasons of course. Because baseball has long enjoyed the reputation of being `America's National Pastime,' moviemakers have often treated it less as a sport than as an iconic institution.  From `Pride of the Yankees' to `Brian's Song' to `Bang the Drum Slowly' to `The Natural' to `Field of Dreams,' movies about baseball have been so concerned with all the mythic implications of the sport that they have rarely managed to convey the sense of carefree fun that comes along with it (`Bull Durham' has been one of the few obvious exceptions to this rule).  The tone in these films is sometimes so sentimental and so reverential that one begins to view baseball more as a type of pseudo religion - with the stadium functioning as a sort of temple where people gather to participate in a communal spiritual experience - than as a form of entertainment.  `The Rookie' certainly falls into this category, yet the film itself has such an air of comforting familiarity about it that it manages to override much of the conventionality of the storyline.  Although we always know where the movie is headed, the easy assuredness with which it charts its course keeps us interested and absorbed for most of the duration.  The majority of the credit goes to Dennis Quaid who, as Jim Morris, the high-school-teacher-turned-big-league-ballplayer, does a first rate job portraying a man torn between responsibility to his family and this golden, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of realizing a childhood dream.  Quaid underplays the role so nicely that we never doubt for a moment the authenticity of all we are seeing on screen.  The screenplay by Mike Rich, though filled with overly familiar scenes and characters, nevertheless manages to avoid many of the potential lapses into overwrought melodrama that could conceivably have robbed it of much of its credibility (the dark hints early on in the film as to Morris' problematic physical condition happily never come to fruition).   Director John Lee Hancock establishes an almost elegiac tone, pacing the film in such a way as to match the unhectic lifestyle of both Morris and the small Texas town in which he lives.`The Rookie,' like Disney's previous sports opus `Remember the Titans,' eschews violence, sexuality and bad language completely, thereby garnering the film a `G' rating and making it first class entertainment for the entire family.  There may be nothing much new in it for adults, but `The Rookie' has the skill to make what was old seem somehow new again.  Not unlike what happens to the hero himself in fact.",Null,22,37,23 November 2002
Memento," ingenious tour de force
","Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller `Memento' is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content. Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.  Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a `condition' brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis  as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie `Betrayal' used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, `Memento' deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.One of the risks of a film like `Memento' is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical `gimmickry.'  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir. `Memento' is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual `strangers' who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life  yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.  David Julyan's subtle and haunting musical score and Wally Pfister's fine cinematography greatly contribute to the unique quality of the film.Watching `Memento' is like entering a strange, mystical dream.  Like Leonard, we feel as if we have suddenly been stripped of that ability to fully make sense out of the chaotic world around us.  We feel cut loose from our mental moorings and find ourselves adrift in a world bereft of the rules of chronological reasoning we cling to so desperately for survival.  How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.",Null,1,3,31 December 2001
Inglourious Basterds," History as fiction, fiction as history
","Quentin Tarantino returns to form with 'Inglorious Basterds,' an uber-violent World War II revenge fantasy, modeled, at least in part, on 'The Dirty Dozen.' Brad Pitt, replete with noose-scarred neck and Southern drawl, plays Aldo Raine, a lieutenant in the U.S. military, who's recruited a band of Jewish mercenaries - dubbed the Inglorious Basterds - to roam the war torn countryside killing Nazis then removing their scalps as souvenirs. The few who are allowed to survive have a swastika carved into their foreheads as a warning to all future victims that the boys are coming to get them.The 'basterds' get their best opportunity to inflict maximum damage when Goebbels agrees to premiere one of his Nazi propaganda films in a theater in occupied France, a premiere at which just about anyone who's anyone among the German high command - including Der Fuhrer himself - will be in attendance. The plan is for the 'basterds' to go in and annihilate virtually the entire Nazi regime in one fell swoop.After years in which we've watched Jews in WWII films being marched off helplessly to death camps, 'Inglorious Basterds' provides an almost purgative function by letting us see the victims finally doling out some long overdue, eye-for-an-eye justice to their murderous oppressors - even if it's a retribution largely consigned to the realm of fantasy and fiction (though the recent 'Defiance' obviously provided us with a factual account of just such a turnabout).Interestingly, though, despite their having star billing in the title, the 'basterds' themselves are actually accorded a surprisingly small amount of screen time in the movie, so that anyone going into it expecting nonstop violent action scenes centered around the group's activities may be sorely disappointed. In reality, much more of the movie's 152-minute running time is devoted to the story of a beautiful Jewess (Melanie Laurent) who, after escaping death at the hands of a sadistic SS colonel (the brilliant Christopher Waltz in his bravura Oscar-winning performance), is now, as the owner of the theater where the movie will be shown, in a unique position to exact her revenge, both for herself and for all her people who have suffered under this brutal regime (her plan is to burn the theater down with all the Nazis inside). Tarantino has self-consciously divided his screenplay into five subtitled chapters. The scenes within each chapter run long and all take place in a single setting, but they are rarely static, thanks to Tarantino's skill at composition, his penchant for crackling dialogue, and the suspense that arises organically from the situations being dramatized. Still, this is far from a fast-paced action-movie crowd-pleaser, so one should be forewarned that a certain amount of patience is required from the viewer.Episodic in structure and deliberate in its pacing - with a healthy dose of black humor and a soundtrack just anachronistic enough to provide the imprimatur of 'coolness' one demands from a Tarantino film - 'Inglorious Basterds' provides an imperfect but imaginative spin on World War II 'history.'",8,0,8,29 June 2010
Underworld," makes one yearn for the good old days
","Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. would be turning over in their respective graves if they could get a gander at `Underworld,' a tale about a war between vampires and werewolves that turns this potentially interesting conflict into one long, unending shootout.Gone are the days when Count Dracula and Barnabas Collins defined for us the image of a vampire.  No longer are these `creatures of the night' the suave, well-dressed aristocrats who inexorably  often reluctantly  seduced unsuspecting bystanders into baring their necks to fulfill the need for human blood.  The vampires in `Underworld' can't be bothered with such mundane and hokey paraphernalia as coffins, crosses, or cloves of garlic - not even with turning into bats at the first hint of trouble.  These modern day vampires talk on cell phones, drive fancy sports cars, use personal computers and fight with all the high tech weaponry modern technology and a limitless studio budget can provide.  With all this fun gadgetry to choose from, what's the point in being a vampire anymore?  The result of this is that `Underworld' plays more like an over-the-top gangster action film that just happens to feature supernatural elements than a horror film rooted in centuries' old traditions.   The werewolves are even less interesting than the vampires in this film. Not only are both camps indistinguishable from one another in looks and appearance, but the werewolves actually come across as surprisingly ludicrous and unconvincing in the few scenes in which they undergo their lycanthropic transformations.   Special effects have become so impressive in recent years that even they have a hard time exciting an audience anymore. A case in point:  when oh when are action film directors going to jettison that most annoying of all action movie clichés  gun battle scenes filmed in slow motion?  `Underworld' has them in spades and they quickly become tiresome and boring.  Even the typical urban gothic look of the film  replete with rain-soaked city streets and a perpetual thunderstorm taking place in the background  reminds us instantly of dozens of other, mostly superior outings like `The Crow,' `Darkman,' `Batman' etc.`Underworld' should have stayed below the ground where it belongs.",Null,0,4,14 March 2004
Coraline," Classic spin on 'Be careful what you wish for'
","What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for? Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy. But as the old adage says, 'Be careful what you wish for' - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this 'perfect' world and these 'perfect' parents may not be quite so perfect after all.Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, 'Coraline' is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time. Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time. The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to. As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal. Like all good fantasies made for kids, 'Coraline' finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can't even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline).But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful 'other' world that Coraline visits - not by a long shot. For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales. Thus, since 'Coraline' does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences. Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm.The animation is first-rate on every level. The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton's 'Nightmare Before Christmas'). Yet, 'Coraline' never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on.",8,0,2,15 November 2009
This Is the End," A unique take on the apocalypse
","Hollywood has made millions out of dramatizing the pending apocalypse, but what if the apocalypse were to happen in Hollywood itself? Like, for real.Well, Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg think they know what it would be like and, in 'This is the End,' they've gathered some of the industry's hottest young stars - James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, and Rogan himself, all playing themselves - to illustrate it for us.The question is: how do these guys - who get paid mega-bucks to essentially play at make-believe all day - do when confronted with a real-life crisis, one designed to test their mettle and their basic humanity, in which courage, heroism, self-sacrifice, quick thinking and dexterity with firearms may be the keys to survival? Turns out, just about as well as the rest of us mere mortals would. And that's the kernel upon which Rogan and Goldberg build their affectionate satire, as the boys hunker down in James Franco's pad in the Hollywood Hills to try and ride out biblical doomsday in all its high-tech/CGI/matte-painted glory.The filmmakers capture the pampered movie star lifestyle with canny accuracy: the orgiastic partying, the drinking and casual drug use, the conspicuous consumption, rampant self-indulgence and egotism run amok. Is it any wonder, then, that none of these Hollywood types are deemed worthy of being sucked up in the rapture, but are instead left behind to fend for themselves and to think long and hard about why they couldn't go with all those other good people? And are they truly past redemption or is there some way to still make amends for a life poorly lived so that they too can take that light beam shuttle to the sky? In addition to the leads, fellow celebrities Michael Cera, Emma Watson, Mindy Kaling, Paul Rudd, Rihanna, Channiing Tatum and The Backstreet Boys make cameo appearances either before or after the cataclysmic event.Deftly blurring that fine line between fact and fiction, this super-meta movie features fun, self-deprecating performances and a sly and knowing script laced with amusing parodies of sci-fi/horror and action movie clichés.Clever and amusing.",7,2,6,22 December 2013
Dawn of the Dead," pretty good though not up to the original
","'Dawn of the Dead' is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, 'Night of the Living Dead.' This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.The original, in addition to being a horror film, was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society. This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straight-ahead horror approach. It may seem impossible for someone to actually 'dumb down' a horror film, but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here. For this reason, the most famous and imaginative images from the first film - that of the undead wandering through the mall, vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein, just as they did in their previous lives - are nowhere to be found in this edition. The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing. Although, theoretically, this should increase their terror potential, it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.Nevertheless, this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn't rise to the level of the original. There's a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film, and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre. There's even a very subtle homage to the great 'Carnival of Souls,' the far more gentle precursor to all these over-the-top zombie pictures, when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his 'calling' as 'just a job.' Although the film isn't really all that scary, 'Dawn of the Dead' provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado.",7,16,30,12 March 2005
Iron Man 2," not as fine as the original, but entertaining enough
","As 'Iron Man 2' opens, Tony Stark, the wunderkind head of Stark Industries, has just revealed to the world at large that it is indeed he lurking inside the metallic suit of the planet's latest crime-fighting superhero. But such a public admission comes with a steep price. For now the United States government wants him to register himself as a deadly weapon; a rival defense contractor (Sam Rockwell) is determined to beat Stark at his own game by creating his own army of iron-clad warriors; and an arch-nemesis (Mickey Rourke) from the former Soviet Union has suddenly appeared on the scene in his own superhero getup to destroy Stark in a mano-a-mano battle on the streets of Monaco.As a piece of pure Saturday-matinée popcorn entertainment, 'Iron Man 2,' directed by Jon Favreau, is, perhaps predictably, a notch or two below its dazzling 2008 predecessor. However, the sequel still has enough quality elements – most of them holdovers from the first film – to recommend seeing it: namely, Robert Downey Jr. as the wisecracking, hard-living but lovable boy genius, Stark; Gwyneth Paltrow as his endearing personal assistant, now CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts; and enough funny one-liners to take the edge off of some – though not all - of the script's numerous plot contrivances. As with the previous film, Downey Jr. and Paltrow achieve a wonderful love/hate chemistry between them, and the cast has been expanded to include Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson (who had an uncredited role in the first one), and Kate Mara as well.The screenplay by Justin Theroux makes at least one right choice by having Stark becoming ever more gravely ill as a result of the chemical he has to keep pumping into his chest to survive in his semi-cybernetic condition. This has the effect of humanizing the character, making him destructible and vulnerable and, thus, someone whose fate we can come to care deeply about. And, needless to say, Downey Jr.'s smart, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.The special effects and actions scenes are impressive, of course, but it is Downey Jr. and Paltrow who once again make the movie soar.",6,2,4,21 April 2011
Lords of Dogtown," strong on style, weak on drama
","The Z-Boys were a group of Venice Beach teenagers who, in the 1970's, pioneered a whole new style of skateboarding that is still popular today and which earned the boys status as instant international celebrities (at least within the tightly circumscribed world of skating). In 2001, one of the original members of the group, Steve Peralta, wrote and directed a documentary on the boys entitled 'Dogtown and Z-Boys,' which featured interviews with many of the original members of the group. Then, in 2005, a 'fictionalized' version of the story came along, 'Lords of Dogtown,' also written by Peralta, but this time directed by Catherine Hardwicke.It's understandable that in her approach to the material Hardwicke would want to preserve as much as possible the roughhewn, documentary flavor of the original. Thus, virtually the entire movie has been shot on grainy film stock using a hand-held camera, which creates a sense of immediacy and spontaneity, and nicely approximates the look of the time period in which the story is set. The best scenes involve the boys performing harrowing, death-defying stunts, as they glide through and around pedestrians and vehicles along the traffic-clogged streets of their Southern California neighborhood. However, this impressionistic style also means that the narrative is often diffuse and unfocused, making it hard for us to distinguish one character from another and to know just who we should be concentrating on at any given moment. The ostensible protagonist seems to be Peralta himself, although it is roughly 45 minutes into the film's running time before even that simple fact becomes apparent. However, about halfway through the film, the dramatic elements finally begin to come together, we get to know some of the boys as individuals, and the movie ends on a genuinely touching note.In the rare moments when the camera actually manages to settle down and an individual scene is allowed to play itself out, we begin to sense that some of the boys playing the skaters may actually have some real talent as actors (we can certainly see that they are damn fine skaters), and a few of them I suspect we will be hearing from again in the not too distant future. In a non-skating role, Heath Ledger plays a sort of mentor to the boys and the owner of the surf shop which served as the launching pad for the movement. Unfortunately, with his half-hearted attempt at mastering a slacker/stoner persona and accent, Ledger seems to be merely marking time in this film, counting down to that moment when he would stun the world with his soul-shattering performance in 'Brokeback Mountain.' Who could have foretold from his work here that he had THAT up his sleeve? 'Lords of Dogtown' is moderately informative to those who know next to nothing about the history of skateboarding, but I imagine it is the true aficionado of the sport who will get the most enjoyment out of the movie",6,13,27,7 July 2006
World War Z," Fast-moving action thriller
","Based on the book by Max Brooks, 'World War Z' is a gripping, adrenaline-pumping thriller about a worldwide zombie apocalypse (a phrase that is fast becoming one of the most overused in modern pop culture).Brad Pitt plays a retired UN employee, now stay-at-home dad, who barely makes it out of Philadelphia alive with his wife ('The Killing's Mireille Enos in a largely insignificant role) and two little daughters as the zombie attacks spring up seemingly out of nowhere. Because of his previous experience maneuvering through arduous situations, he is sent out into the world to find answers as to how the plague may have started and to discover what possible remedies there might be to keep the human race from literally devouring itself into nonexistence.These are not the shambling, foot-dragging zombies of the Romero films or TV's 'The Walking Dead.' They're not only fleet of foot but are able to scale seemingly impenetrable walls by piling one on top of the other like a cheerleader pyramid on steroids (in their speed, they actually have more in common with the creatures in the '24 Days Later' series). This may make them a lot harder to outrun, but it robs them of some of the creepiness we normally associate with the zombie figure.Because the movie is done on a global rather than intimate scale, it lacks the haunting, soul-searing dread and emotional desolation of a work like 'The Walking Dead.' In contrast, 'Z' feels more like a grand action movie but, even as such, it hits all the right notes. Thanks to Brooks' beat-the-clock scenario (adapted herein by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof) and Marc Foster's full-throttle direction, the audience rarely gets the chance to relax the muscles, as we hurtle right along with Pitt from one close-call encounter with a baffling, seemingly intractable enemy to the next.Not all that memorable really, but entertaining while it's going on.",8,0,2,18 November 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Another Apatow triumph
","'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is yet another fantastic comedy from producer Judd Apatow, the man who gave us 'Knocked Up' and 'Superbad' a few years back.As with those previous films, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' which was written by Jason Segel (who plays the lead role) and directed by Nicholas Stoller, has as its center a fairly ordinary person just trying to make some kind sense out of a world that seemingly could care less that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In this case it's Peter Bretter, a fairly average-looking musician, whose girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Mila Kunis), the beautiful star of a cheesy TV crime drama, has just dumped him for Aldous Snow, a scruffy, longhaired rocker played by Russell Brand. In an effort to get over his loss, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii, only to discover that Sarah and Aldous are staying at the same hotel he's checking into.The element that separates 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' from so many other sex-tinged comedies these days is that it actually knows how to find humor in the offbeat moments of life. The jokes are never obvious, and the situation, though certainly contrived to some extent, is close enough to real life to make us care. Furthermore, the screenplay boasts an unusually large number of impressive secondary characters, including Bill Hader as Peter's exasperated stepbrother; Jack McBrayer ('30 Rock's Kevin the Page) as a sexually repressed man on his honeymoon; Jonah Hill as a sycophantic maître d'; Da'Vone McDonald as a blunt-spoken bartender; Paul Rudd as a zonked-out, 40ish surfer; William Baldwin and Jason Bateman as Sarah's hammy costars; Taylor Riley as a chef with a sumo wrestler build; and Kristen Bell as a sweet and gorgeous hotel clerk who has a few issues of her own lurking just beneath her deceptively placid surface.Each is a joy to watch and each brings something unique and refreshing to the comedy table. And that's not something one can say about most movie comedies these days.",Null,0,2,22 August 2011
The 13th Warrior," silly adventure melodrama
","Credit the makers of 'The 13th Warrior' with at least trying to revive that moribund genre of the late 1950's and 1960's - the truly wretched, utterly inane warring-barbarian epic, wherein hordes of badly dressed huns, tartars and Vikings smash away at each other with swords and scimitars to no discernible point or purpose.  That such a film is even attempted in this day and age speaks volumes about either the box-office bravery (should the folly succeed) or financial foolishness (should it fail - which it did) of the movie's corporate backers.Antonio Banderas, who will assuredly not count this as one of the finest hours of his already mediocre film career, stars as a foppish, weak-spined Arabian diplomat who is exiled from Baghdad for an inappropriate dalliance and finds himself an unwitting and reluctant member (the 13th warrior) of a band of Norsemen who have been sent out on a rescue mission to help defend a northern village from attacks by a mysterious malevolent force that comes charging out of the forest on misty nights.  In typical '90's fashion, the filmmakers are not content to play straight with the subject matter but must imply all sorts of supernatural elements, presumably to keep skeptical and more sci-fi oriented modern audiences from hooting the material off the screen.  All those scoffers who deprecated 'The Blair Witch Project' for not providing enough of a glimpse of the horrors implied therein get their comeuppance in this film since the mysterious terror in the woods here turns out to be literally a bunch of guys dressed in snicker-inducing bear suits. The screenplay is a confused mess, replete with important characters that are dropped without any explanation and actions that seem, at times, entirely lacking in motivation.About the only new ground this tedious action film manages to break can be found in Banderas' main character who emerges as rather a cowardly ninny at the beginning, but who, alas in more typical fashion, ends up rallying with the other boys to help save the day.  Still, credit the film with trying to smash the mold of pure blue heroic protagonist at least part of the way. And, perhaps, far from incidentally, the film affords an opportunity for an aging Omar Sharif to hoist himself back onto a camel and roam the desert as he rediscovers his 'Lawrence of Arabia' roots after all these years.  Is is a sadly nostalgic sight.All of which only goes to show that even the most minor diversion shines forth in a major way in a film otherwise utterly devoid of all interest as 'The 13th Warrior.'",Null,2,6,24 January 2000
42," A Phenomenal Film About a Phenomenal Man
","It would be easy to be cynical about a movie like '42,' but the best thing about this biopic of Jackie Robinson is that it's not ashamed to embrace its own squareness. Indeed, it celebrates it, rendering cynicism a not very viable reaction to it or the people who made it.The movie fits comfortably in the tradition of consciousness-raising social dramas that are often derided by critics as 'Oscar-bait.' Garnering awards may have been the intention of those who made '42' and it may not have been, but it really doesn't matter because the movie knows exactly what it's doing - and does it beautifully.Robinson was, of course, the Negro League shortstop (later first baseman) handpicked by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey to be the first African-American to play in the major leagues. Though he broke the 'color barrier,' Robinson never saw himself as a 'hero' or a historical figure, just a man who wanted to play ball. Like many before him and many since, Robinson never set out to change the world, but he was willing to rise to the challenge when history called upon him to do so.But it was far from a smooth road to victory for the young man. Robinson had to weather stiff opposition from fans, fellow teammates, Jim Crow laws and the sport itself, and all this is captured effectively in the screenplay by director Brian Helgeland, which neither romanticizes the do-goodism of the action nor overstates the struggle just for dramatic effect (we are shown that there were plenty of people - both intimates and strangers, blacks and whites - who were rooting for Robinson to succeed).In a star-making turn, Chadwick Boseman delivers the goods as the young Robinson, a man, we are told, with a sizable temper but who manages to rein in his emotions to an almost super-human degree in order to deny his goading detractors just the opportunity they're looking for to bring him down. But amidst a hail of almost nonstop verbal and racist abuse, Robinson retains his dignity by making the bigots look like fools and small-minded bullies in the long run. And it indeed was a long game he was playing, a fact that Rickey consistently reminds Robinson of when things get really bad both on the field and off. And speaking of Rickey, the real scene-stealer of the movie is Harrison Ford playing the gravel-voiced, deeply religious man whose blazing sense of justice and love of baseball converged to alter not only the sport but the world as we would forever after know it.Helgeland has directed the film with solid conviction, often going for the small, intimate moment over the more obvious dramatic confrontation to impressive effect. Helgeland clearly trusts his material and doesn't feel the need to shout when a whisper will do. Yet even with all this restraint, what's amazing is how shocked we are to realize that all this happened a mere 66 years ago. And to see how far we've come.And special note should be made of the scenes on the diamond, which beautifully capture the look and feel of the era and the pulse of the game.To call this movie 'inspirational' is not to denigrate it. On the contrary, '42' honestly earns every single tear, goose-bump and throat lump it elicits from its audience. It is truly a movie worthy of its subject.",9,0,0,19 December 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," waterlogged swashbuckler
","Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley return as swashbuckling adventurers in 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,' the loud but soulless first sequel to the surprise mega-hit from summer 2003. This time the three set out on the high seas in search of the key to Davy Jones' legendary treasure.Replete with creatures straight out of Greek mythology, the plot consists of little more than one absurdly over-the-top set piece after another with little heed paid to either continuity or coherence - and none at all to characterization. Even Depp's mincing, oddly flamboyant Captain Sparrow, which was the one element of quality in the original outing, has faded into the background, doomed to insignificance amidst all the overwrought special effects (Bloom and Knightley are their usual bland selves). For here, indeed, is a movie without so much as a single trace of literacy, grace or style to go along with its box office booty, an assembly-line manufacture if ever there was one.Hectic rather than rousing, this is crass commercial movie-making of the most cynical and hollow sort. One can almost hear the producers and studio execs saying to one another, 'Just keep hurling enough 'stuff' at the audience and they'll never notice that none of it makes any sense.' Let me be the one to assure them then; we do notice.",4,3,5,6 January 2007
Argo," If this were not a true story, no one would believe it
","From the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction file comes 'Argo,' a movie based on a true-life story so unlikely and improbable that it could never have sprung full-blown from the mind of a screenwriter. And if it did, it would certainly never have been green-lit by any self-respecting studio. That it WAS based on a true story made it possible for director Ben Affleck to bring it to the screen and to win a Best Picture Oscar for his efforts.The saga of 'Argo' begins in the fall of 1979, when, in response to President Carter's providing sanctuary for the deposed Shah, anti-Western demonstrators stormed the American embassy in Tehran, capturing and holding sixty-some-odd foreign service workers there as hostages for 444 days. However, unbeknownst to the Iranians - and virtually everyone else in the world - six of the people working in the compound managed to escape to the Canadian embassy, where they spent the next several months in hiding. When the state department finally learned of their presence there, a plot was hatched to get them out and to safety. And this is where things really got weird. It was CIA operative Tony Mendez (played by Affleck) who came up with the bizarre, longest-of-long-shots plan to pose as a Hollywood filmmaker scouting locations for a sci-fi epic he hoped to shoot in that country, passing off the six embassy staff as his crew. In order to pull off the ruse - one fraught with untold risk and peril for all concerned - Mendez enlisted members of the movie industry as co-conspirators and allies, some cognizant of the truth but most not. 'Argo' was the actual script that Mendez found lying in a pile of discards and around which he wove an elaborate hoax, even going so far as to take out ads in the trade papers in case the Iranians needed a little convincing that everything was indeed on the up-and-up. Like a modern-day Henry Higgins with the lives of six innocent people at stake, Mendez had to train these bureaucrats to act, speak and behave like a movie crew or face possible execution if their true identities were discovered. It was truly a special op to end all special ops, though the full truth of it remained hidden until the mission was finally declassified in 1997.The screenplay by Chris Terrio mines a rich vein of dark humor as it juxtaposes the kitschiness and cheesiness of early '80's movie-making against the backdrop of a life-and-death real-world event. John Goodman plays makeup artist John Chambers and Alan Arkin portrays film producer Lester Siegel, two of the Hollywood bigwigs whose professional expertise was instrumental in securing freedom for the group. Bryan Cranston (with a full head of hair) and the seemingly ubiquitous Kyle Chandler (having also appeared in the similar 'Zero Dark Thirty') provide some of the more familiar faces in a large and impressive cast.There's breath-bating suspense as Mendez shepherds his 'crew' past one security checkpoint after another with the Iranian authorities in hot pursuit. Will they make it to the plane on time, and, once aboard, will they be able to reach freedom or will they be somehow thwarted in their effort? As with most movies based on true events, 'Argo' faced its share of criticism from a predictable chorus of nitpicking naysayers for fudging some of the facts and for overdramatizing the beat-the-clock nature of the narrative. Well, get over it, folks; this is a movie, and, as such, a certain amount of dramatic license must be afforded the storytellers in pursuit of their art. And art it turns out to be, a canny combination of social drama and pulse-pounding thriller than never fails to astonish and entertain.",8,0,2,27 February 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Depp is the only real treasure here
","God bless Johnny Depp, for without him 'Pirates of the Caribbean' would be just another empty big budget studio extravaganza - juvenile, bloated and over-reliant on stunt work and special effects. But thanks to Depp's brave and witty performance, the film rises above its own inherent weaknesses to become at least a halfway entertaining picture. He is the real treasure here.'Inspired' - if one dares use so lofty a term - by the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, 'Pirates' takes us to the never-never land of swashbuckling heroes and shiver-me-timbers foolishness. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who was left for dead on an island by his mutinous crew. Sparrow, captain of the legendary Black Pearl, a ship with the reputation for possessing evil, unearthly powers, has now returned from his exile and is ready to exact revenge on the mates who abandoned him. There's really no point in thrashing out the complicated but essentially simpleminded plot here. Suffice it to say that it involves a diabolical curse, a literal ghost ship with a literal skeleton crew, a feisty damsel-in-distress and enough repetitive swordplay and 'avast me, hardy' dialogue to keep the action adventure crowd purring with contentment.For all the care that has gone into the look of the film - the costumes, set design and computer-generated special effects - 'Pirates of the Caribbean' would sink pretty quickly were it not for Depp giving his all to keep it afloat. His lisping, flamboyant, over-the-top approach to the character is exactly what this stale little tale needs to lift it above the ordinary. One has only to see Depp mincing around - where anyone else in the part would have been swaggering - to verify what we have known all along about Depp as an actor, which is that he is willing to take risks and explore different avenues when tackling a role, even one as lightweight and insubstantial as this one. He turns what could have been a mere walk-through, check-cashing part into an inspired comic turn. One can only imagine what a boring movie this would have been without him. For, indeed, the story itself is silly and the other characters (except for Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain Barbossa) stiff, dull and uninteresting. But Depp is the real deal, and all I can say is that I hope he received a large percentage of the film's phenomenal box office booty. Like any good pirate, he deserves it.",5,6,13,22 February 2005
Star Trek Into Darkness," Less cerebral than most but with strong action scenes
","Though it lacks the profundity and depth traditionally associated with the brand, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness,' the twelfth installment in the movie series, has enough rip-roaring adventure and jaw-dropping visual effects to make it a satisfying experience for the action-oriented moviegoer.In this sequel to the prequel that successfully re-booted the series in 2009 (both directed by J.J. Abrams), some initially unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) has begun targeting the leaders of Starfleet, and it is up to the Enterprise and her crew to root him out of his hiding place deep inside enemy Klingon territory.Thanks to the screenplay by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof, there's the same spirited verbal jousting between Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) over the issue of feelings-vs.-rationality that's been going on for decades now, along with a bit of a discussion about the needs of the individual vs. the greater good, as well as about whether the Enterprise should become involved with military conflict instead of just space exploration. But, for the most part, this is a straight-ahead action movie and, as such, it unquestionably delivers the goods. Indeed, there are some truly astonishing action scenes leading up to one through the skies of a 23rd Century San Francisco that has to be seen to be believed - even if believability is never really the prime factor in films of this type.",7,2,3,5 November 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," beautiful to look at but boring to watch
","During the height of the London blitz, four young children are sent off to an estate in the countryside to wait out the war in safety. Ironically, they soon find themselves caught up in a quite different war, one that takes place in a world not their own. For while staying at the house of an eccentric professor, the youngsters discover a magic wardrobe that leads them to a mystical land of centaurs, fauns and a whole host of anthropomorphic creatures - a snow-covered land called Narnia. The kingdom is ruled over by a wicked witch who declared herself queen after she usurped the throne from a benevolent lion king named Aslan, who is amassing a rebel army to help him reclaim it. The children become a part of this epic battle since it has been prophesied that four young humans will arrive some day to bring about the liberation of this benighted kingdom.Based, of course, on the beloved C. S. Lewis novel of the same name, 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' does pretty well in its setting-up stage as the youngest of the four discovers the strange land inside the wardrobe and tries to convince the others of its existence, but once the children become firmly entrenched in the Narnian action, the movie begins to feel too much like a warmed-over 'Lord of the Rings' with a lot less action and far less interesting characters. Aslan, in particular, is so drippy and sappy, so full of bromides and platitudes, that we have a hard time getting misty-eyed even when he's heading up the stairs to perform his act of ultimate sacrifice. Speaking of which, the Christian allegory at this point is so heavy-handed and obvious that it ceases to function as allegory and just becomes slavish imitation. And the scene with Santa Claus passing out weaponry and ammunition to barely pubescent children - how is that an acceptable image in a movie meant for youngsters? The film has a beautiful look and design, although some of the special effects shots look surprisingly amateurish and unconvincing for a film of this size and budget. The acting by the children is passable at best, although Georgie Henley, as the youngest child, and James McAvoy as the faun, Mr. Tumnus, do establish something of a rapport in their scenes together. Tilda Swinton as the Big Bad Witch does little but harrumph around the countryside, glaring and snarling.I realize that both the book and the movie have legions of devoted followers and any attack on either is bound to elicit cries of 'sacrilege' and 'blasphemy' from the faithful. But, the truth be told, 'The Chronicles of Narnia' is a pretty mediocre movie, pleasant to look at but boring to sit through.",5,2,4,17 May 2006
The Notebook," mawkish romance
","'The Notebook' is a trite, hackneyed tale of a poor little rich girl who falls in love with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. It's South Carolina in the 1940's, and Allie Hamilton is a highly educated, ambitious young lady living under the watchful eyes of her snooty, upper crust parents who have pretty much mapped out her whole life for her. Enter Noah Calhoun, a poor working class boy with a devil-may-care spirit and a zest for living whom Allie falls instantly in love with while she and her parents are staying in town one summer. One look at their daughter's pawing this strapping young man from the lower social orders and the parents are hightailing it back to Charleston with the wayward Allie in tow, bringing an end to a flaming summer romance that somehow manages to live on through a subsequent world war (involving the least emotional war buddy death scene in movie history), Allie's engagement to a wealthy veteran, her eventual Alzheimer's, and Noah's disturbingly scraggly beard (he's too depressed to shave, you see).Even though Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are appealing as the two young lovers, very little about 'The Notebook' feels either original or genuine. It seems, in fact, to have been cobbled together from other, considerably more impressive tales of unrequited love in which wealth and class play a key role in keeping the lovers apart. The sad truth is that most of what happens to the pair smacks of dime-novel sentimentality and phoniness. For instance, after a night of powerhouse lovemaking between the newly reunited lovers, Allie wakes up to find herself alone with only a note from Noah telling her to follow the arrows to a surprise. And, lo and behold, what do we see but a long line of arrows lying on the floor leading from the bedroom to a sitting room down the hall. Now, is it really conceivable that Noah sat up all night with a scissors cutting out perfectly formed paper arrows, or is this just one of those scenes that could happen only in the movies? And why does Allie's mother keep all those letters from Noah - 365 of them in one year! - that she carefully hid from her daughter, only to turn them over to Allie years later all tightly wrapped up in a neat little bundle? And I won't even go into the final scene of the movie, which is the worst case of expediency over credibility that I've seen in a movie in a long long time.Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, the film, written by Jan Sardi and Jeremy Levin, and directed by Nick Cassavetes, has been structured as one giant flashback, in which a now aged Noah (James Garner) is reciting the tale to Allie (Gena Rowlands), who is suffering from what the doctor calls 'senile dementia' and so doesn't realize that the story is about them. This approach brings a certain added poignancy to the film - or at least it would were it not undercut by the sappiness of Garner's voice-over narration and that far too heavy-handed conclusion. Joan Allen gives her usual dependable performance as Allie's mother, although her character's 180 degree turnabout at the end seems more a matter of convenience than a carefully though-out metamorphosis within her character. At least the movie doesn't turn Allie's fiancé into an unreasonable and hateful villain. The writers do, at least, deserve some credit for that.In a final note, the film isn't even careful with its period details. For instance, there's a shot (supposedly during war time or immediately thereafter) of characters leaving a movie theater with 'On the Town' splashed across the marquee. The problem is that the film wasn't even released until 1949!",5,9,14,12 September 2005
Madagascar," moderately entertaining film
","In 'Madagascar,' four animals - a feisty hippo, a neurotic giraffe, an applause-addicted lion, and a freedom-yearning zebra - break out of their home in the Central Park Zoo, get crated up and shipped off to Kenya, and wind up stranded on the island of Madagascar. While there, they have to adapt to a whole new kind of life in the wild, learning their place in the natural order of things, which is something they've been shielded from all their lives.This is a bright, colorful, amiable film with likable characters, first rate animation and fine vocal work from the likes of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith. The movie is at its best in the scenes set in Manhattan as the animals roam through the city streets causing terror and havoc as they go. However, once they arrive back in 'the wild,' the narrative begins to run out of steam, primarily because the writers have failed to come up with any compelling villain or foil for them to go up against. There's fun to be had in watching Alex, the highly pampered and civilized lion, getting in touch with his long-dormant and suppressed predatory nature, but it isn't enough to make the film much more than a mild diversion.Still, the movie doesn't completely shy away from some of the more brutal truths of nature, without, at the same time, becoming too frightening or disturbing for impressionable youngsters. It's certainly a lovely movie to look at, and that makes it at least tolerable for adults - impressionable or otherwise - as well.",6,0,1,15 June 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," enjoyable but historically questionable costume drama
","Though no 'A Man for all Seasons' by any stretch of the imagination, Justin Chadwick's 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is a handsomely mounted, reasonably entertaining soap opera set in the politically-charged court of King Henry VIII.Based on the highly fictionalized and speculative novel by Phillipa Gregory, the movie chronicles the 16th Century catfight between the two Boleyn sisters - the more famous one, Anne, whose marriage to the divorced king resulted in England's final rupture with the Church of Rome (and the eventual loss of her own head when she, like his first wife Catherine, could not provide him with a male heir), and the lesser known, already married Mary who, at least as portrayed in this film, was every bit as attractive to the king as the sister who would eventually win his hand.The Peter Morgan screenplay reduces the complex historical events to the level of a Harlequin Romance, pitting the two sisters against one another in a competition for the king's affections. All of this is of considerably less interest than the almost ruthless, behind-the-scenes machinations undertaken by the girls' family to groom them as concubines for the crass purpose of currying royal favor. In fact, it is when the movie touches on the mores of the time and of life at court that it is at its most compelling.Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana all seem to be having great fun playing at dress-up, but the richest performances are delivered by Mark Rylance and David Morrissey as the girls' calculating father and uncle respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas as their levelheaded, pragmatic mother, helpless to prevent the tragedy that was doomed to engulf her family.The costumes and settings are nothing short of sensational, and they alone maintain our interest even when the scriptwriting fails to live up to the level of its subject.",6,0,1,31 December 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," fun fastpaced comic adventure
","The animated feature length film 'South Park:  Bigger, Longer & Uncut' is an endlessly creative, imaginative and high energy version of the hit TV show. But amidst all the unbridled crudity, clever movie musical parodies and incisive social commentary, the question must finally be asked:  is it funny?  Actually, not as funny as it could be or as it thinks it is but amusing enough for a rollicking good time, provided one is able to overcome the nagging suspicion (one its makers are more than happy to instill) that one is witnessing the beginning of the end of western civilization as we know it.The makers of this film show a remarkable ability to look inward, turning the spotlight on both their own product and the cultural phenomenon of which they are a major part.  In its plotting, 'South Park' wisely goes the route of self-parody having enormous fun with the issue of censorship (particularly in the realm of foul language vs. violence as sources of offensiveness), while pushing the envelope of tastlessness about as far as it will go. In its tale of a group of youngsters 'corrupted' by their exposure to a crude R-rated feature from Canada and the hysterical overreaction by a group of irate parents (actually resulting in a war against Canada), the filmmakers are obviously addressing the issues surrounding their own creation.  'South Park' sparkles most in the ingenious parodistic musical sequences which brilliantly approximate in both style and sound those found in productions like 'West Side Story' and 'Les Miserables' (with lyrics that would get them banned in Boston of course). The animation matches the sound in its inventiveness and high energy style.  Much of the imagery also echoes sweetly those 'Peanuts' cartoons of yesteryear.So, given all these virtues, why does the film not register more highly on the laugh meter?  I suspect that it arises from the fact that the makers too often fall into their own trap of expecting the constant repetition of foul language to be a source of comedy in itself.  Unfortunately, though i am far from offended by such a barrage of obscenity, I am also not much amused by it.  Hopefully, most adults have long since passed the stage in their lives when the mere utterance of toilet humor can elicit a burst of hysterical laughter.  Luckily, the filmmakers provide enough creativity in story and style to make 'South Park' a very entertaining piece of entertainment anyway.  One simply regrets that it isn't a funnier film all around.",Null,0,0,27 January 2000
Ice Age: The Meltdown," passable sequel
","'Ice Age: The Meltdown' is a pleasant, if somewhat lackadaisical, follow-up to the animated hit, 'Ice Age,' from 2002. In a plot vaguely reminiscent of 'Dinosaurs,' a group of prehistoric animals flees to higher ground when a melting glacier caused by global warming threatens to flood the valley in which they live. The returning characters include Manfred, the woolly mammoth; Diego, the saber-tooth tiger; and Sid, the wisecracking sloth. New to the cast is Ellie, a female mammoth who has somehow come to think that she is, in reality, a possum, and who provides a romantic interest for the generally stoic Manfred. Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo and Queen Latifah provide the voices for these characters.Oddly, despite the extreme urgency of the situation, the animals spend more of their time just moseying along - falling in love and discussing the issues of the day - than squaring off against the various dangers that confront them. Still, there are enough straightforward action scenes to keep the young ones captivated and enough double entendres and 'in' joke pop culture references to keep the older folk entertained as well. As with most sequels, 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' lacks the freshness of the original, but the animation has a clean, uncluttered look that fits well with the starkness of the setting. The one bona fide musical sequence is an amusing ode to the glories of feasting on prey, done to the tune 'Food, Glorious Food' from 'Oliver!' As animated movies go, 'The Meltdown' is nothing to write home about, but it makes for passable viewing even if you aren't exactly its target audience.",6,0,0,11 March 2007
Balls of Fury," more misses than hits in the laughs department
","The humor is broad and predictably predictable in 'Balls of Fury,' a low-grade, though admittedly good-natured, sports farce that elicits roughly one laugh for every five attempts at being funny (not a bad ration, I suppose, but not really high enough to make the movie worth seeing). The plot, which is barely worth detailing here, involves a has-been table tennis champion (Dan Fogler) hired by the F.B.I. to infiltrate a ping pong tournament (a literal 'death match') being hosted by a notorious underworld kingpin (played to the hilt by the one and only Christopher Walken). George Lopez, James Hong, and Diedrich Bader ('The Drew Carey Show') round out the likable cast.Despite a handful of laugh-out-loud moments and an air of genuine sweetness, there's no compelling reason to recommend 'Balls of Fury,' aside from Walken's campy performance, that is. My advice, therefore, would be to skip 'Balls of Fury' altogether and re-watch 'Airplane' or 'Naked Gun' instead.",5,0,0,20 April 2008
Oldboy," fun, stylish action film
","'Oldboy' plays like a martial arts version of a Franz Kafka novel. Dae-su Oh is a businessman in Korea who wakes up one day to find himself imprisoned in what appears to be a cheap hotel room from which he cannot escape (any time spent in a Motel 6 can elicit the same impression). He doesn't know why he's there or who put him there, but he spends his fifteen-year-long 'sentence' watching TV and perfecting his fighting skills, the better to exact revenge on those responsible when he finally gets out. When that day comes, he sets out to unravel the mystery of his captivity, seeking out clues with the help of a sweet, sad young waitress he meets on his first day of freedom.'Oldboy' is an imaginative, high-energy film that keeps the viewer guessing right up to its final moments. Shot through with dark humor, stylish directorial touches, and cartoon-style (albeit fairly graphic) violence, the film is deliberately disorienting in the beginning, the better to approximate the confused psychological state of its protagonist. But eventually the plot points come fully into focus, and the film doesn't fall victim to that dreaded Third Act curse which has been the undoing of so many other mystery films of recent years.Fun stuff.",8,19,83,23 July 2006
Spider-Man 2," a vast improvement over the original
","As children, most of us grow up wishing we could become gravity-defying super heroes, flying around the world, battling villains, rescuing the innocent, and fighting for truth, justice and the American way. But what if the burden of such a calling turned out to be too much for us? What if saving the world became a 24-hour-a-day/seven-days-a-week occupation that prevented us from leading a normal life and finding happiness with our one true love? That is the dilemma Peter Parker faces in 'Spiderman 2,' a deeper, richer, more psychologically nuanced follow-up to the rather innocuous 'Spiderman' from 2002. Most of the major players from the original have returned, including director Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. What's different this time around is that the filmmakers have chosen to emphasize the inner conflict Parker is undergoing between needing to fulfill the awesome responsibilities that go along with being a crime fighting super hero and wanting to chuck it all in order to win the heart of the literal girl-next-door. Parker finds that being Spiderman keeps him from fulfilling the mundane, run-of-the-mill, day-to-day commitments one needs to in order to have successful relationships with other people - most especially the girl he loves. When the conflict becomes too much for him, Peter has to decide whether or not he is going to continue to lead this double existence or return to the simplicity of life as a mere mortal. It is this added intellectual dimension that gives 'Spiderman 2' the thematic heft that 'Spiderman 1' lacked.The plot, involving a brilliant scientist who inadvertently becomes a killing machine when one of his experiments goes awry, is reasonably entertaining and interesting, though it pales in comparison to the love story and the complex internal conflict taking place in our superhero's overtaxed psyche. The special effects seem vastly improved over the original, with Spiderman's movements through the air appearing considerably more graceful and natural than they did the first time around. A spectacular scene involving Spiderman attempting to arrest a runaway train racing uncontrollably through Manhattan is the action highlight of the film.As Parker, Toby Maguire provides the emotional gravity the story needs to be effective. His shy, self-effacing demeanor draws us to the character and makes him a believable, sympathetic figure whom the audience can relate to and root for all the way through. The sweet, vulnerable, yet eternally self-assured Kirsten Dunst makes for the perfect romantic counterpart to this young man who's all thumbs and who seems perpetually tongue-tied when he isn't donning his webbed designer jumpsuit.I wasn't a big fan of the first 'Spiderman' movie, but 'Spiderman 2' has an intelligence and charm that make this particular installment awfully hard to resist. Raimi may have struck out the first time around, but he has managed to hit a homer - or at least a solid triple with the bases loaded - this time at bat.",8,1,2,13 April 2005
Billy Elliot," wonderful feel-good film
","`Billy Elliot,' one of 2000's best films, is far more than just the typical coming-of-age story.  It is a paean to all of us who have, at one time or another, felt ourselves to be `different' from society as a whole (and who among us, in moments of quiet honesty, would deny feeling this way at some time or other in our lives?).  `Billy Elliot' takes us back to that time in our lives  early adolescence - when we are just beginning to experience the manifold wonders of the world, when we are just beginning to explore those things which makes us feel good, and when we are just starting that long process of self-discovery that will ultimately define who we are and what we love.  Such a journey can be an easy one if, for instance, that thing that we choose to love happens to be socially acceptable  i.e. football for boys or cooking for girls  but what if it isn't?  What if, say, the focus of attention for a young boy growing up in a poor English mining town happens to be ballet dancing?  Then growing up and staying true to oneself suddenly become all that more challenging.  If for no other reason, `Billy Elliot' deserves credit for tackling and illuminating the tricky and sometimes uncomfortable subject of adolescent gender-bending.Billy is an 11-year old boy whose life provides little opportunity for warmth or joy.  His father and brother are striking miners, his beloved mother has recently passed away and his maternal grandmother struggles with the disorientation that comes with advancing senility.  The one ray of light in Billy's otherwise drab, humorless life is his fascination with the ballet class that meets in the same gym where he is supposed to be receiving his boxing lessons.   One of the great joys of `Billy Elliot' comes in these early scenes as we see Billy going to enormous lengths to hide the truth of his activities, secreting his dancing shoes under his mattress or inside his trousers or absconding with a book on dancing from a local book mobile etc. Who among us can fail to identify with this sense that, if others discovered what we REALLY loved, we would quickly become a pariah, a misfit, an outcast?  Haven't we all, at some time or other, secretly hidden objects that meant the world to us but that others just wouldn't understand if they saw we had them?  Well, `Billy Elliot' reminds us that it is okay to be different, that indeed pursuing our goal  whatever it is  is the single most important step to achieving personal happiness.In terms of plotting, there is not really much that is new here.  The conflict-ridden lower class family, the recently dead mother, the feisty, sympathetic teacher who places all her faith in her young pupil, the initial reluctance on the part of the family and the community to accept Billy's dream and their ultimately yielding to his wishes  these are all elements we have seen in films before.  Yet, somehow, `Billy Elliot' never seems clichéd or derivative, partly because writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry get the details of character and setting so right and partly because Jamie Bell delivers such a luminous, naturalistic performance as Billy. Thanks to Bell's subtle underplaying, Billy never comes across as precious or precocious.  He is just an ordinary kid with an extraordinary gift who is not afraid to ultimately stand up and defend his own originality.  As the ballet instructor, Julie Walters conveys just the right combination of firm determination and openhearted compassion to make her a believable inspiration to her young charge.  Gary Lewis, Jamie Draven and Jean Heywood are all excellent as Billy's father, brother and grandmother respectively. 
The term `feel good movie' is often the kiss of death when it comes to encouraging the less sentimentally inclined among us to check out a film. But `Billy Elliot' really is a movie that could serve a salutary purpose. If it inspires even one parent to allow a child to fulfill his or her dream  regardless of what it happens to be  it may be one of those rare films that actually does some good in the world.  Not bad for a little independent charmer like this one.",Null,1,1,14 July 2001
Black Book," entertaining but often preposterous war movie
","'Black Book' may be based on a true story, but it often plays more like a corny wartime melodrama than a serious film about war. Suffice it to say, it has a lot of beautiful and glamorous people running around doing a lot of cloak-and-dagger espionage stuff - all while changing the course of history. That's not to say it isn't an enjoyable and entertaining picture, just that it doesn't rank up there in artistry and truth with the great European films about the Fascist era, classics like 'Open City,' 'Forbidden Games,' 'The Shop on Main Street,' 'Das Boot,' etc. When you boil it down to the bare essentials, the theme of 'Black Book' seems to be that there's nothing like a little hair coloring and a bar of chocolate to help an attractive young girl survive the horrors of war.Rachel Stein is a beautiful Jewish singer whose entire family is mowed down by the Nazis as they are fleeing occupied Holland (Rachel and her family are Germans currently hiding out in the Netherlands). As the sole survivor of the attack, Rachel quickly becomes active in the Dutch resistance, her assignment being to cozy up to a high-ranking Gestapo officer who has taken a liking to her. Soon she finds herself not only in bed with the Nazi but quite possibly in love with him as well.Paul Verhoeven has directed the film much in the style of his big-scale Hollywood productions ('Robocop,' 'Total Recall') - that is to say with a great deal of energy but not a lot of emotion. The convoluted storyline often becomes muddled and difficult to follow, but Verhoeven compensates for this weakness by keeping the proceedings moving at a breakneck pace (which is a good thing since the film takes an exhausting two hours and twenty-five minutes to tell its story). Unfortunately, the movie has been fitted with a musical score that sounds as if it has been lifted from some third-rate espionage thriller from the 1960's. Carice van Houten has brio and spunk as the movie's heroine, running around from one dire predicament and hairbreadth escape to another - she's almost like a Dutch version of the perpetually imperiled Pauline - but most of the other actors simply get lost in the shuffle. And if you've ever doubted that chocolate is, indeed, the answer to all of life's problems, you will never do so again after seeing this movie.I must say that, even though I enjoyed the film immensely, 'Black Book' is probably the first serious film about Nazis that actually had me chuckling at wholly inappropriate places (some of the actors even hold their guns in a funny way). 'Black Book' may be a Dutch film by rights, but it's strictly from Hollywood in its silliness and corn.",6,14,21,29 January 2008
127 Hours," When being caught between a rock and a hard place becomes all too real
","Few movies provide as purely visceral an experience as '127 Hours,' a gripping true-life account of a man who literally gives his right arm to save his life.It was April 2003 when daredevil outdoorsman and experienced rock climber Aron Walston ventured alone into Blue John Canyon in Utah without telling anybody where he was going. Tragedy struck when a giant boulder came crashing down on him, smashing and pinning his right arm so that Walston was actually left dangling a few feet above the ground. After more than five days in this position, he made the horrific decision to cut off the arm, thereby free himself from his predicament.Given the shockingly gruesome nature of the material, it's possible that many people avoided watching this movie when it played in theaters. One of the advantages of seeing the movie on DVD is that the faint of heart can fast-forward through the more unsettling parts and not miss out on the overall experience – or James Franco's dazzling and empathic tour-de-force performance.Moments of lucidity alternate with moments of intense unreality and confusion as the hours tick off and Walston increasingly struggles against hunger, thirst, cold, pain and mounting desperation. What strikes one most about Walston is the amazing resourcefulness and calm demeanor he demonstrates while confronting a situation most of us can imagine only in our worst nightmares. Walston certainly has time to think back over his life and to consider what exactly brought him to this moment in time and to contemplate the people who've made the deepest impact on him, and how he's treated - and, in some cases, mistreated - them throughout the course of his life.Walston's ordeal resonates with viewers in that it shows us just how vulnerable we are to the cruel exigencies of an indifferent Nature, and how one little mistake or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time can forever seal our fate.Director Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufry keep things from becoming unduly claustrophobic by throwing hallucinations, memories and imaginings into the narrative mix and by freely indulging in the hyperkinetic montage sequences that have long been the hallmark of Boyle's style (see 'Trainspotting' and 'Slumdog Millionaire').In terms of acting, this is pretty much a one-man show, but there are important contributions from Amber Tamblyn, Kate Mara and Treat Williams in small but significant roles.Hard as it may be to sit through at times, '127 Hours' provides us with an unforgettable and ultimately inspiring portrait of a man staring into the face of Death – and making Death blink.",8,0,2,3 May 2011
Pirate Radio," blah 'feel-good' comedy
","With a tone that is 180 degrees off from the subject it is chronicling, the soft and cuddly 'Pirate Radio' appeals more to the wistful nostalgia of its aging, baby-boomer audience than to the spirit of teenaged rebellion that defined their youth.The movie takes place in 1966, that moment in time when an entire generation of young people had begun revolting against everything their uptight elders stood for - with rock'n'roll as the one indispensable and unifying force in the movement, giving voice to all those feelings. And considering that much of this musical iconoclasm was emanating from England itself - in the form of the British Invasion - it's rather astonishing to note that rock music could be broadcast for only a single hour a day on British radio at that time. That is until a handful of anarchic DJs came up with the idea of floating boats out to sea, far from the reach of the censors and the law, and spinning the discs from there. The result became known as 'pirate radio,' a thorn-in-the-side for the morality-police in the government but an indispensable listening sensation for the millions of dedicated fans who tuned in on a regular basis.'Pirate Radio' takes us aboard a fictional ship called Radio Rock to provide us with a behind-the-scenes look at the station, but writer/director Richard Curtis hasn't come up with a storyline or a set of characters worthy of his subject. The nominal protagonist is Carl (Tom Sturridge), a 17-year-old virgin whose mother (Emma Thompson) has sent him to the boat to spend time with his godfather, Quentin (Bill Nighy), the head of the operation (obvious shades of 'Almost Famous' in the setup). Carl gets to hook up with all the others on the boat, including Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a smug American DJ who goes by the moniker The Chief. The trouble is that, despite all their assorted eccentricities, none of these people are particularly interesting as characters or convincing as rebels, so we're left with little to engage us beyond the snippets of all those amazing songs from the era that are constantly being played over the action.Even worse is the 'villain' of the piece, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy, hammily played by Kenneth Branaugh, who's made it his life's work to not only see that the station is shut down permanently but to make it a crime even to be caught LISTENING to the station, let alone running it. Since Dormandy never becomes anything more than just a crude caricature of an uptight, petty bureaucrat, the dockside scenes are even less engaging than all the goofy hijinks and antics playing out on the high seas. Moreover, the humor lacks the starchiness and brittleness one generally associates with the best of British comedy. And, in what would appear to be one of those bizarre inverse laws of physics, the more 'Pirate Radio' strives to be a 'feel-good' experience, the less good it feels.Things really go awry when Curtis turns the whole thing into a mini-'Titanic' in the closing stretches, a plot device that converts Dormandy from a pompous elitist snob into a heartless monster. But no matter, for by that time we've already had just about all the self-congratulatory smugness and self-conscious cutesiness we can stand in a single sitting. And what could have been a slashing satire about changing social mores and anti-establishment, youthful rebellion turns instead into a safe, middlebrow and comfy little heart-warmer designed to put a smile on our faces and a spring in our step - which is the very last thing a movie dedicated to the spirit of rock'n'roll should ever be.",4,0,1,5 January 2011
"I Love You, Man"," a mainstream comedy that actually works
","Kevin Klaven (Paul Rudd) hasn't a friend in the world - or so he realizes when he becomes engaged to Zooey (Rashida Jones) and finds he can't come up with a single male buddy to be in his wedding party. The solution? Go out and make some platonic guy friends, even if it means having to rely on your mommy (Jane Curtin) and your gay younger brother (Andy Samberg) to help you do it. Eventually, after a number of faltering attempts, Kevin alights on Sydney (Jason Segel), a mucho macho bundle of testosterone who, like a latter-day Henry Higgins to Kevin's Eliza Doolittle, instructs the awkward lad on the fine art of 'being a man.' But as with any good teacher/pupil relationship, each side winds up learning a little something from the other before it's all over.A straight man far more comfortable in the company of women than of men, Kevin emerges as the ultimate metrosexual figure: fastidious in demeanor, sensitive to the needs of others, and courteous to a fault (he even admits to liking 'The Devil Wears Prada' in a moment of unguarded weakness). He doesn't really know how to roughhouse it with the boys, and any efforts he makes in that direction inevitably lead to failure. Until our man Sydney steps into the breach to give him a few badly needed pointers, that is.Smoothly directed by John Hamburg, 'I Love You, Man' is a relaxed, breezy and sharply written male-bonding comedy that - miracle of miracles - doesn't play down to its audience (it may be crude at times, but it's rarely childish). The Hamburg/Larry Levin screenplay does a clever job poking fun at the double entendres inherent in any modern-day bromance, though one wishes certain characters - Kevin's family members, in particular - had been allotted a little more in the way of screen time. That being said, the performances are all first-rate, with Rudd and Segel playing to their respective strengths - Rudd's of the tongue-tied, self-effacing Mr. Nice Guy who needs lessons in 'manning up,' and Segel's of the refreshingly blunt but socially indelicate Man/Child who clearly needs to do some growing up.There's additional excellent work from J.K. Simmons, Jamie Pressly, Sarah Burns and Rob Huebel, among others.It's also a bit of a casting coup to get both Jane Curtin from the first generation of SNL players and Andy Samberg from the current one together in the same film. Finally, some unlikely cameo appearances by Lou Ferrigno and the band Rush, all appearing as themselves, add to the spirit of fun that permeates the film.",8,18,22,28 February 2010
Finding Nemo," amazing visuals
","Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than `Finding Nemo'?  We doubt it.  With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before.  The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, `Aladdin,' `Shrek' or `Toy Story 2,' it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing.  I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged `kiddie' fare in recent years.  This is a film on e can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so.  Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).Like many tales designed for the junior set (`Dumbo,' `Bambi' etc.), `Finding Nemo' taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children.  It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film.  In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia.  The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke.  Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love.  Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, `Finding Nemo' takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is.",Null,49,62,28 November 2003
Superbad," another triumph from the 'Knocked Up' team
","Filmmakers Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg make lowbrow comedies for highbrow audiences. With films like 'The 40-Year Old Virgin,' 'Knocked Up,' and their current gem, 'Superbad' (directed by Greg Mottola), they have begun, in their own quiet way, to re-write the rules of the modern sex comedy, making films that, despite their R-rated blueness, are just a tad more insightful, a little more nuanced, and a trifle more literate than most films in that genre.The characters in their movies may seem at first blush to be mere photocopies of the nerds and losers familiar to us from all those post-'Animal House,' pandering-to-youth comedy hits of the late 1970's and 1980's. Yet, there is something rather different about these individuals, a difference that it is not always all that easy to put one's finger on. They seem somehow more reflective and self-aware than their earlier counterparts, more able to step out of their skins and see themselves for who and what they are. It's almost as if these characters have had the added advantage of seeing themselves reflected in all those earlier movies (one imagines they've spent a great deal of their childhood reveling in 'Revenge of the Nerds') and of extracting important lessons from those films to help them chart their course through life.The storyline, in and of itself, is hardly original. The screenplay by Rogen and Goldberg chronicles the misadventures of three teenage super geeks determined to go to any lengths or suffer any humiliation to be part of the 'in' crowd at school. With only a few days left before graduation, Seth, Evan, and super-nerd Fogell - an outcast even the outcasts can feel comfortable ostracizing - decide that the time has come to take some drastic action if they hope to have any chance of losing their virginity before high school ends. Thus, Seth cooks up a scheme to smuggle booze into a graduation party being thrown by one of the hottest girls on campus. It is the expected setbacks they encounter as they go about the business of achieving 'coolness' that provide the comic energy for the tale.As they did in 'Knocked Up,' the writers capture the way people in the real world actually speak. The dialogue may be crude and vulgar, but it is also sharply observant and wickedly funny as the characters lament the unfairness of life and reveal deep-seated concerns and feelings about themselves and each other. What's nice is that the characters in this film not only sound like people we might encounter in everyday life but LOOK like them as well. Even the 'beautiful' people in this film aren't drop-dead gorgeous, just believably well put-together and attractive.Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are so authentic and convincing in the roles of Seth, Eric and Fogell, respectively, that they have us securely in their corner from the very first moment they appear on screen. Rogen and Bill Hader ('SNL') also have a good time playing goofy cops, although their characters aren't as finely drawn or interesting as the three main characters, and the scenes with them do tend to drag a bit.It is crucial to point out that, amidst all the blush-inducing, foul-mouthed hilarity, there's an incredible underlying sweetness to 'Superbad,' particularly in the final two scenes of the movie.Together, this team of talented filmmakers is making it fun to go to the movies again.",8,3,9,8 September 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," serviceable but not much more than that
","' X-Men Origins: Wolverine' provides fans with a back story showing how Logan (aka Wolverine) got his retractable adamantian claws. This prequel to the Marvel Comics' 'X-Men' franchise is otherwise a pretty tepid affair, lacking the sharp sociopolitical underpinnings that so distinguished the first installment in the series (the franchise has been in steady decline since that stunning opening salvo).It's true that Logan is a bit of a tortured soul in this film - he just wants to be left alone to live his life as a lumberjack with his beautiful girlfriend by his side, but no one will let him - but it's an inner conflict without much emotional resonance or dramatic impact. The reluctant mutant is up against not only his own brother, Victor, but Stryker, the de facto mad scientist who's kidnapping all the other mutants so he can perform diabolical experiments on them.Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, while the roles of Victor and Stryker have been taken over by Liev Schreiber and Danny Houston, respectively. The movie also features Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch (from 'Friday Night Lights'), Dominic Monaghan (from 'Lost') and Will.i.am in relatively minor roles.The action sequences are well-done from a technical standpoint, but they would be a great deal more compelling if we understood just how vulnerable or invulnerable each character was at any given moment in the drama (their status seems to swing wildly back and forth depending on the individual scene and circumstance).",5,1,4,25 April 2010
Alexander," lumbering epic
","'Alexander' is a handsome but clunky attempt to duplicate those sword-and-sandal epics of the past. Although the screenplay gets many of the details of Alexander's biography right, the movie fails to being the character himself to life, thanks, primarily, to flat writing and a wooden performance by Colin Farrell, who turns the 4th Century B.C. Macedonian leader - who pretty much single-handedly changed the course of Western civilization - into little more than a whiny, teary-eyed mama's boy (and the actor they've chosen to portray Alex at 11 looks so much like little Mark Lester in 'Oliver' that I half expected him to break out into a chorus of 'Where Is Love?' before his part was over). None of the other characters make much of an impact either, although Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, his scheming, diabolical mother, turns in a scenery-chewing performance that is at least fun to watch. Anthony Hopkins brings his trademark pomposity to the role of Ptolemy, historian and narrator of the tale, lending an air of urbane pretentiousness to the film.Almost the only thing of interest in the film is the surprisingly forthright way in which Stone deals with Alexander's long-recognized homosexuality, as reflected in his lifelong devotion to the pal of his youth, Hephaistion. Many filmmakers, aiming for the kind of mainstream audience a film of this budget and size demands, would have simply sidestepped the issue. It's true that the one full-on sex scene is between Alexander and his Persian wife, but Stone at least leaves us with little doubt as to where Alexander's true inclinations lie.For the most part, though, this is a surprisingly conventional and even conservative film for director Stone. Missing are the human insights and fancy directorial flourishes we've come to expect from the maker of 'Platoon,' 'Born on the Fourth of July,' 'Nixon,' and 'JFK' (although the unsubstantiated conspiratorial ending reminds one of 'JFK'). The dialogue is generally pedestrian and prosaic, and the story dawdles when it most needs to move on. The battle scenes are fairly scanty and redundant, although the sight of a herd of elephants charging through the forest as part of an Indian army is mighty impressive.At just a hair shy of three hours, the director's edition of 'Alexander' is a mighty long haul indeed.",5,0,1,26 January 2006
Hot Fuzz," fantastic but falls apart in the home stretch
","From the makers of 'Shaun of the Dead' comes 'Hot Fuzz,' a takeoff on cop buddy/action movies that is hilarious for about the first hour-and-a-half or so of its two-hour-plus running time, until it falls victim to its own over-the-top excesses.Nicholas Angel is a London police officer with the highest arrest rate on the force. Does this statistic earn him a round of applause, an increase in pay, or a promotion to a higher rank, as one might expect? Heavens no. In fact, Angel is so good at what he does that he has become something of an embarrassment to the far less highly-motivated cops who work with him. Thus, he is sent to serve and protect the good citizens of Sandford, which is, we are told, the village with the smallest crime rate in all of England. At first, Angel understandably balks at being such a big crime-fighting fish in such a small, seemingly crime-free pond. And, indeed, he begins his service to the community by arresting large swaths of the city's population for decidedly minor infractions. Soon, however, Angel finds himself embroiled in a far more pressing case when prominent citizens suddenly begin showing up dead, the victims of a possible serial killer who may recently have begun operating in the vicinity.In its initial stages, 'Hot Fuzz' is wickedly funny both as a parody of cop movie conventions and as a wry commentary on British rural values. The typically dry and subtle humor arises from the juxtaposition of the by-the-book stick-to-itness of Angel with the lackadaisical indifference of virtually everyone else with whom he comes in contact. It would have been very easy for director Edgar Wright and his co-scenarist, Simon Pegg (who also plays Angel) to have reduced the character to the level of a mere caricature or buffoon. Instead, Angel comes across as a man fully aware of his high-strung obsessiveness (he's lost at least one marriage over it) yet powerless to change it. Pegg is wonderfully restrained and deadpan as the highly focused, crime fighting Angel, while Nick Frost makes a perfect foil as his inept, but starry-eyed partner who thinks the life of a cop should be more in keeping with what he sees in movies like 'Point Break' and 'Bad Boys II' than what he regularly experiences on the job in Sandford. There are fine performances, too, from Timothy Dalton, Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine, and many others. And I defy you to pick out Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and Peter Jackson in their uncredited cameo appearances.'Hot Fuzz' might have been a flawless, classic comedy had the filmmakers been able to refrain from over-indulging their very obvious fondness for large-scale action sequences. Indeed, it is not too long past the midway point that the movie begins to spiral out of control, as Wright and Pegg fall into the trap of mistaking parodies of tedious action scenes for tedious action scenes themselves.Still, I choose to dwell not on the weaknesses of 'Hot Fuzz,' but rather on its strengths, for here is a film that at least knows how to make us laugh for a good deal of the time that we are in its company. And that's saying quite a lot these days.",8,1,2,2 September 2007
Constantine," silly but better than some
","John Constantine is a chain-smoking exorcist with only a few months left to live. Although he knows that he is already destined to spend eternity in hell for a mortal sin he committed in the past, John is still attempting to find redemption by dedicating himself to battling the demonic forces that exist just beneath the surface of our known reality and which have lately been making a greater effort to cross over from their world to ours.I imagine that the Catholic Church must be rather pleased with this film, especially considering the black eye it suffered at the hands of Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code.' Here the incantations and paraphernalia of the Roman church have a great deal of efficacy in keeping the demonic forces Constantine encounters subdued and at bay.Strictly as a movie and not as a theological document, 'Constantine' is a slightly better-than-average demonic thriller that goes back and forth between the world of humans and the shadowy netherworld inhabited by angels and demons and even a few creatures that fall somewhere in between. In a role not all that far removed from the one he played in the 'Matrix' movies, Keanu Reeves once again functions as the flawed Everyman hero whose job it is to save humanity from a fate worse than, in this case, eternal death. We're more willing to accept the silliness of the premise knowing we have Reeves to guide us along the movie's path. The special effects are impressive for the most part, with special credit going to the art designers for their imaginative view of hell (which looks much like a city after it's been destroyed by a nuclear explosion). The film is, admittedly, too long and the nonsense quotient begins to run dangerously high long about the last half hour. But 'Constantine' is, overall, sufficiently imaginative to keep us interested for most of its duration.",6,1,2,17 July 2006
Troy," uneven though sometimes rewarding film
","Wolfgang Peterson's 'Troy' is an attempt to recapture the look and feel of those sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950's and 1960's - those multi-million dollar, wide screen extravaganzas that helped lure audiences away from their television sets at home and back into the movie houses they had so recently abandoned. As is to be expected, 'Troy' shares many of the strengths as well as many of the weaknesses of those earlier films.On the positive side, 'Troy' provides us with the pleasure of watching history (or pseudo-history in this case) unfolding on a grand scale with events greater than ourselves being enacted on the screen. It also boasts spectacular battle sequences with thousands of extras (or the computerized equivalent thereof) stretching back as far as the eye can see. On the negative side, the movie suffers from over length, corny dialogue and banal characters who frequently get lost on the vast canvas of the film. The good news is that, for the most part, 'Troy' manages to triumph over most of its weaknesses.'Troy' is based very loosely on 'The Iliad,' the epic poem by the Greek writer, Homer. So loose is it, in fact, that the screenplay dispenses completely with the gods and goddesses who play so crucial a role in the original tale and, instead, concentrates exclusively on the humans who are left on their own to act out the drama. Those characters read like a Who's Who of great mythological figures. On the Greek side, we have Achilles, the pouty warrior who sits out most of the fighting because he feels personally slighted by the king who doesn't appreciate him the way he should; Agamemnon, the arrogant chieftain who is more concerned with personal glory than with doing what is right; Menelaus, the impulsive cuckold who has no compunction about taking his nation to war over a personal humiliation; Odysseus, the pragmatic fighter who tries his hardest to get Achilles to see the error of his ways; and Patroclus, the impetuous youth eager to prove his mettle and his devotion to Achilles on the field of battle. Lined up on the Trojan side are Hector, the sensitive tactician; Priam, the wise king and loving father of Hector and Paris; Paris, the callow youth; and Helen, the world's most beautiful woman, for whose sake the epic battle is ultimately fought. In fact, it is Paris' 'abduction' of Helen from her Greek husband, Menelaus, that inspires that nation to launch a thousand ships, cross the sea to the fortified city of Troy, and do battle with the Trojans.Because of the quality of the source material, 'Troy' boasts a slightly more complex and conflicted hero than we are used to finding in action/adventure films. For even though he is reputed to be the world's most invincible warrior, Achilles is also petulant and spoiled, quick to anger and often more concerned with amending personal injuries than with safeguarding the welfare of his own countrymen. The squaring off between the two bitter rivals, Achilles and Hector - two men who, under different circumstances, might have been the best of friends - is excitingly well done and suspenseful. Ditto for the scene in which a mourning King Priam slips into the tent of his enemy to beg for the body of his son. On the other hand, Achille's love affair with the Trojan 'war prize' Breseis emerges as pure Hollywood hokum. And poor Agamemnon has become far more of a conventional villain in this version than he is in 'The Iliad.' Although the screenplay stays relatively faithful to the broad outlines of 'The Iliad''s storyline and characters, it can't duplicate the beauty and soul of Homer's poetic verse. The closest the writers seem to be able to come is having the characters repeat over and over again to one another that men for thousands of years will still be speaking of Achilles, Hector, Troy, et. al. and the events in which they are engaged. All this pretentious, self-reverential speechifying merely succeeds in throwing us out of the drama every time someone utters one of those 'prophetic' lines.Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean round out the cast, but it is the veteran actor Peter O'Toole who, as Priam, delivers the one truly compelling performance. It's also nice to see Julie Christie in a movie again, although her role as the sea nymph, Thetis, Achilles' mother, is too inconsequential for her to have much of an impact.'Troy' is little more than an Illustrated Highlights version of 'The Iliad,' but for those unfamiliar with the work, it serves as a decent enough introduction for those willing to take on the real thing.",6,3,7,11 July 2005
Brokeback Mountain," a breakthrough film
","Is it possible for a film - any film - to truly make the world a better place? I have no way of confidently answering that question, but if any movie COULD do such a thing, then 'Brokeback Mountain' would be that film. Here's that rare work that has the power to transform not only how the individual sees the world but how society sees itself. By putting something never before seen on the screen, director Ang Lee and writer Larry McMurtry earn their place in movie history - and the undying respect of film lovers everywhere.By now, most people know that 'Brokeback Mountain' tells the story of Ennis and Jack, two young cowboys who, in the summer of 1963, sign up to herd sheep in Wyoming and wind up falling in love. Jack is the outgoing one of the two, seemingly more in touch with his homosexuality than is Ennis, who is introverted and taciturn almost to the point of somnambulism. Something powerful takes hold of them up there on Brokeback Mountain, and while they both end up going their separate ways - Jack to become a rodeo rider and get married, Ennis to settle down on a ranch with his wife and two little daughters - the attraction they feel for one another never lessens. In fact, it becomes only more intense over the years, as the men come to realize that each has found in the other his true soul mate, his ideal partner for life - if only circumstances and society weren't conspiring to keep them apart. Instead, all they have to hold on to over the next twenty years are a few fleeting but passionate encounters in the one place where they are free to be who they truly are.Tales of unrequited love have, of course, been a staple of literature since storytelling began, but by making this a GAY love story, the filmmakers bring a renewed power to the genre. Forced to look at it from a novel perspective, we feel as if we are seeing romantic love being played out for the first time. There are those who have accused the film of trying to 'glorify' adulterers, as if this were the first time in which a story of unrequited love involved cheating spouses. Would these same people object to 'Anna Karenina,' 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'Brief Encounter' on such spurious grounds? If anything, 'Brokeback Mountain' points out the absurdity of a society that tells gay people they shouldn't even BE gay but should live their lives as heterosexuals. If Ennis' and Jack's wives are victims, they are far more the victims of a society that forces gays into loveless marriages than of Ennis and Jack, who are simply conforming to what society itself claims it wants them to be.By making the two central characters rugged macho cowboys, the author of the original short story, E. Annie Proulx, not only shatters a gay stereotype, but brilliantly finds the hitherto elusive portal into the consciousness of a mainstream audience. Certainly, this story would not have worked commercially had it been about two gay hairdressers living in San Francisco. For the first time in a Hollywood film, we have major gay characters who are not AIDS victims, psycho killers or limp-wristed best friends of the main female character. Moreover, the movie subtly plays with the latent homoerotic undercurrents that have always been a part of western folklore but which have heretofore been hidden safely enough under the surface so that only those looking for them could find them. Yet, for all its sociological significance, this is, first and foremost, a story about love - deep, raw, all-consuming love - and it is that which makes the movie connect with all audiences, regardless of sexual orientation.As Ennis, Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of a revelation, a triumph of minimalist acting. With his tightly pursed lips, barely whispered monotone and slumped shoulders, Ledger brilliantly conveys the soul of a man struggling with the truth about himself and straining with every fiber in his body and being to avoid acknowledging that truth. So tormented is he in his life that Ennis seems to be trying to pull back his words even as he's uttering them. A masterpiece of understatement, Ledger's work here quite simply ranks with the great screen performances of all time. As Jack, Jake Gyllenhall provides the perfect balance for Ledger, a free spirit more willing to take a chance and defy society, if only he could get his partner to go along with him. Michelle Williams hits amazing dramatic heights as Alma, Ennis' bewildered wife, who suffers in silence after she learns the heartbreaking truth about her husband. Ang Lee's direction is intense, lyrical and visually ravishing, zeroing in on the human drama with laser-like precision and making the stark Wyoming landscape an integral part of that drama. Lee makes it so that it is the SILENCES that really matter here, those moments between words when love and feelings are most completely communicated.Just to show that even a great film need not be perfect, there are times when the movie - a tad too long at two hours and 15 minutes - sags a bit by wandering off into one too many subplots. But the emotions in the film are so raw and engulfing that the film at its best makes us realize just how insignificant and piddling most movies really are. This is one movie that actually stays with you long after you've left the theater.When the history of the movies comes to be written, 'Brokeback Mountain' will take its place among the handful of films that can truly be termed 'watersheds' or 'landmarks,' movies that helped to redefine what cinema could be and do. And it will be one of the few, in the long run, that really mattered.",10,53,70,9 January 2006
Chicken Run," fun animated tale
","Though not on a level with `Toy Story 2,' DreamWorks' animated hit `Chicken Run' provides enough originality of concept and expertise of execution to score as fun, high-spirited entertainment for the whole family.  Borrowing heavily from the 1963 classic `The Great Escape,' `Chicken Run' cleverly envisions a British poultry farm as a barbed-wired camp in which a group of animated hens and one retired RAF rooster are trapped in a life of hopeless, egg-producing servitude.  When the owners of the farm decide to up their profits by converting their operation to a chicken pie manufacturing plant, Ginger, the feisty, levelheaded hen who harbors visions of a glorious life beyond the confines of this hellish prison, decides it is time for the ladies to band together and find a way to escape once and for all. Meanwhile, into their lives drops Rocky the Flying Rooster, a wisecracking American circus performer whose head is easily turned by the attention such a singular stud naturally receives from a coop full of love-starved females. Together, these unlikely heroes and heroines plan and scheme their big break, encountering various setbacks and thwarting multitudinous dangers along the way.As a piece of animation, `Chicken Run' is truly outstanding.  Opting for traditional animated puppetry rather than drawn cel animation or even computer-generated graphics, the creators of `Wallace and Gromit' (Peter Lord and Nick Park) do a remarkable job of creating an assortment of characters whose movements are fluid and whose appearance borders on the surrealistic.  In short, these are not `realistic' looking chickens - all the better to enhance the otherworldly quality of the film's setting.  The carefully crafted sets and backgrounds represent a similar triumph in the areas of attention to detail and establishment of mood.  The movie is, quite simply, a joy to look at from beginning to end, and it is gratifying to know that filmmakers can buck the recent trend towards full scale computer animation and still produce a film that looks this impressive.Just as important, Karey Kirkpatrick has provided a script filled with clever one-liners, finding just the right balance of acerbic wit and heartwarming sentiment.  In addition, every single voice, including Mel Gibson's as Rocky, sounds perfectly right in the context of the character assigned to it.  If there is a bit of a flaw in `Chicken Run,' it probably lies in the fact that the story itself is not quite as fresh or original as the technological accoutrements used to put it across.  In terms of sophistication, the tale itself sometimes seems to be lagging behind the eye-popping visuals and the ear-tickling dialogue.  Still, this is a minor quibble about a film that works so well on so many levels.  `Chicken Run' may not be one of the great works of animation, but it certainly stands as one of the best such films of recent times.",Null,0,0,16 December 2000
Insomnia," a masterful psychological thriller
","Like the 1997 Norwegian film on which it is based, `Insomnia' is a superbly crafted crime thriller, one that is more concerned with the psychological complexities of its main character than with the minutiae of the criminal investigation itself - though the details of the case are fascinating in their own right as well.Al Pacino delivers his finest performance in years in the role of Detective Will Dormer, a seasoned homicide investigator brought in from Los Angeles to help solve the murder of a seventeen-year-old high school student in rural Alaska.  The problem is that, back in L.A., Dormer is facing some heat of his own from LAPD's Internal Affairs Division, which is beginning a probe into the propriety of some of the veteran's actions on the job.  Back in Alaska, while on a stakeout to nab the possible killer, Dormer becomes disoriented in the fog and ends up accidentally shooting and killing his longtime partner, a colleague who, Dormer had just learned, was planning to cooperate with the IA investigation back home, thereby bringing about the possible ruination of Dormer's career and reputation.  Caught off guard by this sudden turn of events, Dormer suddenly finds himself in the unfamiliar role of perpetrator, looking for ways to cover up a `crime' rather than unravel it.  One of the compelling themes of the film is its insistence that only a very thin line separates those who commit crimes from those whose job it is to uncover and prosecute the wrongdoers.Dormer is stunned to find how quickly and easily he can cross over that line.  The outstanding screenplay by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg really knows how to get into the minds and emotions of its characters, particularly in the case of Dormer, who turns out to be one of the most psychologically complex and fascinating figures we have encountered in the movies in a long, long time.  Here is a man who has built his name and career on knowing how to unravel complex crimes, always priding himself on being one step ahead of the criminals who are so convinced they have left no traces behind which could point to their guilt.  Yet, now Dormer finds himself in the same boat, as he anxiously looks for ways to hide the fact that he shot - even accidentally - a man who had the power to bring him down.  As the story develops, Dormer, whom we assume at the start is innocent of the charges for which he is being investigated by Internal Affairs, begins to seem less and less innocent and more and more capable of doing just exactly what it is he is being accused of.   Yet, the triumph of the film is that Pacino and the screenwriters never let us feel we know all there is to know about Dormer.  He is truly a man of mystery, so tightly coiled that even he doesn't know or understand all that is going on in the deepest, darkest recesses of his psyche.  By setting the film in the summer near the Arctic Circle, the filmmakers are able to provide a natural phenomenon to help aggravate Dormer's potentially psychotic condition. Like Mersault in Camus' `The Stranger,' Dormer becomes strangely disoriented by the oppressive effect of the sun, though, in this case, it is the lack of a night that drives Dormer crazy through insomnia.  As the virtually indistinguishable days and nights pass without sleep, Dormer begins to suffer from delirium and hallucinations, making it all the harder for him to separate truth from fiction, fantasy from reality and - most importantly - right from wrong and morality from immortality.  When the killer reveals to Dormer that he saw him shoot his partner, Dormer finds himself faced with the ethical crisis of turning the culprit in or of bonding with him as `partners' in mutual criminality and guilt.  Here again the once-clear and distinct line between investigator and criminal suddenly ceases to exist.Pacino, stoop-shouldered and craggy-faced - the prominent bags under his eyes a physical testimony to his weariness and sleeplessness - plumbs the very depths of this infinitely rich and complex character.  In fact, there is nothing less than an outstanding performance in the entire film.  Robin Williams brings an air of restraint and understatement to the part of Walter Finch, the killer who plays a cat-and-mouse mind game with the sleepless, intellectually vulnerable Dormer, exploiting Dormer's weakened state to his own advantage.  Hilary Swank brings a warmth and compassion to her role as Ellie Burr, an eager-to-please detective who has long idolized Dormer and his work, who also has to make an emotionally wrenching choice near the end of the film.  Finally, Maura Tierney makes her few scenes count as a sympathetic innkeeper whom Dormer turns to as the person who happens to be handy at the moment when the need to unburden his soul spontaneously arises within him.As the film's director, Christopher Nolan establishes and maintains a mood of quiet intensity throughout the course of the film.  Helped by the stark, but somewhat oppressively gloomy beauty of the Alaskan outpost setting, Nolan makes us experience the same sense of unease and disorientation Dormer himself feels.  Nolan has chosen to punctuate his film with a series of highly charged, intensely dramatic confrontation scenes between Dorman and any number of the other characters in the film.   The film never wanes in interest for even a moment of its running time.It is an enormous pleasure to see a film as intelligently conceived and executed as `Insomnia.'  Kudos to everyone involved with making this such a rare and fascinating movie going experience.  But the greatest thanks goes to Al Pacino himself.  He has never been so good.",Null,118,141,16 June 2002
500 Days of Summer," a romantic comedy that actually works
","'(500) Days of Summer' is not the first movie to tell a love story using an unorthodox chronology - with 'Two For the Road,' 'Betrayal' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' having done brilliant trailblazing work in this area long ago. Yet, while 'Summer' is not quite in the same league with those three earlier masterpieces, it's certainly miles above the formulaic nonsense that too often passes for romantic comedy these days.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who in 'Mysterious Skin' delivered one of the truly searing dramatic performances of recent times, here displays a similar adeptness at light comedy playing Tom Hansen, a greeting-card writer who falls head-over-heels in love with Summer Finn (the adorable Zooey Deschanel), a newly-hired assistant in the office.While Tom is dead-set on having a meaningful, permanent relationship, Summer feels no compulsion to throw herself into any kind of long-term commitment, determined to savor the freedom that comes with being attractive and unattached in a buzzing metropolis like Los Angeles.Rather than following a strictly linear chronology, the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Mark H. Weber freely jumps around in time, a technique that allows us to observe the various stages of the couple's courtship simultaneously. But fear not, for the writers are careful to identify, through numbered title cards, which of the 500 days any particular scene is taking place on so the audience doesn't become disoriented. This 'dramatic irony' approach of letting us in on where the relationship will eventually wind up - beyond what even the characters themselves know at the time - adds an additional layer of poignancy to the romance.Astutely directed by Marc Webb, '(500) Days of Summer' is marked by smart writing, perceptive storytelling, charming performances, occasional flights of fancy and a rich attention to detail. And there's a scene on a park bench near the end of the movie that is absolutely heartbreaking.A quick FYI: for a far more somber version of pretty much the same story, check out the equally fine 'The Hottest State' by Ethan Hawke. Together, these two films would make for an interesting double-bill.",7,3,6,10 January 2010
Juno," from the art house to the megaplex
","The thing that separates 'Juno' from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances. From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands. Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip. However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is). Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.'Juno' is that rare low-budget, independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum. First-time screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a clear-eyed, largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters. Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride, while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them. Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic, unhurried way. Confident in the strength and appeal of his material, he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.In a star-making turn, young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character, often bringing Juno right to the brink of un-likability, then pulling back at just the crucial moment, making us see how utterly likable she truly is. As the child's father, Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in 'Superbad,' while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the 'baby wanted' section of the local throwaway.'Juno' faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high-budget, high-octane, testosterone-laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations. Thus, my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let 'Juno' sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet, inimitable fashion. I think it works best that way.",8,301,524,9 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," not all that great but still hard to resist
","Like a spoiled little brat having a temper tantrum in his overstuffed playroom, Roland Emmerich loves to destroy things - only he does so on a scale far beyond the dreams of even the most literal-minded schoolboy. Cars, buildings, national monuments, whole cities - nothing is too grand or sacrosanct that it can't be reduced to rubble in the filmmaker's quest for the almighty buck. He began his assault on the planet and audience sensibilities back in 1996 with 'Independence Day,' in which he used aliens from outer space to do his dirty work for him. Two years later, in 'Godzilla,' he resurrected a campy cultural icon to smash New York City into tiny little pieces for our pleasure and edification. Now, in 'The Day After Tomorrow,' Emmerich has gone for the gold by having Mother Nature herself - as the ultimate woman scorned - pushing humanity to the brink of extinction as payment for our sin of casual indifference to the ecologically-sensitive world around us. This is mass-market film-making with a social conscience.'The Day After Tomorrow' is what people generally have in mind when they refer to 'mindless summertime popcorn entertainment' - a big-budget disaster picture with state-of-the-art special effects, minimalist plotting and wafer-thin characterizations. This current vision of worldwide apocalypse shows what happens when mankind fails to heed the warnings of global warming: storms of unprecedented scope and ferocity are unleashed on major metropolitan areas in the Northern Hemisphere and a new ice age begins. The Chicken Little of the piece is one Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a climatologist who can't get anyone to listen to his dire predictions for the future until it's too late and the sky has literally fallen in. The 'plot' involves Jack setting off on a suicide mission to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and some of his classmates who have been entombed in a snow- and ice-bound New York City.As a storyteller, Emmerich pays a price for his pedantry and social crusading, failing to provide the kind of dramatic arc that turned 'Independence Day' into such a rabble-rousing entertainment. In 'The Day After Tomorrow,' once the destruction of LA and Manhattan have been effectively dramatized - the former by tornadoes and the latter by a tidal wave-cum-blizzard - the film lapses into a mundane narrative pattern, so that the final hour or so consists of little more than people trudging through the snow trying to stay warm. The film turns out to be almost all build-up with very little pay off. Nevertheless, some of the imagery is indeed fantastic, especially that of the skyline of New York City literally frozen under a coating of ice and snow. The characters barely register as people and we really don't care what happens to any of them, but there's still an irresistible pull to much of the film, particularly in the first half, mainly because it shows us how very vulnerable we are to the great natural forces that rule our planet. The movie makes us feel as if we are mere guests in this world, being allowed to exist here only by the grace and whim of a power that - either through malice or fatal indifference - could wipe us out in no time flat.'The Day After Tomorrow' is the movie equivalent of a 50-car pileup. You know there's nothing particularly edifying to be gained by watching it, but you can't help looking at it anyway. You can con yourself into believing that you're studying it as a warning against unsafe driving when, deep down inside, you know that what is really holding your attention is all that destruction and carnage. So it is with this movie. The salutary environmental message is really only the pretext for watching the human race get a first-class ass-whippin'.My only question is what can Emmerich possibly do for an encore?",7,0,1,15 May 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," take a plot synopsis with you
","At this point in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series, the plot lines have become so convoluted and twisted around each other that it is no longer possible to tell the players without a program - or at least without having done some serious boning up beforehand on all that transpired in the two previous entries. That is probably the strongest criticism one can level against 'At World's End,' an otherwise reasonably entertaining addition to the phenomenally lucrative 'Pirates' franchise.Written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and directed by Gore Verbinski, 'At World's End' picks up where 'Dead Man's Chest' left off, with Elizabeth, Will and the recently resurrected Barbossa going in search of Jack Sparrow, who has been consigned to a watery grave courtesy of the Kraken, a sea creature who serves at the behest of the notorious Davy Jones. In this episode, Beckett, the Chairman of the East India Trading Company, has begun to hang any individual even remotely suspected of partaking in piracy, forcing the nine Pirate Lords - including Barbossa and the re-resurrected Sparrow - to band together in armed opposition to Beckett's forces.Like the previous two 'Pirates' films, 'At World's End' is immensely entertaining for the first forty-five minutes or so until the seemingly inevitable tedium begins to set in, caused in large part by the fact that we tend to get lost in the mind-boggling shuffling of characters and plot points. It gets so bad at times that we often aren't entirely sure who's aligned with whom, whose ship we're on, which characters are alive or dead at any given moment, and what 'being dead' actually means in a scenario where the rules on that score seem as variable as a gentle sea breeze on a balmy summer afternoon. Moreover, any action film that runs an exhausting two hours and forty-eight minutes is bound to falter in its pacing and to sag in places, and 'At World's End' is no exception in that respect. Doesn't anyone toiling in the blockbuster-producing factories of Hollywood know how to use an editing machine anymore? Nevertheless, this latest episode does a nice job keeping all its main characters together in the same geographical locale for the most part, so that the actors don't get as lost on the vast narrative canvas as they did in the previous versions. As a result, even the usually bland Keira Knightely manages to step out of the shadows and deliver something of an actual performance in this film. The movie also gives an impressive amount of screen time to the marvelous Geoffrey Rush as the scalawag Barbossa. But the best news is that Johnny Depp returns to the glorious form he displayed in 'Curse of the Black Pearl,' which, for some reason, got a bit tamped down in the second installment The only real disappointment on the acting front is the much ballyhooed appearance of Keith Richards in the cameo role of Jack Sparrow's dad (Depp has confessed to modeling his original performance on Richards). Although the casting of Richards is rife with possibilities, for some reason the performer has chosen to underplay the part rather than to go wild with it. It would have been so much fun to see him hamming it up alongside Depp; instead, Richards drains the life out of the father/son encounter, utterly muffing this golden opportunity for a truly classic scene.The special effects and makeup are typically spectacular, and the director keeps the action percolating along at a reasonably ramped-up pace, give or take the yawn-inducing longueur or two that occasionally come our way.This particular pirate's tale has probably run its course at this point, but 'At World's End' isn't a bad way for it to go out.",6,0,2,27 May 2007
X-Men," surprisingly profound comic book derivation
","In the world of movies, profundity often creeps up in the most unexpected and unlikely of places.  Let's face it; one does not instinctively turn to the super-hero genre if one is searching for films with great thematic meaning and philosophical depth.  Yet, `X-Men' provides just those qualities in the context of a thought provoking, intelligently written and superbly executed tale of `mutants' searching for acceptance, tolerance and affirmation in a world filled with frightened and often even hostile inhabitants. Much more than just a mere action film, `X- Men' broadens into a study of the effects of prejudice, done in almost allegorical terms.  Often when a theme has become played out through over exposure, it takes a fresh approach to make it come alive again.  Yet another movie chronicling the injustices done to blacks, Native Americans, Jews, gays, the handicapped and a host of other routinely aggrieved groups probably would not have the same impact as this film does.  By creating an entirely fictional group to serve as the target of intolerance, the filmmakers allow us see the issue from a novel perspective, stripped down to its barest essentials as it were.  Since none of us brings to the film an innate prejudice against a group that doesn't exist in real life, we are all free to see the irrationality, fear and idiocy that serve as the basis for bigotry in any of its forms.  How many movies of any genre can one say THAT about?The film begins, appropriately, with a scene recreating a factual example of bigotry in one of its most recent and darkest forms  as a family of Jews in 1944 Poland is marched to its doom in a Nazi concentration camp.  We discover later on that the young lad has survived the experience and that he is actually one of the first of a new breed of `mutants' being caused by a sudden leap in the human evolutionary cycle.  It seems that these mutants begin manifesting their various differences around the time of puberty, and that as the 21st Century progresses and more and more of these special people begin to reveal themselves, the world finds itself grappling with the issue of whether or not they should be denied equal rights and equal citizenship and even whether or not they should be allowed to remain integrated with the rest of society.   In many ways, I imagine that this film speaks with particular significance to the gay community, since in contemporary terms, that seems to be the group most often targeted with the kind of ignorant, vitriolic claptrap we hear coming from the outraged `normal' citizens and opportunistic politicians in the film.  The X-Men are a group of mutants (women included, by the way) with super-human powers whose twofold mission it is to prevent the world's lawmakers from passing legislation against them and to simultaneously fight off some renegade mutants who have decided to take matters into their own, less diplomatic hands.  Kudos to writer David Hayder and director Bryan Singer for daring to explore such a profound theme in such an entertaining format.For make no mistake about it:  `X-Men,' for all its profundity and thematic richness, is, first and foremost, a stylish and enthralling comic book action thriller.  Even though the mutant heroes are essentially two-dimensional characters, at least they don't undercut the seriousness of their purpose by indulging in the customary wisecracking, adolescent antics that have diminished so many earlier super hero characters in previous films of this nature.  Most impressive is that the `villain' possesses not only a credible motive for his actions, but even the seeds of some long dormant goodness that allow for the possibility of his redemption somewhere down the road.  (And it is indeed obvious that this film provides a dandy setup for a potentially lucrative series of films to follow).  The first-rate action stunt sequences and state-of-the-art special effects contribute greatly to the entertainment level of the film.  Of the actors, the standout is Patrick Stewart who, as the mutant dedicated to building a bridge of tolerance and understanding between the mutants and the outside world, brings just the right note of comforting civility and rationality to the role.Yet, for all its technical virtues as an action film, it is the depth and breadth of its vision that separates `X-Men' from so many other films of its genre and makes it truly worthwhile viewing.  As grateful moviegoers, our appetite is whetted  and we eagerly await our next serving.",Null,0,0,3 December 2000
Spider-Man 3," rampant overkill
","Clocking in at an interminable two hours and twenty minutes, 'Spider-Man 3' is a movie desperately in need of some serious streamlining. There is such a plethora of characters, plot lines, villains and monsters - all vying for attention and getting in each others' way in the process - that the movie feels as if it has been assembled by a committee rather than having arisen from a single artist's organic vision.The ostensible selling point of 'Spider-Man 3' is that the meek and mild-mannered Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) dons a mysterious black suit that suddenly turns him into a heartless, cranky bad guy. The suit, which is actually a creepy-crawly creature from outer space that changes the personality of whomever it clings to, is only one of four villains Spidey has to contend with here - in as clear a case of malefactor overload as we've encountered in quite some time. No wonder Spider-Man looks so worn out (we seriously thought it might just be the by-product of sequel-fatigue). The others foes include his friend, Harry Osborn, aka New Goblin (James Franco), who still believes Parker was responsible for his father's death; Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual murderer of Parker's uncle who has been transformed into a giant killer sandman; and a cocky little newspaper photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is determined to snap a photo of Spider-Man doing something bad so as to tarnish the superhero's hitherto sterling reputation around town (Brock becomes a victim of the dark suit as well). One would think that with all this occupying the hero, the scenarists (Ivan Raimi, Alvin Sargent and writer/director Sam Raimi) wouldn't have much time left over for romantic entanglements, but one would be wrong in that assumption, for a great deal of the film is devoted to the relationship between Parker and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who has become a tremendously needy, whiney and self-pitying character in this installment. In fact, so tedious is the romance this time around that whatever charisma and charm Maguire and Dunst exuded as a couple in the previous two films has been completely wiped out on this occasion. While I must concede that they are both tremendously likable actors, I think they may have gone once too often to the well with these particular roles. Maguire's impossibly sweet and good-natured demeanor has become particularly annoying at this point (although he isn't all that convincing when he's trying to play the bad-boy villain either).I've never been much of a fan of Spider-Man, either in comic book form or in the movies, but one of the reasons why 'Spider-Man 2' worked as a film and the others haven't is because, in that movie, Parker's crippling self-doubts about whether or not he was really cut out to be a superhero gave a depth to the character that was psychologically sound and which made it easy for the audience to identify with him. In 'Spider-Man 3,' however, Parker essentially has his 'evil' thrust upon him from an outside source and, thus, that key psychological dimension is now lacking. Instead, the filmmakers have decided to really turn on the waterworks in this film, with just about everybody breaking down in tears at one point or another, culminating in an ending so syrupy and sappy that both dieters and diabetics should probably leave the theater a good fifteen minutes before the close of the story.That pretty much leaves the special effects, which run the gamut from decent (they still haven't really figured out how to make Spiderman's 'flying' very convincing on screen) to spectacular (the Sandman is a really cool creature, indeed). The fight scenes are impressively hectic and noisy (which may explain the headache I developed halfway through the film), but it is rather difficult to develop much of a personal rooting interest in the outcome when a group of what are essentially invincible figures are battling it out for supremacy. And talk about villain overkill! With 'Spider-Man 3,' the superhero's movie batting-average drops from an impressive .500 to a middling .333. Let's hope he can raise it back up the next time he steps up to the plate.",4,48,96,6 May 2007
Match Point," engrossing tale of adultery and obsession
","In 'Match Point,' Woody Allen, caught in one of his more 'serious' moods, takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating. Although he leaves a trail of clues implying that this is to be another of his homages to Fyodor Dostoevsky, the film really turns out to be Allen's own version of Theodore Dreiser's 'An American Tragedy' (albeit set in England, perhaps to throw us off the scent). The parallels between the two works are not perfect, of course - in fact they often seem to be intentionally inverted - but they are close enough to make us wonder if Allen did, indeed, do it all on purpose.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris Wilton, a down-on-his-luck social climber who marries into wealth but longs for the passion he finds with another woman. Chris is a professional tennis player who decides to leave the circuit when he realizes he hasn't the skill to compete with the real pros. Taking a job as an instructor at a posh, highly exclusive tennis club, Chris finds himself wining and dining with the rich and famous after one of his pupils, Tom Hewett, takes a liking to him and introduces Chris to his snooty but accepting family. Chris begins to date Tom's warmhearted sister, Chloe, but he is really smitten by an aspiring American actress, Nola, who just happens to be Tom's fiancé. Chris makes the mistake of marrying Chloe before Tom and Nola call off their engagement and go their separate ways. The fact that Nola is free but he is not doesn't deter Chris from pursing an affair with the woman who provides all the passion and excitement his loving but boring wife cannot. But Chris soon discovers that carrying on an affair can result in a life filled with secrecy, lies, guilt and self-loathing. And when the going gets to be just a bit too much for our hero to handlewell, there's always that 'final solution' lurking in the wings, as many an earlier adulterer has discovered to his everlasting regret.'Match Point' starts off very slowly and seems at first as if it will be just another tale of adultery and unrequited love. Yet, Allen really knows how to draw us into Chris' predicament, so that, by about halfway into the film, we feel as enmeshed in his seemingly irreconcilable dilemma as he himself is. Torn between the wealth and position he has as Chloe's husband and the love he feels for the relatively impoverished Nola, Chris is frozen into a state of paralyzing indecisiveness, his every waking moment a tormenting hell of fear and gathering dread as he keeps waiting in breathless anticipation for that other shoe to drop. It isn't until the 'other woman' becomes more of a burden than his clinging wife that Chris can finally launch into action. This turnabout in the screenplay might strike many in the audience as arbitrary and implausible and there is certainly a case to be made for that. But if you can go with the flow, you will be delighted by all the little ironies Allen throws at us in the final stages of the story, which help to underline the filmmaker's thesis that, for all the efforts we make to control our lives, The Fickle Finger of Fate - or in this case a tennis ball precariously balancing on the top of a net trying to figure out which way to fall - always has the final word.Allen has written dialogue that is incisive, intelligent and literate, and the performances he's drawn from the likes of Rhys-Meyers, Goode, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Wilton are superb down to the tiniest detail. Allen keeps his camera tightly focused on his characters, rarely pulling away from them much beyond a middle distance, keeping us firmly locked in the near-claustrophobic drama. Here is a movie that demands patience at the beginning but that really sneaks up on you the longer you watch it.Guided by the hands of a master, 'Match Point' is one of Allen's finest films in years.",8,116,166,12 January 2006
Children of Heaven," a work of art
","The wonderful Iranian film 'Children of Heaven' and its companion piece, 'The White Balloon', remind one of those great Czechoslovakian films of the 1960's ('The Shop on Main Street,' 'Loves of a Blonde,' etc.) in that they achieve their artistry by providing keenly observed glimpses into the minutiae of everyday life. They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all, this magnificent film reminds us that real drama comes not in the form of over-plotted special effects-laden extravaganzas, but from films that examine the universal simplicities of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet - this is when art is achieved.'Children of Heaven' has its roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes not merely the earlier 'The White Balloon' but the original Italian classic, 'The Bicycle Thief.' In this film, young Ali accidentally loses his sister's recently mended shoes; out of this tale of utmost simplicity, the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to overcome this obstacle, the film touches on any number of universal themes: the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often irrational parental anger; well meaning, loving parents overwhelmed with the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that seem cruel to the children who adore them; the petty viciousness with which children often strike out at each other, yet, at the same time, the often unexpected kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another. The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama. Beautifully directed, with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened naturalistic noises, it is a film of many-splendored wonders, its lyricism caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy, its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate young girl in tow.The actors, children and adults alike, underplay their roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are performing at all; the film, through them, becomes a magical fabric of life that draws the audience deep into its world.'Children of Heaven' brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding spaceships, car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony, empty and bereft of life most American films are. Don't miss 'Children of Heaven'! It is a richly rewarding experience.",Null,113,118,4 January 2000
Yes Man," generic but enjoyable Carrey vehicle
","Essentially a cock-eyed variation on 'Liar Liar,' 'Yes Man' presents Jim Carrey as a bank loan officer who spends most of his off-duty hours actively avoiding social engagements with his friends and co-workers. A 'lonely guy' by choice, Carl undergoes a life-transforming experience when he attends a self-help seminar dedicated to the proposition that one can get a whole lot more out of life by saying 'yes' when opportunity comes a-knockin' than by saying 'no.' Soon, Carl is agreeing to virtually every offer that comes his way, often to surprising and hilarious results.As a generally generic Carrey vehicle, 'Yes Man' doesn't provide much in the way of a thespian stretch for the actor, who could toss one of these roles off in his sleep if he wanted to. On the positive side, the movie feels less contrived than some of his previous efforts, thanks to the fact that it doesn't rely on some cheap gimmick like a magic spell or a knock on the head to get the plot rolling. The decision to become compulsively agreeable remains an act of volition on the part of the character, thus making the tale more relatable and grounded in the long run. Nobody is better than Carrey when it comes to over-the-top mugging and he is frequently in prime form here. Moreover, there are quite a few genuine belly laughs that are alone worth the price of admission (with a randy encounter between Carl and his aged landlady achieving the movie's high point of hilarity).On the downside, 'Yes Man' does have a whiff of déjà vu about it that it is never entirely able to shake. Moreover, there is a certain threadbare quality that is almost inevitable when a movie's premise is built, as this one is, on the repetition of a single note. And there are some definite dull patches when the comic ideas seem to be withering on the vine. The compensation, beyond Carrey of course, comes in the form of two noteworthy supporting players: the likable Bradley Cooper as Carl's best buddy, and the winsome and charming Zooey Deschanel as the slightly offbeat motorcycle-riding band singer Carl meets and falls in love with during the course of the story.",6,1,2,6 May 2009
Midnight in Paris," OK but could have been so much better
","Like the man at the movie's core, I was hoping to be transported to a different time and place while watching Woody Allen's universally acclaimed 'Midnight in Paris.' What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.So far, so good. Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often wont to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today. For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite. He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she's picked to marry. No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.The main problem for me with 'Midnight in Paris' is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life. In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last. They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd. Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works. And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better. Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie. Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film? Surely, those are worth the price of admission. Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.So what is good about the film? Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque. And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into 'The Exterminating Angel.' The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.More virtues like these and 'Midnight in Paris' might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.",6,0,0,31 August 2012
Zodiac," a thinking-man's thriller
","With 'Zodiac,' director David Fincher returns to the crime thriller territory he explored to such effectiveness in 'Seven' a dozen odd years ago.For over a decade - from December 1968 to the late 1970's - a serial killer calling himself The Zodiac terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area, dispatching his victims seemingly at random while keeping up a cryptic, cat-and-mouse correspondence with several major newspapers in the area. Despite some impressive leads, the killer was never caught and the murders eventually stopped as quickly and mysteriously as they had started.At 160 minutes, 'Zodiac' lacks the streamlining and telescoping we've come to expect from movies about serial killers, which are more often designed for sensationalism and exploitation than contemplation and reflection. Taking a novelistic approach to the subject, screenwriter James Vanderbilt gives the drama room to breathe, allowing detail to pile upon detail, and providing an array of characters who disappear from the drama for long periods of time only to return to center stage when called upon to do so by the facts of the case.The drawback in such a strategy is that the movie occasionally feels aimless and formless, as it ricochets back and forth between plot strands and characters that often seem at cross purposes to one another. But the distinct advantage of this approach is that the movie feels less contrived and artificial and more akin to real life, as it captures the sometimes decidedly unglamorous nature and frustratingly plodding pace of actual crime detection. And for those who might be hesitant to watch the film due strictly to its subject matter, it should be noted that, for a movie on such a grisly topic, 'Zodiac' is surprisingly tame in the blood-and-guts department (thank goodness).Indeed, the movie gets its unnerving murder scenes out of the way right up front, so it can turn its full attention to its real areas of interest: chronicling the behind-the-scenes search for the killer and exploring the psychological impact this search has on three men who become, to varying degrees, obsessed with the case. Jake Gyllenhaal, who hit a career high water mark in 2005 with 'Proof,' 'Jarhead' and, of course, 'Brokeback Mountain,' continues his journey into edgy roles playing Graysmith, the rather nerdy cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who managed to get closer to unveiling the true identity of the killer than anyone else, and who went on to write of his experiences in the book, 'Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed,' on which the film itself is based. Graysmith was able to scoop even the lead investigator, David Toschi (sharply played by the always interesting Mark Ruffalo), who finds his life becoming ever more overtaken by the case the longer it drags on without resolution. The third major actor in the drama is Paul Avery, the crime beat reporter who turned to drink, thereby torpedoing his own career, after the killer singled him out as a potential target. It is the lack of screen time allotted to Avery that offers one of the genuine disappointments of the movie, especially as he is embodied by the brilliant Robert Downey Jr., whose own life experiences make him the perfect choice for the role.With its meticulously mounted, pitch-perfect recreation of the details of the case as well as the times in which they took place, 'Zodiac' is one of the few films of recent years that can truly be termed a thinking man's thriller.",8,13,26,12 March 2007
Milk," a timely and inspiring biopic
","How fortuitous a thing is timing. Released only a few weeks after the passage of Proposition 8 - a ballot measure that took away the rights of same-sex couples to marry in California - Gus Van Sant's Oscar-nominated film 'Milk' turns back the clock to another, similar struggle in American civil rights history and to the iconic figure who helped to wage it.Harvey Milk was, of course, the San Francisco supervisor and gay-rights pioneer who, along with Mayor George Moscone, was gunned down in city hall in November 1978. The perpetrator, Dan White, a disgruntled fellow board member who had recently resigned his seat, was found guilty of manslaughter (using the now infamous 'Twinkie Defense' to get the lower charge), sent to prison for a mere five years, then released in 1984, only to take his own life two years later.Dustin Lance Black's Oscar-winning screenplay traces Milk's meteoric rise from an obscure, still largely closeted Republican businessman in the early 1970s to the de facto leader of the gay-rights movement that began to take shape during that decade. He became the first openly gay man in the state to be elected to public office and, in 1978, he was instrumental in helping to defeat Proposition 6, which, if passed, would have made it illegal for homosexuals (and even straight supporters of homosexuals!) to teach in California public schools (was this really only thirty years ago?). Throughout all this, Milk managed to develop a large, highly charged grass roots organization, the purpose of which was not merely to combat bigotry wherever it reared its ugly head but to win over the hearts and minds of the people in their community and the nation as a whole.There has been some criticism leveled against the movie that it is too reverential in its treatment of Milk, that it paints him too much as a saint and not enough as an ordinary human being with the requisite number of weaknesses and flaws to make him truly viable as a character. Even if one were to accept that charge (which I do not), it still doesn't take into account the very special quality that Sean Penn himself brings to the role. With obviously heightened mannerisms that he is careful never to allow to slide over into caricature or camp, Penn makes Milk both charismatically larger-than-life and recognizably human at one and the same time. Whether he's in front of a crowd rallying the troops with his megaphone or enjoying a tender moment with his longtime boyfriend, Scott Smith, Penn allows us see the many facets of this obviously complex man.In a movie chock full of outstanding supporting performances, James Franco as Smith, Josh Brolin as Dan White, and Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, a rootless young man inspired by Milk to become a lifelong activist, are the obvious standouts.As a director, Van Sant keeps things moving at an almost whirlwind pace, beautifully balancing the 'big' scenes of rallies and marches with the more intimate moments depicting Milk's relationships with those around him. At times Van Sant brings an almost documentary-style immediacy to the film, seamlessly blending actual footage from that era (much of it of Anita Bryant and her anti-gay crusade) with convincingly staged re-enactments of events at that time. Obviously wanting to end on a positive note, the movie mentions but does not dramatize the 'White Night Riots' which took place in the city following the assassinations, instead focusing on the enormous candlelight march that wended its way through the shocked and devastated city. Thus, the ending, like the movie itself, is a necessary and deeply moving reminder of how the courage of one individual to stand up for what he knows is right can inspire others to follow in his footsteps - and change the world in the process.By opening with file footage of men being arrested at a gay bar then carted off in paddy wagons to be booked as 'sex offenders,' 'Milk' makes the viewer realize how very far society has come in the time since the events depicted in this story - and, with the recent passage of Proposition 8, how very far it still has to go.",9,2,5,14 March 2009
The Prestige," a strong piece of cinematic legerdemain
","Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation - a tale of two master magicians in turn-of-the-century London whose bitter rivalry leads to deception, dismemberment and eventually murder.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are the two up-and-coming magicians who part ways when Alfred is deemed to be partly responsible for the death of Robert's beloved wife (while functioning as a magician's assistant) in one of their acts on stage. Consumed with the desire for revenge and spurred on by professional jealousy, Robert spends the remainder of his days working to undermine and destroy Alfred's career and life.With the help of some first-rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co-writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel. The solid production values - meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography - offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core. More than anything else, the film is a tribute to the stagecraft inherent in the art of magic making. The movie provides not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight-of-hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi-level time structure and its I-never-saw-that-coming, turnabout ending.The performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.On the slightly negative side, the film might have been more successful had it remained entirely in the realm of the real world of magic making and resisted the temptation of turning to science fiction to help move its plot along. Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment.",8,3,5,3 December 2006
Cloverfield," stunning visuals overcome narrative weaknesses
","You sure gotta' give those New Yorkers props for resilience. If they aren't doing battle with space aliens, a bio-engineered plague, or a global warming-inspired ice age, they're fending off a nondescript creature that's come out of nowhere to lay waste to large sections of Lower and Midtown Manhattan. And indeed, after 'War of the Worlds,' 'I Am Legend,' 'The Day After Tomorrow,' and now 'Cloverfield,' one wonders just how much abuse one little island should be expected to take before finally crying uncle.Blending the content of 'Godzilla' with the style of 'The Blair Witch Project,' the makers of 'Cloverfield' relate their story entirely through the use of a hand-held camera, as a group of twenty-something friends have their cocktail party rudely interrupted by the sudden appearance of a monster capable of tipping over skyscrapers and squashing cars as if they were bugs. The movie follows a remnant of partygoers as they wend their way through the smoky chaos of the ruined city, with one of them recording the horrors and devastation on a camcorder as he goes.Despite having a relatively low budget for a film of this type, 'Cloverfield' does a remarkable job in blending CGI graphics with home video technology. It may be true that the inky blackness of the nighttime setting helps to cover a multitude of special effects sins (some viewers may be frustrated by the murky indistinctiveness of the monster itself), but, on the whole, director Matt Reeves, cinematographer Michael Bonvillain, editor Kevin Stitt, and a team of highly talented FX and production artists are to be commended for achieving so much with so little.The advantage of the you-are-there approach that the filmmakers have adopted is that it makes the audience feel more a part of the actual event than if the story were given a slicker, more conventional presentation. Suffice it to say there's no Will Smith here slapping on a flight suit and zooming off into the wild blue yonder to duke it out mano-a-mano with the creature and singlehandedly save the world. These are ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and it's no coincidence that much of the imagery is clearly intended to evoke memories of 9/11. After all, a world where post-apocalyptic paranoia runs rampant is no place for conventional action heroes. Therefore, the verisimilitude of the piece is greatly enhanced by the use of relatively unknown players in the key roles (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel).The disadvantage of this 1st person-restricted approach is that it occasionally leads to repetitiveness in the storytelling, with even the gimmick itself threatening to wear out its welcome quicker than the monster himself does. The narrow focus is also liable to drive some viewers crazy by not providing any kind of resolution or explanation to neatly wrap things up at the end (to me, this is a strength rather than a weakness).Finally, theatergoers who were rendered nauseated by the nonstop bobbing-and-weaving camera-work on the big screen should know that the effect is much less pronounced when viewed on TV.The characters and their relationships may be no more than mere window dressing placed at the service of the story, but that really doesn't matter, for in the case of 'Cloverfield,' the film-making itself is the star.",7,0,1,10 May 2008
Sleepy Hollow," great visuals done in by lame story
","`Sleepy Hollow,' though no worse than dozens of other similarly designed films, seems as good a spot as any to pull back and ask ourselves this question:  are special effects ruining the movies?  Time was when filmmakers, sorely hampered by technological limitations, were forced to make a virtue out of necessity and develop scripts filled with subtlety, imagination and humor to help sustain an audience's attention.   Now, all a filmmaker need do it seems is provide the barest essentials in terms of plot and character development in the vain hope that the astonishingly realistic special effects will single-handedly carry the day.  Such a philosophy, however, far more often than not, leaves the audience feeling assaulted, detached and empty, both mentally and emotionally.Like so many films, `Sleepy Hollow' starts out promisingly.  No one is better at establishing a mood of bizarre, otherworldly eeriness than director Tim Burton and `Sleepy Hollow' is certainly a total triumph in terms of its art direction, set decoration and cinematography.  Through these elements, Burton creates an entire sunless world of mist-shrouded bogs and forests, filled with twisted, gnarled trees, somber graveyards and dreary lonely roads that greet many a quaking traveler with doom and destruction.  For, in this quaint New England village of Sleepy Hollow, a number of citizens have been recently dispatched in a most inglorious way - cut down, literally, by the avenging headless horseman, their heads sliced off and carried away leaving only the decapitated bodies behind as a reminder of their earthly existence.  Into this scene of inexplicable death and carnage comes Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York investigator sent to the town to unravel the mystery.Very loosely based on Washington Irving's classic tale, `Sleepy Hollow,' almost inevitably it seems, violates the spirit of the original through the customary reliance on over-literalization. The headless horseman, like so many figures of classic horror literature, is a creature best left in the abstract, for once he has been realized on screen, much of the majesty and mystery that comprise his aura simply evaporate.  Absolutely nothing is left to the imagination.  He is interesting and frightening as long as he remains off-stage.  The moment he gets off his horse and starts swinging his sword in full view of the camera he loses those qualities.  Despite the magnificent atmosphere, we find ourselves growing more and more restless as the body count begins to swell, especially since the explanation for the horseman's actions, when it is finally revealed to us, comes across as both confused and uninspired.  Once again, a film filled with so much quality and potential at the beginning simply collapses under the weight of conventional storytelling and over-reliance on special effects.The writer attempts to bring humanity to Ichabod by emphasizing his nervousness, hesitancy and squeamishness, yet Depp is allowed to play the scenes with such a comic undertone that he undercuts the thriller aspects of the work.  This technique worked brilliantly in his portrayal of Ed Wood because that was a film filled with warmhearted affection for its subject. Here, the tone works against the intended mood and leaves the audience confused as to just what type of film `Sleepy Hollow' was intended to be. The flat performances delivered by Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson don't help a bit either.Thus, `Sleepy Hollow,' though definitely worth seeing for its many technical marvels, fails to emerge as a very compelling film overall.  Though I know it has become fashionable lately to pooh-pooh `The Blair Witch Project' for its lack of visualization and cinematic finesse, I sincerely believe that the sense of terror lurking in its forest far surpasses that found in Burton's, for all the latter's big budget impressiveness.  Once again, a movie proves that money alone - and great visuals to boot - cannot buy - or guarantee - a quality film.",Null,0,0,20 May 2000
Once," a uniquely beautiful film
","'Once' is a story about a man and a woman who conduct a courtship almost entirely through song. Music being the primary medium in which these two individuals move through life, it is only appropriate that they should express their love for one another through music as well.Glen Hansard plays a struggling songwriter/musician whose recent, emotionally devastating breakup with the girl of his dreams now serves as the inspiration for most of his lyrics. Marketa Irglova is a young woman who recently emigrated from the Czech Republic with her mother and daughter to begin a new life in Ireland. She, too, is a composer of music, though she is less assertive and confident about exposing it to others than he is. The two meet on the street one night while he is performing one of his original compositions and they begin a slow, tentative relationship based largely on their mutual love of music.'Once' is a beautiful, lyrical and heartbreaking film that has understandably garnered a passionate cult following since its release in early 2007. It is an utterly unique and spellbinding work in which the music is every bit as important as the dialogue. The plot, though basic and uncluttered, still manages to throw a few curveballs our way in an acknowledgment that romantic relationships do not always work out in the way we'd like. Filmmaker John Carney keeps it as simple and intimate in his directorial style as he does in his writing, utilizing an unobtrusive and relatively steady hand-held camera that nicely matches the rhythms and beats of the music playing in the background (and often in the foreground). The scene in which the camera, in a single unbroken shot, moves ahead of Irglova as she strolls along the streets of the city singing an original composition is one of the truly transcendent movie moments of 2007. And the music itself is lovely, flavorful and memorable - reason alone, I'd say, for seeing the film.In addition to their obvious talents as singers and musicians, Hansard and Irglova give performances of such poignancy and subtle emotion that they draw us instantly into the hearts of their characters.If 'Once' reminds us of any film, it is probably the French classic, 'A Man and a Woman,' another work whose tale of romantic love was intimately woven through music (although, in that film, the characters themselves were not singing or composing works). That's not a bad template for a romantic movie, when you get right down to it.Since 'Once' is a film that it is much better to experience than it is to read about, I suggest you try it on for yourself. You won't regret it.",9,3,6,13 January 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Sober espionage thriller
","Based on the novel by John le Carre, 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a throwback to films like 'The Ipcress File' and 'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' - that is to say, a sober, serious tale of secret agents set in that period quaintly known as the Cold War.Gary Oldman plays an agent for British Intelligence who's called out of retirement to uncover a possible mole in the top echelons of the agency. Set in 1973, the complex - a bit too complex at times, perhaps - plot utilizes flashbacks to unravel much of its story.Written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and directed by Tomas Alfredson, the movie doesn't go for the cheap thrill or the easy stunt, relying on intellect rather than action-movie antics and pyrotechnic special effects to generate its suspense. The tone is subdued and carefully modulated, the pacing slow and deliberate. And fine performances by Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, et.al., and an appropriately chilly atmosphere make for enjoyable viewing.",7,1,2,2 September 2012
We Were Soldiers," simplistic but powerful war film
","World War II has been tagged by some with the rather oxymoronic appellation `the last good war.'  What this means is that the `heroes' and `villains' in this epic conflict were so clear-cut and obvious - and the goals so straightforward and crucial - that filmmakers approaching the subject haven't needed to bother much with exploring the moral complexities that lie at the root of all war, that most inhumane of human endeavors.  Films set in World War II have almost invariably reflected a sense of moral certitude, with the Allied nations seen as the forces of Good locked in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of Evil represented by the Axis powers.This is not, of course, the way Americans came, for the most part, to view the Vietnam War.  Faced with no clearly defined enemy or menace, many Americans began to question their country's involvement in what seemed from a distance to be a civil war between two alien nations and cultures. Thus, when it finally came time for filmmakers to address this issue, their films naturally reflected much of the moral ambiguity that defined the nation as a whole.  Films like `The Deer Hunter,' `Platoon,' `Apocalypse Now' etc. not only questioned the moral rightness of our involvement and actions in that conflict, but actually made us question whether heroism - on the scale of the common soldier caught in the conflict - was even a valid possibility.The new film, `We Were Soldiers' attempts to rectify that skepticism, trying to counterbalance the films like those listed above, while at the same time serving as a long overdue and honorable tribute to the brave young men who fought and died doing their duty on that strange foreign soil.  The film, thereby, endeavors to bring the WWII war film sensibility to one set in Vietnam.  In order to focus our attention on the individual heroism of the men involved, the film first has had to drain the narrative of its entire sociopolitical context.  Since this is the story of the first major battle between the Americans and the Viet Cong (which took place in November 1965) one would naturally expect to hear quite a bit of discourse - both among the military leaders and the rank-and-file combat soldiers - as to the why and wherefore of both the conflict and the Americans' reason for taking part in it.  Yet, we get none of this.  All the soldiers involved simply do their duty without question, an attitude which becomes, in effect, the film's operative definition of the word `heroism.'  This is what separates `We Were Soldiers' from those previous Vietnam War films.  The characters in those other movies were also dying bravely, but they always seemed to be questioning the powers-that-be that got them into the situation in the first place.  In `We Were Soldiers,' no one ever questions.  The need to follow orders is simply accepted as a given - and thus heroism becomes a matter of doing one's duty and of helping one's comrade regardless of any overarching justification for the slaughter.  Without having to wade through all the moral murkiness of the conflict itself, we are thus freed up to admire the sheer courage and determination of the men.  In fact, the film even makes a few good willed nods in the direction of equanimity by showing that even the Viet Cong fighters, who are attempting to kill all these fine young American men, also have girlfriends and families they love back home.
Given this self-imposed myopia, `We Were Soldiers,' nevertheless, does an admirable job honoring these men.  Like most war movies, so much time is spent on the pyrotechnics of battle that little time is left to engage in any real character development.  `We Were Soldiers' attempts to flesh out its characters in the opening stretch when we see several of the men with their wives and families before embarking on their mission.  But once they hit the ground in Vietnam, all hell breaks loose and most of the men become lost in the chaos of this seemingly interminable battle.  The film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.  The carnage is appropriately gruesome and the filmmakers make sure that we see every last bit of the grotesquerie that the act of unbridled human butchery has to offer.  The special effects team has done an extraordinary job bringing all this to life on the screen.Although a few of the early family scenes seem treacly at best, some of the film's most profoundly moving moments occur back home, when Julia Moore (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the film's protagonist, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), takes it upon herself to deliver the `death telegrams' to the other wives on the base.Gibson does an admirable job as the man in charge of the mission, displaying both a rugged strength and a compassionate love for his men that makes him a well-rounded character.  One appreciates the fact that the writers, Joseph L. Galloway and Harold G. Moore himself (upon whose life and book this true story is based) don't require Moore to indulge in the kind of cheap theatrical heroics common to characters of this type.  He is a man whose level-headedness and grace under fire help lead his men on to victory in an almost impossible situation.  This is also a rare instance in which a character is allowed to have a religious dimension without being made into a fool in the process.Randall Wallace, as the film's director, seems equally at home in the battle sequences and in the quieter moments of subtle sadness that permeate the scenes at home.`We Were Soldiers,' for all its simplicity of theme, manages to be a moving tribute to the young men who found the personal courage to put their lives on the line, with or without a cause that made any sense.",Null,1,2,16 March 2002
Ocean's Twelve," lazy, half-hearted effort
","2004's 'Ocean's Twelve' picks up where 2001's 'Ocean's Eleven' left off. When we last saw them, Danny Ocean and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities. However, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict, the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean's doorstep demanding restitution. He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences. Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it's never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat). What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries - one a detective and the other a rival thief - who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.'Ocean's Twelve' is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film. For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh have come up with a ha'penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in 'Ocean's Eleven.' Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories. Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start. Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors. Moreover, there is a side foray involving Julia Roberts trying to pass herself off as Julia Roberts that is inane, incredible, preposterous and embarrassing. The sequence is indicative of the lazy, half-hearted approach the filmmakers have taken towards both their material and their audience.It's also unpleasant watching the one character with even a smidgen of a moral code crossing over to the dark side at the end of the story - and asking us to get all misty-eyed and choked-up when it happens (at least when Anakin does it, we aren't expected to cheer him on from the sidelines).The high-priced, big-name actors - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon and Albert Finney - go through the motions, but they seem hopelessly cut adrift by the meandering, substandard screenplay. Actually, only Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the detective and former girlfriend of Brad Pitt, is given anything of genuine substance to work with here. All the rest are just picking up paychecks.In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in 'Ocean's Twelve' is pretty damn awful any way you slice it. We've already had it sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?",4,0,0,15 July 2005
Crash," Is the Academy kidding with this?
","Like a bad student film with big-name stars in its cast, Paul Haggis' puerile and self-important 'Crash' is a masterpiece for the easily impressed. Filled with bathos and bombast, and more implausible coincidences than an 800-page novel by Charles Dickens (and no offense meant to Mr. Dickens), 'Crash' plays less like a movie and more like some underachiever's dissertation for a Sociology course entitled Racism 101. (Racist white cop fondles black woman in front of her husband at routine traffic stoppause projectordiscuss what this scene shows about racism in our societyresume filmsame racist white cop pulls same black woman to safety from burning wreckagepause projectordiscuss what this scene says about the possibility of redemption for every individualetc.). Astonishingly, this piece of mealy mouthed claptrap won the Academy Award for the Best Picture of 2005.Cribbing its interlocking, multi-character format from 'Short Cuts,' 'Grand Canyon,' 'Magnolia,' '13 Conversations About One Thing' and a whole host of other similar but far superior films, Haggis' work purports to tell us that everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - living in Los Angeles is a thoroughgoing racist and bigot and, even more amazingly, spends twenty-four hours a day giving voice to their prejudice. Forget about political correctness; these people talk about race, race and nothing but race for nigh unto two hours in ways that show that Haggis is completely tone deaf when it comes to how people in the real world actually speak. This is a movie devoid of a single plausible moment (you know that verisimilitude is not high on this film's agenda when it starts snowing in Los Angeles!); it's a movie in which characters act completely without reason or motivation and in which every event that happens, no matter how idiotic or ridiculous, does so in the service of the message. On the level of dramaturgy alone, 'Crash' is an unmitigated disaster and a blueprint for how not to make a movie.Unfortunately, as 'Crash' itself begins to crash and burn, an awful lot of fine people wind up getting trapped inside the wreckage. A largely talented cast is wasted on an assortment of poorly written, shallow characters, and Haggis has no idea of how to create either drama or tension in any of the scenes he shows us. The moody score by Mark Isham does its best to make it all seem powerful and important, but the sheer incompetence of the writing and directing rob the film of both those qualities. Indeed, rarely has a movie been as full of itself as 'Crash' is, and rarely has a movie explored such a serious and important subject in as pretentious and superficial a manner. Perhaps the most insulting aspect of the film is how easily it bestows redemption on even its most wretched characters, as if all of life's problems could be so easily wrapped up in time for the closing credits. As others before me have pointed out, this is indeed a 'feel good' movie about racism, the very last thing a movie about racism should ever be.If you can buy a film in which an assortment of whiney, unappealing characters hurl racial invectives at one another for an hour and a half, then turn around and throw themselves into each others' arms in time for the tear-stained finale, then 'Crash' may be the movie for you. But if you find yourself laughing rather than weeping through the course of the story, don't say you hadn't been warned beforehand.What could all the fine folk in the Motion Picture Academy have been thinking?",3,11,20,25 April 2006
Snatch," incoherent, smart alecky gangster picture
","With `Snatch,' it would appear that the films of Guy Ritchie can now be officially consigned to that dubious category known as `an acquired taste.' Having enjoyed his previous work, `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' I guess I can say that I acquired that taste to at least some extent a few years back.  Now, having endured his most recent film, `Snatch,' I can safely say that I have `unacquired' it since.`Snatch' is a muddled, incoherent mess of a film, filled with plot mechanics and an assortment of characters so inscrutable as to leave the audience, first, confused, then, indifferent and, finally, downright hostile.  I refuse to even attempt to cope with unraveling the complexities of the plot here, since Ritchie himself obviously couldn't be bothered with doing so himself.  Suffice it to say that it has something to do with a bunch of foreign and homegrown mobsters in England vaguely involved with Brad Pitt as an amateur Irish gypsy boxer.With all the conflicting accents emanating from the mouths of the characters, fully a third of the dialogue is downright indecipherable Moreover, Ritchie is so busy indulging in his trademark camera and editing tricks that all hope of keeping up with the action disappears five minutes into the movie.  The flashy, hyperkinetic visual style is too cute by half, but even that is not nearly as cloying as the insipid attempts at trendy humor that pepper the criminals' lame interactions with each other.  As to Brad Pitt's agreeing to appear in this film, I have a few suppositions:  he did it as a favor to the director; he just couldn't resist the temptation to show he could pull off an accent for an entire film; or he had a hankering to return to the boxing arena after having gotten into such good shape for `Fight Club.'   Whatever the reason, even Pitt is unable to rescue this dreadful affair.(For those who care, yes, Madonna does make it onto the soundtrack of the film).`Snatch' is little more than an irritating, annoying and off-putting exercise in directorial self-indulgence.",Null,0,1,27 January 2002
The Beach," not very gritty story of survival
","Is this merely `Survivor' without the million-dollar payoff?  Or is it a modern vision of James Hilton's most famous novel?  For those too young to have any memories of `Lost Horizon,' `The Beach' may seem like a wildly new and original work.  And, as this is, essentially, a narcissistic youth fantasy starring teen-idol Leonardo Di Caprio, chances are that most of the film's audience will indeed be hovering somewhere near the puberty mark. Since the cast of characters is so youthful to begin with, the film is able to dispense with  or, at the most, treat obliquely  one of the major themes that runs through `Lost Horizon,' that of the universal lure of Eternal Youth.Di Caprio stars as Richard, a young man so bored with the mundane rituals of modern civilized life that he journeys alone to Bangkok to partake of the exotic experiences a more primitive life has to offer.  While there, he encounters a seeming madman who, right before his suicide, draws a map for Richard revealing the whereabouts of a small tropical island, guaranteed to be a Shangri-la for any person clever and daring enough to get there. Recruiting two of his hotel neighbors  a young French couple  to accompany him, Richard sets out to find his own private place in the sun.  But life is never quite that simple and the three soon discover that the island is already inhabited by other jaded tourists who have set up a carefree, thriving community far away from both the amenities and problems of the modern world.This concept of discovering a secret, pristine and uncorrupted paradise has a timeless appeal and pull.  And, as long as `The Beach' hews closely to this theme, it remains a reasonably interesting film, for who cannot identify at least partially with the lure of this idea?  The tricky part for the filmmakers tackling this theme is to make this unlikely situation seem real and believable.   Unfortunately, in the case of `The Beach,' the people who comprise this out-of-the-way community seem, for the most part, way too agreeable and cooperative.  This is like a Club Med resort without the room service.  Survival here doesn't seem like much of a struggle and there rarely ever seems to be much in the way of intense disagreements and arguments amongst the group's members.  We wonder, for instance, why, without monetary compensation or incentives of any kind for that matter, one man does all the cooking while another man does all the building.  As far as we can tell, they do virtually all the work on the island while the others frolic on the beach playing volleyball all day.  `Lost Horizon' was a certified fantasy  `The Beach' aspires to realism yet it needs a bit more grit to really achieve the truth it is after.  Yes, grim reality does occasionally poke its ugly head into this insulated world from time to time in the form of man-eating sharks and gun-toting pot harvesters - but the characters themselves lack psychological depth and clarity.  With rare exceptions, the people on the island seem to exist in a state of unlikely harmony, exhibiting little or none of the human conflict, personal jealousy or power politics one would reasonably expect to find in such a situation. Then when, late in the game, the film develops grand illusions of becoming a meaningful and grim look into the dark heart of madness, `The Beach' becomes both pretentious and laughable.   This is particularly the case because Richard seems to drift in and out of madness with a dexterity that would leave Sigmund Freud himself speechless and dumbfounded. 
`The Beach' may well appeal to all those viewers who found the phony, pseudo-adventure theatrics of `Survivor' realistic and compelling.  Indeed, the best part of the film is the ending when all these pathetic, craven softies from civilization, who fancy themselves rugged individualists, get their final comeuppance.  Those of us who have long ago freely capitulated to the lure of all our assorted modern amenities happily get the last laugh.",Null,21,37,30 September 2000
Fast & Furious 6," Status quo
","'Fast & Furious 6' gives the series' rabid fan base pretty much everything it could possibly wish for: an array of uber-expensive, souped-up racecars; a heavy helping of in-group camaraderie; a bunch of super-macho posturing (even from the women); a bevy of scantily-clad, slow-motion groupies; a moderate dose of tough-guy sentiment (nothing too girly though); a smidgen of comic relief; a raft of ear-piercing gun battles and, of course, the series' patented trademark, a whole mess of turbo-charged chase scenes.The plot - since contractual obligations demand there be one, I suppose - involves our favorite band of car racing outlaws (Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, et. al ) coming out of 'retirement' in various foreign lands to help Dwayne Johnson's DSS agent take down an international heist gang in exchange for full immunity for the crew back in the States. There's a lot of talk about 'the family' and much romantic palaver between Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, but that's basically just filler between all the spectacular (if scarcely plausible) race sequences - which is as it should be when you're fast and furious.'Fast & Furious 6' ends with one of those 'don't try this at home' provisos, which in light of the recent tragic fate of series star Paul Walker, seems more vital and relevant than ever (not to mention ironically prescient).

Scary Movie 2," more vulgar than funny
","'Scary Movie 2' may well be one of the crudest, raunchiest and most vulgar comedies ever aimed at an essentially mainstream audience. This sequel to the original box office smash has a great deal of energy but little else to recommend it. The first film, though hardly a model of tasteful restraint, at least managed to be clever and witty from time to time. This version is a farrago of dirty jokes revolving around disgusting bodily functions and perverse sexuality - neither of which I have a particular problem with, but the least we could demand from such an assault is that the jokes themselves be funny. Unfortunately, most of the humor is executed in such a strained, over-the-top style that all the effort is visible right up there on the screen - the death knell for any truly effective comedy. At its narrative core, the film is a parody of all those 'Haunting'-type movies in which some carefully selected people are gathered together in a haunted house by a sinister doctor intent on conducting some diabolical experiment. Along the way, the filmmakers poke fun at 'What Lies Beneath,' 'Invisible Man,' 'The Exorcist,' 'Poltergeist,' 'Charlie's Angels' and an assortment of other well-known flicks. The fact that 'Scary Movie 2' is aimed at a young teen audience should certainly give the parents of America pause. Although this film probably doesn't visualize anything most of these youngsters haven't articulated amongst themselves already, discriminating parents should at least be aware of the graphic nature of most of the material (if they have to pare this down for network television any time soon, there will be five minutes left of the movie). Almost inevitably - as is the case with most of these scattershot-type comedies - 'Scary Movie 2' manages to elicit a few genuine laughs with its antics - just not enough to make the film really worth recommending.",Null,1,2,19 September 2004
Pan's Labyrinth," somewhat less than the sum of its parts
","One of the cardinal rules of any good fairy tale is that, no matter how fantastical it becomes, it must make sure to keep one foot firmly planted in reality so that the story can more easily connect with the audience. In the case of 'Pan's Labyrinth,' however, that foot may be so firmly planted in the real world that it actually prevents the movie from cutting loose and soaring into the stratosphere of imagination and enchantment in the way we wish it would.The movie takes place in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War that has left Franco in power and bands of defeated Leftist rebels hiding out in the Iberian countryside. Eleven-year-old Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother to the estate of Captain Vidal, a vicious fascist who, in a clever bit of fairy tale role reversal, plays the part of the evil stepfather of the story. As Vidal busies himself with hunting down the pesky Communist outcasts, Ofelia discovers herself drawn to a strange alternate universe, unbound by the laws of nature, which frequently opens up for her to enter and to which she alone seems privy.There's no denying that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is an extremely well made movie, miles above the average American fantasy film in terms of both sophistication and vision. Director Guillermo del Toro has fashioned a dark, violent, exquisitely realized world filled with secret passageways and awe-inspiring creatures to which Ofelia periodically retreats in an attempt to escape the even more brutal life around her. Like Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz,' the lovely Ivana Baquero is the perfect heroine for the tale: wide-eyed, curious and filled with an intense longing for a world better than the one that entraps her. The movie is a miracle of art direction, set design, makeup and special effects, and it boasts some of the most dramatic use of sound this side of 'Das Boot.' Yet, for all its good points, 'Pan's Labyrinth' winds up disappointing us a bit in the end. For much of its running time, the movie seems to be operating in two largely different spheres - that of reality and that of fantasy - and having a hard time bringing the two together into a unified, coherent whole. It spends too much time chronicling the conflict between the fascist general and the rebels in the forest - which might be interesting in a different context and another movie - and not enough focusing on Ofelia's otherworldly adventures. Even though the emotional pull back to Kansas was never far from Dorothy's - and the audience's - consciousness, Baum knew enough not to spend too much actual time there. Del Toro, on the other hand, seems not to be able to yank himself from the scene, the result of which is that the fantasy world never exerts the magical force on us that it might have done had it been more thoroughly developed and taken a more center stage in the drama. The magical world in 'Pan's Labyrinth' lacks the sort of densely plotted, compelling narrative one finds in the 'Lord of the Rings' saga or 'The Wizard of Oz.' We don't get a clear picture of what the land itself is like, who its various inhabitants are, and what Ofelia's real role will be once she gets there.Thus, although the parts in 'Pan's Labyrinth' are better than the whole, thanks to the quality of the film-making and of Baquero's performance, those parts are often indelible and unforgettable.",7,11,20,24 February 2007
Blade II," monotonous action film
","I seem to recall a time, in the not too distant past, when vampire movies actually made a little effort to be scary.  This is no longer the case, apparently, for nowadays the vampires themselves have become so image-conscious that they just can't seem to be bothered with anything as mundane as conjuring up a few goose bumps for a thrill-starved audience. These modern-day Draculas need to devote all their time and energy to proving just how hip, cool and trendy they really are.  Take the bloodsuckers in `Blade II.'  In this sequel to the highly successful 1998 original, the vampires all talk in the vernacular of streetwise thugs and sport the very latest in grunge attire (one would think that there would be at least a few old timers in their ranks who would rather don a Bela Lugosi-type tuxedo than a torn jeans and leather ensemble, but, apparently, in this day and age, vampirism has become strictly a young person's game).
In this film, Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the laconic `half-vampire' who, unlike his full-blooded brethren, can move around in the daylight. Blade has dedicated his life to defending mankind against the deadly assaults from the world's apparently enormous vampire population.  However, in `Blade II,' a new twist has been added.  Blade learns that a new form of vampire  a `super vampire,' one that feeds on vampires as well as humans - has suddenly been unleashed onto the earth, and the mere conventional vampires are forced to enlist the aid of their own archenemy to help defeat this new strain.   Because `Blade II' ends up substituting action for suspense, the movie quickly turns into a monotonous series of nonstop chase scenes, gun battles and kickboxing sequences  all filmed so darkly that it is often hard to fully see what is happening on screen.  I guess we are paying the price for the success of `The Matrix,' since every action movie worth its salt now has to feature at least half a dozen martial arts sequences to make the action-hungry audience feel it is getting its money's worth.  The makers of `Blade II' also rely so heavily on gross-out effects and state-of-the-art gizmos and gadgets that they all but drain the life's blood out of the film. With no one for us to identify with or care about, there is really no way for the story to generate any actual suspense.  We sit and watch, admiring of the technical aspects of the film, perhaps, but completely unabsorbed in the action on screen.   In `Blade II,' the vampires, super-vampires and pseudo-vampires, by waging what is little more than a two-hour long gun battle, end up boring us long before the sun peeks over the horizon.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
Knocked Up," perceptive romantic comedy
","Like many romantic comedies these days, 'Knocked Up' can seem a bit schizophrenic at times, straddling a fine line between salty language, sexual innuendo and crude sight gags on the one hand, and a foursquare endorsement of monogamy and marriage on the other. The standard formula for such films is that the characters are allowed to be as promiscuous as they want to be in the early stages of the drama provided they see the error of their ways and settle into responsible domestic conformity by the time the closing credits come rolling by.'Knocked Up' goes a step further than most films in this genre by turning this theme - which is usually more implied than stated - into the very cornerstone of the movie itself. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is a socially backward, unemployed, loser stoner who has a drunken one-night-stand with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful, up-and-coming reporter for the E Channel. When, in the stone-cold sober light of early morning, Alison sees who exactly it was she had sex with the night before, she essentially brushes Ben off, never expecting to really have to deal with him ever again. Fate, however, has other plans, as she soon discovers that she is pregnant with Ben's baby. Will Ben do the right thing by giving up his nerdish bachelor ways to marry Alison and be a true father to his child? Will Alison overcome her initial repulsion to discover the true Ben and start a family with him? Even though the answers to those questions are never much in doubt given the nature of the genre, the movie has a great deal of fun getting to those answers..This is writer/director Judd Apatow's highly anticipated follow-up to the wildly popular 'The 40 Year Old Virgin,' a film that most people seemed to enjoy more than I did. For despite some fine performances and some very funny moments, 'Virgin' often seemed weighed down by both the implausibility of its premise and its dogmatic adherence to the overused 'Pygmalion' formula. Luckily, 'Knocked Up' starts right off the bat with a more believable and compelling premise, which allows the audience to more clearly identify with the characters and their situations. What separates 'Knocked Up' from so many other generic romantic comedies is that Apatow has a sharp ear for the way people in the real world actually speak. The lines are not only incisive, witty and sophisticated, but they are also what we would expect to hear coming out of the mouths of individuals caught in their particular situations. He makes us laugh at all the foolishness, foibles and insecurities we ourselves are prone to as we cope with the often maddening complexities of human relationships. Apatow also has a rare gift for making even the secondary characters compelling and interesting. Thus, even though Ben and Alison are the primary focus of the movie, Alison's uptight sister, Debbie, and her beaten-down husband, Pete, are fully fleshed-out figures as well. And even though Ben's loser roommates come across as fairly stereotypical zonked-out geeks and nerds, at least they are given some very funny one-liners to deliver as commentary on the main action.However, all is not mere fun-and-games in this film. Some of the fight scenes, for instance, are surprisingly raw and cutting in their no-holds-barred brutality and frankness, and many in the audience may find themselves squirming uncomfortably in recognition of things that they themselves have said or done in the heat of anger. On a more upbeat note, Apatow also has a knack for inserting up-to-the-minute pop culture and movie references into the dialogue without making it feel desperate or forced. This gives the movie an enjoyably contemporary, 'with-it' quality - although one wonders how far that may go towards limiting the shelf life of the movie in the long run, and how dated it may appear to audiences catching it on some cable station a decade or two from now.Apatow is also to be commended for building his romantic comedy around a less-than-hunky male lead (although he doesn't have the nerve to go for a Plain Jane equivalent for the distaff side of the equation). It also helps that Rogen and Heigl are so utterly endearing in the roles of Ben and Alison, and that they receive such fine support from the likes of Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and many others, including a handful of recognizable celebrities who make cameo appearances playing themselves.It's true that the movie runs out of steam a bit along the way and overstays its welcome by about a half hour or so, but given its broad canvas, 'Knocked Up' feels more expansive, comprehensive and fully baked than your average cookie-cutter romantic comedy. It's also a great deal more fun.",8,1,5,2 June 2007
Megamind," Villain as hero
","The blue-skinned, bulbous-headed, shape-shifting, malapropism-spouting space-creature known as Megamind (Will Ferrell) prides himself on being the baddest bad guy around. His arch nemesis Metro Man (Brad Pitt), also a creature from beyond this world, is a squeaky-clean, universally beloved superhero who literally walks on water and keeps thwarting the plans Megamind has for ruling Metro City (which he mistakenly pronounces 'metrocity'). When Megamind, much to his own surprise actually, manages to do away with Metro Man in a contentious battle-to-the-death, he begins to realize that being a villain isn't all it's cracked up to be without a worthy hero to call an opponent. Thus, Megamind hatches a plot to clone another Metro Man figure out of some remnants of the dead hero's DNA. But Megamind gets more than he bargained for when his creation comes to life.Though 'Megamind, ' directed by Todd McGrath, has the distinction of being one of the only family-oriented animated films ever to feature a bad guy as its main character, the movie may be too cerebral and esoteric to completely enthrall children and too undisciplined and gimmicky to appeal all that much to adults. Still, the movie has a clean, sparkling look, filled with a whole host of futuristic devices in the foreground and stunning cityscapes in the background, and it moves fast enough to keep its audience focused on the screen for the duration. It also features the voice of Tina Fey as the Sweet Polly Purebred-type TV news reporter who is a constant bone of contention between Metro Man and Megamind - and Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller add their own vocal support in minor but key roles. And the script by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons contains an interesting subtext about the rewards and sacrifices that come with being both a hero and a villain, a subtext that brings an added dimension to the movie.",7,3,4,27 November 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," perfect vehicle for Burton and Depp
","The story of Sweeney Todd is what Charles Dickens might have come up with had he used Jonathan Swift's 'A Modest Proposal' as his source of inspiration. Of course, in a Dickens version, all those who found themselves on the wrong side of Todd's razor would be venal exploiters of the poor and working classes who clearly deserved the fate that befell them. In Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of the story, however, people of virtually all social categories and walks of life get tossed indiscriminately into the meat grinder, in as grim a spectacle of democratic equanimity as we've encountered in quite some time. For this is a tale of a man who allows the desire for vengeance to so completely overtake him that he quickly turns from being a righteous avenging angel seeking justice for himself and his loved ones to a maniacal serial murderer who kills for the sheer sake of killing (with a little culinary treat thrown in as a side benefit).Benjamin Barker starts off as a good-natured barber living with his impossibly sweet wife and brand new baby daughter in 19th Century London. When a corrupt judge who has designs on Barker's wife throws the young man into prison on false charges, Barker transforms into a gloomy and bitter man, determined to exact his revenge on the individual who ruined his life, drove his wife to suicide and has made Barker's now-teenaged daughter an object of his unwanted, lascivious advances. On his arrival back in London once again a free man, Barker changes his name to Sweeney Todd and resumes business in the barber shop located above Mrs. Lovett's thoroughly unhygienic meat pie emporium where the cockroaches barely outnumber the raisins in the recipe. Eventually, the two entrepreneurs hit upon a scheme to systematically slice the throats of Todd's customers, then add the bodily remains to Mrs. Lovett's list of secret culinary ingredients.With 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,' director Tim Burton has finally found the material he was born to make. Dark as well as surrealistic, morbid as well as operatic, 'Sweeney Todd' perfectly fits the Tim Burton style and temperament, and, indeed, the filmmaker has taken full advantage of the opportunity afforded by the property, allowing his imagination to run wild in the areas of art direction, set decoration, costume design and makeup. Yet, while this is a beautifully crafted film from a technical standpoint, Burton never allows the visuals to overshadow the storyline or the characters.'Sweeney Todd' is clearly not intended for all audiences. It is certainly a different kind of musical, pitch-dark and violent and with no real choreography to speak of. And any hopes for a sentimental, happily-ever-after resolution are washed away by the sanguinary nature of the scenario and a closing shot that is literally a tableaux steeped in blood. Yet, there is one element that makes it all connect with audiences, and that is Johnny Depp's performance. Depp could not have found a role more perfectly suited to his demeanor and talents than that of Sweeney Todd. Never before has his brooding intensity and expression of wild-eyed mania been used to more impressive effect than it is here. He makes a character whom it is often very hard to like into a person the audience can feel for and care about, no small feat in light of the many reprehensible actions he performs on screen. Depp also does a more-than-adequate job with Sondheim's challenging tunes, especially given the actor's clearly limited range as a singer.Depp gets strong support from Helena Bonham Carter as his pasty-faced, death-hued partner-in-crime, Mrs. Lovett, while Sasha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman bring subtle shadings to their otherwise hiss-able villains.",8,1,2,7 January 2008
Blades of Glory," moderately amusing dopey comedy
","In 'Blades of Glory,' Will Ferrell and John Heder play two rival figure skaters, Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy, who are permanently banned from the sport when their gold medal tie results in a fisticuffs melee on the arena ice. After the men go their separate ways for awhile, Jimmy learns of a loophole in the rules which would allow them to return to skating but only if they compete in the doubles category. Even though the two men hate each other with the heat of a thousand white-hot suns and they would be the first all-male duo in the history of competitive skating, Chazz and Jimmy agree to bury the hatchet and take a stab at mounting a comeback. The fact that the two of them are complete opposites in terms of demeanor and style - Jimmy is a cupie-faced innocent while Chazz is a swaggering macho man, both on the ice and off - only adds to the absurdity.'Blades of Glory' never aspires to be anything more than a dopey, crowd-pleasing, mainstream comedy, and, as such, it generally hits the mark. It's true that it runs out of comic steam from time to time and that it is more amusing when the two men are arch rivals than when they are the best of friends, but there are enough laughs to make the film decent fun for the not-too-critical viewer. Ferrell and Heder make an enjoyable comic team, while acting stalwart Craig T. Nelson provides just the right balance as their winning-obsessed coach. As the evil, self-absorbed sister-and-brother duo determined to sabotage the boys' chances, Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, fine comic actors under most other circumstances, are burdened here with having to bring to life two overly broad stereotypes. Despite their talents, that effort ultimately exceeds their grasp.Special note should be made of the amazing CGI work, without which this film could never have been made. Even though we know none of these actors could possibly be doing any of these skating moves in real life, we are thoroughly convinced of its verisimilitude for the duration of the film. And the movie does a nice job lampooning all the snazzy graphics, corny biographical features, and sappy, self-important commentary that have become a staple of modern TV sports programming.",6,5,9,7 October 2007
The Polar Express," beautiful images, uneven story
","'Polar Express' is an animated film version of the beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. In order to give the film a true 'storybook' look and feel, the filmmakers used real life actors, then digitally altered them to make them appear more like animated figures to help them blend in with the backgrounds. The result is a frequently dazzling, though often strangely creepy work, depending upon the individual scene.The movie tells the tale of a boy who is just beginning to question the existence of Santa. One Christmas Eve, while he is lying awake mulling over his dilemma, a mysterious train magically appears in front of his house, carrying with it an enigmatic conductor who bids him enter. Torn between his dual impulses towards both doubt and curiosity, he ultimately hops on board, only to find it filled with other specially selected children all on their way to the North Pole.On the positive side, the film features gorgeously designed and lovingly detailed backdrops that transport the viewer to a genuinely entrancing world of imagination and fantasy. Director Robert Zemeckis and his many animators and visual effects specialists bring this world to life through a dazzling combination of rich colors and uninhibited movement. Any single frame of this film could be used in an illustrated version of the original text.The glorious visuals alone help the film to overcome the somewhat episodic nature of the storyline and the built-in repetitiveness that comes along with it. However, the movie runs into its greatest trouble with the look of the human characters. Although they are leagues ahead of the people in two-dimensional animation, there is a certain dead-eyed quality to them that is often disconcerting. Moreover, Santa's elves, creepy enough in close-up, look distressingly like a massive colony of swarming red ants when the camera pulls back. Thus, the movie ends up being at its weakest where it should be at its strongest - in conveying the innocent magic of Christmas. On the other hand, the final scenes posses a subtle tenderness that conveys the spirit of the season without becoming overly mawkish or sentimental about it. And Tom Hanks does first-rate work providing the voices for virtually all the male characters in the film.'Polar Express' may never achieve the classic status of the best holiday films, but some of its images will make it worth re-visiting every few seasons.",7,3,7,4 December 2005
The Town," a potent mixture of crime procedural and human drama
","Based on the novel by Chuck Hogan, 'The Town' is a superb drama set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, a neighborhood in Boston that has the dubious distinction of being the bank and armored-car robbery capital of the world. Writer/director Ben Affleck plays Doug MacCray, the leader of a sometimes unruly Irish gang that routinely engages in both those activities (the other members of the team include Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Owen Burke). On one of their robberies, one of the members goes rogue by kidnapping an attractive bank manager and taking her along with them as a hostage. Although she is blindfolded the entire time and is eventually set free, several of the robbers fear she may still someday be able to testify against them were they ever to come to trial. To protect her against the more dangerous members of the group, Doug insinuates himself into her life and quickly finds himself developing a serious attraction to her.'The Town' works beautifully on so many different levels at once: as a thrilling crime-and-detection tale, a complex human drama, and a richly textured account of life in an individual neighborhood. Doug may be torn between his criminal background and the love of a good woman who offers him a chance at a better life - but that doesn't stop him from still partaking in many of the foul deeds that have come to define his life over the years. If anything, 'The Town' shows just how deeply planted are the roots that bind us to the soil (i.e., neighborhood) of our past - and how hard it is to rip ourselves free from them and still continue to flourish. In other words, it may be possible for a man to redeem himself in the eyes of God and his fellow citizens, but it may be a long and faltering journey on the way to that outcome.As a character, Claire (Rebecca Hall) is equally three-dimensional and complex. She's a decent, hardworking young woman who tends her own garden in the city and volunteers her time in helping the youth in her community. When she meets Doug, she is still traumatized by the events that have happened to her and is initially unaware that Doug had any part in them, believing him to be just an easygoing, compassionate man with whom she's falling in love. How she'll react when she finds out the truth about Doug and how that revelation will affect their burgeoning relationship provides the key emotional focal point of the drama.Running contrapuntally to the romance is the attempt on the part of the FBI, led by John Hamm (minus his Don Draper Brylcreemed hair), and the Boston Police Department to capture the band of thieves. There are moments of breath-bating suspense as the law inexorably closes in on its target, and Affleck proves once again that that much abused standby known as the 'car chase' can still be a potent storytelling device when we actually care about what happens to the characters – even those it is not always all that easy to like.",8,0,0,28 November 2011
Closer," Flawed but compelling character study
","Based on the stage play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols' 'Closer' is a generally uncompromising look at that great big messy thing we call love. The movie views romance as a kind of high stakes parlor game in which men and women jockey for positions of power, use sex and deception as weapons to annihilate their opponents or get what they want, and wind up settling for safety over passion when it's time to get on with their lives. 'Closer' also acknowledges the sad truth that, when it comes to love, we tend to want what we do not have, then lose interest once the desired object is attained.Marber has written a complex screenplay centered around four major characters. Dan is an unsuccessful novelist who meets and falls in love with Alice, a young American living in London. Julia Roberts plays a professional photographer named Anna, another American transplant, who has her first encounter with Dan when he comes to her studio to have some portraits taken of him. A mutual attraction develops between the two of them despite Dan's purported love for Alice. The fourth main character is a doctor named Larry who meets Anna and falls in love with her even though Anna's real obsession seems to be Dan.For the next couple of years, the relationships between these four characters undergo tremendous transformations, forming and re-forming, grouping and re-grouping, until even the individuals involved no longer know what they feel or who they want. All they know is that happiness always seems to be vaguely out of reach because the person each of them is involved with has either moved on to someone else or has lost interest in the relationship. The film often condenses time by leapfrogging over months and years between major scenes without a great deal of transition, forcing us to pay rapt attention at all points throughout the movie.Since 'Closer' is derived from a stage play, it's not always successful at hiding its theatrical roots. Sometimes that's a good thing as when the movie achieves a sealed-off, claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the personal drama. Like a lot of stage writing, the dialogue is often literate, sharp and insightful, but, towards the end, it occasionally feels a bit too clever and artificial for its own good. Once the characters start articulating the 'great truths' of their lives, they lose authenticity and become mouthpieces for the author. And after about an hour of watching them sabotage their own happiness and listening to them whine about their lives, your patience and empathy may begin to run a bit thin, undercutting some of the positive feelings you've developed towards the movie in the first half.In terms of the acting, three of the four leads - Law, Roberts and Natalie Portman - all deliver strong, subtle performances, but Clive Owen hits too many false notes, especially when he is called upon to emote to any great extent. Still, the others draw us into their insulated little world of drama and woe just enough to make us interested in what's taking place in their lives and damn thankful we aren't a part of it.If for nothing else, 'Closer' deserves plaudits for a clever, dead-on, hilarious and brilliantly sustained comic sequence involving internet cyber sex. That alone is worth the price of a rental.",7,2,3,4 February 2006
Shutter Island," stylistically complex, sophisticated psychological thriller
","Martin Scorsese's 'Shutter Island' is a psychological thriller done in a florid, grand opera style.Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play two federal marshals circa the 1950s who've been sent to an isolated institute for the criminally insane, run by Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the patients there, a Medea-like figure who killed her own children a number of years back. DiCaprio's character is also haunted by memories and dreams of his young wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire, and by his own traumatizing experience liberating Dachau at the close of World War II. The two investigators soon discover that everything is not quite what it appears to be on Shutter Island and that indeed something quite nefarious and sinister may be going on there.Ever the agent provocateur, Scorsese brings a healthy dose of his trademarked purple-prose filmmaking style to the proceedings. He sets his tale against a backdrop of howling winds, crashing waves and falling trees, punctuated by thundering chords pounding away on the soundtrack. It may make the movie seem preposterously pretentious at first, but we soon learn that there is a method to Scorsese's madness, as what appears initially to be gratuitous showmanship on the part of the director becomes an integral part of the work once the details of the story emerge.This theme of who-is-truly-mad-and-who-is-truly-sane in this world has been played out many times before in the movies, but 'Shutter Island' brings a level of sophistication to it that is really quite impressive. The movie keeps us guessing at every stage of the drama, with the twists and turns of the storyline drawing us ever deeper into the surrealistic, fractured world it's created for itself.DiCaprio and Ruffalo both turn in outstanding performances, but this is Scorsese's movie all the way.",9,0,3,16 June 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Solid entry in the series
","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a solid sequel to 2011's 'Captain America: The First Avenger.' Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with an entertaining plot that offers a modicum of character development to go along with all the mayhem, chase scenes and CGI effects that are the life's blood of the modern- day action flick.In this installment, '40's relic Steve Rogers (he even has an all- American name) is still adjusting to life as a superhero in the 21st Century when he discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D, the fictional spy agency, has been infiltrated and taken over by a traitorous organization known as HYDRA. Rogers has no idea who he can and cannot trust as he endeavors to save S.H.I.E.L.D. and the world at large from certain destruction. Enter the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), a manufactured super being similar to Rogers, who just happens, however, to fight for the other side.As the granite-jawed, all-American-boy hero, Chris Evans possesses a good-guy earnestness and a disarming charm that fit the character nicely, and he's matched by such stellar figures as Robert Redford, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, etc.It's all in good fun, and the time passes quickly, but, when all is said and done, you probably won't remember much about 'The Winter Soldier' a few hours after it's over. But, then again, that's not exactly what modern Hollywood blockbusters are all about anyway.",7,0,1,12 January 2015
Capote," chilling and complex psychological study of the author
","With his trademark curling lisp, high-pitched, squeaky voice and flamboyant mannerisms, it would have been easy for almost any actor to build a portrayal of Truman Capote on a foundation of studied mimicry and impersonation alone. But in 'Capote,' Phillip Seymour Hoffman goes far beyond surface recreation, plumbing the core of the inner man and bringing him to palpable life on the screen. Most eloquent in his silences, Hoffman mesmerizes us with his performance.Based on a book by Gerald Clarke, 'Capote' deals with the period in which the author struggled through to create his literary masterpiece, 'In Cold Blood,' a book he claimed as the beginning of a whole new genre of writing, the 'nonfiction novel.' In November 1959, a family of four was brutally slaughtered in their Kansas farmhouse by two drifters in search of cash, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith. Capote, a successful writer and bon vivant of the literati set in Manhattan, found himself drawn to the case, venturing to the heart of the country with his lifelong friend, Harper Lee (author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'), to interview the accused killers and try to make some sense of the whole thing. The screenplay by Dan Futterman zeroes in with stiletto-like precision on the complex relationship that develops between Capote and Perry, the more 'sensitive' of the two killers. Capote is drawn to this man in so powerful a fashion that even he is unable to figure out exactly why. Is it because he senses something in Perry's past that reminds him of his own (both suffered from abandonment issues), thus creating a sort of kinship between them? Is he attracted to Perry sexually and romantically? Or is he being subtly manipulated by an evil man who senses in this author a weakness and vulnerability he can exploit for his own nefarious purposes? It is a tribute to the complexity of the film-making that we feel that none of these and all of these possibilities may be true simultaneously. And what is so great about Hoffman's performance is that he builds on this ambiguity. We are never entirely sure if Capote truly cares for Perry or if he is merely using him to get what he needs for the book. And the way Hoffman plays him, Capote never seems quite sure either. He is obviously drawn to Perry with a sort of grim fascination, as anyone might be who encounters a person whose actions are as inexplicable and yet larger-than-life as Perry's. But when it all becomes too much for Capote and he begins to ignore Perry's demands for attention, is he doing so out of indifference or disgust at himself for being so drawn to this person in the first place? Is this fascination with Perry revealing dark truths about Capote that the man himself is unwilling or unable to acknowledge? The film never answers those questions - as well it shouldn't.Clifton Collins Jr. is also very powerful as Perry, providing the sensitivity and charisma the character needs to make the story convincing. In a rich performance as Harper Lee, Catherine Keener serves as the moral center of gravity to which Capote must continually return in order to finish his work and maintain his grip on reality.In his first non-documentary film, Bennett Miller demonstrates remarkable control as a director. His spare film-making style perfectly reflects not only the harsh Midwest setting but the chamber-like drama that is unfolding within it. It is a very 'interior' film, and Miller is not afraid to linger long on his scenes, allowing the actors free rein in establishing their rhythms and building the drama.Although come Oscar night, I will be rooting for Heath Ledger to take home the trophy (I believe his performance in 'Brokeback Mountain' is the high point of acting in recent times), I will certainly understand it if the Academy chooses to honor Hoffman's work here instead. It would definitely be my second choice.",9,2,2,14 February 2006
Life of Pi," A Boy and His Tiger
","In an era in which CGI has made it possible to put virtually anything one could possibly imagine up on the screen, it has become harder and harder for a filmmaker to make an audience's collective jaw drop. But Ang Lee achieves just that with his adaptation of Yann Martel's 'Life of Pi.' This movie truly has what we, in modern parlance, like to refer to as 'the wow factor,' simply because it is unlike anything we've seen on screen before. 'Life of Pi' is a surrealistic tale of survival about an Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with nothing but a ferocious Bengal tiger for a companion. The first thought we are struck with while watching 'Life of Pi' is that this movie would have been impossible to make prior to the CGI revolution in filmmaking. With so many movies abusing that technology for sheer commercial ends, it's gratifying to see a film actually using it for thought-provoking and artistic purposes (see also 'Gravity'). At times brutally harsh while at others gloriously lyrical, the movie combines the realistic with the fantastical, the rational with the spiritual - all to illustrate the many disparate and dichotomous elements that, working in glorious chaotic tandem, make up this vast expanse we call the universe. The first third of the film focuses on Pi's life before the shipwreck. Pi (short for Piscine, which as it shares a rather unfortunate homonym in English, causes Pi at a very early age to abbreviate it) is innately curious about not only the world around him but the world that lies beyond the physical. He is so fascinated with the spiritual, in fact, that he has adopted the tenets of each of the world's major religions and made them his own. Pi lives with his stern, skeptical father (Adil Hussain), his more open-minded, sympathetic mother (Tabu) and his somewhat less curious older brother (who is played by three different actors in various stages of the story). One of the prime exhibits in the zoo owned by Pi's father is a Bengal tiger that, through a bureaucratic fluke, has been tagged with the name Richard Parker, a prosaic moniker hardly befitting the king of the jungle. When the father decides to sell the zoo, the family, along with the animals, board a Japanese freighter to begin a new life in Canada (the plan is to sell the animals once they get there). On the way, however, tragedy strikes when the ship sinks in a tremendous storm, sending all but Pi and Richard Parker to the bottom of the sea. 'Life of Pi' is the story of their survival.Alternately awe-inspiring, heartbreaking and suspenseful, the screenplay by David Magee expands on the 'circle of life' metaphor to explore how each element of nature is interlocked with every other element, with each action prompting a reaction unto infinity. Though natural born 'enemies,' Pi and Richard Parker achieve a kind of symbiosis, ultimately forced to rely on one another for survival (RP for his physical needs, Pi for his spiritual), and in so doing, they achieve a harmony that puts them in sync with the rest of the universe. Yet, for all its pantheistic elements, the movie doesn't over-sentimentalize nature, doesn't shy away from showing us the unthinking brutality that is also a part of that universe, underlined by the fact that living creatures can survive only by feeding on other living creatures. It certainly never downplays the very real danger Pi is in at every moment from his feline companion. This cat may be animated, but he's no cartoon character.Never one to shy away from a challenge, Lee won a second Best Director Oscar for his work here, and someday the Academy might even see fit to bestow a Best Picture award on him as well (he was certainly robbed of that honor for 'Brokeback Mountain'). As he has done many times before, Lee demonstrates a total command of the medium in 'Life of Pi.' There's a hallucinatory quality to much of the film, as Pi frequently experiences preternatural visions that transcend the confines of the material world and of rational thought, leading him to a oneness with God. Suraj Shama has been handed the challenge - one might almost call it the burden - of carrying large stretches of this film entirely on his own, with only a CGI effect to interact with. It is a challenge the gifted young actor is more than equipped to handle and he fulfills it beautifully.Though the movie throws the audience for a loop at the end, making us question the veracity of the tale the adult Pi (Irrfan Kahn) is relating to the writer (Rafe Spall) who hopes to chronicle the experience, no one can ever convince the true believer in all of us that this is anything other than a love story between a boy and a tiger. After all - thanks to the technical wizards who've made it all possible - we've seen it with our own eyes.",8,2,5,15 March 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," Better than '12' but not by much
","After the disastrous 'Ocean's Twelve' was released in 2004, I ended my review by asking, 'We've already had this saga sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?' Well, at long last that question has been answered, and it has come in the form of a good news/bad news proposition. The good news is that 'Ocean's Thirteen' marks at least a slight improvement over the previous installment (but then again that's not a particularly high bar to jump over). The bad news is that it is ONLY a slight improvement.For this latest entry in the series (which began, it is easy to forget, with the genuinely entertaining 'Ocean's Eleven' in 2001), writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and director Steven Soderbergh have at least had the wisdom to return the boys back to Las Vegas, not traipsing all over Europe on what seemed like a high-cost junket for a bunch of already overpaid actors. In 'Thirteen,' Danny Ocean and his 'crew' of con artist buddies rally behind the ailing Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), who has just been cheated out of his portion of a brand new casino by his unscrupulous partner, the allegorically named Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who wants the business all to himself. The plan is to sabotage Bank's place so it will go belly-up even before it officially opens.At the beginning, 'Ocean's Thirteen' seems like it might turn out to be a fairly decent caper movie, but after about the first half hour or so, a noticeable fatigue and lethargy begin to creep into both the writing and the performances. Very quickly, the plot runs out of steam and we come to sense that the all-star players - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner et. al.- are merely going through the motions, hanging around just long enough to cash their hefty paychecks before heading off to worthier, more artistically rewarding endeavors. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Cheadle, in particular, have been striking out on such interesting career paths of late, that, perhaps, their hearts just aren't in this saga much anymore. And without their acting like it matters, it makes it hard for us in the audience to feel that any of it matters either.'Ocean's Thirteen' may be better than 'Ocean's Twelve,' but it's still a largely half-hearted effort that does little to burnish the reputation of the original movie. I think it's long past time to float this series out to sea so that its fine actors can continue pursuing more worthwhile projects. We would all benefit from a win-win proposition like that.",5,13,27,10 June 2007
Lost in Translation," moving mood piece
","As its title suggests, Sofia Coppola's Oscar-nominated film is the story of two lost souls who find one another in a foreign-speaking land (in this case, Tokyo).  Bob Harris is a world-famous action movie star from the 1970's who is in the city to appear in a commercial for a Japanese whiskey. Charlotte is a young American woman in her twenties who has flown over from the states to be with her photographer husband while he does a shoot for a Japanese rock band.  Staying at the same luxury hotel, Bob and Charlotte eventually cross paths and find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another.Bob and Charlotte are both introspective people, fully convinced that the lives they are leading are sterile, stifling and meaningless.  Bob, despite the obvious `success' he's enjoyed  fame, fortune and family  finds himself burned out and deeply dissatisfied with virtually every aspect of the life he's built for himself.  When we first meet Bob, he appears to be a man dragging himself through life, utterly unable even to feign the interest and enthusiasm that the people he meets expect of him.  In a brilliant performance, Bill Murray conveys this weary cynicism more through his body language and facial expressions than through words.  Indeed, it isn't until much later in the film  after he and Charlotte have found one another and have begun to communicate on an intimate level  that Bob is able to even halfway articulate what it is he is going though.  Charlotte, despite the fact that she is essentially just starting out in life, feels equally lost and rudderless, finding herself married to a man with whom she has little in common both intellectually and emotionally.  As Charlotte, Scarlett Johansson provides a poignant portrait of a woman who has so much to offer if only someone would be open enough to accept it.  Luckily for her, Bob comes along to do just that; unluckily, he is no more `available' than she is to make this relationship work.As conceived by Coppola, `Lost in Translation' is more than just a tremendously sad evocation of unrequited love.  It is a heartrending tale about what happens when we not only marry the wrong person but end up meeting our soul mate when it is obviously too late to do anything about it. As a writer, Coppola has opted to convey more of her meaning through silence and indirection than through dialogue and drama.  As a director, she often lingers for long periods of time over seemingly irrelevant details of daily life, creating a lyrical, poetic mood that enhances the melancholic tale she is telling.  The film sometimes feels more undernourished and less revelatory than it might have been had she allowed her characters to open up to each other in a more fully articulate way.  We sometimes feels as if Bob and Charlotte have so much more to say to each other  and to us - that we end up growing strangely impatient.  But then we just have to remind ourselves that that is the point Coppola is setting out to make here, that we can't always find the words to express the complexity of our feelings adequately and that sometimes we just have to find that special person who can understand us at our deepest level even without words.  That is what Bob and Charlotte do for one another as epitomized by that whispered bit of dialogue at the end that the audience is never intended to hear.  What Bob says to Charlotte we never know, but, whatever it is, it has meaning and significance only to her.`Lost in Translation' demands a certain level of patience from its audience. But anyone who can appreciate a subtle, beautifully acted and exquisitely directed character study should find many subsurface rewards in this film.",Null,0,1,11 April 2004
Tangled," refreshingly 'square' and straight-forward fairy tale
","The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, 'Tangled' is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to 'reality' than most such films – if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose 'Prince Charming' comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside. But 'Tangled' doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena. There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary). The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world. Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this naïve but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years. So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.'Tangled' is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick – indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room – and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust. The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy. The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, 'Tangled' doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness. It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements. It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence. And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.",Null,1,2,1 August 2011
Pacific Rim," Retro monster movie
","Guillermo Del Toro's 'Pacific Rim' proves yet again that what was one generation's B-movie castoff is another generation's A-movie mainstay. It's a throwback to all those monster movies that played mainly in drive-ins in the 1950s - only here the budget is huge and the stop-motion and claymation techniques used back then have been replaced by the latest in CGI technology.In this 21st Century edition, giant creatures have broken through the earth's crust and are stomping all over many of the planet's largest coastal cities (see 'Godzilla,' 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms,' 'The Giant Gila Monster,' etc. for the roots of these types of films). Humanity's response has been to create an army of giant metallic robots replete with two mind-melded human pilots at the controls (think of it as a WII version of a tank with arms and legs). Charles Hunnam, of 'Sons of Anarchy' fame, is the hotshot pilot called out of self-imposed retirement - his co-pilot/brother was lost while on a previous mission - to help rescue the world. Rinko Kikuchi is his new partner with some unresolved issues of her own to deal with. Idris Elba, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini and Ron Perlman (I guess we know what the 'Anarchy' boys were doing on their time off that year) round out the cast.The plotting is nothing to write home about, and there is way more jabbering, soul-searching and speechifying than is probably called for in a movie such as this - but the intense action scenes, bits of comic relief, and rally-round-the-flag-boys heroics help the popcorn go down smoothly.",7,2,5,11 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," not up to par but worth seeing
","Say what you will about George Lucas, you have to give the guy credit for setting himself a difficult task in `Star Wars: Attack of the Clones' (and I do mean beyond trying to deliver a film that will meet the almost impossibly high expectations of his millions of fanatical followers).   By choosing to place Anakin Skywalker front and center as the story's main focal point, Lucas does what few others in this business are willing to do  which is to risk making a crowd-pleasing epic without a likable central `hero.'  After all, since this film is a prequel and not a sequel to the original trilogy, we all know that this brooding young man will end up turning into the irredeemably evil Darth Vader.  Of course, Luke Skywalker fulfilled the requirements of conventional hero for the original series and even Han Solo, though he was a bit of a rogue and a scoundrel, always allowed his virtuous side to break through when the chips were down.  Anakin, though, for all his internal struggles in this film, is predestined to go over to the Dark Side (certainly in the next installment).  The pre-knowledge the audience is privy to from our acquaintance with the later chapters gives the film a kind of poignant sadness at times - or at least it would if Lucas had done a better job as both writer and director in bringing it out.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written that Anakin comes across as little more than a petulant, peevish, moony-eyed schoolboy most of the time  hardly either the `greatest Jedi knight' we keep being told he has the potential to become nor the future Hitlerian dictator we know he will one day be.   His romantic, puppy-love interludes with Senator (former Queen) Padme Amidala are embarrassing at best.  We have indeed come a long way from the fun love triangle involving Luke, Han and the feisty Princess Leia.In fact, that seems to be the basic trouble with this film, as it was with the previous installment, `The Phantom Menace.'  Somewhere along the way, someone drained all the FUN out of `Star Wars.'  The first three films seemed so fresh, so adroit, so light on their feet.  The prequels, though they are not without interest, feel bloated, top heavy and devoid of any real conviction or excitement.  One cannot fault Lucas, I guess, for becoming overly fascinated with his matted backgrounds, computer graphics and special effects, but it does no one any good to have all that hardware whirling by in the background when the action in the foreground is so banal and uninteresting.  Even the set pieces here  a flying car chase through a crowded city that defies all known laws of physics, a cluttered battle scene that takes place in a gladiatorial stadium  don't get the adrenalin pumping in the same way that the space battles in the original `Star Wars,' the race through the forest in `Return of the Jedi' or even the pod race in `The Phantom Menace' did.  And I will reiterate a comment I made three years ago about that last film.  Why is it that, in a movie with `Star Wars' in its title, are there virtually no outer space battle scenes in this picture?  Is that really too much to ask?A few other problems plague the picture.  R2D2 and C-3PO, whose one-sided bantering lent such charm to the original films, have become virtual extras in the story by this time.  And since the rest of the script is so entirely witless, the few moments they have together stick out too much as obvious (and not very effective) attempts at comic relief.  No longer do these two uniquely nonhuman characters feel like an integral part of the action.  Even worse, the once endearing Yoda, with his annoyingly inverted sentences and his never-ending string of sanctimonious pearls of wisdom, has, quite literally, become this movie's Jar-Jar Binks (who does appear but in a much more limited role).  The acting by Hayden Christensen (Anakin), Natalie Portman , Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor (a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and who is going to believe that McGregor will mature to become the distinguished Alec Guiness?) is serviceable at best, as the performers have been put there basically to deliver the stilted dialogue and serve as foreground for the upstaging special effects.So, after all these complaints, is `Attack of the Clones' worth seeing? Surprisingly, the answer is `yes' and it really has nothing to do with the special effects.   The reason this film is worth seeing is because Lucas has undertaken to pull off something virtually unique and unprecedented in modern cinema.  He is attempting to tell a complete story over the span of six different movies.  Even when we can see how the film isn't coming together the way it should, we can't help but plug into the narrative development itself.  Because we know how it will all end up, we want to see how the missing pieces of the puzzle will fall in to place to give us the complete, total picture.   So even if each individual installment doesn't exactly carry us away, there's enough interest in the vision itself to keep us coming back for more.",Null,72,137,12 June 2002
Corpse Bride," a Tim Burton charmer
","Much like his 'Nightmare Before Christmas,' 'Tim Burton's Corpse Bride' uses state-of-the-art, stop-motion animation to tell a cheerily morbid story - this one showcasing bodies in various stages of decomposition larking it up in a musical comedy underworld. Think of it as a role-reversal version of the myth about the god Hades and his reluctant bride Persephone, kidnapped from the land of the living.Victor is a painfully shy and awkward young man who is about to enter into an arranged marriage with an equally shy young woman, coincidentally named Victoria (even more 'coincidentally,' the movie takes place in the Victorian Era). However, on the eve of the wedding, Victor finds himself 'married' to a dead woman whose frozen corpse he stumbles upon in a nearby forest. Victor is immediately whisked away to the Land of the Dead, where skeletons sing and dance, and where maggots and black widow spiders offer words of advice for the benighted newlywed couple. Much of the story involves Victor's desperate attempts to flee the scene and Victoria's concomitant efforts to bring him back to the land of the living.The talented animators have had a bit of ironic fun with the visual palette, bathing the scenes set in the real world in a ghostly-blue pallor, while bringing the Land of the Dead to life with vibrant, splashy colors. In both foreground and background, the animation has a clean, uncluttered look, with the exaggerated, severely angular features of the characters providing amusing commentary on their personalities. The dialogue is clever, sharp and witty, and the musical numbers have a buoyancy and bounce to them that help keep the morbid subject matter palatable for all but the very youngest audience members. The film is also blessed with fine voice-over work from the likes of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, and horror movie veteran Christopher Lee.'Corpse Bride' is a relaxing, unfrenetic treat for those on all points of the life/death continuum.",8,0,2,24 September 2006
Gone Baby Gone," a nifty directorial debut
","Working for the first time on the opposite side of the camera, actor-turned-director Ben Affleck has delivered a solid, if imperfect, crime drama entitled 'Gone Baby Gone,' based on the novel by Dennis Luhane. Ben's brother, Casey, and Michelle Monaghan play a pair of missing-persons investigators hired to find a little girl who disappeared from her Boston home three days earlier. Her mother is a foul-mouthed coke-fiend who is not very particular about the company she keeps and who seems strangely reluctant to cooperate with the authorities working to get her daughter back. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris co-star as cops whose involvement with the case grows ever more complicated as the drama unfolds.Affleck co-wrote the screenplay - his first since 1997's 'Good Will Hunting' - with Aaron Stockard, and together they have gone beyond the surface simplicities of the standard whodunit to probe the ethical complexities that are, for good or for ill, an integral part of law enforcement work. As the central character, Patrick is continually confronted with the moral relativism of his actions, be it in negotiating with child abductors without police authority, shooting down an unarmed pedophile who has just murdered a child, or going after a crooked cop who reveals a legal indiscretion to him in a moment of drunken confidence. Yet, when all the murky details of the case are finally revealed, Patrick realizes that, when it comes to doing what's 'right,' even he has a line over which he will not cross - even if, by refusing to do so, he loses the one thing that matters the most to him in his life. And yet there's still no guarantee that the choice he makes will be the best for all concerned in the end. As an over-arching theme, the film also points out how difficult it is to raise children in a world in which so many adults are themselves deeply troubled and maladjusted.As director, Affleck has extracted fine performances from every member of his large cast, most notably Casey, Freeman, Harris, Amy Madigan and Amy Ryan, impressive enough to have earned an Oscar nomination for her work here.The multi-layered script occasionally defies credibility and pushes too hard to make its points, but 'Gone Baby Gone' is at least willing to explore the ethical uncertainties of life and to honor that stance by ending on a note of ambivalence and ambiguity. That alone makes it a rarity in commercial American film-making.",7,3,5,5 April 2008
American Hustle," A full-throttled tribute to the American con man
","For all that we revere the farmer, the soldier, the statesman, the law enforcer, the clergyman and the hero, we Americans have always reserved a special place in our hearts for the outlaw, the gangster, the card shark, the con man, the hustler. It's a trait that goes to the very core of our identity as a people, a crucial element in our national mythology. From our most humble beginnings, hustling has stood as a time-honored tradition, a value 'as American as apple pie.' Indeed, whole genres of literature and popular entertainment have sprung up around this idea. And for all the lip service we pay to what we righteously call the Protestant work ethic, we can't help but subversively admire those who are able to achieve the American Dream through less noble and less arduous means. Indeed, our history is populated with scoundrels and scalawags we've somehow managed to turn into folk heroes, and, while today our grifters operate on Wall Street or in corporate boardrooms rather than on the western frontier, the characteristics are the same: they're all just slick-talking manipulators operating outside the system and making a fortune while doing so. And, oh, how we love it! Unless it's being done to us, of course; then, we're not so crazy about it, which is why when it involves political corruption, the fleecing of us the taxpayer, we may no longer be quite so forthcoming in our admiration.'American Hustle' is David O. Russell's smart and savvy tribute to the con artist in all of us. He and his co-writer, Eric Warren Singer, have chosen to set their work in the 1970s, an age of polyester suits, ultra-wide lapels, porkchop sideburns and bad comb-overs. It was also host to one of the biggest financial scandals of the modern era, Abscam, an FBI sting operation that resulted in the convictions of a mayor (played by Jeremy Renner), a United States Senator, six United States congressmen and an assortment of state officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania on bribery and corruption charges. 'American Hustle' starts off by declaring that 'SOME of this actually happened,' and, indeed, the movie's often absurdly comic, larger-than-life quality makes us question the veracity of a good deal of what we're seeing. But no matter because the movie is clearly more a study in character and theme than it is a factual recounting of the events of history (which explains why all the names have been changed to protect the guilty).And what a cast of characters Russell has gathered for our amusement and delectation! A paunchy, balding Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld, a natural-born shyster who's found a way to earn money (to the tune of $5,000 a crack) through offering loans to people desperate for cash, money these down-on-their-luck individuals will never see. Irving is married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), a scatterbrained chatterbox who is so high maintenance that Irving is forced to live on his own even though he supports her and her son, whom he's adopted as his own. Irving's problem is that for all his willingness to rip off people, he may be just a tad too softhearted to be very lucrative at his profession. Enter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), an attractive woman with some secrets of her own who becomes Irving's business partner and lover. They're not in the business very long before undercover FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) blows the lid off their operation, offering them immunity from prosecution if they'll help take down some bigger fish. Richie is, in many ways, the focal point of the screenplay, a preening, overreaching lawman whose main concern is netting as many big fish in his net as he can in order to make a name for himself. It's not long before tensions are developing among the three principal players, and much of the movie's fun derives from watching these two outsized figures, who find their value in being able to manipulate others to their own advantage, engaging in what amounts to a giant pi**ing contest over strategies, ethics and even Sydney herself.As with any good tale of con artists and grifters, 'American Hustle' beguiles us with the spectacle of hustlers hustling the hustlers, since, as we're told, hustlers are ultimately just people 'doing what they need to do to survive.' It gets to the point that not only do the characters not know who's telling the truth and who's playing whom, the audience can't tell either. And even though Richie thinks he's shrewd enough to play in the big leagues, he soon learns the bitter lesson that, when it comes to hustling, amateurs should never mess around with professionals.Russell employs a dizzying whirlwind technique - consisting of fast-paced storytelling, energetic camera-work and editing, snappy dialogue, crisp narration - that puts one in mind of 'Goodfellas.' Even when the action is set in an enclosed room, which is often the case, the movie never stops moving. It's alive and we're alive to it. Moreover, the spot-on period details, especially the uber-tacky 70s fashions, only serve to heighten the absurd humor of the tale we're watching.'American Hustle' boasts one of the finest acing ensembles we've come across in quite some time, which, in addition to the main cast, includes Louie CK, Michael Pena and Robert De Niro, among others.There's a manic energy in both the performances and the filmmaking in 'American Hustle' that perfectly reflects the soul of a nation founded on youthful vigor and anti-establishment rule-breaking. And indeed it's that uniquely American spirit of anarchic iconoclasm that Russell captures to such memorable effect in 'American Hustle.'",9,1,3,17 April 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," impressive film-making, less impressive storytelling
","'The Bourne Ultimatum' has much in common with this summer's earlier 'Live Free or Die Hard,' in that both movies are essentially one long chase sequence involving a protagonist whose ingenuity and grace under pressure are surpassed only by his seeming indestructibility.This is the third, and, we're told, final installment in the Robert Ludlum series about Jason Bourne, the agent programmed by a rogue element of the CIA to be a mindless killing machine. In 'Ultimatum,' Bourne, who has since long disowned his professional-assassin past, is being hunted down by the Langley operatives who created him in the first place, believing that they risk career-destroying exposure and criminal prosecution if they don't silence their boy permanently.Acclaimed director Paul Greengrass ('Bloody Sunday,' 'United 93') brings his considerable film-making skills to bear on the material, sprinting headlong right out of the starting gate and giving us few moments to catch our breath on the way to the finish line. By employing a jittery hand-held camera throughout, Greengrass intensifies the chaotic nature of many of the scenes and brings a spontaneity and immediacy to the action on screen. In addition, the razor-sharp editing and plethora of locales (the film makes stops in New York, Moscow, London, Paris, Madrid, Tangier and a number of other cities) add greatly to the movie's effectiveness. We're never in any one place for very long, and a mere blink of an eye or lapse of attention at any crucial moment could spell disaster for anyone dutifully trying to follow the plot.I must say, however, that for all the tremendous movie-making pyrotechnics on display here, the movie suffers a bit from distention and overkill in the long run. After about the first half hour or so of nonstop action, the movie becomes a trifle wearying and redundant. We find ourselves wishing it would actually put the brakes on for a few moments so we could get to know the characters to a greater extent. For almost the entire movie (until the final sequences, that is), Bourne is little more than a nonstop running machine, dodging bullets, karate-chopping bad guys, jumping off rooftops, crashing through windows. All this is very impressive as stunt work and action-figure hoopla, but a little of it goes a very long way after awhile.Matt Damon has become very comfortable in Bourne's skin over the course of the three movies, but the role doesn't provide him with a great deal to sink his teeth into in terms of genuine acting. David Strathairn, Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Albert Finney also do well in their assorted roles, but like Damon, they are limited by the restrictive nature of the film-making.Thus, for all its big-name, high-priced talent, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is more a director's picture than an actor's, making Greengrass the default star of the movie when all is said and done. And if we are ultimately left wondering if it may not be just a bit too much of a good thing, well, the goodness itself is treat enough these days, I guess.",7,3,7,6 August 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," Shakespeare adulteration
","'10 Things I Hate About You,' a modern updating of 'The Taming of the Shrew,' demonstrates what happens when filmmakers drain The Bard of his poetry and language and cater to modern moviegoing tastes - they reduce a classic work to yet another in a long line of lamebrained, dull teenagers-on-the-make tales featuring a contingent of adolescents who would never be caught dead reading Shakespeare.In this version, set in contemporary Tacoma, Kate and Bianca have been converted into two squabbling high school sisters, the former a notorious harridan from whom all peers flee and the latter a virginal beauty whom all the boys covet but who is laboring under her father's edict that she not be able to date until her older sister does.That Shakespeare's plot fails to translate to modern times goes without saying since the father's obsession lacks the kind of logic the original author provided.  In the original's historical context, the cultural tradition dictating that the older daughter must marry before the younger one rings true as a motivation for the story's narrative underpinnings. Here, since the fathers seems mostly concerned with the - real or imagined - horrifying consequences of his daughter's dating, his decision to allow Bianca to date only if Kate does seems counterintuitive and counterproductive.  It seems hardly sensible that his fears would be allayed by having TWO daughters out on the town with boyfriends.All this could be forgiven if the filmmakers had provided a screenplay with even a smidgen of cleverness and humor.   In fact, the first ten minutes hint at a reasonably astute satire of modern high school life, particularly in the character of a sex-obsessed female counselor who provides the only moments of amusement in the entire film.  Since she us dropped almost immediately from the action, all we are left with is the spectacle of a group of shallow teenagers laboriously executing the mechanics of a once irresistable plot.  Kate is nowhere near the terrifying shrew nor her pursuer the arrogant rogue they need to be to be comically effective.  They come across as only slightly askew, but basically ordinary, adolescents who lack the charisma to make them even slightly interesting.'10 Things' proves yet again that Shakespeare without Shakespeare results only in a bareboned plot devoid of wit and artistry.",Null,0,0,14 February 2000
Rush," Strong performances and race sequences
","Ron Howard's 'Rush' relates the true-life tale of two Formula One racecar drivers - Britain's James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda - whose intense rivalry helped to define the sport in the 1970s.As befits a pair of arch competitors, Hunt and Lauda were polar opposites in any number of ways. Hunt, the 'bad boy,' was a hard-drinking, hard-living international playboy-type with a crappy marriage - his supermodel wife (Olivia Wilde) was having an affair with no less a figure than Richard Burton - while Lauda, the 'good-boy,' was a work-obsessed, early-to-bed homebody with a terrific marriage to a beautiful and devoted woman (Alexandra Marlena Lara). Hunt was also devilishly handsome and sexy, a fact which garnered him a bevy of overeager groupies and celebrity status, while Lauda, with his self-described 'rat face,' barely registered as a blip on the cultural scene. The movie chronicles their relationship - defined by incidents of high drama and near-tragedy - both on and off the track, with each developing a grudging admiration for the other's doggedness, tenacity and undeniable devotion to the sport over time.The movie has a number of things going for it. The screenplay by Peter Morgan doesn't dumb down the characters or overdramatize the conflict between them. In addition, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent as Hunt and Lauda, underplaying rather than grandstanding their way through their roles. And, of course, it goes without saying that the racing sequences, though truncated at times, plunge the audience right into the heart of the action in a way not available even to real-life fans of the sport, be they sitting in the stands at the track or watching at home on TV. Once again, the intimacy of the medium of film makes itself felt in a major way.Why then the overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the film, the nagging sense that, for all the quality elements that have gone into it, the movie just doesn't amount to all that much in the end? Could it be that, when all is said and done, the story really isn't all that interesting or the characters all that compelling (Hunt's wife is given particularly short shrift in the screenplay)? Whatever it is, there is something about 'Rush' that keeps us from giving ourselves over to it completely. So just enjoy the performances and car races and don't expect a life-altering experience from Howard's latest feel-good opus.",7,2,3,5 October 2013
Notting Hill," trite romantic fable
","'Notting Hill', the latest venture from the makers of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', lacks the charm and depth of the original film, which, in retrospect, stands as one of the top romantic films of the 1990's. 'Weddings' soared on the basis of three essential elements:  the sharp, offbeat wit of its screenplay, the likability of its subsidiary characters, and, most important, the emotional and psychological depth of the Hugh Grant character, who, in many ways, functions as the archetype of all those modern men caught between love for a good woman and the paralyzing fear of committment.  'Notting Hill' unfortunately approaches romance from a far more conventional direction, settling for wish-fulfillment fantasy rather than a more acerbic reality.  The trouble with 'Notting Hill' begins, in fact, with its initial premise of the world's most beautiful movie star falling in love with a handsome but essentially average Joe bookseller in the Notting Hill section of London.  By creating such an unlikely setup, the film loses the emotional connection with the audience so essential to the success of a romantic comedy.  The contrivance at the movie's core makes it impossible for us to really identify with the principals and, thus, the movie devolves into little more than an exercise in play acting for the two leading characters.  This is a shame because Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are certainly two of the world's most attractive and likeable stars and this role obviously seems tailor made for Ms. Roberts who carries with her the built-in aura of all that goes into being a world famous media celebrity. Perhaps, the stars are let down by the film's screenplay, which seems strangely devoid of real imagination and wit and the pace of the direction, which often allows comic lines to fall flat.  A scene, for instance, in which Grant, through a convoluted set of misunderstandings must interview other actors in Roberts' new movie, is deadly in its lack of comic freshness and timing.  The same can be said of a poorly written dissertation on the comparisons between some food Roberts is eating and Mel Gibson's much-exposed derriere.  Moreover, unlike in 'Weddings', the secondary characters, who surround Grant and provide him with a running commentary of advice, come across as bland and witless and subtract rather than add spice to the central romantic proceedings.  'Notting Hill' does provide a few scattered moments of genuine humor and charm (Grant's being forced to attend a movie wearing his prescription deep sea goggles is hilarious), but the film often relies, stereotypically,  on sappy  montage sequences accompanied by a song-filled soundtrack rather than incisive dialogue to achieve a romantic mood.  'Notting Hill' simply does not ground its characters enough in reality to make us care.",5,0,4,26 July 1999
The Aviator," flawed but compelling look at a visionary
","It ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius - just ask Howard Hughes, the renowned millionaire, who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes, to make the biggest movies, and to become the richest man in the world. That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend. For Hughes also suffered from the demon of mental illness, which manifested itself in chronic obsessive/compulsive behavior, a neurotic fear of germs, and acute paranoia. Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger-than-life figure in 'The Aviator,' a high-flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses - and whose legend lives on today.John Logan's script spends virtually no time on Hughes' youth except for a brief prologue which shows Howard's hypochondriac mother planting those seeds of fear in his tender psyche that would haunt him the rest of his life. The story proper begins with Hughes' efforts to produce what would turn out to be the most expensive film ever made up to that time, the war epic 'Hell's Angels,' a non-studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of movie-making and aviation. If nothing else, Hughes thought BIG, and his capriciousness and profligacy, as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making, also spilled over into the realm of aviation, as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost. His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill-fated Spruce Goose, the largest airplane ever made - and one whose airborne career lasted exactly one flight.Logan and Scorcese also focus on the personal side of Hughes' life, concentrating specifically on his tumultuous affairs with Katharine Hepburn (brilliantly played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well - so well, in fact, that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.As director, Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film, soaring highest - as is appropriate, perhaps - in the aviation sequences. The first hour, in particular, moves at a breathless clip, as he weaves the various strands of his epic - yet, at the same time, intimate - story into a cohesive whole. If the truth be told, at 170 minutes, the movies does run a little too long and it sags a bit in its middle section. However, as Hughes begins to unravel psychologically - at one point locking himself in a screening room barely clinging to what little remains of his sanity - the movie becomes a sad but fascinating study of a man in the throes of a nervous breakdown. The scene in which Hepburn converses with Hughes through a locked door, pleading with him to let her come in and help him, is heartbreaking in its poignancy.As Hughes, Leonardo Di Caprio carries the weight of the film on his frail shoulders, and he does a superb job, hitting new dramatic heights in the scenes in which he both falls to pieces psychologically and rises confidently to the challenge of clearing his good name in a senate hearing. Alan Alda is also terrific as the senator from Maine determined to get Hughes to sell TWA to Pan Am in order to achieve a monopoly on international flight carriers in the future.The first half of the 20th Century provided fertile soil for individuals like Hughes to grow and flourish, men with the brains to see what the future offered and the guts to reach out and go for it. The film captures the era beautifully through the art deco architecture, the dazzling sets and costumes, and a nostalgia-evoking soundtrack overflowing with familiar period standards.What Scorcese undoubtedly understands is that Hughes continues to cast a spell over the general public not because of what he accomplished as a moviemaker, an inventor, an entrepreneur, but because he did all those things battling demons that made him both inexplicably strange and, at the same time, more recognizable as a human being with weaknesses very much like ourselves. It is this paradox that creates the kind of mystery a figure needs if he is to remain a source of fascination long after his death. In honor of that spirit, 'The Aviator' doesn't unravel the enigma of Howard Hughes; it deepens it. And that is as it should be.",8,3,4,24 August 2005
Oblivion," Visually impressive sci-fi drama
","It's 2077. The Earth has been rendered virtually uninhabitable after an alien invasion that took place sixty-some years earlier. Even though the humans technically 'won' the war (using nuclear weapons which pretty much wiped everything out), most of the planet's survivors have long since moved to a colony on one of Saturn's moons, leaving behind only a handful of people, like Tom Cruise's Commander Jack Harper, as part of the ' mop-up crew,' whose job is to repair drones and to make sure the alien remnant known as the 'scavengers' don't interfere with the continued production of fusion power from the oceans that is needed by the humans living up on Titan.Complications arise when Jack rescues a female flight commander (Olga Kurylenko) whose vehicle is shot down by Scavs. Trouble is he thinks he may remember her from a time before he had his memory 'swiped' as a needed security precaution given the sensitive nature of his job and mission.'Oblivion' is a visually elegant film from director Joseph Kosinski, adapted from his graphic novel, which was never published. The screenplay by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn has some of the opaqueness of 'Inception,' as, like a master card dealer, it shuffles the planes of reality to the point where the characters and the audience can't quite make out what is actual and what is a mixture of dreams, memories and alternate realities. Similarly, the filmmakers seamlessly blend CGI action, metaphysics and a surprise, turnabout ending to create a subtle, thought-provoking vision of technology in a post-apocalyptic future.'Oblivion' takes its time telling its story, more concerned with mood and impression than with whiz bang action and plot details - though it doesn't stint on either of those two things either.Andrea Riseborough, Melissa Leo and Morgan Freeman round out the cast, though Freeman's character feels more plot contrivance than genuine person.'Oblivion' isn't a completely satisfying movie in the final analysis, but its effective balance of tone and glorious visuals makes it worth watching.",7,0,0,8 January 2014
American Pie," crude but amusing sex comedy
","If you are a person easily offended by a film dedicated primarily to the glory of teen sex, you may well view 'American Pie' as yet another in a long line of cinematic harbingers of the collapse of western civilization.  If, however, you remember adolescence as essentially a period of unending coitus interruptus, you may well find yourself engrossed by this amusing, though admittedly crude, series of sexual and scatalogical gags woven around a plot involving the desperate attempts of a quartet of last semester seniors to lose their virginity on the fast approaching sexual armageddon known as 'prom night.''American Pie' gleans most of its comic energy from its outrageous examination of the crazy and innovative extremes desperately horny teens will go to in order to experience the thrill of sex in lieu of the real thing.  An attractive, game cast helps to mitigate the crudity of many of their actions and the filmmakers' lighthearted tone encompasses the characters in such a cloak of affection that the audience identifies with, rather than condemns, their antics.As meager compensation for the moralists among us, the film does heavily promote the use of condoms and comes up with even more creative prophylactics for those times when a partner is not available.'American Pie' is certainly not for every taste and there are those who would argue that it serves a less than salutary purpose as a guide for already sex-obsessed teenagers.  Be that as it may, the film provides a fair number of hearty chuckles for those of us who can find humor in a group of backward youngsters experiencing the frustration and desperation we have all, at one time, experienced.I do have one troubling question though:  why do none of these characters, whenever they are involved in a potentially compromising position, ever lock a door?  The answer, I suppose, is obvious for, if they did, at least half the film's biggest laughs would become impossible to achieve.  For this film, at least, such a suspension of disbelief may be a prerequisite.Be forewarned but enjoy!",Null,41,65,1 February 2000

","'Burn After Reading' shows what happens when a couple of bungling amateurs attempt to beat the big boys of the C.I.A. at their own game.Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand are the D.C.-based health club workers who stumble across a computer disc that they believe contains top secret, classified information. In actuality, it's the property of Osbourne Cox, a C.I.A. analyst who has recently been let go from the agency, and who is composing his memoirs as an act of retaliation against his former bosses. Tilda Swinton plays Osbourne's harridan wife who's having an affair with a tic-plagued, exercise-obsessed married man embodied by George Clooney. The discovery of the disc leads to a roundelay of false assumptions and comical misunderstandings all wrapped up in an intricately plotted scenario dripping with situational ironies.'Burn After Reading' is Joel and Ethan Coen's darkly humorous follow-up to their Oscar-winning masterpiece, 'No Country for Old Men,' a grimly serious work that took little time out for comic relief (and earned them bucket loads of awards for doing so). This new film finds the boys back in the more familiar terrain of 'Fargo' and 'The Big Lebowski,' where the laughs outnumber the gasps by a healthy margin. 'Burn After Reading' certainly adheres to the customary Coen Brothers formula where a heightened quirkiness and a deliberately disjointed storyline are coupled with sudden flare-ups of violence and the unexpected deaths of major characters.While the refusal to follow a predictable narrative path is one of the chief selling points of any Coen Brothers film, the fact of the matter is that, in the case of 'Burn After Reading,' the script probably could have used a few more revisions to bring the disparate elements more satisfactorily in line with one another. Too often it feels as if the movie itself is rambling around pointlessly, without any clear direction or purpose. For one thing, many of the scenes that might have served as the connecting tissue holding the various story lines together seem to have been - perhaps deliberately - left on the cutting-room floor. We're laughing along with the craziness all right, but we're also hoping against hope that the filmmakers will find a way to bring it all together in the end. Instead, what we get is a sit-down synopsis of events that is probably the least successful finale of that sort since the closing scene in 'Psycho.' For if viewers think they were frustrated by the truncated ending in 'No Country,' they ain't seen nuttin' yet.The best thing about 'Burn After Reading' is the delicious performances from a cast that any director would give his eyeteeth to work with. Malkovich, McDormand, Clooney, and Swinton all manage to define their characters through individualized quirks without ever going over the top and reducing their characters to caricatures. But it is Pitt who steals every scene he's in as the nerdy, hyper kinetic doofus who fancies himself a double-naught spy fit to stand alongside the James Bonds of the world. Pitt has rarely been this winning.Now don't get me wrong. 'Burn After Reading' is a frequently hilarious film that is vastly preferable to all those cookie-cutter comedies that can be found habitually ensconced in the neighborhood multiplexes. But it's not exactly prime Coen Brothers either, and, for that reason, I have to make this only a halfhearted recommendation. But, then again, even inferior Coen Brothers is better than no Coen Brothers at all.",7,20,40,13 September 2008
The Bourne Identity," superficial spy flick
","What exactly is it that determines the moral code by which a person lives? And can the very same person be a cold-blooded murderer in one incarnation, then become a virtual humanitarian when all memory of that previous life somehow gets wiped away?  These provocative questions are raised, though never adequately explored, in `The Bourne Identity,' a fairly standard man-on-the-run spy thriller based on the best selling novel by Robert Ludlum.  Written by Tony Gilroy and directed by Doug Liman, `The Bourne Identity' tells the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA hit man who has been suffering from amnesia ever since his bullet-riddled body was plucked floating out of the Mediterranean Sea.  Initially unaware of his secret agent status, Jason - together with Marie, a young woman he picks up in Switzerland and hires to drive him to Paris - tries to piece together the clues to his identity and purpose.  Essentially we are back in old Hitchcock territory, where the story's hero is being chased by all sorts of nefarious figures even though he himself has not a clue as to who these people are or why it is they are so anxious to put an end to him.`The Bourne Identity' might have been a more interesting film had it attempted to explore some of the more subtle implications of its morality play situation.  Instead, the filmmakers concentrate almost exclusively on the superficial aspects of its spy thriller premise.  There are brief flashes where Jason ponders the deeper issues of a troubled conscience, but they are quickly thrown over for the usual cat-and-mouse accoutrements of this odd-man-out scenario.  And, frankly, despite the novelty of the Paris setting and some impressive stunt and action scenes scattered along the way, nothing in the film really much engages the audience's sympathy or interest. Matt Damon does a solid job conveying the underlying sweetness of Bourne's character, but nothing in his demeanor or behavior can convince us that he is a government-generated killing machine.  What's missing from this story is any attempt to show how this character, whom we have come to view as comassionate and loving, could ever have done the things he is said to have done. That analysis would have lent the film that extra bit of depth it so sorely lacks in its current form.The film is at its most interesting when it shows how Bourne, because he is himself a product of CIA training, can use the very tools his mentors gave him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and even outwit the professionals at their own game.  The film features a relatively impressive car chase through the streets of Paris (though it pales in comparison to the ones in `Ronin').  But I can't believe that filmmakers are STILL using that old standby  the one where some workers just happen to be transporting a piece of glass across the street just so the careening cars can come crashing through it.  I thought that one had been put to rest, finally and irrevocably, 30 years ago in `What's Up, Doc?'",Null,1,2,30 June 2002
Hot Rod," enjoyably wacky comedy
","For a fun, mindless and relaxing good time, check out 'Hot Rod,' one of those goofy, lowest-common-denominator slapstick comedies which won't do much to raise your IQ or make you a better person for having seen it, but which just might put a smile on your face - provided you're not too highbrow to give yourself over to it, that is.Prime credit for the movie's success goes to SNL's powerhouse-of-energy Andy Sandberg, an immensely gifted physical comedian who doesn't get nearly the recognition he deserves for his talents. Here he plays Rod Kimble, a developmentally-challenged wannabe daredevil who fancies himself the heir apparent to none other than the late great Evel Knievel himself. To that end, Rod devises elaborate stunts - usually involving jumping over large objects or a series of large objects on his secondhand moped - that invariably lead to his winding up face down in the dirt or smashed headlong into some massive immovable object. But you just can't keep a good stuntman down and, after every fall, Rod picks himself up, dusts himself off and, disregarding his bruised body and bruised ego, heads on to his next venture, eternally optimistic that this time he will be able to complete his mission. Rod's goal is to impress not only the pretty girl who lives next door (Isla Fisher) but his mucho macho step dad (Ian McShane) who thinks Rod is just a mollycoddled, cape-wearing pantywaist, undeserving of his respect.Joining in the fun are fellow SNL stars, Bill Hader and Chris Parnell, along with 'Arrested Development''s Will Arnett and acting legend Sissy Spacek to class up the joint.Replete with corny '80s-style musical montage sequences and some mighty impressive stunt work, 'Hot Rod' will win you over with its good-natured dopiness and charm. And the good feeling that it engenders may even be worth those couple of brain cells you're sure to lose in the course of watching it.",7,1,5,24 July 2009
The Italian Job," slight but moderately entertaining caper film
","Urbanites who spend half their waking hours stuck in non-stop traffic jams may get a kick out of `The Italian Job,' in which one of the characters finds a way to bring almost the entire metropolitan LA area to a gridlocked standstill.  The film, a remake of a 1969 vehicle starring Michael Caine, is an entertaining caper tale that provides all the elements we expect to find in a film of this sort: the elaborate heists, the high tech gadgetry, the inevitable double crosses and the benevolent thieves who would give Mother Teresa a run for her money in the pure-of-heart sweepstakes.  The story begins in Venice, Italy, where a cadre of thieving buddies, under the tutelage of one Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), pulls off an amazing heist of some gold bars valued at $35 million.  But before any of the guys have had a chance to even cash in and enjoy their stake, they are betrayed by one of their own  Steve, played by Edward Norton  who kills their mentor, the beloved John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and leaves the rest of the gang for dead in a near-frozen river in the snowy Alps.  A year later, thawed out and not a little peeved at the turn of events, Charlie and the rest of the crew discover Steve's whereabouts in Los Angeles and plot out an enormously complicated scheme to exact their revenge - more for their slain buddy, of course, than for the gold itself.The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, but `The Italian Job' boasts enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time.  The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict inherent in the narrative setup.  We want to see more confrontation scenes between the `good' thieves and the one `bad' one, but Steve rarely spends any screen time confronting his pursuers.  That's why the best scene by far is one that occurs in a restaurant when the antagonists DO actually square off against each other fact to face.  The overall lack of interaction between these two forces might have been less noticeable and detrimental had the filmmakers come up with any internecine conflicts among Charlie and the other members of his brigade.  Instead, these guys all get along so swimmingly with one another that all we are really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they play themselves out.  The men have no disagreements, no differences of opinion and no conflicts of interest within their happy little group, a defect in the screenplay which robs the film of some of the tension it might otherwise have had.Still, `The Italian Job' is a smooth, fairly standard, fairly enjoyable little time waster with a few good chases both on land and sea, some deft acting and a smattering of amusing one-liners to keep us from walking out of the theater.  That one forgets the movie the minute one leaves the theatre is pretty much par for the course for this genre anyway.",Null,6,12,1 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," truly great in parts, but way too long
","I will be the first to admit right up front that I am not exactly the greatest fan of all those medieval-type fantasy novels of which J. R.R. Tolkien's trilogy entitled `The Lord of the Rings' is the standard-bearing prototype - so I readily concede that there may be people out there far better equipped to do critical justice to this three-hour, multi-million dollar special effects extravaganza than I am.  Yet even I can perceive that the makers of this first installment (subtitled `The Fellowship of the Ring,' after the first novel in the series) have done a fairly creditable job in transferring the author's vision to the big screen.  In purely visual terms, the film is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The superb art direction, set decoration, make up, and state-of-the-art special effects all combine to bring Tolkien's many fantasy worlds to eye-popping fruition on film.  The film is, quite literally, a nonstop visual feast. 
If only that were enough.  The question is, though, how far can visuals alone take one  especially when that journey requires three hours of one's valuable time to arrive at the destination?   For once one strips `The Lord of the Rings' of its dazzling look, is there anything left to engage the mind beyond what the eye can take in?  There, I'm sorry to report, is where the movie begins to enter problematic and treacherous waters.  Although the writers do a decent job at keeping the details of the story relatively coherent, those of us unfamiliar with the Tolkien canon may find ourselves having trouble coping with the profusion of bizarre character, place and clan names that come whooshing by us at lighting speed  names that the trilogy's devotees probably know better than those of their own kith and kin.  Luckily, director Peter Jackson keeps the film packed to the rafters with high-energy action sequences (guaranteeing that 14 year-old boys will be enraptured from beginning to end)  although this over-reliance on pandemonium and hubbub seems to have the strangely paradoxical effect of actually slowing the film down in the long run.  Nonstop action can become just as boring as nonstop inaction (a fact of physics Hollywood seems never to fully comprehend) and, in the case of this film, the lack of variation in the pacing results in a certain dramatic monotony taking hold after awhile. For the sad truth is that, despite all the beauty of background and setting that the film offers, `The Lord of the Rings' ultimately emerges as little more than a three-hour chase story  and, unless you are a Tolkien-devotee from way back, you may find yourself growing restless not long after the novelty of the film's look begins to wear off.  Unfortunately, `Lord of the Rings' lacks the three crucial elements that any film presumptuous enough to demand three hours of our time needs:  narrative complexity, thematic depth and character development, none of which this film provides in any appreciable quantity.Perhaps the root of the problem lies in the fact that we can't help but feel that, in some ways, George Lucas beat these filmmakers to the punch twenty some odd years ago when he released a similar type work called `Star Wars.' The advantage Lucas had, however, is that he carried his mythmaking and empire-building into the hipper, postmodern realm of intergalactic space adventure.  `The Lord of the Rings' can't help but feel a trifle retrogressive as a result.  Even more important is the fact that, in Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, R2D2, Darth Vader etc., Lucas created well-delineated, finely developed characters that far outshine in personality and depth the assortment of hobbits, dwarves, wizards and monsters that adorn this film.  Nowhere do we find, for instance, the kind of complex and amusing love-hate chemistry that defined the relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia.It is probably unfair to even make a comparison between `The Lord of the Rings' and `Star Wars' and I certainly concede that there is a tremendous amount to admire in this new film.  It is quite obvious that `The Lord of the Rings' has been made by master craftsmen who clearly love the book they are adapting and are trying to make the best damn movie they can in its honor.  I seriously doubt that any amount of carping by a holdout like myself will have the slightest effect on the enjoyment millions of Tolkien fans will derive from seeing their beloved work so beautifully wrought on screen.  Still, someone has to be a minority, dissenting voice  if only to speak for all the non Middle Earthers out here who find that Hobbits, as befits their size, should probably be taken in relatively small doses.",Null,1,1,28 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," Finding Neo
","'The Matrix Revolutions' is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were 'The Matrix' and 'The Matrix Reloaded.' In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.Of the three films, 'Revolutions' is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting. What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities. The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for 'Revolutions,' which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme. In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled 'Finding Neo'). The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by. Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from 'Revolutions' - which we did from the two previous 'Matrix' films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which 'Revolutions' very nearly is. Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into. Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is.",Null,193,308,26 September 2004
Man of Steel," Not your father's Superman
","Comic book purists may well balk at 'Man of Steel,' writer David S. Goyer and director Zack Snyders's radically re-imagined take on the Superman story (with a hefty assist from Christopher Nolan). However, those who think that even a universally recognized slice of Americana could use a little updating every now and again will find much of interest in this new film.This one starts off fairly traditionally, as we are once again shown the origin story of the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes who would later grow up to be the super hero famous for being faster than a speeding bullet and being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. We see again how, with their planet Krypton on the verge of being blown to smithereens, the baby's parents (Russell Crowe and Ayulet Zurer) launch him into outer space in a ship programmed to land on a planet called Earth, where he will go on to be found by a loving Kansas couple (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and raised as their very own. And how this baby, dubbed Clark Kent, will grow up to be a man with super powers that he first will not understand but over time will come to accept and to use for good by rescuing the innocent and vanquishing the evil.But after following the conventional path for a time - and just as you're settling in for a rehash of the famous 1978 movie version of the same material - 'Man of Steel' suddenly verges off onto radically untrod territory. First of all, this Clark Kent is a much more psychologically conflicted creature than we are used to finding in depictions of Superman, who hitherto has been one of the sunnier, less brooding and more well-adjusted figures in the superhero canon. This Clark is genuinely struggling with his place in the universe, wondering why it is that he is 'different' from all the other kids and why his parents keep telling him not to let anyone else know of all the marvelous feats of strength and heightened perception he is capable of doing. Even more radically, the Lois Lane (Amy Adams) in this version, while still a reporter for the Daily Planet, is onto Clark right from the start and, in fact, pursues him to find out what it is that makes him tick. No double identities, no coy disguises for this couple (if one could ever call a pair of black-rimmed glasses and a fedora a disguise).'Man of Steel,' in many ways, plays less like a superhero movie and more like an alien-invasion thriller, as Clark is reluctantly forced to reveal his identity and special powers to the world when one of the survivors from Krypton, the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon), comes to Earth, all guns a-blazing, intent on making it his own.At first, Henry Cavill seems a bit stiff as the man of steel (pardon the pun), but, as that moniker suggests, that might not actually be a bad thing, for it underlines the earnestness and innate goodness of the character in a way that a more emotive performance likely would not.I must also add that among recent blockbusters, 'Man of Steel' easily has the most spectacular special effects and the most exciting action scenes, bar none. Yet, Snyder clearly has his sights set higher than a mere comic book fantasy. The flashback scenes, recalling Clark's childhood spent on the farm, have an almost Terrance Malick, impressionistic feel to them, as they evoke the poetic richness of nature. This enhances the mythic quality of the storytelling and neutralizes the cheesiness that is regularly so much a part of the genre.To those who complain that this is not the Superman story they've known and grown up with, I'd respond by asking what the point would be of remaking an already overly familiar film if you're just going to do the same old thing anyway. This is the only movie in a long time that actually managed to surprise me, and I think that in an entertainment industry in which safe and boring imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - and often the surest route to box office success - I admire artists who are not afraid to shake things up a bit, even if it winds up upsetting a few people in the process. So sit back and enjoy this new take on a famous story - just know ahead of time that this is NOT your father's Superman. And I say 'Amen' to that.",9,10,16,16 December 2013
Radio," sentimental but hard to resist
","'Radio' tells the true life story of a high school football coach who befriends a severely mentally retarded young man (whom they nickname 'Radio' because he loves listening to the radio so much), lets him hang out with the team, and, thereby, changes not only the boy's life but the lives of just about everyone in the South Carolina town in which they live. When Radio's behavior on the sidelines begins to serve as a distraction during the games, some of the less sympathetic, die-hard football fans of the town make an effort to downplay his role or eliminate his presence altogether.Set in 1976, 'Radio' is a thoroughly predictable, sentimental heart tugger that will have people either gagging on the syrup or crying in their popcorn. For all its heavy handed manipulation, however, 'Radio' turns out to be a pretty decent little film due, primarily, to the superb performances by Ed Harris and Cube Gooding Jr., and to the fact that the movie doesn't overplay its hand as often as it might. In fact, it wisely underplays much of the conflict, allowing the moments of quiet subtlety to predominate. As played by Harris, Coach Jones is a solid, decent, caring man who can't help but give his love to a fellow human being who needs it. Harris' soft-spoken strength makes us believe in the goodness of the man. The film does an effective job conveying the incredulous reactions of many of the otherwise well-meaning town folk, as even Radio's own mother asks Joe why he is doing what he's doing. The scenes between Jones and this woman, lovingly played by S. Epatha Merkerson, are some of the finest in the film. The movie also isn't afraid to confront the issue of whether the people of the town - and that includes Jones himself - aren't actually being patronizing towards Radio in their treatment of him, and whether he isn't more of a 'mascot' for the team than a bona fide member. Gooding Jr. slips effortlessly into the role of Radio, making him a compelling figure even though he has virtually no lines of dialogue in the movie. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the caring but nervous school principal who sees Radio's presence on campus as a potential threat to student safety, but who has enough faith in Jones to give Radio a chance to prove himself. It's nice to see Debra Winger in a movie again, although her role as Jones' ever-patient, ever-supportive wife, doesn't give her much room to strut her stuff as an actress. There's no denying that 'Radio' is a humanity-of-man type film that could easily set the teeth on edge with its Goody Two Shoes philosophy of life. Be that as it may, 'Radio' turns out to be a warm, uplifting film that even Scrooge would probably like.",Null,61,71,15 November 2004
28 Weeks Later," Decent, if unspectacular, zombie flick
","'28 Weeks Later' picks up where '28 Days Later' left off. The virus that's been turning ordinary human beings into flesh-eating zombies has apparently run its course, the infected humans have all died of starvation, and Britain is slowly being repopulated with many of the citizens who fled the scene at the start of the epidemic. One of those returnees is Don (played by Robert Carlyle), who is suffering from survivor's guilt after leaving his wife in a moment of panic to be devoured by the creatures. Or was she? Suffice it to say, it's hard to keep a good virus down and soon London is in the grip of a major new outbreak of the illness. Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots and MacKintosh Muggleton (what a great name!) play various characters who spend the bulk of the movie running for their lives from the menace.Zombie pictures have become such a staple of the horror movie genre that it is hard for anyone to do anything particularly novel or original with them anymore. Zombie bites human, human turns into zombie, new zombie bites another human, and on it goes ad infinitum. That scenario may have been fresh and exciting when George Romero first introduced it to the world in 'Night of the Living Dead' back in 1968, but it has been diluted through repetition and overuse ever since (partly by Romero himself with his endless, ever diminishing variations on the theme). The one innovation the original '28 Days Later' came up with was to speed up the zombies' movements so that they were no longer the lumbering creatures that anyone's 85-year-old granny could easily outrun.'28 Weeks Later' has some genuinely suspenseful moments and a nice post-apocalyptic feel in its early stretches, but, like its predecessor, it tends to devolve into a tedious shooting-gallery sideshow the longer it goes on. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's hurdy-gurdy film-making style, which is intended to replicate the chaos and pandemonium of the situation, often leads more to confusion than to clarification for the audience. Still, the movie contains a few cool plot twists and raises some thorny ethical issues, such as whether or not innocent people are to be sacrificed if that means ensuring the safety of the population as a whole. And there is certainly more than enough bloodshed and general mayhem to keep the zombiephiles among us rooted to our seats. Even the undead should have fun with that.",6,0,1,9 August 2008
Cast Away," fascinating tale of survival(spoilers)
","From such established literary classics as `Robinson Crusoe' and `Lord of the Flies' to such products of pop culture idiocy as `Gilligan's Island' and the original `Survivor,' the human imagination has been fired up by tales of ordinary folk being suddenly stranded on a deserted island and forced to survive by sheer wit, ingenuity and the unquenchable human instinct for self-preservation.   Perhaps, those of us who have been softened by all the amenities we have come to rely on to get us through our daily lives wonder if we, ourselves, could rise to such a challenge.   Whatever the underlying motivation, the lure of the theme is primal and seemingly universal, as evidenced by the recent popular successes of both TV's `Survivor' and the latest movie opus from Robert Zemeckis, `Cast Away.' `Cast Away' is a film that works on several different levels at once  but surely the most impressive is the sheer physicality of the undertaking. This extends not only to its setting but the fact that Tom Hanks, during the course of the filming, underwent a change in physique matched only by Robert De Niro in `Raging Bull.'  Even more impressive is that Hanks delivers a tour de force performance, portraying a character who, for vast stretches of the film's running time, speaks nary a word and, hence, must convey his thoughts and feelings almost entirely through facial expressions and bodily gestures.The story is a simple one:  Chuck Noland is a classic type-A FedEx exec (one wonders what tidy sum the company forked over for the benefit of this product tie-in to end all product tie-ins) who is clearly too focused on the split-second requirements of his hectic job to stop and smell the roses  or to formally propose marriage to his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt).  When his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean, Chuck, as the sole survivor, manages to wash up on a deserted island and is forced to make it on his own in this strange, forbidding world.  Zemeckis and Hanks do a remarkable job making Chuck's predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating.  We watch the step-by-step process by which Chuck attempts to bring order to his strange new existence  and the equally intriguing ways in which he attempts to cope with the mounting loneliness and solitude that will face him in the coming years if he is not rescued.`Cast Away' is filled with moments of surprising warmth and emotionality. The personal relationship Chuck establishes with a volleyball he names Wilson achieves a strange meaning and depth since it speaks to the great need we all have for companionship and love  even if we have to invest human traits into an inanimate object to get them (children, of course, do this all the time with their stuffed animals or imaginary playmates).  The finale of the film rings true as well, for we know that, in our lives, fate often intervenes in ways we do not expect and that time truly does not stand still for any of us.   The world marches on and, if, for any reason, we fall off temporarily, all we can do is to jump back on and try to catch up, painful as that may be at times.One might have wished for a bit more psychological depth to be applied to Chuck's experiences AFTER the rescue  an exploration of the stages a man caught in such a situation would go through in his re-assimilation into civilization.   But that would probably require a whole other film or at least another hour's worth of running time.As it is, `Cast Away' is gripping, moving and fascinating to watch and it is a worthy entry in a genre that seems never to lose its hold on our imaginations.",Null,0,0,9 August 2001
The Village," better than advertised
","Though it's sure not to be everyone's cup of tea, M Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' plays like a good old-fashioned 'Twilight Zone' episode all done up in period costume and expanded out to feature film length.Set in the late 1800's, the story - which plays like a cross between 'The Crucible' and 'The Blair Witch Project' - takes place in a small village that has been cut off from the outside world by strange and potentially deadly creatures who inhabit the woods nearby. These mysterious figures - referred to by the townsfolk as Those We Don't Speak Of - have made some sort of pact with the humans to the effect that they will leave the people alone if the people leave them alone. However, one individual in the town - a young man named Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) - has an aching desire to leave the village and explore the world beyond the parameters of the woods. It is that unprecedented willingness to cross the barrier and violate the pact that sets the story in motion.'The Village' is obviously intended to be an allegory about how humans use fear of the unknown to keep themselves from venturing out to worlds beyond their own, and, concomitantly, to justify hiding from the ugliness of life. The film has the stripped-down look and feel of a morality play performed on a stage whose sets are simple and stark and whose characters and dialogue are weighted down with heavy symbolic value. 'The Village' requires patience from the audience and an acceptance going into the film that this will not be a horror movie in the traditional sense - i.e. one filled with gore and grue or high-octane chills and thrills - but rather a subdued exercise in portentousness and understated suggestion. In this respect, the movie works quite well.Heavily reliant as it is on imagery and mood to achieve its effects, this is less an actor's film that it is a director's, but Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody as the literal village idiot, deliver reasonably compelling performances. But it is Bryce Dallas Howard, as a young blind woman sent into the forest on a danger-filled mission to bring help back from town, who shines in the film.Shyamalan has made quite a lucrative career out of movies that use indirection rather than explicitness to generate their suspense. That 'The Village' is the weakest of those films thus far ('The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs' are more fully realized works), doesn't diminish the fact that those willing to give it a chance may find it to be a rewarding experience.",7,1,2,22 August 2005
21," interesting story given decent treatment
","The only thing standing between 21-year-old Ben Campbell and his lifelong dream of attending Harvard Medical School is the $300,000 in fees and tuition it will cost to go there. But Ben has a special skill that might make it possible to cover his bills and then some. It turns out he's a genius when it comes to numbers, and it is this talent that brings him to the attention of Micky Rosa, Ben's professor at MIT, who has come up with what he believes is a full proof system for winning at blackjack. Rosa invites Ben to become a part of a handpicked team of similarly gifted students who are getting some extracurricular lessons in how to beat the house at 21. Ben is, at first, reluctant to sign on to what seems like a morally questionable enterprise, but the lure of easy money and the appeal to his ego finally win him over. So off to Vegas they go to put their system into play. But can a clean-cut, wholesome boy like Ben stay true to his goals and principles once he's had a taste of life in the fast lane? Based on a true story, '21,' directed by Robert Luketic, is a slick, superficial, well-oiled crowd-pleaser that holds one's attention while it's playing itself out but doesn't provide much food for thought or emotional resonance after it's over. Jim Sturgess makes for an appealing protagonist as the acceptance-craving Ben, but the real acting here is done by Kevin Spacey as the odious professor who uses blackmail and bribery to keep his minions in line, and Laurence Fishburne as a head of casino security who may turn out to be the one serious impediment to the team's success. The script fails to make the card-game esoterica comprehensible for the lay audience - we're forced to accept way too much of it on faith - but hardcore gamblers will probably be taking notes for future pointers.Plus, there's a great moment at the end that makes the whole shebang suddenly worthwhile.",6,0,1,6 February 2010
Pitch Black," mediocre sci fi entry
","`Pitch Black' is a ha'penny, two-bit science fiction film that plays like a hybrid between `Lost in Space' and the much-imitated `Alien' and `Jurassic Park' films.  In this film, a space ship carrying a cargo of commercial passengers is forced to crash land on an unidentified planet, which, although there doesn't seem to be a shred of animal life anywhere to be found, still manages to be somehow inhabited by swarms of carnivorous birdlike creatures that only come out at night.  Ask not what these animals must feed on when there isn't a crew of fleshy earthlings conveniently placed there for them to nibble on.  Such rigorous application of logic is not one of `Pitch Black's strongest selling points.Neither, in fact, is the cast of characters it has managed to assemble for the occasion.  Here we have the typical `cross section of humanity' routinely called upon to make its appearance in films of this type.  The ship's crew and passengers include two feisty young women, a hardnosed law enforcer (is he really a hero or a man with something to hide?), an effete wine-guzzling coward, an androgynous teenager (the `revelation' involving this character comes as a surprise only to the dimwitted characters in the film), a family of Muslims and a truth-seeing, muscle-bound serial killer who becomes the group's physical and intellectual mainstay. 
The story, though simpleminded and derivative of any number of other better films, nevertheless, manages to border on the murky and incoherent quite often.  We often aren't sure who is doing what or why (though, in all honesty, we don't particularly CARE either).  The special effects are generally sub par for a film of this genre and the only real attempt to create an otherworldly atmosphere consists in applying various types of light filters to the camera lens.Completely lacking in suspense, excitement or originality (although the ending has a slightly unexpected twist), `Pitch Black' is strictly one for the video graveyard.",Null,2,5,17 February 2001
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," time-marking installment
","In 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,' the penultimate entry in the decade-long 'Harry Potter' movie series (it covers only one-half of the final novel with the second half due out at a later time), things are going from bad to worse for our intrepid little band of wand-waving heroes and the people who have taught and raised them. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is running for his life from the evil Lord Voldemort, who's made it his life's mission to personally finish off the young lad, and the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by Death Eaters, who have begun a wave of persecution against all Muggle-born witches and wizards.For those who are die-hard devotees of the 'Potter' series and who have literally grown up with these characters, watching 'Deathly Hallows' must feel a bit like going to the prom in the run-up to senior graduation (an apt comparison since Harry, Hermione and Ron are now all well into their adolescence with all the teen-drama and angst that that inevitably entails). For those of us who are but casual observers of the tales, the movie feels muddled and poky, its storytelling much too esoteric and confusing and its pacing much too slow. The latter may be attributed to the fact that this is only one-half of the story, with the promise of a tighter resolution to come in the final installment. Still, that doesn't make sitting through this film any more palatable or entertaining.",5,2,3,25 May 2011
Cold Mountain," boring, meandering soap opera
","Based on the best-selling novel by Charles Frazier, Anthony Minghella's `Cold Mountain' is, like his earlier snooze-fest, `The English Patient,' one of those highbrow historical romances that only a Motion Picture Academy member could love.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play Inman and Ada, two Southerners whose budding romance is cut short when he goes off to fight in the Civil War.  Though the two `lovers' barely know one another, she spends years pining away for him, while he, eventually, deserts the battlefield in order to get back to her.  When her minister father dies unexpectedly, Ada, who has hitherto led a very sheltered life, is forced to fend for herself on the land he left her.  Eventually joining her in that endeavor is a feisty young woman named Ruby, played with a whole host of annoying, self-conscious mannerisms by the usually reliable Renee Zellweger.In ambiance and plot, `Cold Mountain' feels an awful lot like a warmed over `Gone With the Wind,' right down to the Southern-belle-forced-to-demean-herself-to-survive scenario.   The difference is that the two main characters in `Cold Mountain' are completely uninteresting as people and thoroughly unconvincing as lovers.  In a film in which the driving force is supposed to be obsessive passion, it's odd that the romance is laid out in such lukewarm and sketchy terms.  It's hard to believe that a young man would risk execution for treason trying to get back to a woman he barely knows  and it's even harder for the audience to work up much personal stake in the outcome.   Ada is like a magnet drawing Inman to her, but, for the life of us, we can't figure out the attraction.  Law does reasonably well as a sort of anti-hero version of Odysseus, but Kidman fails to score as a charisma-challenged Penelope  or Scarlett O'Hara, if you prefer. Another problem with `Cold Mountain' is that it overdoses on Southern-fried cornpone and backwater moonshine.  Every time Inman or Ada turn a corner, they seem to be confronted by yet another `colorful' Southern character  be it a fornicating preacher, a clan of promiscuous hillbillies, a fiddler-playing, ne'er-do-well daddy, or even the over-the-top Ruby herself, whose way with a folksy aphorism, after some initial appeal, eventually ends up setting the teeth on edge.  The film is a strangely schizophrenic one in that, while the lead characters are underdeveloped to the point of blandness, the secondary characters are overdrawn to the point of buffoonery.  The film, after awhile, begins to resemble the casting call for an out-of-town revival of Tennessee Williams.  There are a few good things about `Cold Mountain.'  It doesn't shy away from some of the more brutal aspects of war and it deals head-on with the struggles the Southerners had to undergo being on the losing side. Moreover, some of the vistas are attractive.  But, apart from a few effective moments, `Cold Mountain,' is little more than a boring, meandering, high-toned soap opera, just the kind of movie that makes Academy members sit up and take notice come nomination time (the film garnered seven nominations and one win  for Zellweger's performance).  The rest of us are more likely to just curl up and go to sleep instead.",Null,4,8,25 July 2004
American Psycho," sharp satire of yuppies
","No doubt about it, Mary Harrion's `American Psycho' is definitely not for every taste and audience demographic.  The good news is, perhaps, that the film is nowhere near as gruesome and gory as both its subject matter and its controversial nature would lead one to believe.  In fact, its tone of ironic comic detachment helps to de-emphasize the more sordid aspects of the material and to instead highlight the film's bitingly satiric message. 
Set in the mid-1980's, `American Psycho' casts a scathing eye on the then-brand new, up-and-coming group of 20-something executives known as `yuppies.'  Patrick Bateman, the psycho of the title, is a man who literally seems to have everything  stunning good looks, a fantastic physique, a beautiful fiancé, a diploma from Harvard and a successful career as a Wall Street executive.  Yet, alone of the young men with whom he consorts, Patrick flatly admits to us in voice-over narration that he is literally an empty-suit - that his perfectly maintained outer appearance, seemingly well-ordered social routine and empty, superficial personal relationships merely mask the moral emptiness that lurks at the core of his soul.  Much of the complexity of Patrick's character comes from the fact that he seems, paradoxically, to be both obsessed with the idea of conforming to the values of the world he lives in, and, at the same time, being strangely conscious of their unreality and meaninglessness.  Thus, we see him becoming almost emotionally unglued because he fears he will not be able to reserve the proper table at a posh upscale restaurant or because he feels that one of his corporate buddies has a more impressive looking business card than he does.  Much of Patrick's madness has its roots in the kind of obsessive-compulsive paranoia that arises from the modern insistence that life should and, indeed, can be converted into a perfect, problem-free existence if one just has enough money and a sufficient amount of the right `stuff' to make it that way.  Frankly admitting that he feels no emotional attachment to any other human beings, Patrick is thereby free to channel his madness into its ultimate anti-social, taboo-shattering shape and form: serial killing.  Thus, as days turn to nights, Patrick begins to rack up his victims and potential victims  a homeless man, assorted prostitutes, an ex-girlfriend, an unctuous business associate, even some policemen who get wise to his activities later in the film.  Luckily for the squeamish among us, far more of the film's running time is devoted to a comic rather than thriller mode.  The brittle, dryly humorous Mary Harrion/Guinevere Turner screenplay mines the corporate world milieu and the twisted rantings of a values-free mind for all their black comedy potential.  Christian Bale brings a remarkable subtlety to a touchy role, managing to seem coolly alluring, chillingly detached, touchingly pathetic and wryly amusing all at the same time.   Special credit should go to the stark, almost antiseptic look the filmmakers achieve through the art direction and set design, a look that matches in visual terms the moral and emotional emptiness of the characters and their world. 
Much was made of the anti-woman tone of the novel at the time of its initial release. Perhaps because the writers and the director are themselves women, the movie seems to have toned down that aspect quite a bit.  Indeed, as in a movie like `In the Company of Men,' we find ourselves not so much appalled as sadly bemused by the vehemently anti-women comments uttered by Patrick and his cronies because we see what shallow losers these men really are. Harrion and Turner obviously know whereof they speak.To reiterate, `American Psycho' may not be everyone's cup of cinematic tea, but those looking for a sharp little satire of modern American life will find some definite rewards.",Null,1,2,28 October 2000
Little Miss Sunshine," fun family road picture but where are the seatbelts?
","Death, drug addiction, attempted suicide, emotional instability - these are just a few of the elements that make up what is fast turning into the sleeper hit comedy of 2006 - 'Little Miss Sunshine,' in which an extended family of six piles into its rickety minivan and takes a thousand mile road trip from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Newport Beach, California, so that their daughter can compete in a beauty pageant for pre-teen girls. Needless to say, the family experiences many colorful and lesson-instilling adventures along the way.The characters, for the most part, fall into that category that anyone familiar with independent movie-making will instantly recognize as the 'photogenically dysfunctional.' That is to say each has his own individualized 'quirk' stamped onto his character to make him both 'weird' and 'recognizable' at the same time. The father, Frank (Greg Kinnear), is a win-at-all-costs motivational speaker who has designed a nine-step program for success that he expects not only his clients but his own family members to internalize and follow. Cheryl (Toni Collette) is his generally pragmatic wife whose relative sanity is the only thing that seems to be keeping the rest of the family from spinning off into unrestrained movie quirkdom. Frank's father (Alan Arkin) is a cantankerous, heroin-sniffing old man who cusses a blue streak, obsesses over pornography, and says everything that is on his mind no matter how politically incorrect in nature. Frank (Steve Carell) is Cheryl's morose gay brother who has just been released from a mental hospital for a failed suicide attempt. Dwayne (Paul Dano) is the teenaged son who wants to be an Air Force pilot and has taken a vow of silence until he reaches that goal. Finally, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the adorable little moppet with dreams of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant and who seems, along with her mother, to be the one levelheaded thinker in the group.This is, for the most part, a charming, extremely well acted film that can be very entertaining provided one doesn't go into it expecting too much. The conflicts and interactions among the various characters are often sharp and shrewdly observed, and directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keep the tone and pace of the film lighthearted and breezy (even in its darker moments). The screenplay by Michael Arndt walks a fine line between cynicism and sentiment, only occasionally stumbling along the way. Unfortunately, about halfway through the film, one of the most engaging and entertaining characters drops off the radar screen, and his absence is definitely felt. There are also a few too many sitcom level routines and situations, and the scene at the beauty pageant comes perilously close to endorsing the very thing - the sexualizing of pre-pubescent girls - that the film is supposed to be savaging (although I can see where the filmmakers could mount a counter argument to me here, but I'm not sure it would be all that convincing).Although all the performers are fine, Toni Collette is really the one who brings this film to life. In portraying the one generally 'normal' adult on hand, Collette lets reasonableness and common sense guide her reactions to the near-surrealistic events that are happening to them. And young Abigail Breslin is a natural-born scene-stealer.Apart from its few flaws (including the fact that not a single one of the six riders in the car - not even the little girl - is ever seen wearing a seatbelt), 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a winning film that seems to be saying that, good, bad or indifferent, family is what really matters in the end.",8,2,8,22 August 2006
Knowing," more end-of-the-world nonsense
","*PLOT SPOILERS* In 1959, a grade-school Nostradamus puts a piece of paper containing seemingly random numbers into a time capsule. When the container is opened fifty years later, it turns out that the numbers were not random at all but rather numerical predictions of future disasters, pinpointing the dates they were to occur and the number of people who would lose their lives in them. Enter John Koestler, a professor of astrophysics at MIT, who decodes the messages and becomes convinced that if he can just get others to heed the warnings, he'll somehow be able to avert the catastrophes. Unfortunately, John soon discovers that these piddling little disasters are mere warm-up exercises for the Big Cataclysmic Kahuna that is to come In 'Knowing,' the clichés of plot and character come fast and furious. John is a single dad who turns to atheism after his wife dies in a hotel fire, convinced that nothing happens for a reason and that life is nothing more than a series of random events, blah, blah, blah. As usual, the atheist - an egg headed scientist, naturally - has to be shown that there is indeed a higher power somewhere controlling our destinies. I guess we're just supposed to accept that fact and not question the appalling nature of that being's actions as he proceeds to wipe out an entire planet (the movie manages to combine elements of the Adam-and-Eve and Noah's Ark tales into a single story).In the tradition of 'Armageddon,' 'The Core,' '2012,' etc., 'Knowing' is an apocalyptic chiller that reduces the destruction of all life on the planet to the level of a cheap carnival thrill ride. Nicholas Cage - who is stuck in yet another of those Droopy Dog save-the-world roles that have become all too prevalent in his career of late - does what he can with a script that starts off with a reasonably intriguing premise, then fritters it away on giggle-inducing hysterical-crowd scenes and a dopey subplot involving extraterrestrials that should have Steven Spielberg suing the makers for copyright-infringement. And the be-fruitful-and-multiply ending is as queasy as it is implausible.There are additional wooden performances by other members of the cast, but the kindest thing would be to let them remain nameless and to forget that any of them were ever even in this picture.",4,0,3,15 January 2010
Hugo," dazzling visuals and a love of cinema overcome the movie's flaws
","Melding elements of both Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger into a single character, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a homeless orphan who lives surreptitiously inside a great train station in Paris circa 1931. To assuage his loneliness and to give some purpose to his life, he fixes and maintains the station's many elaborate time-pieces - and, to survive, he furtively steals food from the local vendors selling their wares there.A life-affirming departure for the normally dark and brooding Martin Scorsese, 'Hugo' is such a beautifully crafted work of commercial cinema that I feel a trifle ungrateful for not actually liking it more - though, more accurately perhaps, I should say that I love the final third of the film but have some reservations about what comes before. It is certainly a wonder to behold in terms of its art direction and scenic design, which together help to create a never-never world of Art Deco architecture and breathtaking cityscapes, where the surreal and the real comfortably meet - a fitting visual correlative, as it turns out, for the theme of the film. And it goes without saying that the movie richly merited each of the many awards it earned for its visual accomplishments.Adapted by John Logan from the Brian Selznick novel, 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret,' 'Hugo' is at its most magical when it is reveling in and celebrating the pioneer days of filmmaking, particularly the fantastical works of magician and special effects wizard Georges Melies ('A Trip to the Moon'), who is an actual character in the movie (played by Ben Kingsley). It seems, according to the story, that Melies left filmmaking an embittered, forgotten has-been and now owns a toy booth in the very train station that Hugo calls home. One fateful day, Hugo and Melies' paths cross - and so the adventure begins Given all these quality elements, what then are my objections to the film? Primarily, they rest in the fact that, as a central figure, Hugo is too lacking in fire and passion to generate much interest for the audience; that the secondary characters - particularly Sacha Baron Cohen as a war-ravaged security guard - come across more as live-action cartoon figures than as real people; and that the storytelling and pacing in the first half of the film often lag behind the visual stimulation. All these work as distancing devices that keep us from becoming as fully engaged in the plot and the world of the film as we perhaps would like to - until the last third, that is.And that final third winds up making all the difference, as it brings together the movie's disparate elements into a unifying theme of fixing that which is broken - be it a mechanical device or the human heart. This theme is reflected in the film's visual motif of endless machines, both those that are functional and those that are in need of repair. And Scorsese's meticulous re-creation of Melies' classic works is indeed a wonder to behold.There is one glaring anachronism, however: though the story is set in 1931, Hugo at one point makes reference to having seen Errol Flynn in 'Robin Hood,' a movie that wasn't released until 1938! A prescient kid, that Hugo.",7,0,2,27 April 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," slam-bang action movie with a good sense of humor
","The `Matrix' movies have been all the rage the past several years, yet, in terms of their plotting, they seem to have gleaned many of their core ideas from the earlier `Terminator' films.  When you think about it, the `Terminator' and `Matrix' films share the same basic premise: a race of machines takes over the earth, destroying most of the human population in the process, save for a rebellious remnant whose job it is to keep sending representatives either back in time (as in `Terminator') or into the artificial world of cyber reality (as in `Matrix') to try and undo the damage.  Is it not then a bit redundant to have a new film from both these franchises in the same movie season?  Perhaps it is, but I doubt that hardcore action films will complain.`Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' picks up where `Terminator 2: Judgment Day' left off.  We meet the famous John Connor, the presumed rebel leader of the future resistance forces, now living a dissolute life in Los Angeles, reasonably convinced that, by averting nuclear war in the last film, he will never have to assume the burdensome role of `savior of humanity'  a role he feels unqualified to fill - that fate might otherwise have decreed for him. But when a sequel is called for, rest assured that nothing is ever quite as simple as it appears and, thus, John once again becomes the target of a killer robot sent back from the future to destroy him.  This time, however, he has a love interest of sorts  Kate Brewster, a veterinarian who finds herself enmeshed in all the havoc, since she too will become a key figure in the post-apocalyptic rebellion.  As in `Terminator 2' (but not `Terminator 1'), Arnold Schwarzenneger plays the `good' robot sent back to protect Connor's life, since Connor is, for some odd reason, apparently the only person on the face of the planet capable of mounting an effective counterforce to the brutal machines.`Terminator 3' features more solid mayhem than virtually any film in recent memory.  (It is also probably LOUDER than any film ever made, as well). Jonathan Mostow, replacing James Cameron at the directorial helm, has provided action fans with a veritable orgy of car chases, gun battles, and massive explosions, so many of them, in fact, that it's a bit surprising in retrospect to realize that he has also managed to pour a little plot and character development into the mix as well.  `Terminator 3' is like a fix for action movie junkies, one that moves at a breakneck pace and never lets up in intensity.  It's true that one may become a bit dismayed at the cavalier indifference shown towards the innocent victims in the film, but that seems to be par for the course in our increasingly coarsened culture. John (Nick Stahl) and Kate (Clair Danes), in true action-movie fashion, bounce back from a succession of gunfights and body slams with a resilience worthy of the terminator machines themselves.  Are you sure they aren't ALL just robots under the skin?The whole enterprise might have dissolved into tedious redundancy were it not for the humorous self-awareness demonstrated by Arnold Schwarzenneger, whose straight-faced, deadpan delivery heightens the dry humor of much of the screenplay.  After years of playing this type of character, Arnold seems totally relaxed as he goes for the big laughs, wisely sensing that the best way to approach this material is to gently rib himself and the audience at the same time.  I honestly cannot remember when Arnold has been this good.Like virtually all time-travel scenarios, `Terminator 3' eventually finds itself caught in a box of mind-bending inconsistencies.  We are told that the machines of the future send terminators back to the past (our present) to prevent John and Kate from surviving the war and becoming the leaders of the resistance movement in the future.  Yet, as the story is constructed here, it is the terminator itself who, by hunting down the desperate pair, actually ends up SENDING them to a place where they will be able to survive the nuclear holocaust that destroys much of the world.  Had the machines just left the two alone, they would most likely have perished with the rest of the hapless human race, clearing the way for the machines' unchallenged domination in the future.  Can these wise machines not see the ironic result of their sending the terminator to try and destroy these two human threats?Oh well, logic and common sense are not necessarily the primary ingredients of a film of this sort.  Suffice it to say that `Terminator 3' provides enough action and humor to tide us over till the next inevitable installment.  Let's just hope we don't have to wait till Arnold has served out his second term as governor to get to it.",Null,0,0,23 July 2003
The Orphanage," top-notch Spanish horror film
","'The Orphanage' offers proof positive that quality filmmaking can triumph over even the tritest of themes. In bare outline, it's really just the oldie about the family that moves into a creepy older establishment – in this case an abandoned orphanage with a very dark past – only to be hounded by the spirits of the people who died there under horrific circumstances. Laura (Belen Rueda) is a woman who was herself raised there as a child and who has now returned with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep), to open a home for disabled children. In no time flat, however, things begin going bump in the night, and Simon disappears under mysterious circumstances. Could the souls of the children who died there be trying to contact the living, and could they be using Simon as a means of achieving that end? Anyone with even the most rudimentary knowledge of how such stories normally play themselves out should have no trouble divining the answers to those questions. But in his debut as a director, Juan Antonio Bayona demonstrates a real flair for the macabre, so that every haunted-house-movie cliché – every creaking door, every sudden apparition – that comes our way seems somehow new and fresh again. Perhaps it's the artful imagery, the fluid camera-work, or the highly effective soundtrack – or all three combined - that account for the movie's effectiveness. Whatever it is, Bayona is able to imbue even the most mundane object – a playground ride, a child's doll – with the utmost menace and dread.At times, the film seems to be channeling some of the 'greats' of the genre, namely 'The Innocents,' 'The Omen,' 'Poltergeist' (especially with its high-tech ghost-hunters and creepy psychic played by Geraldine Chaplin), and the original version of 'The Haunting.' And because of the quality of the work here, the movie emerges more as an homage to those earlier classics than a slavish imitation of them.People may be divided over the story's resolution – finding it either immensely satisfying or unnecessarily corny – but no one can deny that, for genuine thrills and suspense, 'The Orphanage' is one of the better horror movies of the past several years.",8,1,3,13 October 2010
U-571," pale imitation of the great 'Das Boot'
","Every so often a film comes along that so completely fulfills the demands of its genre that all such films that come after it seem to be little more than pale imitations in comparison.  Such a film is the 1981 German classic, `Das Boot,' undoubtedly the gold-standard against which all other submarine sagas must  fairly or unfairly  inevitably be measured.  Since that film pretty much exhausted the great humanistic themes of brotherhood and survival to be found in this category of films, the American submarine films that have come afterwards  `The Hunt For Red October,' `Crimson Tide,' and now, `U-571'  have been forced to turn to high level suspense plotting to supplement the standard genre conventions.  Each of these films has its moments but, the truth be told, one ends up invariably comparing these pieces of pulp entertainment to a genuine work of cinematic art  and there is just no comparison.In a way, this genre, more than virtually any other, suffers from the cramped restrictions of its underwater setting.  There just isn't a lot to DO in a submarine and, hence, the directors of these films are obviously very limited in the way they can approach the material both visually and dramatically.  Thus, we are subjected to the endless tight close-ups on the men's worried, perspiring faces as they cast their eyes upward and strain their ears during the inevitable depth-charge and how-low-can-they-go-before-they-break-apart sequences.  We know that, before long, we will be watching that needle moving precariously into the red zone on the depth gauge, followed by the customary popping bolts, creaking hull and spouting water mains as the ship challenges the limits of its diving capabilities.  (Not one of these subs, in the history of the movies, by the way, has ever failed this test).  To get a little visual action into the picture, the cinematographer will, at some point or other, begin shaking the camera chaotically to simulate exploding depth charges a mere stone's throw from the ship's egg-like outer shell.Unable to even approach `Das Boot's cinematic and technical expertise, `U-571' attempts to generate excitement with its action movie plotting and ambiance.  Regrettably, neither the story nor the characters in this film are particularly engaging.  Mathew McConaughey stars as Lt. Andrew Tyler, a naval officer who manages, through a complicated series of partly planned, partly inadvertent circumstances, to lead a group of men on board a German u-boat, kill most of its crew and cruise around the North Atlantic in a Trojan Horse type operation, while uncovering the German codebook they have been sent to find on the ship.  Unlike `Das Boot,' whose primary concern was to make its recreation of life aboard a sub as realistic and convincing as possible, `U-571' loses its way in a welter of action film histrionics, cardboard cutout characters and maudlin sentimentality.  Taylor is supposed to be a second-rate, overly-sensitive officer whom the bigwigs trust so little that they refuse to assign him a boat and a command of his own - but do we doubt, that by finale time, he will have proven himself to be a leader in the true-blue military tradition?  None of the characters in this film seem to differentiate themselves from one another in any way that would make us care about them.  They all seem to be, essentially, a group of dressed-up actors playing at soldier  a far cry from the fully fleshed-out and convincing set of characters that comprised Wolfgang Peterson's crew. 
Perhaps it is unfair to judge `U-571' in relation to that earlier epic work. (After all, `Das Boot' runs several hours longer than this film). Nevertheless, it is a measure of the true greatness of that incomparable German masterpiece that it literally left nothing for future films to add to the genre.  It is all there in that one work  complete and perfect in its artistry and form.  Very few films sum up their genres as consummately as Wolfgang Peterson's `Das Boot.'",Null,2,4,21 October 2000
"I, Robot"," intelligent sci-fi film
","Based on the classic novel by Isaac Asimov, 'I, Robot' is a tasty sci-fi elixir with a nifty whodunit twist.Will Smith plays Del Spooner, a Chicago homicide detective who has always harbored deep suspicions about the servile robots who are fast becoming common household items in the year 2035. One day, Spooner is called in to investigate the suicide of Dr. Alfred Lanning, the inventor largely responsible for the technology that has gone into the making of these robots. Almost immediately, Spooner begins to suspect that Lanning's death may not have been a suicide at all but rather a homicide perpetrated by the robots who, though programmed to do no harm to humans, may be evolving to the point where they are becoming sentient beings fully capable of overriding their programming and acting at will. As this brand new model of robot hits the streets, Spooner becomes something of a modern day Cassandra (or Chicken Little, if you prefer), attempting to convince his skeptical superiors that this seemingly benign army of anthropomorphic mechanisms may actually be a threat to human civilization as we know it.Like virtually all quality science fiction, 'I, Robot' aims its sights at mankind's propensity for sowing the seeds of its own destruction, in this case by inventing technology that eventually outruns the ability of its creators to control it. And when it comes to artificial intelligence, in particular, how long, the film asks, will it be before the intelligence becomes real and the creator becomes subservient to that which he has created? 'I, Robot' is a sleek, thought-provoking action film, filled with suspense, drama and mind-boggling plot twists. On a purely visual level, however, the film is a bit more problematic. Although the backdrops that work to create the image of a futuristic Chicago are eye-popping and dazzling, some of the computer-generated images, particularly in the action sequences, look a trifle too much like video games to be entirely convincing. Still, although the movement of the robots isn't as realistic as, perhaps, we would like it to be, the facial expressions are fantastically effective, creating a sense of personality and life behind a façade of cold, synthetic technology.I haven't read the story on which the film is based, so I have no way of knowing how faithful to Asimov's original vision the filmmakers have been. Be that as it may, for the non-initiates, 'I, Robot' is a solid film that at least does justice to the genre as a whole.",8,0,1,10 July 2005
American Beauty," sometimes shattering vision of American life
","If you've ever wondered what life was really like in the Ozzie and Harriet household after the cameras stopped rolling, `American Beauty' might well afford you a good indication.  Although this is certainly not the first glimpse into the dark underbelly of modern suburban life - films like `Ordinary People' and `Blue Velvet' long ago shattered any myths about the subject - `American Beauty' is clearly one of the grimmest and least compromising.  Writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes paint a disturbing portrait of a family and a neighborhood in serious moral crisis.  They transport us on an often painful journey to a world whose residents lead lives of quiet desperation cozily hidden behind the tranquil faÃ§ade of tree-lined streets, white picket fences and exquisitely manicured lawns and gardens - a neighborhood and, perhaps, even a family not too unlike some of our own.In his Oscar-winning performance, Kevin Spacey stars as Lester, a 42-year old man suffering a major case of mid-life angst, stuck, like so many other men in his age bracket, in both a dreary, meaningless job and a dreary, meaningless marriage, in his case to a consumer-conscious wife whose personality has long since been drained of the passion and spontaneity that once defined it.  Lester also has an alienated teenage daughter who suffers from feelings of worthlessness and a consequent inability to relate in any positive way to either her parents or the materialistic life they have made for her.  Feeling utterly empty, Lester begins to become infatuated with his daughter's beautiful blonde schoolmate, an obsession that leads to pedophilic fantasies as well as tortured feelings of unrequited passion.What is remarkable about the film is that Ball and Mendes don't concentrate merely on Lester's problems but manage to weave a full tapestry of suburban despair by shifting their focus to a wide assortment of other characters as well.  Many of the secondary characters, who could easily have slipped over into stereotype or caricature, actually are allowed to breathe and develop in three-dimensional ways.  Thus, we come to understand that, in her own way, Carolyn, Lester's wife, is just as unfulfilled as he is and just as unsure of how to cope with that bewildering situation.  Jane, his daughter, is just a good-hearted kid who craves affection and moral guidance from parents who seem too self-possessed or too emotionally burnt-out to provide her with those needs.  Like so many of today's youth, she suffers from feelings of inadequacy because she doesn't measure up to society's view of ideal physical perfection - her main goal in life is to undergo breast augmentation - and she really only wants to find someone who will love and accept her on a deeper, more spiritual level.  This she finds in the form of Ricky Fitts, her strangely `different' next-door neighbor, a boy who spends his life filming his experiences and whose amazing self-confidence and self-assurance inspire others to label him psychotic and Jane to fall in love with him.  Ricky is, perhaps, the most controversial element of the film because his blatant drug dealing never seems to come under any moral censure by the film's makers.  After all, at least Lester eventually backs off from his planned conquest of Angela, the seeming nymphet, at the last moment.  When he comes to the realization that Angela is really only a sweet, mixed-up kid, he envisions the psychological damage his exploitation of her would inflict - both on her and on himself.   Therefore, before his demise, Lester discovers that he is not quite as morally bankrupt as he has led himself - and us - to believe.   Angela also is revealed as a complex character, a girl so afraid of being `ordinary' that she devises an entirely fictional persona to present to a world that, ironically, really doesn't care about her anyway.  In a way, Angela defines the theme of the film, in that it seems to suggest that there really is no such thing as `ordinary' in terms of human existence and that we all spend our lives in a fruitless attempt to achieve or at least replicate it.  Of the entire cast of characters, Ricky's father, a homophobic, hardnosed ex-Marine, perhaps suffers from the worst case of just such self-denial and emotional repression.   Thus, he becomes the device through which the final tragic outcome is eventually set into motion.All involved - writer, director, actors, cinematographer Conrad Hall - deserve immense kudos for their moral courage and their technical expertise. Still, one begins to wonder if all these thoroughly dire views of suburban life are really any more true or accurate than the preposterously sunny portrayals of the 1950's.  Isn't it possible that the truth may - as with all aspects of life - lie somewhere in between?  `American Beauty' takes us to a particular place filled with a particular group of people.  As a result, it is safe to say that, while it provides `a' vision of modern suburban life, it is yet to be shown that it provides `the' definitive vision.  Like all great art, it offers only a part of the overall picture - but that part, in this particular case, is profoundly disturbing and truly unforgettable.",Null,0,0,10 November 2000
Over the Hedge," lively and endearing
","'Over the Hedge' is a high-spirited, fast-paced addition to all those talking-animal animation movies that have flooded the multiplexes over the past several years.In terms of its setup, 'Over the Hedge' provides the flipside to the earlier 'Madgascar,' in which a bevy of zoo animals traveled out of the city and back to the wilds from which they - or at least their ancestors - had originally come. In 'Over the Hedge,' the animals are already living in the country, only this time civilization has come to them in the form of a brand new suburban housing tract that has sprung up in their vicinity while the denizens snoozed away through winter hibernation (that's one fast-growing housing development, I must say). Despite the dangers inherent in crossing over into human territory, the animals decide that the abundance of conveniently pre-packaged snack food to be gotten there is just too good to resist and that the benefit to be derived from such foraging expeditions is well worth the risk posed by any irascible, irate humans.'Over the Hedge' benefits from clever, well-delineated characters, cute facial expressions on the part of the animals, fine voice work from the likes of Bruce Willis, Gary Shandling, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Nick Nolte and Allison Janney, and a storyline that moves along at a brisk, action-packed pace, well-suited to the often wavering attention spans of children and adult viewers alike. The jokes are marginal but occasionally witty, and the suburban setting has been lovingly captured in all its spanking-new colorfulness and sparkle.As animated-animal movies go, 'Over the Hedge' is better than most.",7,0,1,20 March 2007
The Alamo," Forget 'The Alamo'
","In the early part of the Nineteenth Century, the area now known as the state of Texas was the scene of a massive tug-of-war between the Mexicans, who claimed ownership of the land, and the Americans who were determined to gain independence for the territory so that it could one day be subsumed into the new, ever expanding nation to the north. The 1836 siege of the Alamo played a crucial role in determining the outcome of that struggle. For it was here that a group of 187 Texans chose to make their stand against over 3,000 Mexican troops led by the famed Santa Anna - and lost their lives in the process. This turned out to be a short-lived, Pyrrhic victory for the Mexicans, however, for the totality and brutality of the slaughter so outraged the Texans that the phrase 'Remember the Alamo!' quickly became the official rallying cry for Texas independence, which was won soon after.'The Alamo''s all-star cast includes Patrick Wilson as William Travis, the Lieutenant Colonel who led the American forces; Jason Patric as James Bowie, the consumptive knife-fighter and leader of the Texas militia; Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crocket, the legendary Indian-fighter-turned-United-States-senator; and Dennis Quaid as General Sam Houston, who chose to sit out the siege but who managed to extract swift and total revenge against Santa Anna and the Mexican army a very short time later.The film is most effective when it deals with the history surrounding the event, even though a number of historians have raised serious objections as to the veracity of much of what is shown on screen. Still, when virtually every single person is dead at the end of a battle, it is a little difficult to come up with the primary source, eyewitness testimony one would need to compile a reliable historical account of the incident. Speculation is obviously going to play a very large part in any dramatic recreation of the event, so I think the moviemakers can be given some slack in this area. However, it is as dramas that such movies are judged, and here 'The Alamo' doesn't score nearly so well. Admirably, it has attempted to see its larger-than-life characters in relatively life-sized terms, but in its attempt at humanizing the participants, it often winds up sentimentalizing them instead. Crockett, in particular, falls victim to this problem. So obsessed is he with playing down the near-mythological, iconic status his previous exploits have garnered for him, that he becomes little more than a simpering revisionist bore in the process.'The Alamo' also suffers from a malady common to films based on well known historical events: that of knowing the end of the story going into the movie. It leads to an even more serious problem here than it did in, say, 'Titanic,' because, at least in that film, even though we knew beforehand that the ship was going to sink, at least we didn't know exactly which characters were going to go to their watery graves with her. In the case of 'The Alamo,' all we can do is wait for the final battle to commence and watch as each of the characters suffers a common fate.Because the majority of the film's 137-minute running time is taken up with the 13-day-long siege and standoff, the pacing often leans towards the desultory and the languid. Most of the time is spent with the characters sitting around and waiting for help to arrive, not exactly a scenario designed to provide edge-of-the-seat excitement for the viewer. Most of the acting is wooden and stiff, although Thornton brings a few nice touches to his portrayal of Crockett, even if his golly-gee-aren't-I-just-like-everyone-else boyishness begins to wear a mite thin after awhile. There's also an undercurrent of xenophobia running through the film in its one-sided portrayal of the opposing forces. Santa Anna, in particular, is reduced to the level of a stock villain, stopping just short of twirling his (admittedly nonexistent) moustache at moments of extreme dastardliness. Needless to say, there's been very little attempt to humanize him.The actual climactic assault on the Alamo has been impressively mounted, although we are strangely unmoved by all the deaths we see happening before us. Interestingly, it is only in a different scene - the one in which Houston's army chases some fleeing Mexican soldiers into a river, brutally and senselessly slaughtering them in the process - that the filmmakers capture the ugliness and madness of war. More scenes like that might have made 'The Alamo' less of a total rout for the audience than the Alamo was for those involved in the real thing.",5,1,7,3 April 2005
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," reasonably entertaining parody
","'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' is a parody not only of 'Walk the Line' and similar musical biopics – replete with the seemingly inevitable dead kid brother (see also 'Ray') - but of musical styles and pop-culture trends as they have evolved over the past half-century.The movie starts in the 1950s as a young backwater hick named Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly), an Elvis Presley-style crooner, takes the country by storm with his hit single 'Walk Hard.' From there it's on to fame as a Dylan-inspired protest singer, a turn as a disco-diva, and, finally, the wizened recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in his 70s. And, along the way, of course, there are the inevitable bouts with drug addiction, the time spent in prison and rehab, a wife ('SNL''s Kristen Wiig) left at home to raise the kids, a mistress (Jenna Fischer from 'The Office') who's his one true-love and who stands by him no matter what, endless arguments with his managers and fellow band mates, groupies and orgies for the taking, furniture- and crockery-smashing tantrums, songwriter's block, stardom as a 1970's TV variety-show host – you name it, it's in here. There's even a hilarious encounter with the late-era Beatles, who seem well on their way to cutting each others' throats, let alone splitting up the band.All of this is, of course, played for laughs. Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasdan, and directed by Kasdan, 'Walk Hard' is never more than passably entertaining, filled with as many jokes that fall flat as those that rise to the occasion. It's definitely not up there with the best of their work. Still, a 50/50 ratio isn't a particularly bad one as far as mainstream comedies go these days, and Reilly is so good as Dewey that he makes even the lesser moments more-or-less ignorable. There are also fun turns by Raymond J. Barry, Margo Martindale, Chris Parnell, Harold Ramis, Jane Lynch, and many others. Moreover, the music (by Michael Andrews) and singing (who knew you had it in you, Mr. Reilly?) are both terrific, and they alone are worth the price of admission.",Null,0,0,20 July 2011
We're the Millers," refreshingly astute Hollywood comedy
","'We're the Millers' is that rarest of cinematic creatures - a high-concept Hollywood comedy that actually works.Jason Sudeikis from 'Saturday Night Live' plays a small-time drug dealer who's sent by his skeevy drug lord (Ed Helms) to Mexico to pick up a shipment of marijuana. In order to avoid arousing any unwanted suspicion at the border, David rents an oversized RV and hires a motley crew of acquaintances to pose as his all-American family. These include a down-on-her-heels stripper posing as his wife (Jennifer Aniston); a hard-edged, homeless girl standing in as his daughter (Emma Roberts); and a big-hearted dork from the neighborhood assuming the role of his son (Will Poulter).The story is fraught with any number of comical misadventures as David and his unlikely troupe encounter armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and another family (led by Kathryn Hahn and 'Parks and Recreation's' Nick Offerman) in an equally ostentatious RV along the way.What separates 'We're the Millers' from so many other recent studio-manufactured comedies is the sharpness of the writing and the appealing nature of the characters. The script maintains a deft balance between subtle wit and blatant slapstick, modern-day crudity and old-fashioned sweetness. And even in those rare moments when the movie jumps the track, it's quick to climb right back on and head on to its destination.Much of the credit for the movie's success goes to the actors who create tremendously likable characters, all with their own comic quirks and eccentricities, but all rooted, at least to some extent, in real life. The real scene-stealer is Poulter whose spot-on portrayal of a lovable nerd serves as the beating heart of the movie.So effective in fact are the actors in getting us to root for the characters that the movie can play up the whole corny and sentimental notion of what it means to be a family and get away with it. Thus, it manages to keep its subversive cred while at the same time warming the heart. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you get right down to it.",8,7,13,30 September 2013
Disturbia," simple, effective thriller
","'Disturbia' is 'Rear Window' with gadgets - lots and lots of gadgets. Forget the high-powered binoculars that Jimmy Stewart had to rely upon in that earlier film to fulfill his voyeuristic tendencies; that's strictly old school stuff compared to the PCs, cell phones, camcorders and various other technological marvels the hero of 'Disturbia' uses for his spying and sleuthing. Thus, what is a bane for modern-day paranoiacs is clearly a boon for neighborhood Peeping Toms.Shia LeBeouf is Kale, a suburban teen placed under house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher after the latter makes a cutting remark about Kale's recently deceased father one day in class. Literally stuck at home with nothing to do, Kale begins to wile away the hours spying on his various neighbors, including, naturally, a young blonde hottie who has conveniently moved in right next door to the horny prisoner. Kale also begins to suspect that the man down the street, who spends most of his free time benignly mowing his lawn, may, in fact, be a serial killer who lures beautiful women into his home and violently dispatches them. Soon, Kale, his best friend from school, Ronnie, and the blonde cutie, named (what else?) Ashley, are crime-solving with the best of them, uncovering clues and closing in on the suspect even as they become aware that they might not be quite as invisible to their intended target as they originally thought they were.Despite its tendency to wander off into Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew-level melodramatics at times, 'Disturbia' is a generally tidy little thriller, refreshingly simple and straightforward in a time when such films tends to be just a little too clever and a little too convoluted for their own good (the screenplay is blessedly devoid of those 'surprise' turnabout plot twists that are practically de rigeur in modern movie thrillers). There are plenty of holes and inconsistencies in the storyline, as is perhaps to be expected, but co-writers Christopher B. Landon and Carl Ellsworth, and director D. J. Caruso keep us from fixating too much on them with the skill of their film-making. The climactic scenes are wickedly suspenseful, even if just about every shot feels derived from some previous film ('The Silence of the Lambs,' 'The Shining,' 'Poltergeist,' and 'The Blair Witch Project' seem to be the primary sources here).The key factor in 'Disturbia''s success lies in LaBeouf's star-making performance in the lead role. This talented and charismatic young actor has a slightly befuddled, puppy dog expression that gives the character the vulnerability he needs to make his heroics convincing. He is nicely complemented by Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer as his partners in crime-detection, and by David Morse (the dad in 'Contact') as the killer next door.",7,0,1,5 May 2007
The Patriot," good battle scenes, sappy drama
","`The Patriot' is at its most authentic when it concentrates on the ugly brutalities of its Revolutionary War battle scenes and at its least authentic when it focuses on its own dramatic, storytelling elements which are, all too often, marked by heavy-handed contrivance, bathos and plain old-fashioned corniness.  Alas, for those of us who approached this film with high expectations and high hopes, the bad news is that the latter aspect takes up far more screen time than does the former.
This latest directorial effort by Roland Emmerich at least has the advantage of novelty working in its favor in that few films of recent times have even bothered to chronicle and recreate this particular period in American history.  All too often we think of the people who helped found this new nation in almost plaster saint terms, and `The Patriot' seems, for a while at least, as if it is going to try to portray them in a more complex, well-rounded light.  Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is presented to us as a reluctant warrior, a man initially opposed to the war because he wants to protect his family from harm yet who, after one of his own sons is brutally murdered by the British, suddenly takes up arms, as much out of a sense of personal revenge as out of a commitment to cause and principle.  So far so good  yet as the drama unfolds, we become more and more skeptical of what we are seeing on screen.  As a director of crowd-pleasing extravaganzas in the past (`Independence Day,' `Godzilla'), Emmerich just can't seem to resist indulging in all the requisite Hollywood touches that end up trivializing the seriousness of the film's subject matter.  For instance, the scene in which Martin almost single-handedly slaughters a group of fully armed Redcoats plays like the typical action scene in any conventional Gibson vehicle.  Nor is the director much more successful in his attempts to humanize the characters.  The scenes between Martin and his son, for instance, as well as those between him and his dead wife's beautiful sister or between his son and the girl who becomes his sweetheart all reek equally of phoniness and sentimentality.  This is not helped one whit either by the syrupy, bombastic symphonic score provided by John Williams which sounds, quite literally, as if he lifted it directly from the soundtrack of his own `Jurassic Park.'In an effort to turn this epic struggle for freedom into a simplistic rah-rah action film, Emmerich and writer Robert Rodat have created a British commander so villainous that he stops just short of twirling a handlebar moustache every time he utters a command to mow down injured prisoners or set ablaze a church filled with unarmed men, women and children sympathetic to the rebel cause.  This character, who also plays a major role in the death of Martin's son, provides the protagonist with a rather cheap foil against which to fight and the audience with a convenient target at whom it can hiss, boo and jeer.  Thus, the filmmakers reduce this complex battle for liberty to the level of conventional, lowest common denominator melodrama when what we crave is the kind of hard edged moral complexity we find in war movies like `Glory' and `The Last of the Mohicans.'Visually, `The Patriot' is a knockout, filled with widescreen images of glorious autumnal landcapes with or without battling armies in the foreground.  Structurally, however, the 165-minute film suffers from distention and attenuation with a screenplay that involves itself with far too many subsidiary characters to keep the drama neatly in focus.  The pace often seems languid as we wile away the time between impressive, but sometimes all-too-brief clashes between opposing armies.  For it is in these scenes that `The Patriot' manages to excel.  Those sensitive to movie violence may object to the graphic nature of these depictions of brutal wartime carnage.  Yet, it is in just this refusal to sugarcoat the horrors of the blood-soaked battlefield that `The Patriot' finds its one element of validity and truth.  Unfortunately, the realistic nature of these sequences only serves to further emphasize the phoniness of much of the rest of the film.  The overall failure of  `The Patriot' is a shame because the Revolutionary War remains fertile territory for a filmmaker willing to provide a less pandering, audience-friendly approach to the subject.  We eagerly await that future film's arrival.",Null,0,1,18 November 2000
Silver Linings Playbook," A breakthrough performance for Bradley Cooper
","Dramatizing mental illness has always been a tricky proposition for the movies. How often have we seen such attempts devolve into either freak show comedy or horror movie madness? 'Silver Linings Playbook' is one of the few to get it right. It's not that writer/director David O. Russell doesn't see the humor in the situations he's depicting - there are some very funny scenes in the movie - it's that he sees humor as just one small aspect of what turns out to be a far more complex and multi- layered condition.In a tour-de-force performance that finally put him on the map as an actor of extraordinary talent, Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a young man who suffers from a severe case of Bi-Polar Disorder, so severe that Pat has been spending the past few months since the dissolution of his marriage in an institution. But Pat has chosen to move back in with his parents, who work hard at trying to understand Pat's condition and to cope with his often bizarre and incomprehensible behavior. While he nurtures the fantasy that he will one day reunite with his estranged wife, Pat meets Tiffany, a local girl who seems to have as many issues as he does when it comes to functioning in the real world.'Silver Linings Playbook' makes the not entirely novel case that all of us suffer from our share of personal quirks and idiosyncrasies - Pat's dad's superstitious obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles isn't too many steps away from the irrational concerns that dictate Pat's life - but that BPD just ratchets them up to a much higher level. The screenplay, which was adapted from the Matthew Quick novel, goes from the comical to the serious to the heartbreaking to the romantic without any noticeable grinding of tonal gears. Ditto for the nearly perfect ensemble cast which includes Robert De Niro as Pat's father, Jacki Weaver as his mom, and Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, who won a Best Actress Oscar for her work.But it is Cooper who makes the movie his own. There is scarcely a moment when he does not appear on screen and the actor casts a spell over the audience from first frame to last. He avoids the role-given temptation to chew the scenery, opting instead for understatement in his portrayal of a man whose desire to fit into the world is often at odds with his ability to do so. The result is a performance that elicits both laughter and tears from the audience, but which never feels contrived or manipulative while doing so. He draws us so deeply into the core of the character that we even accept his potentially trite belief that one must look for the silver lining in even the darkest of clouds since, when you think about it, what alternative does one really have? It's a career- defining performance for an actor clearly concerned with making the most of his time in the spotlight.",8,1,2,8 March 2014
Van Helsing," so-so action film
","'Van Helsing' is a campy, tongue-in-cheek homage to the three key figures of classic movie horror - Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man - and those who do them battle. Hugh Jackman is the mysterious Van Helsing, a centuries-old monster-slayer who works sub rosa for the Catholic Church in its ongoing battle with the forces of evil. In this tale, Van Helsing is sent off to Transylvania to destroy the famed Count Dracula, a vampire who's been rampaging through the countryside for more than four hundred years now, making life miserable for the inhabitants therein.Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, 'Van Helsing' is a sometimes entertaining, sometimes half-baked adventure tale, beautiful to look at but largely devoid of any real suspense or excitement. The action scenes are overwrought and redundant, filled with computer-generated special effects that are surprisingly second-rate in nature. However, the art direction and set design do an outstanding job creating a Transylvania that plays upon our memories of those Universal classics from the 1930's. Moreover, David Wenham serves as an effective cowardly/comic Sancho Panza-type sidekick for the more staid and conventionally heroic Van Helsing, who suffers pangs of remorse when he is forced to destroy the monsters.The final battle scene between Van Helsing and Dracula does drag on for a minor eternity, but the movie, overall, should satisfy rabid fans of the action film genre. The rest of us can find intermittent entertainment gawking at the scene.",5,1,2,22 July 2005
Divergent," Yet another ho-hum dystopic movie
","Is it even possible in this day and age to make a dystopic science fiction film without it feeling somehow derivative of so many earlier, better works? I tend to doubt it. Take 'Divergent,' a futuristic tale based on the book by Veronica Roth, itself just the first in a series of novels aimed primarily at young adults. Right off the bat, one can see that 'Divergent' owes a great deal to Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World,' both being set in a society built on a strict caste system, where every member of the community is assigned a social level and a specialized task from which there is basically no escape. The difference is that, in Huxley's world, one is engineered from 'conception' to be a member of a certain caste, while, in Roth's, individuals are, theoretically at least, free to choose, at one crucial point in their adolescence, the group to which they will forever belong.In 'Divergent,' there are five categories or 'factions,' as they're called here, only two of which have any real significance in the film: Abnegation, whose principal function is selfless service to the community, and Dauntless, which serves, essentially, as the police force in this walled-off, post-apocalyptic version of old Chicago. Caught in the middle is a young woman named Beatrice (Shailene Woodley), who, while raised in Abnegation, finds that she may actually be what is called a 'Divergent,' a rare individual who fits comfortably into more than one category, making her an existential threat to the stability of this homogeneous society, where everyone knows his or her place and role. Beatrice opts to join Dauntless, a decision which leads to innumerable training sequences that seem to drag on for a minor eternity.Par for the course for the dystopic genre, our divergent heroine soon finds herself on the run from diabolical government forces (led by Kate Winslet) bent on destroying her lest she throw a monkey wrench into their 'peaceful,' 'well-oiled,' 'harmonious' society.And that's pretty much all the movie is about. Throw in some dreamscape elements straight out of 'Total Recall' and 'Inception' - both much better films, by the way - and soon we find ourselves heading down the rabbit-hole into incoherence and confusion from which it becomes virtually impossible to extricate ourselves.Even decent - if pretty much standard, at this point - production values can't rescue a generally drab film.",4,0,1,3 November 2014
The White Ribbon," the very definition of an 'art film'
","Movies don't come much more austere or art-house friendly than 'The White Ribbon,' a German film written and directed by Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke. With its stark black-and-white cinematography and deliberate pacing, the film has the look and feel of an old Ingmar Bergman picture - Ingmar Bergman crossed with M Night Shyamalan, that is, since its story centers around a village in pre-World War I Germany where strange and inexplicable things begin to happen. The town doctor is injured in a mysterious horseback riding mishap; the baron's son is found hanging upside down in a barn; a worker dies in a freak factory accident. All of this is narrated by the town's schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) who falls for a sweet, shy girl who works as a nanny at the manor house.The children - most of whom look like they just stepped out of 'Village of the Damned' - struggle with thoughts of death and the guilt caused by a repressive society, while the adults - an emotionally rigid and unyielding pastor, a cruel, incestuous doctor - contend with their own inner demons, as they groan under the burdens of a class-conscious feudal system and the weight of their own conflicted desires. The theme seems to be that when people bury their natural urges under a crushing mountain of rules and regulations - whether societal or religious in nature - those sublimated urges will manifest themselves in other, demonstrably harmful ways (killing birds, destroying property, kidnapping and torturing children, etc.). The conclusion we're supposed to come to, I guess, is that it was from just such seeds that the war that was to come would eventually spring. I guess.I wish I could say that I liked 'The White Ribbon' better than I do. It's certainly wonderful to look at, and there is something haunting and hypnotic about Haneke's vision of life in a small German village at that particular moment in time. But the plotting is so obscure, the pacing so funereal, and the overall demeanor so heavy-handed and pretentious that, I'm afraid, it takes quite a bit of forbearance and patience just to get through it all.Still, the mood and the visuals make it worth the effort.",6,45,83,9 July 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," decent but unmemorable
","When a giant robot from outer space threatens to destroy all life on Earth, a group of adorable monsters - whose very existence has been kept under raps for decades by the federal government - is deployed to defeat the menace. One of the 'monsters' is Susan (energetically voiced by Reese Witherspoon), an average California girl who becomes a multi-story giantess after she is hit by a meteorite on the day of her wedding. The save-the-planet mission she is sent on gives her a chance to prove to herself and to those around her that she has what it takes to make a difference in the world.'Monsters vs. Aliens' is a minor-league animated effort that is clearly aimed more at the youngsters in the audience than at the adults. Kids will enjoy the cutesy creatures, the frenetic pacing, the bright colors and clean backgrounds, and the nonstop action sequences that make this feel at times almost like a 'Transformers' for the pre-teen set. And speaking of other movies, the film is stuffed to bursting with cinematic allusions, ranging from 'Close Encounters' to 'E.T.' to 'The Wizard of Oz' to 'The Blob' to 'Attack of the 50-foot Woman' to 'Dr. Strangelove,' some of which will be familiar to the kiddies and some of which only the adults in the audience will be able to pick up on.Overall, 'Monsters vs. Aliens' is lively, attractive and innocuous and will probably be forgotten by most viewers a good five minutes after they've seen it - the older viewers, that is.",6,0,1,10 May 2010
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Largely joyless update of the fairy tale classic
","'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' starts off with a fairly clever premise, but it never comes up with anything particularly interesting to do with it. It would appear that, since stuffing their witch captor into her own oven, the precocious youngsters have grown up to be renowned, Medieval bad-asses, hired by a village to investigate the mysterious disappearances of a number of its children.As the title characters, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do what they can with woefully underwritten roles, but the movie itself quickly degenerates into a succession of redundant action and fight sequences (inexplicably, with modern firepower) that fail to excite either the imagination or the pulse and that ultimately go nowhere.

Step Up 2: The Streets," 'Fame' redux generally falls flat
","Saddled with a screenplay that wouldn't earn a passing grade in a Cinema 101 course, 'Step Up 2 the Streets' is an urban fairy tale about an orphaned crew dancer (Briana Evigan) from the 'hood who is accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But can she find a home with the assortment of geeks, preppies and classically-trained arty types who attend the school? And can she succeed as a student without turning her back on her 'homies' from the old neighborhood? Or will she be forced to form her own crew from dancers at the school to compete with the Big Boys out on the streets? You can write the script yourself, but the key selling-point of this sequel to 'Step Up' - sort of a mash-up of 'Fame,' 'Footloose' and 'School of Rock' - is clearly not the storytelling but the dancing. And in that respect it delivers the goods. So ignore the predictable plotting, the tinny dialogue, the corny inspirational speeches, the wafer-thin characters, the obligatory montage sequences and the amateurish acting, and simply revel in the moves, street-dance or otherwise, that permeate the film. It's not much in the way of compensation, I know, but at least it's better than nothing.",4,1,1,26 November 2009

Overflowing with imagination and creativity, it manages to breathe new life into that trickiest of cinematic genres  the surrealist satire.  Like all films that dare to take risks, `Being John Malkovich' sometimes stumbles in the paths it chooses to take, but at least its course is always an innovative and fascinating one.
John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a soft-spoken nebbish leading a life less of quiet desperation than of overwhelming blandness.  Unable to support himself as a puppeteer, he finally succumbs to his wife's pressure to seek out a job, landing a position as file clerk in a bizarre company located on the 7 ½ th floor of a Manhattan office building.  One of the triumphs of the film is that it portrays the surreal in such an understated and quiet way. This floor has ceilings so low that the people who work on it must continually crouch as they move about their business, yet they all accept that fact with an uncomplaining and unquestioning good humor.  Even when Schwartz discovers a strange portal hidden behind some cabinets leading directly into John Malkovich's brain, all those to whom Craig reveals his secret take very little convincing both to believe him and to experiment with it themselves.  Thus, by creating a world that already appears slightly askew in its reality  Craig's wife, in addition, runs a pet shop and therefore fills their house with a menagerie of exotic animals the film makes it possible for us to go along with the characters' otherwise inexplicably blasé reactions.Writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze hit upon a number of fascinating themes in the course of their bizarre musings.  Craig, for instance, learns that there exists a certain safety in the tediousness of everyday life, for the moment he allows the extraordinary to enter his ordered world he unleashes passions - that have been long dormant both in himself and his wife - which he finds himself unable to control.  His wife, in particular, whom he has mistakenly pigeonholed as a woman concerned only with the humdrum domesticities associated with married life, provides him with a rude awakening as she begins to surpass him in her burgeoning obsession with experiencing the excitements of sexual liberation.  Craig also discovers the terrifying truth about himself, that, beneath the façade of a meek, mild-mannered artist there lurks the soul of a repressed despot, as he comes more and more to relish the ability to move into Malkovich's mind and control his thoughts and actions  much as with his beloved puppets, but now on a much more grand, much more malevolent scale.  The film generates much of its comic tension through the complex sexual interplay that develops among Craig, his wife, Lotte, and his alluring but enigmatic co-worker, Maxine, in whom both husband and wife develop a more than passing sexual interest.  With tinges of `No Exit,' the three characters find themselves caught in a frustrating world of overlapping and therefore clashing sexual desires and passions.The film demonstrates a real stroke of genius in its casting.  John Cusack, with his look of understated bewilderment, perfectly conveys the soul of a man too long accustomed to expecting little in the way of surprise out of life.  Catherine Keener brilliantly captures the detached cynicism and taunting coolness that makes her such an enthralling sexual temptation to both Craig and Lotte.  And whose audacious decision was it to cast Cameron Diaz as the near-dowdy second fiddle to Kenner, to make her the NON-sex object in the film?  As for Mr. Malkovich himself, he seems to be having the self-deprecating time of his life as he allows himself and even his lack of general public name recognition to become targets for gentle ribbing.
`Being John Malkovich' is not a perfect movie.  It occasionally sags in places and suffers from some repetition and, like many utterly original and audacious works, it sometimes alienates its audience through its quality of often-cold calculation.  At moments in which the iconoclasm seems to become an end in itself, one may be tempted to see the film in emperor's-new-clothes terms, wondering if what one is seeing is really as brilliant as it appears or just an intellectual scam being played on a self-congratulatory elite audience.  For the most part, however, `Being John Malkovich' is fertile enough in its invention and varied enough in its imaginativeness to rate as a film well worth seeing and cherishing.  There should definitely be more like it!",Null,1,2,3 June 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," could have been a whole lot funnier
","'The 40-Year Old Virgin' wins the award for being the dirtiest, most foulmouthed version of 'Pygmalion' this side of 'My Bare Lady.' As the title explicitly states, this is the story of a man who has somehow managed to avoid having sex for the first four decades of his life, and the attempts on the part of his co-workers to see that he doesn't make it five. Thus, once they get over the shock of Andy Stitzer's little secret, these helpful buddies spend the remainder of the movie coaching and grooming him in the fine art of sexual conquest and romantic seduction.The problem with 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' is that it can't decide whether it wants to be a crude, gross-out raunch-fest or a sweet, warmhearted romantic comedy. By trying to succeed at both, it manages to succeed at neither. For all the filmmakers' attempts to meld them, the two very different halves just keep canceling one another out.Yet, as with any film that aspires to make us laugh, 'Virgin' must finally be adjudged a success or failure based not on how wild or tame it is, but on how funny. And, unfortunately, there just isn't very much humor to be found in this film, with the setups and jokes feeling mighty thin and painfully obvious for the most part, and the movie never seeming to know when to leave well enough alone. The 'well enough' are the two lead performers - Steve Carell and Katherine Keener - who are both tremendously natural and likable performers and who could really make us care about their characters if the film weren't so cluttered with extraneous elements and subsidiary characters, and so tedious and drawn out in its execution. For, indeed, 'Virgin' flies right in the face of that unwritten law of movie-making that decrees that no comedy should ever even approach a two-hour running time, let alone exceed it. Yet, clocking in at a whopping 128 minutes, the film begins to feel aimless and endless, with long stretches of time between all-too-infrequent laughs.",6,2,4,7 May 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," the satire could be sharper but Clooney saves the day
","So just who are these men who stare at goats? They're members of an elite, covert military unit - known officially as the New Earth Army and unofficially as Jedi warriors - trained to use New Age mysticism and psychic powers to defeat the enemy (their staring at the goats is supposed to result in the animals' deaths). Bob Wilton is a newspaper reporter from Ann Arbor, Michigan who becomes personally involved with the unit while serving as a war correspondent in Iraq. He's drawn in by a retired Special Forces operator by the name of Lyn Cassady who lets Wilton in on some of his most closely guarded secrets.Based on the book by Jon Ralston, 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' claims to be based on fact.As that rare dark satire that takes on militarism and war as targets, Grant Heslov's 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' gets more points for guts and daring than it does for execution. Its points often lack clarity and focus and the hijinks occasionally feel too much like leftovers from 'MASH' and 'Catch-22' for total comfort. Yet, there are enough offbeat and humorous moments to more than compensate for the frequent concept that backfires or the occasional joke that falls flat. The basic premise of the story seems to be that since war is the province of madmen and fools, who better fit to wage it? And in the topsy-turvy world of Peter Straughan's screenplay, even the counterculture concept of hippy-dippy pacifism gets co-opted by the military machine.The acting throughout is first-rate. George Clooney is so entertaining as the half-brilliant/half-mad Cassady that he makes the movie worth seeing for his performance alone. Add to that a host of fine performances by Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey and you have a flawed but occasionally compelling work",6,0,2,9 May 2011
Spider-Man," not up there with other comic book movies
","Perhaps it isn't all `Spider-Man's fault that it was released 24 years after the original `Superman' or 13 years after the original `Batman' movies.  But the fact is that those films beat this new film considerably to the punch, which probably explains why `Spider-Man,' for all its sophisticated special effects, feels decidedly Old Hat  especially compared to the infinitely more complex and sophisticated `X-Men' from a few years back, not to mention the brilliant `Darkman' from way back in 1990.  That last comparison is particularly apt since' Spider-Man's director, Sam Raimi, virtually cut his teeth on that film.  In `Darkman,' Raimi brought a seriousness of purpose and a uniqueness of vision to the project that helped to carry the comic book movie genre to new artistic heights.  `Spider-Man,' though inoffensive, seems bland and benign in comparison, calculated to reach the widest audience possible (which apparently it has succeeded in doing, a fact that says less about the quality of the movie, perhaps, than about the undemanding tastes of modern moviegoers).`Spider-Man' seems so by-the-book in its narrative, tone and purpose that it never soars much above the ordinary and never carries the audience to the kind of exciting, visionary world one would expect from a film of this type. The movie is blessed in one all-important respect though: its inspired decision to cast Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, a mild mannered nerd who becomes a super hero after he's bitten by a genetically altered spider.  Maguire's winning and disarming performance is the film's one incontestable virtue.  All else seems problematic, beginning with the storyline, which plays virtually by rote.  One needn't list all the conventional elements, starting with the poor, picked-on geek who can't get the girl he loves to even acknowledge his existence, the loving, older guardians who support their boy in everything he does, the tortured super villain (in this case, the Green Goblin) who is both the hero's alter ego as well as his arch nemesis.  All this is, of course, par for the course, but I guess the thing I object to the most is that the tone is simply too innocuous and sunny.  The film can't generate any real suspense or excitement because the threats seem so halfhearted.  By the same token, the film doesn't have much of a playful spirit either.  The love scenes between Spider-Man and his truelove, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), work only because the actors themselves are so likable in the roles.  Otherwise, the romantic element is as underwhelming and clichéd as virtually every other feature of the film.  Probably the most unaccountable aspect of the plot is that, despite the fact that Spider-Man does only good for the citizens of Manhattan, we keep being told that the citizens are ambiguous in their attitudes towards him.  Yet, we are given no reason to credit this possibility for even a split second.  It is an arbitrary plot device thrown in to try and generate some desperately needed suspense in an admittedly pretty lackluster screenplay.Which pretty much leaves us with the special effects.  Though adequate at times, many of the shots of Spider-Man swooping along the streets of New York City, his web suspended from the tops of skyscrapers, seem strangely unconvincing.  Perhaps since we feel no immediate involvement in the proceedings, the special effects sequences never manage to catch us up in the excitement of what they are showing us.   One keeps hoping and expecting to be carried away by the film, but it simply never happens.`Spider-Man' simply does not rate the box office revenue it has earned.",Null,0,0,15 June 2002
Jarhead," very impressive, thoughtful war drama
","'Jarhead' is a war movie not really about war. Rather, it's about that strange time before war, when young men and boys are trained to kill without hesitation or remorse, when group-think and group cohesion become the goal of every soldier, and when the boredom and tedium of waiting for the enemy to strike can be almost as unnerving and unbearable as the horrors of war itself.The film is based on the true story of Anthony Swofford (superbly embodied by Jake Gyllenhaal), a Marine sniper who served in the Gulf War in 1991. The story begins in 1989, as Anthony is undergoing the grueling rigors of boot camp training. When Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait, Anthony is shipped off to the Middle East as part of the operation known as Desert Shield, soon to become Desert Storm. For Anthony and his fellow Marine sharpshooters, it is the waiting that turns out to be the least endurable aspect of the assignment, as they battle the discomforts of life in the Arabian Desert - and often each other.At no time does 'Jarhead' pretend to be anything other than the story of one particular soldier in one particular war; we never get the sense that Anthony is supposed to be representative of all Marines at any given time. As such, the movie eschews politics and philosophy, avoids heavy-handed moralizing and preaching, and refuses to either glorify or denigrate the men who are its subjects. Instead, it keeps it all life-sized and realistic, showing us how ordinary men cope with the extraordinary life of being a Marine in times of peace as well as times of war. Writer William Broyles Jr. makes every moment count as each of the major characters confronts some sort of personal demon, although Broyles never overstates the issues or indulges in cheap theatrics or hyperbole. The men remain complex and real, with each character drawing both strength and weakness from those around him.Director Sam Mendes keeps the scale intimate and the story tightly focused on the interplay between the men, reserving most of the actual fighting scenes for the final act. The film is filled with memorable moments and unforgettable images that often border on the surrealistic: the boys achieving a near-orgasmic frenzy watching the helicopter scene in 'Apocalypse Now;' their stumbling upon endless rows of burned-out vehicles filled with charred corpses of fleeing civilians; oil from set-afire wells raining down from ink-black clouds, turning day into night and covering the earth with a thick coating of sludge and ooze; an oil-drenched horse mysteriously emerging out of nowhere only to disappear back into the vast wasteland of the ruined, darkened landscape. The film is worth seeing for its imagery alone.Those seeking a traditional war film - one heavily laden with booming artillery and graphic battle scenes - may find 'Jarhead' a bit of a slow go at times, but those in the mood for a film about personal relationships set in a military context will find much to celebrate in this movie.",8,1,2,29 November 2005
Shrek Forever After," definite uptick in quality
","As 'Shrek Forever After' opens, the warmhearted ogre is suffering through a bit of a midlife crisis. Having been firmly ensconced in marital and domestic bliss for quite some time now, Shrek suddenly finds himself pining for the days when he could be a real, full-time ogre, roaming the countryside and terrorizing the general populace - instead of changing diapers, pushing strollers, and signing autographs for fans who remember those long-gone glory days when he could still strike fear into the hearts of men.In the 'be careful what you wish for/you don't know what you've got till it's gone' scenario that Josh Klausner and Darren Lemke have concocted for this fourth entry in the series, Shrek (Mike Myers) allows himself to be tricked into essentially signing his life away to the dastardly Rumpelstiltskin (the excellent Walt Dohrn) in exchange for a chance to once again become a full-fledged, undomesticated ogre for a day. We then get a new spin on 'It's a Wonderful Life,' as Shrek learns what the world would have been like had he never been born. He also has to get Fiona (Cameron Diaz) – the beautiful princess by day/ugly ogre by night who, in this alternate universe, is now the leader of a band of freedom-fighting ogres – to fall in love with him all over again.Though a definite improvement over the drab and disappointing 'Shrek the Third' from 2007, 'Shrek Forever After,' directed by Mike Mitchell, never quite achieves the level of cleverness and wit that the first two installments did – which is a high bar indeed for anyone in this business. Still, the mix of Fractured Fairy Tale revisionism, pop culture references and recognizable pop tunes remains a winning one for the most part, and there is just enough sentiment to lift our spirits without stranding us in a puddle of goo. Plus, all the great sidekicks are back, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas), and Cookie (Craig Robinson), and the voice work and animation are, as always, first-rate. In fact the voice-over cast reads like a who's-who of well-known actors and performers: Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Jon Hamm ('Mad Men'), Jane Lynch ('Glee'), Kathy Griffin, Mary Kay Place, Meredith Vieira, Ryan Seacrest, Regis Philbin and Larry King. Not a bad little group that.",8,0,0,7 July 2011
Collateral," first rate thriller...up to a point
","What happens when a working class stiff - you know, a decent human being and a live-and-let-live Average Joe type - finds himself face to face with Evil incarnate? Well, that's exactly what happens to a cab driver named Max in Michael Mann's allegorical thriller 'Collateral,' a sharply-defined morality tale that unfolds on the freeways and surface streets of after-hours Los Angeles.'Collateral' is that rare crime drama that is more concerned with theme and character than with the mechanics of the crime - at least until the movie shatters to pieces in its closing reel, that is. But for starters, writer Stuart Beattie has come up with a humdinger of a premise to get the ball rolling. Max has been driving a cab for twelve years now, but he still has dreams of owning a fancy limo company one day, then retiring to his own private little island getaway in the South Seas. One fateful night, he picks up a fare who will end up changing his life forever. Vincent is a paid assassin who virtually kidnaps Max, forcing him to drive him around town so he can track down and execute his assigned hits. Max can do little but look on helplessly as he gets pulled further and further into this cat-and-mouse game of cold-blooded murder.'Collateral' is, above all, an actor's film, as two intriguing characters square off in a fascinating duel of wills. As Max, Jamie Foxx beautifully captures the subtle intensity of a man, passive and humanistic by nature, who is forced to participate in what is to him an incomprehensible case of ritualized slaughter. Tom Cruise, cast against type as an unshaven, salt-and-pepper-haired villain, is chilling as a steely-eyed killer seemingly cut off from even the most basic human emotions of empathy and concern for one's fellow man. Together, these two fine actors draw us into their epic struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil, with the latter seemingly holding most of the cards.The movie is filled with moments of extraordinary suspense and tension as Vincent and Max act out their human drama against the backdrop of a beautifully filmed LA at night - with Mann showing, once again, as he did in 'Heat,' that no director captures that milieu with greater precision than he does. Moreover, the moody soundtrack provides a perfect, otherworldly complement to the slightly surreal story unraveling on screen.Unfortunately, 'Collateral' falls apart long about the last half hour, as the plot mechanics take over and the characters become pawns in the hands of an out-of-control screenwriter who obviously could find no workable way to bring his tale to a satisfying conclusion. The tension in the first three-quarters of the film derives from our knowledge that Vincent has, for all intents and purposes, caught Max in a snare from which he cannot escape. Thus, that cab becomes a crucial factor in the human drama taking place within its restrictive confines. But once Max and Vincent leave the cab and become separated in the closing stretches, we lose that sense of claustrophobic entrapment so essential to the tale, and most of the tension evaporates. Thus, what starts off as a severely circumscribed tale of two men caught in their own private little hell ultimately devolves into a damsel-in-distress, knight-in-shining-armor action fantasy that undercuts the realism and seriousness of all that came before.Still, taken as a whole, 'Collateral' is a thriller well worth watching.",7,44,57,3 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," enjoyable entry in the series
","Harry and his wand-waving friends return in 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' the third in the series of high-flying adventures by British author J.K. Rowling.This latest film finds a more grownup Harry being pursued by the evil Sirius Black, who has just performed the unprecedented feat of escaping from a prison for wayward warlocks. As Sirius moves inexorably closer to his intended victim, Harry learns some surprising details about the murder of his beloved parents.'The Prisoner of Azkaban' is a pretty decent installment overall, although it could use some tightening here and there to make it more streamlined and evenly paced (the film runs an overlong two hours and twenty-two minutes). The production design and special effects are as stunning as ever, as once again we are transported to a visually beautiful world of unbridled fantasy and imagination. One of the reasons why the Harry Potter works are so popular is that they root their stories in characters who are realistic and believable, so that even amidst all the riding of brooms, casting of spells and reciting of incantations, Harry, Ron and Hermione are able to keep their feet on the ground and their hold on the audience.Although many people have noted a 'darker' element running through this film, I really didn't see it, and, in fact, I think 'Prisoner' is less intense than the second - and best - installment, 'Chamber of Secrets.' Although there seems to be enough creativity in the original concept to support a few more 'Potter' movies, even Potter-maniacs may feel that at least some of the bloom has begun to fade from this particular rose. I guess only future installments will truly tell.",7,0,1,11 May 2005
Ratatouille," Bon Appetit
","The city of Paris has never looked better - more richly-hued and elegant - than it does in 'Ratatouille,' the latest product from Pixar Entertainment and the umpteenth animated film featuring an anthropomorphic animal as its lead character.Brad Bird's confection brings two unlikely elements - food and rodents - together in its clever story of a rat with a passion for gourmet cooking who teams up with a newly hired 'garbage boy' to surreptitiously whip up a whole host of savory dishes at an upscale restaurant located on the West Bank of Paris.'Ratatouille' is somewhat more cerebral and considerably less frenetic than the typical Pixar production, which may prove problematic for some of the younger folk in the audience. And, indeed, there are times when the pacing does tend to drag a bit even for more seasoned moviegoers like myself. Still, the action scenes are palpitating in their energy and excitement, and even those jaded by the unimaginable strides made in CGI technology over the years will be properly bowled over by what the filmmakers have managed to pull off here. The sheer fluidity of movement alone in this film is draw-dropping in its impressiveness. The story is rather less compelling overall, but one has to admire Bird's willingness to keep the drama at least somewhat intimate and life-sized. The price of that subtlety, however, is that the movie is also a trifle dull in spots.The film is highly blessed with energetic voice work by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole, and, above all, Janeane Garofalo as a high-strung, up-and-coming chef who doesn't take too kindly to fresh-out-of-the-oven competitors encroaching on her territory.But it is the exquisitely designed backdrops that finally make 'Ratatouille' a thing of joy and beauty.

The Lego Movie," Full of energy and imagination
","The cheerfully dystopic 'The Lego Movie' is like a family-friendly version of 'A Brave New World,' with a little bit of 'The Matrix' thrown in for good measureEmmet Brickowski is a rule-following, law-abiding 'good citizen,' just like all the other countless conformist drones who make up the futuristic society in which he lives. Only Emmet is even more average than the average Average Joe, as evidenced by the fact that even the people he works with aren't really sure who he is. In true dystopic fashion, he lives in a society that demands unthinking and unquestioning obedience to the status quo, making it easier for those in positions of authority - particularly the arch-villain Lord Business - to accrue ever more power without any pesky resistance from the effectively pacified unwashed masses. Until, that is, Emmet is informed that, unlikely as it may seem, he just may be the long-awaited Messianic figure, know as The Master Builder, whom, it has been prophesied, will one day appear on the scene to mount a revolt against the tyrannical system and lead his fellow citizens to freedom.Even though he's essentially an animated Lego figure, Emmet turns out to be the single most endearing everyman hero we've been asked to fall in line behind in quite some time. And the always under-appreciated Chris Pratt ('Everwood,' 'Parks and Recreation,' 'Guardians of the Galaxy') deserves much of the credit for that. So, too, do the writers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who co-directed the film as well.To add to the spirit of anarchic fun, a host of historical and pop culture figures, from Lincoln and Shakespeare to Superman and Batman to the casts of 'Harry Potter' and 'Star Wars,' make cameo appearances in the film.There's also a parallel story that takes place in the 'real world' that underlines the part imagination and role-playing have in bringing people together.Imaginative plotting, first-rate animation and sharp, snappy writing - backed by outstanding voice work by Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman - instantly place 'The Lego Movie' in the pantheon of great computer- animated films.",8,1,3,3 August 2014
The Fast and the Furious," begins well then careens downhill
","In its early stages, `The Fast and the Furious' offers promise that it will become a kind of street-smart, urban version of `American Graffiti' for the new millennium.  It is, alas, a promise that goes largely unfulfilled when the film decides to go the `Donnie Brasco' route instead (although this ain't no `Donnie Brasco').  Like `American Graffiti,' this movie peers into a culture centered largely around automobiles  although in this case it involves high-speed street racing rather than mere cruising.  Unlike Lucas' classic, however, `The Fast and the Furious' betrays its milieu by incorporating a trite tale of an undercover cop (cherubic, squeaky-clean Paul Walker) sent in to infiltrate the cruisers led by Vin Diesel, who appear to be running an elaborate, but actually rather incredible and impracticable, truck hijacking business.  Thus, we are left to endure the inevitable moral conflicts that arise when the cop falls in love with the leader's sister and he begins to feel `sympathy' for the man he is supposed to betray. We could forgive the fact that the dialogue is incredibly inane and the characterizations nonexistent if the film had at least stayed true to its first 40 minutes of nonstop action.  Director Rob Cohen brings a real style and feeling for visual composition to these early scenes, punctuated by incredible stunt work and lightning-paced editing.  The film also captures the feel of urban street rhythms in its musical soundtrack (although you may feel somewhat assaulted by all the visual and aural over-stimulation if you happen to be 25 years of age or older).  In fact, if `The Fast and the Furious' had stayed in this mode throughout, it might even have become an epochal film for the teens of its era.  In this early part, the film's characters pose and strut and drip attitude in a way that becomes emblematic of the trendy youth culture of the time.  Instead, the film becomes just another trite police melodrama straight off the film-factory assembly line. 
That's really a shame because the stunt work is phenomenal throughout, and Vin Diesel conveys a kind of raw animal magnetism that bodes well for his future in action cinema.  He has a way of commanding the audience's attention every time he makes an appearance on screen.  The cars too are spectacular, although they are so overloaded with computer gizmos and jet propulsion devices that one begins to wonder if NASA itself didn't design and build them.Had it been willing to forego the standard plot mechanics and been content to afford us a glimpse into the life of the street-racing culture, `The Fast and the Furious' might have ended up as a `classic' of youth action cinema. Instead, it becomes just another dumb movie with some really neat car chases.",Null,2,5,19 February 2002
Control," subtle, well-acted docudrama
","'Control' is a biopic about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the 1970's British rock band Joy Division, who killed himself in 1980 immediately before the group was to embark on its first American tour. The movie chronicles Curtis' early days in Manchester, the formation and rise of the band, his unhappy marriage, his serial philandering, his uncontrollable epilepsy, and his lifelong battle with depression.One might be tempted, looking at the bareboned detailing of his life, to ask if there is really anything new here. And indeed, Curtis' story seems to follow a fairly standard arc for the lives of artists in general and rock musicians in particular (though there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of illicit drug use going on in this case), and as such the movie doesn't show us much of anything we haven't already seen countless times before in similar works. Yet, 'Control' is so cool, understated and restrained in its handling of the material that it succeeds in drawing us into the lives of these characters in spite of the over-familiarity of the tale. The conflicts are real and the emotions raw, particularly when dealing with Curtis' rocky relationship with his wife, Deborah, who loved Ian unconditionally but could never get him to reciprocate those feelings, partly because Ian had fallen in love with a Belgian fan he met while on tour.In a beautifully controlled and thoughtful performance, Sam Riley poignantly captures the sadness that seems to lie ever present at the core of Curtis' being, while Samantha Morton conveys the almost desperate state of a woman too much in love to realize, until it is too late perhaps, that she isn't receiving love in return (the Matt Greenhalgh screenplay is based largely on Deborah's memoirs chronicling their time together). Much of the anguish Curtis went through in his life served as source material for the lyrics to many of the group's songs, a number of which are used to provide a running commentary throughout the film. The movie also makes effective use of voice-over narration to try to figure out what is going on in that troubled head of his.For his impressive directorial debut, photographer Anton Corbijn has wisely chosen to shoot his film in artful black-and-white, the better to capture the starkness of the scene and the state of his character's mind. Joy Division purists may object to the fact that Corbijn has had the actors themselves perform the songs rather than dubbing in the originals, but they do a fine job overall in interpreting the pieces.Whether Curtis, in the long run, had a harder life than many who don't wind up committing suicide is not for us to determine. What the film does make clear, however, is that once he felt he was losing control over his life (symbolized by his constant and seemingly incurable epileptic seizures) and had pretty much made a mess of things as a husband, a father and a lover, his purpose for continuing in the struggle seemed to have disappeared. What a sad conclusion to come to, especially when one is only twenty-three years old. With subtlety and insight, 'Control' movingly distills the essence of that sadness.",8,3,4,3 August 2008
Now You See Me," A Hollywood blockbuster that's actually fun
","Sort of a modern-day version of 'Charade' (much better than the ACTUAL modern-day remake, 'The Truth About Charlie'), 'Now You See Me' is a phenomenally entertaining piece of prestidigitation about four street magicians - Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Isla Fischer - who form an act called The Four Horsemen, whose claim to fame is that they have the ability to rob banks without leaving the arena where they're performing. Like the Stanely Donen classic, 'Now You See Me' is built on a series of plot twists and character turns in which no one or nothing is quite what he, she or it appears to be.The always engaging Mark Ruffalo is the skeptical FBI agent trying to catch the criminals in the act, while old pros Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman have the time of their professional lives as a veteran magician and a veteran magician debunker, respectively. Their scenes together are alone worth the price of admission. And Ruffalo is perfection as the slightly disheveled and perpetually outmaneuvered law enforcer who finds himself up against a quartet of antagonists who always manage to be a good half-dozen or so steps ahead of him.It's hard to overstate just how much fun this movie turns out to be, with well-earned kudos going to Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt for their infinitely imaginative screenplay, Louis Leterrier for his turbocharged direction, and all the technical wizards who've engaged in a little legerdemain of their own by making the magic scenes so seamless and convincing.And if it all doesn't seem entirely plausible in the end, and you walk away with the nagging suspicion that the writers must have cheated in some way - well, that IS the power of magic, after all.Hollywood filmmakers please take note: THIS is how you make a crowd-pleasing blockbuster!",8,0,3,30 November 2013
Ocean's Eleven," a pleasant souffle of a film
","Steven Soderbergh's remake of `Ocean's Eleven' is a stylish heist picture featuring some of the brightest stars in moviemaking today.  The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. Taking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.A film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   Unlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?",Null,72,84,27 July 2002
Spirited Away," a minority dissenting view
","In Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated feature, `Spirited Away,' a young girl by the name of Chihiro and her parents stumble across an abandoned `amusement park' that turns out to be a mysterious bathhouse for the spirit world (a la `Carnival of Souls').  After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that `Spirited Away' might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.   The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do. For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?    The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that `Spirited Away' has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well. 
`Spirited Away' offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care.",Null,32,45,3 May 2003
Pearl Harbor," great action scenes; dreadful story
","One can only speculate about how great a part timing plays in determining whether or not any particular film is a success or failure at the box office.  I suspect that had `Pearl Harbor' been released three or four months later than it was  in say September rather than June of 2001  it might have been able to ride the wave of renewed American patriotism that accompanied that other Day of Infamy, the September 11th terrorist attacks - and found itself some true financial glory.   As it is, the film will probably now enjoy a more lucrative life in its home video incarnation than it might otherwise have done under more normal circumstances.  So I guess, in some ways, the film's timing ends up being fortuitous after all.  
Even from the start, one could see that `Pearl Harbor' was designed as a bald-faced attempt to replicate the unprecedented success of `Titanic.'  One is only amazed at how completely it fails.  In both films a simplistic love story has been grafted onto an historic event of monumental tragedy, one that is familiar to the audience beforehand, comes mostly at the end, and offers scads of special effects wizards gainful employment in bringing the episode to life on the screen.  In many ways, `Pearl Harbor' is simply the biggest, loudest and costliest example of that strange hybrid genre known as the `chick flick/war movie.'  (In this way, I guess filmmakers feel they have the whole date-night crowd covered).  Somehow, one expects to find romance on a cruise ship.  It feels right there.  A romantic story seems somehow less apropos as the foundation for a film on this particular subject.  In fact, the love triangle scenario that makes up fully the first half of this film's enormous three-hour running time is of such surpassing banality that one begins to wonder if anyone bothered to read the script before the actors were pushed out in front of the cameras.  For it is quite obvious that all the creative minds engaged in bringing this film to completion were focused far more on the massive reconstructed sets, elaborate explosions and jaw dropping special effects than on anything so simple and banal as character development or thematic depth.
It would be hard to imagine three less interesting characters than Rafe (catch the All-American hero name yet!), Danny and Evelyn to serve as the focal point for a film on this important a subject.  The first two (played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are childhood buddies, now turned bomber pilots, who happen to fall in love with the same beautiful nurse (played by Kate Beckinsale).  Just think back to the complex characters at the core of `From Here to Eternity.'  In that film, so absorbing and grand were those figures and the situations in which they found themselves that the Pearl Harbor attack actually stayed, for the most part, in the background.  In `Pearl Harbor,' we are never allowed to forget that the sole purpose for the movie's existence is the attack sequence.  Every moment of the first half is painful to watch  from the awkward and silly first meetings, to the sappy and drippy love scenes, to the inevitable fistfight between the two best friends just hours before they will be called upon to demonstrate brotherhood in action for a greater cause.  Rick, the main character in `Casablanca,' uttered the famous truism that the travails of three insignificant people don't `amount to a hill of beans' in the face of events of global importance  and that philosophy has never seemed more on the money than in the case of `Pearl Harbor.'  But then when you are fretting over making back those untold millions you've lavished on your star-studded production, you don't dare allow yourself to entertain such subversive thoughts.  I hate to have to say this but the pasteboard love story that weakly props up `Pearl Harbor' ends up being an insult to both those who survived and those who perished in the holocaust.What is NOT an insult to their memories, however, is the attack sequence itself.  Here the wretched movie almost redeems itself, for not only is this scene breathtakingly realized in its complexity and scope, but it also captures the poignancy of the devastation in amazingly graphic terms. The gruesomeness of much of the death and carnage put before us makes us fully appreciate, for the first time I think, the enormity of the horror and suffering that accompanied that event.  `Pearl Harbor' justifies its brilliant excesses by bringing this moment to epic life for a whole generation who has heretofore probably encountered it only as a highlighted study note in some dry high school or college textbook.   For a glorious half hour or so, the filmmakers husband all the resources of modern special effects to plunge us into an epochal moment in our nation's history.  Herr, indeed, is technological excess employed in a salutary purpose.
The advantage in seeing `Pearl Harbor' on video rather than in the theatre is that, in the latter venue, one could only snooze through the torpid first half and wake refreshed when the bombs started dropping and the guns firing. Now, with the power of the remote in one's hand, one can simply fast forward to all the good parts and leave the sappy ones behind.",Null,1,3,2 January 2002
Tropic Thunder," outlandish spoof of movies and movie-making
","'Tropic Thunder' wears its political incorrectness as a badge of honor. With one white actor appearing in black face and another portraying a drooling, buck-toothed mentally retarded man, this big budget spoof of big budget movie-making is guaranteed to raise the hackles of a sizable chunk of the movie going public. Yet, my suspicion is that an even larger segment will be laughing right along with this loony satire that also takes on Hollywood values, movie industry insiders and action movie clichés at the same time.It seems that every time a movie is set in an exotic locale, we are treated to stories about how the actors took part in some sort of movie 'boot camp' to 'toughen them up' for the ordeal ahead and to add a note of authenticity to their performances. 'Tropic Thunder' has fun with that practice by dropping five pampered movie stars, dressed in full army fatigues and regalia, into the jungles of Vietnam as preparation for the mega-budget war picture they are currently appearing in. Unfortunately, make-believe quickly turns into reality when the quintet runs into some dangerous drug dealers who don't much care for these warlike intruders suddenly invading their turf.Out of this setup, writers Ben Stiller (who also stars in and directed the film), Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen have fashioned a lively and frequently hilarious tale of clashing egos and comic misunderstandings that isn't afraid to cross over the line into tastelessness and vulgarity if that's what the material calls for. Robert Downey, Jr. steals the show as Kirk Lazarus, an Australian actor from the Lee Strasburg school of method acting, who has gone so far as to employ pigment-altering treatments as a means of fully immersing himself in the character he is playing, a bad-ass black man replete with fro wig and jive accent. Stiller is Tugg Speedman, a once sure-fire box office attraction whose recent career downturn has forced him to take roles in small, independent productions like 'Simple Jack,' in which he plays the part of a mentally retarded farm boy in the most offensive way imaginable (this has caused the film to be picketed by a number of anti-discrimination advocacy groups). Jack Black appears as Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted actor who goes into serious withdrawals after his secret slash of blow is swiped by a frenzied bat. Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson round out the thespian five-some as, respectively, a conscientious actor (he's actually read the script and the book on which it's based) and a rapper hoping to make it big in the movies.Other noteworthy performers include Tom Cruise, barely recognizable beneath a scruffy beard, bald plate and prosthetic fat suit, as a manic, cutthroat producer who's more than willing to sacrifice his own actors if doing so will help to insure the bottom-line for the studio; Matthew McConaughey, as a frantic agent fully dedicated to fulfilling every wish of his demanding client; Nick Nolte, as a disabled Vietnam vet whose alleged personal experiences in combat serve as the basis for the film being made; and Danny McBride, as a special effects engineer who's finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between a squib he planted and an actual explosion set off by the heavily armed dealers.Though 'Tropic Thunder' is primarily an actors' picture, the performers would not have been able to pull it off without being handed such solid material to work with. In spite of a few inevitable dry spots and the occasional joke that simply doesn't work, the script deftly mixes sophisticated satire with lowbrow buffoonery. Not surprisingly, given its pedigree, the film is very knowing about the whole Hollywood scene, managing to parody war movie clichés right along with all the behind-the-scenes insider stuff related to the industry, particularly the demands and pressures involved in high stakes movie-making.And it is a tribute to the makers of 'Tropic Thunder' that they've not only refused to buckle under to those pressures, but that they've made attacking those pressures the very purpose of their movie. There is no doubt that many viewers are not going to be quite as charitable in their assessment of this film as I have been, and that is certainly their prerogative. But when so many Hollywood comedies these days are forced by the demands of bottom-line corporate interests into being as bland and inoffensive as possible, it's nice to come across one that is actually willing to take some risks once in awhile. In this case, at least, it would appear as if those risks have finally paid off.",8,1,4,13 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Pass the aspirin
","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is a youth-oriented comedy that is destined to divide audiences into two diametrically opposed camps: those who see it as a brilliantly creative and satirical take on modern adolescence, and those who see it as a migraine-inducing, insufferably pretentious exercise in self-conscious self-indulgence that has desperation written all over it. The movie is definitely an acquired taste, but one thing is for certain: very few who see it will be indifferent to it.Based on the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is a highly stylized, non-linear account of a 22-year-old geek (played, as always, by Michael Cera) and his surrealistic adventures with his friends and band mates (the cast is indeed enormous) – who are a combination of dorks and Goths and just about everything in between – as they do battle against evil forces, most of them former boyfriends of his current flame (Alison Pill), in snowy Toronto. Writers Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright's attempt to transfer the look and style of graphic literature to the big screen meets with only modest success here (Wright also directed the movie), and it's not too long into the film's nonstop assault on the senses that we're compelled to holler 'Uncle!' purely out of self-defense.The is-it-a-dream-or-is-it-reality? narrative framework, the frenetic editing, the robotic line-readings, and the words constantly flying all over the screen have a certain novelty and charm at the beginning, but they quickly wear out their welcome – as well as the audience's patience – and all we're left with is a profound sense of relief once the whole thing is finally over.Despite the best of intentions in wanting to do something a little bit different for a change, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' still comes across as a 'cult classic' trying just a little too hard to become a 'cult classic.'",Null,3,5,23 August 2011
Enchanted," thin but enjoyable fantasy
","'Enchanted' is a fish-out-of-water tale that is also an homage to 'Snow White,' 'Sleeping Beauty,' 'Mary Poppins,' and countless other Disney classics that have come before it. Here, a fairy tale princess (Amy Adams) crosses over from the world of animation to the world of live-action, without losing her cheery disposition and otherworldly charm in the process.On the day she is to be wed to her long-awaited Prince Charming, the beautiful Giselle is tossed out of the storybook kingdom of Analasia by a jealous evil queen (Susan Sarandon) who has no intention of letting some pretty little upstart usurp her throne. When Giselle finally finishes falling, she lands smack dab in the middle of a live-action Manhattan that is only a tad less immaculate and a shade less colorful than the cel-animated world she calls home. The plucky heroine is both dazzled and a bit confused by this strange looking world where the people don't seem quite as friendly or optimistic about life as the inhabitants of Analasia. Giselle is befriended by an unromantic, decidedly commitment-phobic divorce attorney (Patrick Dempsey) who doesn't know quite what to make of this odd, undoubtedly deranged creature who, when she isn't inspiring critters to help her tidy up the apartment or breaking out into full-throated, spontaneous song, is extolling the virtues of true love and declaring her undying faith in happily-ever-after endings.Most of the fun of 'Enchanted' lies in watching this almost impossibly cheerful, utterly imperturbable former cartoon character going up against the harsh realities of the real world (as harsh as the 'real world' in any Disney film can be, that is), yet maintaining her sunny disposition throughout. The filmmakers have devised some spot-on parodies of the typical Disney musical number, replete with high-pitched warbling, a chorus of singing animals, and lyrics that reflect an unquenchable conviction that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. At times, the idea of the film is better than its execution, opting, as it often does, for silliness and strained slapstick over sophistication and wit. And sometimes, even the concept itself falls flat, as when we are left to ponder whether these creatures, with their weird behavior and exotic garb, would really be all that out of place in Times Square. And, regrettably, the filmmakers couldn't resist throwing an utterly superfluous, CGI-generated dragon into the mix at the end.Yet, for the most part, the movie is clever, bright and beguiling, and boasts a wonderfully ditzy performance by the lovely Miss Adams that brings the whole sugarcoated confection to life. The material many be stretched a bit beyond its breaking point, but 'Enchanted' casts a spell over its audience anyway.",7,0,2,21 May 2008
Inside Out," Imaginative and insightful
","I may be going out on a limb here, but it's probably safe to say that 'Inside Out' is the first mainstream animated feature film to be entirely centered around a seriously depressed child. The reason Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is so depressed is that the personified emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) - that are responsible for keeping her psyche running smoothly have been seriously flubbing up of late. So much so that Riley runs the risk of experiencing a full mental breakdown if the emotional team can't retrieve all the core happy memories from Riley's childhood that are rapidly slipping away.Imaginatively conceived by Pete Docter, Meg Lefauve, Josh Cooley and director Ronnie del Carmen, 'Inside Out' takes place in two entirely distinct realms: first, in the 'real' world, where a young girl has been dragged by her well-meaning but oblivious parents (Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Lane) from Minnesota to their new home in San Francisco; and, second, in the complex inner workings of said child's brain - a place filled with personality islands and memory balls all operated by the aforementioned Emotions from a giant console. Rare for a movie aimed primarily at children, 'Inside Out' is psychologically astute in its observations about human nature while remaining fanciful and childlike in tone and attitude. It explores the things that really matter to a youngster who's suddenly been yanked from a world where everything is comfortable and familiar to one where everything is unsettling and strange. The movie also points out how even the most well-intentioned of adults often fail to take into account children's very real feelings at crucial moments in their lives. On a technical level, 'Inside Out' comes replete with all the visually stunning graphics, fast-paced storytelling, and outstanding voice work that we've long associated with any computer-animated feature produced by Pixar Studios. But it's the less tangible elements of heart and imagination that truly count in this work.",7,3,21,15 April 2016
Resident Evil," Living Dead rehash
","Sort of a `Night of the Living Dead' for the cybernetic generation, `Resident Evil' features a group of people trapped in a futuristic subterranean biological weapons laboratory who are forced to do battle against a host of mutant, flesh-eating zombies.  Based on a popular video game, the movie feels like virtually every other film in which characters are trapped in an enclosed setting where they find themselves being systematically knocked off one by one courtesy of some malevolent, super-human force.  (Think `Alien,' think `Invisible Man,' think `Deep Blue Sea,' think `The Thing,' think several dozen other movies).  But `Resident Evil' is not content to steal merely from those movies.  We are also treated to the slow-motion, suspended-in-midair kickboxing moves from `The Matrix' as well as the slide-and-dice laser beam from `Cube,' which manages to leave body parts galore strewn all over a shiny hallway floor.Perhaps because the characters all seem to look and sound so much alike, I kept getting the impression that the filmmakers were reusing the same actors in different parts.  How else to account for the fact that characters seemed to die in one scene, only to be miraculously resurrected for the next?  (And I'm not talking about the zombies here).  Or perhaps it is simply because the screenplay allows so few of them to distinguish themselves as individuals that we end up getting that impression.  Though the art direction and special effects are state-of-the-art, the script seems woefully undernourished.   But then again, this has become far more the rule than the exception in this particular genre of late.`Resident Evil' actually has a rather intriguing beginning and a very effective (and brave) ending.  It's too bad that so much of what comes in between the beginning and the end reeks of second-rate horror movie theatrics.  `Resident Evil' is nothing more than George Romero given a hollow, modern sheen.",Null,0,2,2 August 2002

The Butterfly Effect," intriguing time-bending thriller
","Have you ever wondered how differently your life might have turned out had you taken a left turn instead of a right on the day of that fateful accident, or chosen a different college or career path, or not gone to that dance the night you met your one true love?  All of us have played this `what if' game at some point in our lives, speculating about where we might be, whom we might know and what we might be doing now if even a single event in our past had played out differently.  And how many of us would be willing to return to a key moment in our past if we knew that, by doing something different, we could forever alter the path our life ended up taking?  And what if we discovered that by undoing that event we ended up altering our lives and the lives of those around us in ways we never expected?  Would we still want to do it?This is the premise for `The Butterfly Effect,' an effectively creepy supernatural thriller that boasts a star-making performance by Ashton Kutcher.  Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a young man in college who, since his childhood, has been suffering inexplicable blackouts at key traumatic moments in his life.  And traumatic his life has been!  His father is consigned to a mental institution, suffering from an ailment that may have been passed on to his son.  In addition, Evan is friends with a young girl, Kayley, whose father sexually abuses not only her but Evan as well.  Kayley also has a sadistic little brother named Lenny, who inspires Evan, Kayley and a neighbor friend of theirs to perform malicious pranks and even sets Evan's dog on fire.  Now that he's in college, Evan discovers he has the power to transport himself back in time to many of these key moments in his life in an attempt to rewrite history and undo the mental and psychological damage they've caused.  The trouble is that Evan finds out that changing the course of history often brings a whole host of other unforeseen and unanticipated problems right along with it.Directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have fashioned a complex, intricate screenplay filled with plot twists that continually alter the plane of the film's reality.  The story hurtles us back and forth in time, showing us what was, what is and then what might have been without a moment's confusion, all the while making us question whether Evan isn't simply insane after all.  There are a few, perhaps inevitable, plot holes, the most glaring of which is why Evan is unable to find out how a prank he and his friends committed in their childhood turned tragically wrong (Evan blacked out during the event).  Considering the fact that the tragedy was one that became common knowledge in the small town in which Evan lived, it is highly implausible that he would have to wait till his early Â‘20's before he finally found out what had happened.  In addition, one might question the propriety of using a topic as sensitive as pedophilia for a supernatural thriller.  Still, those are minor quibbles for a story that works remarkably well at keeping itself credible and focused despite the inherent absurdity at its core. Kutcher does an effective job carrying the film.  By not being too handsome or too heroic, Kutcher keeps Evan life-sized and interesting.  We're willing to follow him through this elaborate labyrinth because we can identify with the truths of his character.  He's a young man who genuinely wants to make things better for the people he cares for, yet the mental anguish he is going through as he attempts to piece together some semblance of comprehensible reality from the jumbled fragments of his life comes through loud and clear.`The Butterfly Effect' is not your usual mind-numbing, schlock thriller.  It has intelligence and style and a very intriguing storyline.  It will probably get you rewinding some of those key events in your own life, wondering might have been.",Null,4,11,4 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," pallid, unnecessary sequel to two series
","'Alien vs. Predator' brings together the two most popular sci-fi monsters from the 1980's to duke it out in a winner-take-all battle. The question is: does anyone care? The tale begins when scientists discover an ancient pyramid mysteriously buried deep beneath the frozen surface of Antarctica. In no time, a team of explorers and archaeologists is dispatched to the site to investigate the puzzling phenomenon. While there, they discover that this is no ordinary ruin, but a temple established long ago by outer space aliens who have made their presence known in order to lure fresh human sacrifices into their trap.With a premise that feels an awful lot like a warmed over version of 'The Thing,' 'Alien vs. Predator' spends virtually no time on character development and, instead, heads straight to the action - not an unusual course of events in a film of this kind, until one realizes that what distinguished both the original 'Alien' and the original 'Predator' from the typical action flick was having charismatic performers in the lead roles (Sigourney Weaver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively). In contrast, Alexa Woods makes for a pretty wan heroine and the supporting players are not much better. And although this film predictably registers high on the goop meter, there isn't much inspiration to be derived - even for die-hard action fans - from what is, essentially, two CGI effects going at one another for nigh unto two hours. The sad truth is that the fight scenes quickly become monotonous and boring seeing as there is nobody on screen whose fate we really care about.About the only real surprise in this film is that the obligatory 'fake scare' scene, usually given to a cat to deliver, is here performed by a penguin.",4,3,6,20 September 2005
No Country for Old Men," a near-masterpiece
","In the stylish new Coen Brothers' movie, 'No Country for Old Men,' the violence is both graphic and coy, both in-your-face and strangely demur in the way it is portrayed. Bit players are frequently blown away in full view of the audience, while key characters often meet their ends off screen, away from the spotlight of the prying camera. For this is the theme of the movie, that violence is arbitrary, capricious and unpredictable, and that things are only going to get worse in a culture that has grown increasingly coarse and indifferent to human suffering over the years.The 'old man' of the title is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a small town Texas sheriff who, as he nears retirement, has seen a depressing spike in violent crime in his jurisdiction, thanks, primarily, to the recent proliferation of drug-running from Mexico (the movie takes place in 1980). For this is a 'new time' in America, one in which an all-out criminal 'war' is being fought, as much on the open plains as in the crowded cities. It is the 'old men' like Bell, the last in a long line of old style Texas lawmen, who can no longer recognize their country and who are left to recede into the background bewildered and frustrated by their inability to do anything to stop it.As the story opens, a group of men lie dead in a windswept field, victims of a drug deal gone terribly awry. The perpetrator is a psychopath by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is now wandering the countryside on a random killing spree, dispatching human victims as casually as the rest of us would a mosquito or fly. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a 'retired' welder who stumbles upon not only the carnage-strewn scene but a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in unmarked bills. When Moss makes the fatal mistake of taking the loot, he becomes the prime target of Chigurh, who will stop at nothing to get what is rightfully his.Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, 'No Country For Old Men' is less notable for its story and characters than for its cinematic naturalism and impressionistic style. Despite having made some truly exceptional films in the past, Joel and Ethan Coen have never been as thoroughly in control of their medium or as supremely confident in their film-making as they are here. The first hour, in particular, is such a flawless masterpiece of composition and tone that it will probably be studied as a model in film school courses for years to come. Not since the films of Terrance Malick has landscape been used to more brilliant effect than in the opening section of this work. The setting - so brilliantly captured in Roger Deakins' incisive cinematography and Craig Berkey's stunning sound design - becomes a palpable presence in its own right and a key player in the drama. The Coens have done their own editing on the film, which explains why the pacing feels like an exquisitely honed piece of music, built on finely calibrated beats and rests, meter and rhythm. The hypnotic, dreamlike quality of the film-making carries the story into the realm of archetype and myth which matches perfectly the surrealistic nature of the piece.Bardem provides a bone-chilling portrait of a human killing-machine whose sole purpose in life is to destroy that which gets in his way (not that he doesn't enjoy killing just for the sheer pleasure of it as well). In Bardem's hands, Chigurh becomes the true incarnation of evil in its darkest form. Jones brings a world-weary gravity to the role of the sheriff, while Brolin, who gets the majority of the screen time in the film, does some of the best work of his career as the man desperate to keep one step ahead of his pursuer.Perhaps predictably, the movie is not able to sustain the same level of greatness all the way through its running time and there are moments when the filmmakers seem to lose their way somewhat (particularly when Woody Harrelson shows up as a comic-relief bounty hunter). The unresolved ending may frustrate those who don't like any loose ends hanging around at the end of a story, but the inconclusiveness of the conclusion actually adds to the verisimilitude of the movie quite a bit.Still, even if the movie falters a bit towards the end, there's no denying that 'No Country For Old Men' is one of the outstanding films of recent times. In fact, that first hour or so is about as close to perfection as film-making is ever likely to get.",9,1,9,8 December 2007

After years of trying unsuccessfully to integrate the more than a million aliens who arrived on it into regular society, government officials have decided to move them out of the slum, known as District 9, where they now reside, to District 10, a camp located far away from the city (the aliens are referred to derisively as 'Prawns,' due to their crustacean-like appearance). Trouble begins when Wikus Van De Merwe, a field operator for the MNU (Multinational United), becomes exposed to a mysterious alien substance while in the process of evacuating the camp, a substance that causes him to slowly turn into a Prawn himself. Immediately, the MNU wants to dissect him to better understand how to operate the aliens' weaponry (for some reason human DNA renders the weapons useless in human hands). However, Wikus escapes and becomes a fugitive from justice, finally hooking up with an alien who may possibly be able to help him retrieve his full humanity. (Though set in South Africa, the movie's provenance is actually New Zealand).Shot partly in the style of a you-are-there documentary and partly as a conventional third-person narrative, this relatively low-budget ($30 million) thriller, written by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell and directed by Blomkamp, is high on creativity, raw energy and imagination and low on sci-fi movie clichés (the overused fugitive-on-the-run scenario being one of the few concessions it makes in that regard). 'District 9' also provides more food-for-thought than the average big-budget movie in this genre. Like 'Alien Nation,' it uses the arrival of outer space visitors to weave a thought-provoking parable about such relevant social issues as prejudice, governmental and corporatist secrecy and propaganda, black market exploitation of the masses, and xenophobia. The script also deviates from the standard formula by making the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos. They are just worker drones who happened to get stranded on a strange planet, whose generally compassionate inhabitants invited them to stay on - albeit, clearly as second-class citizens, as it turns out. The movie also captures some of the poignancy of the 1986 version of 'The Fly,' as piece by piece, Wikus loses the one thing that defines what he is - his humanity. Yet, ironically it is in becoming less human - in being able to more fully identify with an 'other' to the point of extraordinary self-sacrifice - that he becomes most human (a theme not unlike the one in 'Avatar,' actually).Even with all its impressive CGI effects and hardware, 'District 9' would not be half the movie it is without the extraordinary performance of Sharlto Copley who, as Wikus, provides the picture with the human heartbeat it needs to be effective. A somewhat bumbling, barely competent bureaucrat is not an obvious choice for a an action movie hero, but Copley makes that very tricky transition seem utterly natural and seamless. Wikus is a good-hearted man who's forced by circumstances to perform actions he wouldn't normally perform just to survive, yet he remains true to his moral code most of the way through. It is he and he alone who lifts 'District 9' to the level of compelling human drama.Excellent special effects, exciting action sequences, some subtle social satire (particularly in the early stretches) and moments of surprising tenderness all combine to make 'District 9' a one-of-a-kind movie-going experience.",8,1,4,2 February 2010
Mamma Mia!," Whose idea was it to make a musical where no one can sing or dance?
","Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near-celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - 'Waterloo,' 'SOS,' 'Fernando,' 'Dancing Queen,' 'The Winner Takes it All,' etc. - that made it the world's top-selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's. Several decades later, ABBA's music became the basis for a hit stage musical entitled 'Mamma Mia!' in which a simple narrative was deftly woven around many of the quartet's songs. Now, the much-ballyhooed movie version of 'Mamma Mia!,' written by Catherine Johnson and directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived on the scene.The story takes place on a beautiful Greek island where the never-married Donna (Meryl Streep) single-handedly runs a modest hotel for an ever-thinning crowd of tourists. Her daughter, Sophie (the charming Amanda Seyfried), has never known who her real father is, mainly because Donna herself doesn't even know. With the help of her mother's diary from twenty years ago, Sophie narrows the candidates down to three (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard), then secretly invites them to her wedding in the hope that she will be able to figure out which of them is her real father in time to have him accompany her down the aisle.On stage, 'Mamma Mia!' succeeded primarily because it was able to keep its wafer-thin storyline modest in scale and life-sized in scope. But blown up to the magnified proportions of the big screen, the material becomes a compendium of overacting (Julie Walters being the most egregious culprit in that regard), ham-handed literalization, forced spontaneity, and production values that look both gaudy and chintzy at one and the same time. Moreover, the direction is clunky, the choreography abysmal (especially compared to what we were treated to in 'Hairspray' just a year ago), the photography either over or underexposed (depending on whether the scene is set at night or during the day), and the singing not unlike what one might hear emanating from the local pub on an average karaoke-night.In fact, there has always been an inherent problem built into 'Mamma Mia!,' which is that much of ABBA's charm derives from the crystalline voices of its lead singers, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog. Take away those harmonies and at least a certain percentage of that charm is lost. Now the movie version of 'Mamma Mia!' comes along and simply compounds the problem by hiring big-name actors rather than trained singers to somehow interpret the pieces for us. Indeed, this must be the only musical in movie history made up almost entirely of people who can't sing (at least in the old days they used to dub the voices in if they had to). One has to give Streep brownie points for at least trying to belt out the tunes, but her rendition of 'The Winner Takes it All,' which was the rafter-rattling showstopper in the stage version, falls flat due not only to her own inadequacies as a vocalist but to the awkward staging and foolish hand gestures she uses to accompany her singing (almost as if she were trying to act out the lyrics as she's singing them). Actually, I've never understood why anyone would buy either the original cast recording or the soundtrack to 'Mamma Mia!' anyway when the real thing is readily available and clearly far superior to any imitation.All that being said, I am still inclined to at least half-heartedly recommend that people go to see this movie for a number of reasons. First, because the music itself (written by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus) is fun, infectious and finally irresistible, no matter how much the singers may be unintentionally stomping all over it; second, because even though their singing leaves much to be desired, Streep, Bosnan and Seyfried somehow make us care about the characters and the silly little predicament they're caught up in; and third, because there are a number of scenes that actually work quite nicely, the best being when Donna sings the sweet mother's lament 'Slipping Through My Fingers' (a song clearly within Streep's limited vocal range) to her soon-to-be-wed daughter. Streep and Seyfried are both very moving and poignant not only in that particular scene but in all of the scenes in which they appear together.For the half dozen or so audience members who aren't already familiar with the ABBA oeuvre, one can only hope that they will use 'Mamma Mia!' as a springboard to sampling the real deal.",5,197,334,19 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," a visual masterpiece
","If 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is to be believed, then surely hell hath no fury like an idol worshipper scorned. And if it isn't, well heck, a little yarn-spinning might not be entirely out of order in a movie that is, by its very nature, a lyrical, haunting and visually stunning elegy to the fabled Old West and the larger-than-life figures who inhabited it.The 'idol,' in this case, is Jesse James, the notorious outlaw who, even before his death in 1882 at the age of 34, had become a legend in his own time, famous the world over for the many highly publicized robberies and killings he committed all across the American heartland. Indeed, an entire cottage industry of highly romanticized literature (a sensationalized mixture of fact and fiction) had already sprung up around him and the other members of his gang (including his nearly-as-famous brother, Frank). One of those who not only gobbled up the mythology but absorbed it into his soul was a young, self-described 'nobody' by the name of Robert Ford, who, at the age of nineteen, finally got the chance to not only meet his childhood hero in person, but to join up with him in what would turn out to be the bandit's final great train robbery. However, disillusionment can come mighty quickly when an idol is revealed to have feet of clay, and when Jesse didn't accord Robert the respect he felt he was entitled to, the one-time sycophant became the gunman's most dangerous nemesis - and the man who would eventually take his life.'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is not a traditional shoot-'em-up action picture, but rather a long, deliberative and contemplative mood piece focused on the burdens of 'celebrity' and on the need to be a 'somebody' in the eyes of the public. In a beautifully understated performance, Brad Pitt portrays James as part ruthless killer and part raving paranoiac, a mentally unbalanced sadist who spends much of his time waging physical as well as psychological warfare on the men he feels have betrayed him (with good reason in some cases). Yet, Pitt allows moments of humanity and tenderness to seep through his otherwise buttoned-down, stoic demeanor. As Ford, Casey Affleck is the true revelation in this film, finding the root of this pipsqueak's incessant need for braggadocio in his low self-esteem and obsessive need for recognition from others. The irony is that Ford's version of 'celebrity,' when he finally achieves it, is quite different from that of Mr. James - even if their fates take eerily similar paths in the end. These two superb actors are matched in performance by Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner and Sam Sheperd, all of whom are excellent in their roles.Using Ron Hansen's novel as his source, writer/director Andrew Dominik has crafted a work that, aesthetically speaking, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece, a film in which virtually every shot can stand as its own work of art. Roger Deakins' brilliantly lit, softly filtered cinematography (reminiscent of the work in the similarly themed 'The Grey Fox') lends an otherworldly quality to the film, perfect for bringing out the legendary nature of the material. And Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' beautiful and haunting score goes a long ways towards achieving that end as well.From first frame to last, 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Brown' draws the audience into its beautifully lit world of history and legend - and makes us a part of that world.",9,2,4,29 March 2008
Remember the Titans," powerful drama
","Finally - a reason to boycott Disney that actually makes sense.  As I hunkered down to watch the DVD version of `Remember the Titans' - a bowl of popcorn in one hand and a diet soda in the other - what did I discover, to my amazement and horror, but that there was NO widescreen edition of the film anywhere to be found on the disc!  As a lover of movers, I long ago made a pact with myself that I would try to watch every movie in its purest possible form and that includes seeing it with its original theatrical ratio in tact.  What good is watching a movie when up to half its original picture is missing?  That is why I love DVD so much.  It almost always provides us with that option.  Watching a film that has been panned-and-scanned to fit the requirements of a square TV screen is as anathema to me as watching a film spliced-and-diced to meet `broadcast standards' or to make room for oodles of mind-numbing commercials selling products you wouldn't want even if they were given to you free of charge.   All this is prelude to saying that the review you will be reading from here on out is based on at best 90% of the movie that was shown in theatres around the country (and that's a conservative estimate).  Yes, I know there is a widescreen DVD version of the film on the market.  My point is trying to fathom why Disney feels the need to separate its full and wide screen editions when many of us may not have access to both, since we often find ourselves at the mercy of numbskull video storeowners who wouldn't know a jump cut from a freeze frame if their lives depended on it.  Furthermore, once a person gets home with a video, how many of us are going to want to go through the hassle of returning to the store to pick up the widescreen version?  Get a clue, Disney! `Remember the Titans' is a near-perfect film for young people to see.  Not only does it open their eyes to just how recently - a mere 30 years ago - blatant institutionalized racism was woven into the fabric of many segments of American society, but the film shows them just how far we've come in rectifying that situation in a very short while.  Stylistically, `Remember the Titans' emerges as an effective distillation of two sure-fire popular genres:  the inspirational true-life sports story and the inspirational consciousness-raising racial drama.  Although the more cynical among us may feel a bit `inspirationed' out by the time the film's closing credits go rolling by, the rest of us will probably find ourselves dewy-eyed and emotionally uplifted by the experience. Based on a true story, `Remember the Titans' takes us back to the year 1971 when a high school in Alexandria, Virginia - like schools all over the South - was just beginning to cope with the hot button, highly emotional issue of court ordered desegregation.  Into this hornet's nest of bigotry and rancor steps Herman Boone, a black football coach, hired to replace Bill Yoast, a top-notch coach who has led his team to no fewer than 15 championship seasons.  Credit `Remember the Titans' for tackling this issue in a unique way.  By acknowledging the unfairness done to Yoast (ironically, in the name of `fairness'), the film makes the reaction of some of the whites at least  comprehensible.  Few films of this type seem willing to delve into the moral complexity surrounding the sensitive issue of racism and choose instead to paint their characters literally as well as figuratively in black-and-white terms.  `Remember the Titans' doesn't do that.  We are allowed to see the issue from the white people's view as well - and to understand a bit where  they too are coming from.  Indeed, the basic theme of `Remember the Titans' is that anyone can change, given the proper chance and the set of circumstances necessary to bring it about. It is with this set of circumstances that `Remember the Titans' most concerns itself, as it chronicles the gradual but inexorable change that takes place not only in the individuals involved but in the community as a whole.  The amazing thing, too, is that `Remember the Titans' manages to do all this without resorting to the use of a single four-letter expletive - an accomplishment that is not only rare in this day and age:  it is positively unique!  This, along with the salutary theme, makes `Remember the Titans' ideal viewing for schools and youth groups as well.  Director Boaz Yakin and writer Gregory Allen Howard are to be commended for crafting a film that is believable, fast moving and emotionally powerful all at the same time.  The actors are all superb in their various roles, with Denzel Washington, as always, serving as the solid center holding the whole project in place. `Remember the Titans' could be dismissed as just another cliché-ridden, feel-good film designed to appease a smug, self-congratulatory liberal audience, making them feel superior by confirming their own goodness.  If it is such a film, so be it.  When a reminder of our common humanity comes along that is as good as `Remember the Titans,' the cynics will just have to be content to sit this one out and bitch from the sidelines.",Null,1,2,22 September 2001
Batman Begins," Batman bio
","Just when you thought you couldn't stand even one more movie based on a comic book superhero, along comes 'Batman Begins' to redeem your faith in the genre.This film serves the same function for the previous 'Batman' movies that the 'Star War' prequels do for the original 'Star Wars.' In this film, we learn how it is that a shy, sensitive young lad named Bruce Wayne grows up to become a crime-fighting superhero known as Batman, replete with flying cape, mask and a heavily armored vehicle called the batmobile. We learn what it is that causes him to dedicate his life to eradicating evil and righting wrongs in the fictional enclave of Gotham City. I don't want to give away any of the major plot points, but suffice it to say that it involves a childhood tragedy, a desire for revenge, and the love of a morally pure young woman who sets him straight at a key moment in the story.'Batman Begins' succeeds primarily because it paints its central figure in realistic, believable terms. It takes us step by step through the process by which Wayne transforms himself into Batman, not just in terms of the physical accoutrements that go into making up his superhero persona but the psychological development he must undergo before he can fully take on the superhero mantle. Thus, 'Batman Begins' works on the dual level of an action/adventure picture and a human drama.'Batman begins' boasts fine art direction and special effects, exciting action sequences and first-rate performances by Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Morgan Freeman, and (a distressingly emaciated) Liam Neeson.This is the best 'Batman' movie to hit the big screen yet.",8,0,1,19 April 2006
Twilight," enough new twists on the genre to overcome its weaknesses
","The extent to which you'll enjoy 'Twilight' may well depend on just how much romantic melodrama and teenage angst you can put up with in a two-hour period.Based on the insanely popular novel by Stephanie Meyer, this first in a series of tales dedicated to vampires and the-humans-who-love-them overdoses a bit on pasty faces and soulful ogling, but it still manages to revamp the genre in some unique and interesting ways. For instance, these bloodsuckers can apparently move around and function in daylight, or at least subdued daylight, which is pretty easy to find in the perpetually overcast Pacific Northwest where the movie takes place. Moreover, these vampires do not sleep in coffins and are able to thrive as well on animal blood as on human, being just a matter of willing oneself to do so.Bella (Kristen Stewart) is a moody, seventeen-year-old high school student who comes to live with her police chief father (Billy Burke) after her mom ('24''s Sarah Clarke) and step dad take off on an extended road trip across the country. Almost immediately, Bella discovers that there's something not quite right about Edward (Robert Pattinson), the mysterious and darkly brooding boy who seems to have taken a more than casual liking to her. As the feeling is mutual, Bella takes it upon herself to find out everything she can about the enigmatic lad, eventually discovering, with a little help from Google, that Edward is indeed one of the undead, albeit a dreamy one for a girl with a matching pallor who's already a bit emo herself.The self-loathing vampire, tormented by what he is and what he has to do to survive, has been a staple of the genre ever since Barnabas Collins hit the scene in the 1960s, and Edward certainly follows in that tradition. The other thread the story pulls from is the doomed-teenage-romance theme a la 'Romeo and Juliet,' only in this case the young lovers are separated not by warring families but by the fact that they hail from different species. This brings the added complication to their relationship that if Edward becomes too uncontrolled in his passion for Bella, he might just wind up quite literally devouring her. This sex-equals-death theme has always been a major and recurring subtext running right through vampire folklore, and the story does a nice job bringing it to the surface.The romantic moments are, for the most part, handled with tenderness and delicacy, and the scenes with Edward's 'family' - who have all sworn off human blood and are trying to live at peace with their human neighbors - are some of the cleverest in the movie. Moreover, the film generates a good deal of energy and suspense in its latter half, though it does tend to sag a bit in its closing moments.Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Catherine Hardwicke, 'Twilight' isn't as sophisticated or imaginative as the similarly-themed 'True Blood,' but for a tweenie romance with a supernatural twist, this ain't half bad.",7,1,6,22 October 2010
Blue Crush," a touch of reality makes this better than expected
","The best we should reasonably expect from a movie like `Blue Crush' is that we will be treated to some stunning footage of surfers riding the world's greatest waves (along Hawaii's Pipeline, natch) to personal fame and glory. We certainly get that in abundance - but what we have less right to expect, perhaps, is that the film will offer anything else of any real quality. After all, we've been to these kinds of movies before, harking all the way back to those halcyon Bleach Blanket Bingo days when Gidget, Moondoggie and the rest of those addle-brained, teeny-bopper cut-ups aspired to nothing higher than a life of eternal youth spent wallowing in the bleach-white sands of Santa Monica or Malibu.  In the case of `Blue Crush,' therefore, I am happy to report that the screenplay - by Lizzy Weiss (based on a magazine article by Susan Orlean) -provides just enough touches of realism to keep this new film both life-sized and interesting.  And the majority of the credit goes to the film's protagonist, Anne Marie Chadwick who, much to our surprise, engages our sympathies from first moment to last. 
Anne Marie is no bubble-headed, bleached-blond bimbo with nothing on her mind but winning the big Pipeline competition.  Although that is, indeed, part of her life's plan, Anne Marie is, also, an intelligent, pragmatic young woman, fully aware of both her strengths and weaknesses and just trying the best she knows how to make her life work for her, the young sister in her charge and the two surf buddy girlfriends she lives and works with.  Anne Marie is also riddled with insecurities, as she struggles to overcome the fear instilled in her by a near-fatal accident in that very same spot a few years earlier.  Meanwhile, she and her pals work hard trying to eke out a living as maids at a posh hotel, earning just enough money to keep a roof over their heads and pay some of their bills so they will be free to head to the coast at the first sign of prime `Surf's Up' conditions.
The acting in the film is really quite impressive.  As Anne Marie, Kate Bosworth lights up the screen with her subtly nuanced, poised and dignified performance.   She knows how to use understated facial expressions to convey the thoughts and feelings of the character she is portraying.   Equally compelling are Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake as her fun-loving buddies, Mika Boorem as her little sister, and Matthew Davis as the professional football quarterback who becomes her love interest.  Director John Stockwell, to his credit, manages to keep the majority of the scenes intimate in tone and realistic in nature, rarely allowing the narrative to wander into overwrought melodrama or teen-movie farce.  Even the obligatory fight scene is kept restrained and believable.There are occasional weaknesses in the film  a gaggle of snooty football wives and groupies who snub Anne Marie for being too lower class for their tastes are the primary offenders  but, on the whole, `Blue Crush' turns out to be a much better film than its subject matter would ever lead us to expect.  That comes as a particularly pleasant and un-looked-for surprise here in the shank of the summer movie going season.",Null,58,66,7 September 2002
Bridesmaids," Less than groundbreaking but fun overall
","Given the reviews and the comments by many of those who'd already seen the movie, I was expecting 'Bridesmaids' to be a bit more of a raucous affair than it ultimately turned out to be. Yet, while it isn't exactly the 'groundbreaking' film so many people had described it as being, there's enough you-go-girl sassiness and charm to make it a pleasant enough comedic experience.SNL alums, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig (who co-wrote the screenplay with Annie Mumolo), play best friends from childhood, Lillian and Annie, the former a career-woman who's getting ready to tie the knot with a wealthy banker, and the latter, an insecure bundle of neuroses with commitment issues whom Lillian has asked to be her bridesmaid. Into the breach steps Rose Byrne (Glenn Close's bete noire from TV's 'Damages'), as Lillian's snooty new friend whom Annie sees as a rival for Lillian's affections. The focus of the screenplay is mainly on Annie, as she goes about subconsciously sabotaging many of the traditional pre-wedding festivities, as well as her own chances at happiness.Though the women here are occasionally foul-mouthed and uninhibited in their behavior and topics of conversation, they really aren't as crude and vulgar as the media - looking for a look-even-women-can-be-as-bad as-men storyline - has made them out to be. In fact, the tone of much of the movie is sweet and thoughtful, as Annie copes with her very recognizably human feelings of inferiority and jealousy.Directed by Paul Feig, the movie alternates between broad slapstick and sophisticated satire without skipping a beat, though there is the occasional dry-spot to slow down the proceedings. And Melissa McCarthy ('Mike and Molly') steals every scene she's in as a straight-talking tomboy who obviously flunked out of the Miss Manners School of Social Etiquette.It's not a great comedy by any stretch, but it's hard not to be won over by it in the end.",8,2,3,3 December 2012
Meet the Fockers," quite funny but not on a level with the first
","'Meet the Parents' was one of the best and most commercially successful mainstream comedies of recent years, a hilarious tale of a young man trying his damnedest to impress his prospective father-in-law - an ex-CIA agent with some mighty strange ideas about interpersonal relationships - and being thwarted at every turn.Now comes the sequel, 'Meet the Fockers,' in which the young, affianced couple, Greg and Pam, take her parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, to meet his parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, a pair of freethinking flower children left over from the '60's (she's a psychologist who specializes in sex therapy for geriatrics) who have little in common with the uptight, conservative Jack, a man with a few eccentricities of his own to account for.One of the reasons why 'Meet the Parents' worked so well as a comedy was that, no matter how absurdly preposterous and slapstick-y the scenes became, the humor always remained rooted in a universal, believable premise. We always felt for Greg because we could identify with his predicament. By bringing in this second set of parents, 'Meet the Fockers' begins to feel less like a human comedy and more like a strained sitcom, one in which the characters and situations become subordinated to the laughs and all sense of reality flies out the window. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since many of the jokes here are, indeed, very funny, but one still misses the heart that made the original film such a first-rate comic charmer.That being said, 'Meet the Fockers' is still a lot of fun to watch, primarily thanks to the high-caliber cast that has been assembled for the occasion. Joining the original players - Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner - are Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two old pros who seem to be having the time of their professional lives plowing full-throttle through this material. The material itself is a bit on the crude side, with lines that are not quite sophisticated or subtle enough to qualify as double entendres. Add to that a few too many jokes about mammary gland function and scenes involving dog humping and you will quickly realize that the writers are aiming for a fairly low common denominator audience here (the title is the first dead give away, I suppose). Nevertheless, some of these bits do actually result in some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, thanks primarily to the caliber of the performances.No one will be confusing this with Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw, that's for sure, but 'Meet the Fockers' offers a fun time for those who prefer their comedy aimed a wee bit lower.",7,0,1,30 May 2005
Non-Stop," Effective within its limitations
","Those with a fear of flying might want to skip 'Non-Stop,' an airliner- in-jeopardy thriller that could have you taking trains and buses for quite some time to come. In another of his increasingly frequent action-hero roles, Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a U.S. air marshal who discovers that someone aboard a flight from New York to London is threatening to kill a new passenger every 20 minutes until $150 million is deposited into an account that has been set up for the occasion. The twist is that the mystery culprit is making it look as if Marks is the actual extortionist and may even be making Marks carry out some of the killings for him.'Non-Stop' works well enough within the limited confines of both the setting and the hostages-held-for-ransom genre of which it is a part. The whodunit plotting unravels at an appropriate pace, with a whole host of possible suspects for us to choose from, including fellow passengers Juliette Moore, Anson Mount ('Hell on Wheels') and Corey Stoll ('House of Cards' ), as well as Michelle Dockery ('Downton Abbey') and Lupita Nyong'o ('12 Years a Slave') as flight attendants who demonstrate grace and ingenuity under pressure.The holes in the plot are probably large enough to fly a 747 through, but you really won't notice or care while you're strapped in for the ride. And to think, most airlines just provide movies as in-flight entertainment.",6,1,3,12 September 2014
Man on the Moon," great Carrey performance in an uneven film
","Your fondness for `Man on the Moon' may well be predicated on your feelings for Andy Kaufman, both as comic performer and offstage human being.  And, as this film suggests, there was not, ultimately, a very wide gap between the two.  Indeed, the point of the film seems to be that, with Kaufman, the many characters he showed to us on stage and T.V. pretty much reflected the man who existed in real life.This may be both the strength and the weakness of the movie itself. Kaufman's purported genius has always eluded me.  Ostensibly, it lay, I imagine, in his metaphorically giving the finger to his audience while entertaining them at the same time.  That audience, ultimately discovering that it was the butt of the joke, then was able to go a step further and become a willing part of the act, allowing them all to feel superior to the uninitiated masses still deluded enough to be on the outside looking in. Kaufman's act became, then, a kind of exclusive comic club, a collective act of defiance against the social norms of theatrical convention and good taste.  Thus, we see him in the film reading the entire novel `The Great Gatsby' verbatim to a stunned and ultimately hostile college audience; we see him wrestling women while spouting inflammatory chauvinistic rhetoric and deliberately muffing his lines on live national television in a brilliant blurring of the line between reality and theatricality.  The problem, however, is that iconoclasm has never been a source of humor in itself, and much of Kaufman's act and persona came across as heavy-handed, smug and self-conscious, particularly in his grating Lithuanian `Taxi' character.  In short, Kaufman always seemed too full of himself and so dazzled by his own cleverness and cuteness to ever be truly funny.  It was like he was always pointing his thumbs back at himself saying, `Look how funny I am.'  Such unctiousness inspires us not to laugh.The film itself is an uneven study of the man.   The first half is particularly shaky.  After a clever 5-minute view of Kaufman as a performance-obsessed child, we move to his young adulthood where we see him bombing in a local nightclub with an act so aggressively unfunny that we cannot even imagine that it could possibly be real.  Then, virtually in the blink of an eye, he is discovered by his future manager, again, in a scene of staggering incredibility, in which Kaufman somehow manages to reduce his audience to helpless laughter with material that couldn't possibly evoke even titters let alone room-shaking guffaws.  Before we know it, Kaufman has somehow landed a hosting job on `Saturday Night Live' (yet another bad performance) and has become so much in demand that he not only secures a role in a new sitcom, `Taxi,' but is allowed to make all sorts of demands from the producers in exchange for his services.  The chronicle of his meteoric rise to fame simply lacks the detail necessary to make it credible.
The movie finds surer footing as it moves ahead in time.  If anything, the gross lack of humor of many of his performances recreated for the film simply underlines the overrated comic gifts of Kaufman himself.  Although the writers, Scott Alexander and Larry Karasczewski, and director, Milos Forman, convey an obvious attitude of affection towards Kaufman, they do not shy away from portraying the self-centered petulance that governed many of his actions both in his professional and personal life.   The most poignant moments come when he discovers he has lung cancer, yet cannot convince many of the people who are closest to him that he is really sick, so skeptical has his life of duplicity made them.  Though Courtney Love is very good indeed as the woman who learns to love Kauffman, the portrayals of her character and their relationship as a whole remain sketchy and superficial throughout.  We never really sense much chemistry between them since they never seem to experience much in the way of revelatory conflict.  She simply loves him unconditionally, and she is given little to do but beam pleasantly at him or look perpetually concerned for his health and well being.
`Man on the Moon's one element of undeniable brilliance lies in the triumphant performance of Jim Carrey in the starring role.  In physical appearance, in mannerisms, in comic stylings, he, quite literally, becomes Andy Kaufman!  Whether on stage or behind-the-scenes, Carrey never hits a false note, displaying his uncanny ability to bring out the humanity that might easily have been lost in a portrayal of a very eccentric comic artist. Indeed, Carrey lends some much needed depth to a screenplay that, in its bare-bone plotting, often seems undernourished and underfed.  `Man on the Moon' becomes, ultimately then, more compelling as a steppingstone in Carrey's development as an artist than as an elegy for the artist who once was.",Null,74,98,10 June 2000
The Pianist," gripping though flawed drama
","`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.",Null,11,17,14 June 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson at the top of his game
","Wes Anderson's latest cinematic confection, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel,' is a quirky, surrealistic comedy set at a mountain resort run by a concierge named M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and a 'lobby boy' named Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori), whom M. Gustave has taken under his wings to train in the art of service. Set in a fictional country, the movie begins in 1968, when the Grand Budapest Hotel is just a shadow of its former self, having been allowed to fall into disrepair and currently inhabited by a small contingent of eccentric tenants. One of them is a writer (Tom Wilkinson) who discovers that Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) is now the owner of the once-proud establishment. The elder Mustafa regales him with stories of an earlier time in the hotel's history - the 1930s, in fact - when the palatial inn played host to only the richest and most aristocratic of occupants and guests. Through dual-narrated flashbacks, then, Anderson weaves a smart and cheeky tale of an enduring friendship that triumphs over class division, a tale that combines wit with imagination and social commentary with visual elegance, set against the writer/director's trademarked air of heightened unreality. When he isn't fulfilling his duties as hotel concierge, the foppish M. Gustave, fastidious in manner and with a poetic quote for every occasion, offers his 'personal' services exclusively to blond, fabulously wealthy and emotionally insecure dowagers, one of whom bequeaths to him a priceless painting upon her sudden death. This surprising turn-of-events puts him at odds with a veritable army of the deceased woman's outraged relatives. This leads to a stolen art treasure, a false conviction for murder, a daring prison break and a mad race to stay one step ahead of the pursuing authorities, as M. Gustave endeavors to prove his innocence.To enhance the dreamlike nature of the material, the look of the film is marked by whimsical art direction and ultra-stylized framing. Even the dimensions of the screen change with the time period of the story - traditional square for the scenes set in 1932 and widescreen for those that take place in 1968.In addition to the splendid deadpan performances of Fiennes, Abraham and newcomer Revolori in the key roles, the movie provides a veritable sea of familiar faces in supporting and bit parts, many of them members of Anderson's repertory company: Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Owen Wilson, among others. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' finds Mr. Anderson in peak form.",8,2,4,9 October 2014
The Transporter," colorful action picture
","`The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is - a sleek, slick, high-octane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and, quite frankly, doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case, since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as `credibility.'Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter, a stolid, nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages (no questions asked) all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the `package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being - a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped, bound and gagged, into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most, if not all, of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet, Frank turns out, despite his initial air of callous and self-serving indifference, to be a criminal-type with a heart of gold, and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However, the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like `The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline, which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions, car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stock-in-trade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed, well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel, who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright, sparkling sheen.   In fact, Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.In addition to Statham, who makes for a very `cool' action film hero, Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd, wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome `complication' that steps into Frank's smooth-running, well-ordered life.`The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food - not high in nutritional value, but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its cool-under-pressure protagonist, the film delivers the goods.",Null,156,176,27 October 2002
Seabiscuit," A Triple Crown
","Writer/director Gary Ross has made a triumphant film out of Laura Hillenbrand's beloved bestseller.  Like the original author, Ross gathers the strands of his story slowly, showing how the lives of three initially unrelated people  an owner, a trainer and a jockey  converge at a single point, the racehorse phenomenon known as Seabiscuit.Both Hillenbrand and Ross have conceived of Seabiscuit as a metaphor for his time, a beacon of hope and inspiration for a despairing, Depression-ravaged nation.  He is certainly that and more for the three troubled men whose lives he touches, providing each with the opportunity to overcome immense odds, achieve some form of redemption, and put some meaning back into his life.Given its `inspirational' subject matter, `Seabiscuit' could easily have dissolved into little more than a sappy `feel-good' movie.  Luckily for us, the low-keyed approach Ross has taken towards the material purges it of sentimentality.  The movie is upbeat and heartwarming, yet we rarely feel as if the film is pushing our buttons in any obviously manipulative way.  Much of the credit goes to Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire, three superb actors who know how to underplay their parts to achieve maximum effect.  William H. Macy provides a wonderful comic turn as the hilariously overwrought and corny racetrack announcer who reflects the gee-whiz tone of a nation captivated by this amazing animal.  Visually, the film is superb, thanks to John Schwarztman's lovely cinematography, which imbues the bucolic 1930's setting with a kind of nostalgic glow, as well as to the handsome art direction and costume design that perfectly capture the look of the era.  The horserace sequences have been masterfully staged and edited and rank with the best ever put on film. 
`Seabiscuit,' clearly one of the best mainstream movies of 2003, is a true first place finisher.",Null,0,0,30 August 2003
28 Days Later...," effective atmosphere, derivative story
","`28 Days Later' could easily be the fourth installment in George Romero's `Living Dead' trilogy  only this time the zombies have a bit more get up and go to them.When Jim wakes up out of a coma one day, he discovers that not only is he the only person in the hospital but virtually the only person left in the entire city of London.  After wandering through the deserted city streets for awhile, he eventually runs into a couple of stalwart survivors who inform him that 28 days earlier a plague began sweeping across the planet  catalyzed by the release of some infected test monkeys  causing people to turn into mindless killing machines and passing on the virus to their victims through their blood.  Although `28 Days Later' is little more than a rip-off of those earlier zombie classics, director Danny Boyle does bring a certain level of artistry to his handling of the material, particularly with his apocalyptic visions of a London and an English countryside utterly bereft of human beings. There's a real end-of-the-world eeriness to much of what we see on the screen, a product more of suggestiveness than of blatant visualization. Indeed, Boyle shows the zombies as little as possible, a wise move for a couple of reasons: first, because leaving a threat unspecified allows the audience to use its imagination, thereby heightening the suspense and tension, and, second, because, quite frankly, these fleet-footed zombies simply aren't all that terrifying when we get a close-up view of them (certainly not on a level with Romero's lumbering  and truly horrifying - originals).  And that, perhaps, is the biggest complaint I have against the film.  For all the impressiveness of the visuals and the tone, `28 Days Later' just isn't a very scary film in the long run.  The plotting is derivative, the characters not very well developed, and the poorly staged final showdown more laughable than frightening.  Like two many horror films, this one suffers from a weak third act, with the anticipatory windup more impressive than the delivery.There's a lot to admire and recommend in `28 Days later.'  But it just doesn't get under the skin the way the best horror films do  and the nightmares just don't come.",Null,9,17,21 December 2003
Cars," fantastic animaton but too often stuck in neutral
","So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles? 'Cars,' the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings. It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen. The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices. It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the 'eyes' in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse. While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town. The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations. It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn't winning the big race).The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival. There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo. A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman. You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie. Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, 'Cars' seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features. Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile. Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and 'drive' (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip. Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves. For a movie built entirely on driving, 'Cars' is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time. The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to 'drag' (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does. There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter. In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as 'The Great Race,' 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' or 'Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines' as its source of inspiration. Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film. These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer. But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, 'Cars' is too often stuck in neutral.",7,0,1,24 January 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," dazzling but imperfect film
","Ang Lee's martial arts drama `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' earned its niche in movie history as the first foreign language film ever to gross over $100 million dollars at the U.S./Canadian box office.  It is, of course, a film of other distinctions as well.The factor that sets this film apart from all previous martial arts films is, principally, the fight scenes themselves, which involve the characters defying the laws of gravity by floating in the air, walking along walls and even conducting a sword fight high above the tree tops of a windswept forest.  These sequences, which achieve a sort of heightened surrealism, are indeed breathtaking to behold in their originality, boldness and technical perfection.  They provide the unforgettable imagery that very few films these days seem able to achieve, giving the audience the all too rare sense that it is seeing something wholly new and visionary. Based on a novel by Du Lu Wang,  `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' tells a quite fascinating story of a stolen sword and the attempts of two warriors, one a man, the other a woman, to retrieve it.  Like most movies set in an Asian past, Lee's film conveys a tone of quiet contemplation, even when great issues of war and peace, life and death, duty and honor are being fought over and discussed.  There is a lyrical, poetic beauty to much of this film, even  or, perhaps I should say, especially  in the non-martial arts sequences.  As the two warriors, Chow Yun Fat, a fighter grown weary of his past and yearning for the quiet rewards of peace, and Michelle Yeoh, a woman unique to her profession yet feeling deeply her unrequited love for the man she follows, bring a sturdy maturity to their complex roles.  They provide the human warmth that, in the first section of the film, in particular, keeps the work rooted in reality.  Unfortunately, there is a scene about an hour into the movie, when a young aristocratic woman, destined to be married but yearning for the liberation that would come with being a warrior, has a long romantic flashback, chronicling her strange affair with a handsome young barbarian.  Although the scene ends up being crucial to the understanding of the rest of the film, it really isn't on an intellectual par with the main story of the film, coming across instead as something of an embarrassing bodice-ripper in tone and style.  Although the film does return to its main plotline eventually, it never completely recovers from the detour it has taken.  As with most movies with a midpoint sag, the audience is never really able to completely tune back in.  What a pity  for `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' clearly has the elements to make a truly great film (and, judging from the reaction of many critics and writers on this site, a large number of people feel it is).  Luckily, after the flashback, the film manages to get back on track, as we witness the complex interplay between the unthinking arrogance that comes with youth and the restraining wisdom that comes with age.  This is the most powerful theme that runs through this visually gorgeous film.Thus, despite its minor imperfections, any lover of cinema would be well advised to see `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' for the many wonders it contains.",Null,0,0,10 August 2001
Django Unchained," A Film Artist at the Top of His Game
","Quentin Tarantino's wickedly original farce 'Django Unchained' does for slavery what his 'Inglorious Basterds' did for World War II. Namely, it rewrites history as it SHOULD have been, not how it actually was. In 'Basterds,' we got to see Hitler and his murderous minions taken out well ahead of schedule by a motley group of allied assassins. In 'Django,' we get to see freed slave Django Freeman doing pretty much the same to just about every racist white villain unfortunate enough to cross his path. In short, 'Django Unchained' goes beyond mere historical revisionism to historical wish-fulfillment fantasy and helps to lay the foundation for a new genre in the process.As 'Django Unchained' opens, the title character is part of a group of chained slaves en route to auction. However, before they can get there, Django is freed by a loquacious, silver-tongued German man (played brilliantly by the scene-stealing Christoph Waltz) who is appalled by slavery and who asks Django to partner up with him as a bounty hunter. In addition to tracking down and killing wanted fugitives, the two make it their mission to rescue Django's wife (Kerry Washington) from bondage to an infamous plantation owner, played by Leonardo DeCaprio in one of his finest performances to date.Django actually began life as a character in a series of spaghetti westerns dating back to the mid 1960s and, indeed, Tarantino has included many spaghetti western tropes in his film, even though most of the movie takes place in the pre-bellum South. This Django is 'very loosely based' on the earlier one, seeing as how the original, played by Franco Nero (who makes a cameo appearance in this film), was not a black slave but rather a white Union soldier.There's no denying the purgative effect of seeing Django delivering some frontier justice to all those slave owners and white oppressors who deserve everything they get at his hands. But Tarantino has never been one to see the world in black-and-white terms, nor as a simplistic conflict between evil and good. There's a highly disturbing scene, for instance, where Django, determined not to blow his cover as a black slave trader, allows another slave to be mauled to death by dogs, a scene that shows Tarantino will even risk alienating Django from the audience if that means staying true to his vision. The director has clearly come to play, and he has no use for cleanly delineated lines between right and wrong, not when a person's very survival is at stake. The world he is showing us is simply too brutal, too unforgiving for such moral niceties to have much sway.As an artist, Tarantino is clearly at the top of his game here, blending a host of seemingly contradictory elements into a seamless, eclectic whole. He mixes acerbic humor with hyper-stylized violence, and places flawless period piece detail against a soundtrack filled with contemporary songs, some already released and some written directly for the movie. Tarantino isn't afraid to linger long over his scenes, letting the audience savor every last juicy line of dialogue he's placed in the mouths of his characters. For the writing is always the best part of any Tarantino film, and he doesn't let us down here.And that's probably why the actors seem to be having the time of their professional lives in this film. While Jamie Foxx is taciturn and tight-lipped (as any hero - or antihero - of the West should be), Waltz, Di Caprio and Samuel L. Jackson, as the ultimate sycophantic house slave (often playing the Fool to DiCaprio's Lear), go head-to-head in a no-holds-barred war of verbal gymnastics. The writing and performances are so much fun on their own, in fact, that Tarantino's dazzling visuals sometimes seem like just an unusually tasty dessert designed by the chef to top off the meal.Tarantino clearly lives and breathes cinema, and thus he has populated his canvas with a vast array of familiar faces from movies and TV, past and present, some in very minor roles: Don Johnson, Walter Goggins, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Jonah Hill, James Parks, and Tarantino himself.The filmmaker's latest opus may not be for every viewer, but if you're looking for an iconoclastic work that has little regard for propriety and good taste and is not afraid to venture out into previously uncharted territory, then 'Django Unchained' is the movie for you.",9,1,4,20 March 2014
Drive," Mesmerizing exercise in pure cinema
","Not since 'Taxi Driver' has there been so glorious a paean to the poetry of driving as the appropriately titled 'Drive,' a film that received a standing ovation when it was unspooled at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011. Indeed, the film is an homage of sorts to Scorsese's 1976 classic as well as to its iconic lead character, Travis Bickle.As Ryan Gosling's unnamed character cruises hypnotically along the streets of downtown L.A., he seems all of a piece with his vehicle - almost as if it were an extension of him or he of it. For Gosling, driving is clearly both an obsession and an art form and he brings to it all the finely-tuned grace and immersive concentration of a symphony conductor or a prima ballerina. Taciturn almost to the point of inarticulateness, Gosling's character only comes fully alive when he's behind the wheel of a car. Indeed, almost a full quarter-of-an-hour of running time elapses before he speaks a word, and even then - and indeed throughout the course of the film - it's only to utter some banal commonplace or half-articulated thought. Language cannot convey his feelings, the sense of who he is; only driving can. Speech serves a strictly utilitarian function for Gosling, but driving speaks to his soul. And, appropriately, both his jobs - that of an assistant mechanic at a local repair place and a daredevil stuntman for the movies - involve working with cars to one extent or another. And, oh yes, he also sells his services as getaway driver for an assortment of sleazy armed robbers willing to pay his price and play by his rules.This last fact is what winds up causing problems for the character, when he falls in love with an attractive neighbor (Carey Mulligan) whose husband gets paroled from prison early on in the movie. But the direction the story takes with this plot turn is not what you might expect, thanks to an intelligent screenplay by Hossein Amini based on James Sallis' novel of the same name.Gosling's character fits comfortably in the mold of Travis Bickle - a morally ambiguous yet righteously angry antihero who defends innocent women and children against the evils of the world while freely crossing over that line himself. And at times he seems almost as mentally unhinged and psychotic as Bickle himself does. Yet, Gosling also runs the risk of inadvertently endangering both himself and those he cares about with his actions. The dual nature of the character is evident throughout the picture in the radically different ways in which he treats the various people in his life. Indeed, it is only with Irene and her young son, Benicio, that Gosling can be unconditionally and stoically tender - in stark contrast to the methodical brutality with which he dispatches the numerous enemies who are out to get him (be forewarned: the violence in the film can be unnervingly graphic at times).Perpetually clad in a silver racing jacket - its collar turned up and a giant scorpion printed on the back - Gosling delivers his most indelible screen performance to date. Largely denied the tool of dialogue to define the character, Gosling is forced to rely almost exclusively on facial expressions and body language to convey the man's thoughts and feelings at any given moment. And he does an award-worthy job, for he commands our attention every split second of the time he is on the screen - which is virtually always. He's like a muted vortex drawing us into the heart of the character.The superb cast is rounded out by a hirsute Bryan Cranston ('Breaking Bad') as the owner of the shop where Gosling works; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman ('Sons of Anarchy') as mob bosses looking to hire Gosling to be the driver for a stock car they're planning on purchasing; and a barely recognizable Christina Hendricks (from 'Mad Men') as a moll who gets in over her head on one of Gosling's 'jobs.' Heck, even Russ Tamblyn, of 'West Side Story' fame, makes a cameo appearance! Those who criticize the film for being too arty and Gosling's character for being too taciturn seem, to me, to be missing the point entirely. First, he is inarticulate precisely because he has found a means of expressing himself (i.e. driving) that doesn't require conventional language. (In fact, wouldn't that criticism eliminate all silent movies automatically?) And, second, like a fine wine, the movie can be savored strictly on the basis of its aesthetic qualities ('The New World' is a similar film that comes to mind). We are transported to a different world through the sheer beauty of the imagery and pacing, the mesmerizing performances, the hypnotic and smoothly flowing tracking shots (kudos to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel), the haunting score (more kudos to Cliff Martinez) and canny soundtrack choices.As a director, Danish-born Nicolas Winding Refn is clearly a filmmaker to the manner born, demonstrating a command and mastery of the medium that leaves one breathless with admiration and awe. For 'Drive' is a movie that revels in its own being. And that makes it a special treat for anyone sophisticated and savvy enough to appreciate its cinematic richness.",9,2,5,19 April 2012
Frozen," Traditional in the best sense of the word
","Walt Disney's 'Frozen' takes us back to a time when animated films were literally royal affairs, overflowing with handsome princes and beautiful princesses, magic spells and comical sidekicks, Broadway-style songs and happily-ever-after endings. In this case, it's the Princesses who take center stage, and they're pretty resourceful and feisty, as befits the modern era.The story, based on 'The Snow Queen' by Hans Christian Anderson, features Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) as royal sisters, the former of whom has magical powers, the latter of whom does not. The problem is that Elsa's use of her power is erratic, to put it mildly, and in an attempt to protect Anna from any possible fallout, Elsa has hidden that power from her little sister for most of their lives. On the day she is crowned Queen of Arendelle, Elsa inadvertently casts a spell on the world, plunging it into eternal winter. It becomes the job of Anna, with the help of some colorful assistants, to get Elsa to un-cast the spell and return normalcy to the world.With screenplay by Jennifer Lee and direction by Lee and Chris Buck, 'Frozen' isn't the most cutting-edge of animated features, particularly in contrast to many of PIXAR better-known offerings, but it has an elegant, classical appeal that makes 'old-fashioned' seem cool again. The score by Christophe Beck isn't instantly memorable but it at least it's more snappy than sappy, and the shimmering visuals compensate for a touch of spottiness in the storytelling.",8,6,13,1 May 2014
2012," Put your brain on hold
","In the not-so-grand tradition of 'When Worlds Collide,' 'Earthquake,' 'The Day After Tomorrow,' 'Armageddon,' 'Deep Impact,' 'The Core,' etc., '2012' is a big-budget disaster picture with a low-budget mentality. Just how foolish it will look in 2013 is anyone's guess - though it couldn't possibly look any more foolish than it did when it was released in 2009. And all courtesy of that Grand Poobah of disaster flicks, Roland Emmerich.The doomsday scenario in this instance comes in the form of exploding solar radiation that has become so intense that it's begun to cause the Earth's core to melt (like a microwave oven, we're told), resulting in the wholesale destruction of the planet's crust. This obviously doesn't bode well for the people dwelling on the surface, where life as we know it will soon cease to exist - just as the Mayans so cannily predicted centuries ago.As with any disaster-movie worthy of the title, the story involves little more than an assortment of stock characters trying to keep one step ahead of the impending apocalypse. This particular cross-section of humanity includes John Cusack as a writer of prescient but less-than-commercially-successful sci-fi novels, Amanda Peet as his ex-wife, Danny Glover as the President of the United States, Thandie Newton as the President's daughter, Oliver Platt as his self-interested Chief of Staff, Chiwetel Ejiofor as a brilliant geologist, and, for comic relief purposes, Woody Harrelson as a bug-eyed, trailer-dwelling, crackpot conspiracy theorist whose theoretic conspiracies turn out to be anything but crackpot.And because of the enormous and far-reaching nature of the disaster, the movie can borrow bits from any number of previous disaster movies and get away with it; thus, we get a touch of 'The Day After Tomorrow' here, a smidgen of 'The Poseidon Adventure' there. Heck, there's even a hint of 'Wall-E' in the closing moments.There's always an odd and uncomfortable moral principle operating in films of this type: namely, who cares if the whole world is going to hell in a hand basket, so long as our intrepid band of survivors (usually including an adorable pet or two) makes its way to safety. And the trite and corny estranged-spouse melodrama involving Cusack and Peet that Emmerich and co-writer Harald Klasser have seen fit to plaster onto their vision of a worldwide holocaust is enough to make us start rooting for humanity's wholesale annihilation long before the movie's hit the halfway mark. Apparently, in contradiction to what Rick said at the end of 'Casablanca,' the problems of a couple of little people DO amount to a hill of beans, after all - at least in the eyes of Hollywood.Of course, one doesn't go to these types of films in search of grand themes or complex characterizations, but rather for the epic and wanton destruction of all things animate and inanimate - and in that respect, at least, '2012' delivers the goods. In fact, the action and special effects are so preposterous and over-the-top that one can't help but admire the sheer, unadulterated, childlike trashiness of it all.So hunker on down to watch humanity get the ass-kicking of a lifetime - just make sure to have plenty of popcorn and Jujubes on hand to help get you through the experience.",5,1,3,7 January 2011
The Number 23," nothing special
","In yet another attempt to break away from the manic comic persona that has become his stock-in-trade, Jim Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an animal control expert whose life is literally taken over by a strange novel he is reading entitled 'The Number 23.' In it, the protagonist - whose life story, Walter believes, greatly parallels his own - becomes convinced that the number 23 exudes a kind of mystical power over the fates and lives of certain, specially chosen people. Soon Walter is seeing 23s all over the place and slipping further and further into paranoia and madness just like the character in the book.'The Number 23' is a gimmicky, insubstantial thriller that is facilely consumed then instantly forgotten. The movie keeps cutting back and forth between Walter's life in the real world and re-enactments of events in the novel, which are basically silly film noir knockoffs done in murky, over-stylized settings. Though there are a few fleeting moments of quality in the wrapping-up stage of the drama - where the filmmakers actually seem to be pulling the story elements together in a semi-coherent fashion - there's little to engage our interest in most of the rest of the movie.Carrey, Virginia Madsen as his wife, and Danny Huston as a professor friend of the couple, aren't given much to work with in terms of character development. Everyone simply seems to be going through the motions, marking time till a more substantive movie heads their way. Here's hoping such a project won't be too long a time in coming.",5,1,3,22 March 2007
Ghost Rider," minor super hero venture
","16-year-old boys of all ages will have a grand time with 'Ghost Rider,' the upteenth movie adaptation of a beloved Marvel Comics series. The rest of us who don't fall into that particular demographic, however, will be left scratching our heads wondering what all the fuss is about.Johnny Blaze is a death-defying motorcycle stuntman with a passion for The Carpenters who, as a youth, sells his soul to the devil in a desperate bid to prevent his father from dying of cancer. However, as is the Old Boy's wont to do, Satan tricks the hapless youngster by killing the father anyway, leaving Johnny to spend the rest of his life wandering the earth alone and loveless (despite adoration from legions of loyal fans) until he is finally called upon to assume his role as a 'ghost rider,' a bounty hunter for the devil who turns into a flaming skeletal figure that rides around at night collecting all the bad souls and dragging them kicking and screaming to their destiny in the hellish underworld.'Ghost Rider' boasts a simplistic good-versus-evil plot line, a stylized, otherworldly look, and a passel of pretty damn cool special effects to keep the fan-boys happy. It also, however, suffers from uneven acting, faulty logic (why, for instance, would a minion of Satan go around battling evildoers and rescuing the innocent?), and a romantic subplot that is bland and tedious enough to serve as a signal for restroom and concession stand breaks for the die-hard action aficionado.Nicholas Cage may be a trifle long in the tooth at this point to be playing a comic book super hero type, and Eva Mendes is little more than a pallid Lois Lane wannabe as his TV reporter girlfriend, Roxanne Simpson. Luckily, there's some fun to be had at the hands of a couple of old pros who basically walk off with the film: Peter Fonda (looking more and more like his famous dad in his later years) as a suave, glinty-eyed Mephistopheles; and Sam Elliott as an old, enigmatic cemetery caretaker who may be able to help Johnny in his efforts to eradicate evil and free himself from the curse he's under (unfortunately, nothing much is done with Elliott's character except to ride him off into the sunset at the end. A pity). Their performances, along with the high-flying CG graphics, keep the movie from becoming a total loss.",5,0,1,28 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," bland conclusion to a thought-provoking series
","In the first two 'X-Men' films, perceptive viewers could easily detect the 'pro-gay rights' subtext that ran through the storyline about a race of superpower 'mutants' let loose on the world and the debate over their place in society. The latest installment, 'X-Men: The Last Stand' takes the issue a step further by proposing a complex moral dilemma: should the 'mutants' be encouraged to partake of a supposed 'cure' for their condition or should they be proud of who they are and not change merely to placate a society made uncomfortable by their presence?Unfortunately, even though 'The Last Stand' raises this intriguing ethical issue, it really doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. The main problem is that the screenplay simply fails to come up with a character commensurate with the movie's theme. In fact, there are so many mutants running around that none of them is ever able to grab the center of the movie's attention or the focus of the audience. Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Iceman, Rogue etc. all have their individual moments but they are soon crushed under the weight of overblown actions scenes and over-the-top special effects. Only Ian Holm's evil Magneto has a chance to break through all the pyrotechnics and create some impact as a character.I loved the original 'X-Men' when it came out in 2003 precisely because it felt so bold and daring in its willingness to explore social issues along with all the CGI effects, stunt work and explosions that are par for the action film genre. But the two follow-up editions have not lived up to those expectations. I'm sorry to say that, despite all the technical fireworks of the grand finale, the 'X-Men' series ends not with a bang but with a whimper.",5,3,5,21 January 2007
The Lives of Others," fine drama despite a gaping hole in the screenplay
","It seems somehow appropriate that 'The Lives of Others' should be set in 1984, since it takes us to a world where George Orwell's fictional Big Brother has become an all-too-real fact of everyday life. The place is East Germany, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, where not just every action but virtually every thought can be surveyed and monitored by the secret police agency known as STASI. As self-appointed 'voices of the people,' artists suffer an even more intense level of scrutiny than the average, everyday citizen. As a result, many of them have either fled the country, committed suicide, or compromised their artistic vision in exchange for security and safety. Georg Dreyman, a successful writer and dramatist, has chosen the latter course of action, towing the party line in his works better than most of his fellow artists. Nevertheless, Wiesler, a security agent with STASI, suspects that Dreyman may not be quite the ideological purist Wiesler's fellow officers believe him to be (Wiesler may also be motivated by the fact that he is attracted to Dreyman's beautiful girlfriend, a well-known stage actress named Christa-Marie Sieland, and, thus, has reasons of his own for wanting Dreyman out of the picture). To confirm his suspicions, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment bugged so that he and Sieland can be kept under surveillance twenty-four hours a day. After awhile, however, Wiesler begins to soften in his stance towards Dreyman and, before long, he is betraying his own vows to the state by whitewashing his official reports on the writer.Within this historical context, 'The Lives of Others' provides a chilling portrait of what life is like under a totalitarian regime. It shows the dehumanization that occurs when freedom of thought and expression become anathema to a society, and the untenable paranoia that develops when one must live in constant fear of betrayal from stranger, acquaintance and loved-one alike.Interestingly, the two main characters in the film share very little screen time together, yet they are intricately linked in their roles of the observer and the observed. Dreyman is a man willing to go along with a system he knows to be wrong, partly out of fear, but partly too out of a sincere belief that nothing he can do, even as an artist, will ever really change things. It isn't until a close friend of his, a 'blacklisted' theater director, decides to take his own life rather than to live with the oppression that Dreyman wakes up from his lethargy and takes a proactive stance against injustice.Wiesler has a less clearly defined moment of epiphany, and this strikes me as being one of the very few weaknesses of this otherwise extraordinarily fine film. If Wiesler has a literary antecedent, it would have to be Guy Montag, the fire-starting protagonist in Ray Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451.' Like Montag, Wiesler is a gung-ho advocate of a regressive regime, eagerly performing his duty of stamping out what he believes to be seditious and subversive elements that threaten the stability of the society. But whereas Montag has his unmistakably paradigm-shifting moment while reading 'David Copperfield,' Wiesler has no comparable event to explain his 180-degree turnabout in outlook. He just suddenly goes from being Dreyman's bitterest antagonist to his greatest protector and champion without a whole lot of explanatory detail to go along with the change. It's difficult for us to accept the fact that a man would suddenly turn his back on everything he's dedicated his life to without at least a vaguely articulated reason for doing so.As Wiesler, the late great actor, Ulrich Muhe, leaves an indelible mark in his portrayal of a man whose cold, emotionless surface may be more the product of his environment than a reflection of the true man at the core of his being. In a largely nonverbal role, Muhe is forced to convey much of his character's thoughts, feelings and emotions through his piercing eyes and tightly pursed lips. Sebastian Koch brings a remarkable subtlety to the role of the writer, while Martina Gedeck as his girlfriend, and Ulrich Tukur as Wiesler's hardnosed superior deliver excellent performances as well.In her film-making debut, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brings both a stunning attention to detail and a strong sense of atmosphere to her work. Given the repressive environment she is portraying, Donnersmarck wisely holds back on delivering grand sentimental gestures for most of the film - which makes the climactic moments all the more heart-wrenching and devastating when they finally arrive.In this age of ramped-up fear and paranoia - and the increased scrutiny and surveillance that come along with them - 'The Lives of Others' serves as a stark reminder of the things we lose when we give up our freedoms.",8,1,5,25 August 2007
Hellboy," endearing comic book adaptation
","Based on the works of Mike Mignola, 'Hellboy,' written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, is a better-than-average comic book adaptation that boasts a refreshing sense of humor amid all the customary action sequences and first-rate special effects. The story begins in 1944, near the end of World War II, with the Nazis attempting to open a portal between earth and a hell-like dimension where seven evil deities have been lying in wait for just such an opportunity to come in and take over the world. One creature from the other side makes it through before the Nazis' scheme is thwarted, a young 'boy' who is adopted by an American expert in the paranormal and groomed to become a superhero who can do battle with all the supernatural creatures who apparently exist in an abundance undreamed of by the vast majority of the human race.The makers of the film have wisely chosen to keep Hellboy life-sized and believable in both his physical and psychological dimensions. Despite his red skin, stone right hand and ability to leap from rooftop to rooftop with gravity-defying ease, Hellboy is really just an Average Joe-type, with a bit of an ego, a sardonic sense of humor, a strong sense of loyalty, and a really good heart. Heck, he even has problems in the romance department not much different from what all the rest of us go through at one time or another in our lives.The movie is overlong and the screenplay probably includes one or two monsters more than it needs to in order to get the job done, but Ron Perlman, even under all the heavy makeup, makes Hellboy a three-dimensional, sympathetic character, while John Hurt brings warmth and authority to the role of Professor Bruttenholm, the 'father figure' who raises him.",7,0,0,22 October 2005
P.S. I Love You," One can hear the gears grinding all the way through
","Before he dies, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) - the pluckiest victim of a brain tumor since the stiff-upper-lipped Bette Davis faced-down a similar fate in 'Dark Victory' - comes up with an ingenious way to continue giving Holly (Hilary Swank), his soon-to-be widow, advice from beyond the grave. He composes a series of upbeat letters to be delivered to her at regular intervals after he's gone - missives that contain specific instructions on how to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and move on with her life. You see, Holly was kind of an uptight stick-in-the-mud when they were married, and now the too-good-to-be-true, happy-go-lucky Irishman wants to loosen her up by getting her to perform karaoke, sending her on an all-expenses-paid trip to the place of his birth, and encouraging her to become a cobbler (I kid you not). But will Gerry's continued presence in his widow's life actually retard her ability to let go of the past and start anew? And does this 'Ghost' knockoff stand a ghost of a chance of becoming as universally beloved as that earlier husband-hanging-around-after-death classic? Beyond the cringe-inducing creepiness of its premise, 'P.S. I Love You,' based on the novel by Cecilia Ahern, is one of those annoying romantic comedies in which the women get all goofy, frisky and/or tongue-tied the moment some good-looking guy so much as steps into their line of vision. Moreover, Gerry is portrayed as such a saintly figure, both before his demise and most definitely thereafter, that we never get to know him as a real, flesh-and-blood person in his own right; instead, in order to make all the ladies in the audience swoon over his magnificent romantic spirit - one, I might add, that no man in the real world has the slightest hope of ever living up to - writer/director Richard LaGravenese has seen fit to deprive Gerry of all those flaws each of us is entitled to just for being a member of the human race - and which are truly the only things that make a character interesting in the end. And with that crucial dimension missing from the couple's relationship, we soon lose interest in Holly as well. And, of course, the movie cheats by having Gerry's illness take place entirely off-camera, so as not to disturb the light romantic tone of the piece, but it does little to make us care about the couple. The movie finally hits on some honest sentiment round about the 115-minute mark, and the story does avoid going down one painfully obvious narrative pathway towards the end, but, by that time, it's much too late to undo the damage.A large cast of well-known and talented actors - Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., among them - do yeomen work with poorly written parts, but it's an uphill slog against bathos, pratfalls and contrivance all the way. Well, at least the Irish scenery is lovely.",4,0,0,31 August 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I'm Finally a Convert
","`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' turns out to be a mighty impressive second installment in the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy  and this from someone who wasn't exactly the greatest fan of the first installment, `Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.'  That film, for all its visual splendor, narrative ambition and epic scope, ultimately, turned into little more than a conventional monster movie, with the characters battling one strange creature after another to the point where the film finally became a crashing bore long before its three-hour running time was up.   `The Two Towers,' though equally long (one minute shy of three hours, to be exact), doesn't fall into this monotonous narrative pattern, thereby allowing for more variety in its story and more depth in its characterizations.As someone who knows next to nothing about the specifics of the trilogy, I must say that the story can be a bit hard to follow for the non-initiate. We aren't always sure who is who or just how the battle lines in the various good-vs.-evil conflicts fall out.  This has the unfortunate effect of making the early stretches of the film confusing and, at times, downright incomprehensible.  Luckily, the plot strands begin to straighten themselves out after not too long a time, and one can at least follow the unfolding action well enough to become absorbed in the spectacle on screen.  And impressive that spectacle is, with director Peter Jackson once again creating an entire fantasy world with the help of his cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie, as well as his various art directors, scenic designers and special effects wizards.One of the reasons `The Two Towers' triumphs over `Fellowship of the Ring' is that this newest film provides us with more conflicted, more complex characters.  This is especially true in the case of Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who's been entrusted with the powerful ring, but who must now struggle to avoid becoming taken over by its evil power.  Similarly, Gollum, a loathsome but strangely compelling creature who befriends Frodo in an attempt to wrest the ring from him, suffers with bouts of schizophrenic near-madness as part of him wants simply to do the right thing, and, thereby, garner acceptance and companionship in the process.  These two characters bring some added depth to all the surface magnificence of eye-filling vistas and heart-pounding adventure and battle scenes.Not being familiar with Tolkien's novels, I cannot say to what extent the film is or is not faithful to the original.  I will, therefore, simply state that `The Two Towers' is a powerful and moving saga that can stand on its own as a first-rate movie-going experience.  Having nodded through the first installment of the series, I was not exactly looking forward to Part Two. Now, having seen Part Two, I can't wait to see Part Three.",Null,0,0,31 January 2003
Across the Universe," far from perfect but not a disaster either
","I'm pleased to report that 'Across the Universe' isn't nearly as insufferable as I had expected it to be. As a die-hard Beatles fan, my initial trepidation was not entirely unwarranted, given that the one previous attempt at crafting a movie around the Fab Four's oeuvre was the kitschy, lamentable 'Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' as bad a film as has ever stunk up the inside of a movie theater. Faced with such an appalling precedent, I certainly did not have high hopes for this latest endeavor, which, from its previews, looked to be another Beatles-inspired travesty in the making.The good news is that 'Across the Universe,' written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed by Julie Taymor ('Titus'), never sinks to the level of that earlier fiasco, although it does come perilously close a few times - mainly in the second half of the film when it lapses into pseudo-psychedelia of the worst kind. But, luckily, that doesn't happen very often, and much of the film is surprisingly sweet and charming in its intentions and approach.It's the early 1960's, and a scruffy Paul McCartney look-alike named Jude (Jim Sturgess) leaves his home in Liverpool to find meaning, adventure and purpose in America. While there, he falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Ward), a beautiful young blond who becomes actively involved in the antiwar movement when her fiancé is killed in battle and her brother is shipped off to fight in Vietnam. Their love story is played out against the backdrop of the turbulent '60's, a time of free love, flower-power fashions, peace demonstrations, drug use, and anti-establishment radicalism, all of which find their way into the fabric of the film.The Beatles' canon, which served as the perfect soundtrack for that extraordinary era, is so uniquely rich in songwriting material that each fan is sure to find something to carp about regarding which songs the filmmakers have chosen to put into their film and which they've opted to leave out. I would have preferred more selections from the band's earlier period and slightly fewer from their later, even though I realize that the latter provide the kind of narrative richness and thematic depth around which a group of filmmakers can more easily construct a full-bodied story.Most of the songs are seamlessly sewn into the narrative, although there are times when we can sense the scenarists stretching the material to make a certain song fit. For instance, there's a character named Prudence who serves no real function in the story other than to give the other characters a chance to sing 'Dear Prudence' to her ('Jude' and 'Lucy' are marginally more forgivable since they are at least the names of the main characters in the movie). 'Across the Universe' works best when it keeps its vision simple and close to everyday life. Conversely, it runs into the most trouble when it edges towards surrealism and stylization, often slipping over into pretentiousness and self-indulgence when it does so. Taymor exploits her trademark fascination with puppetry and masks, but the visions she creates with them often feel outdated, cheesy and campy. Particularly egregious is an ill-conceived scene featuring Eddie Izzard as a Timothy Leary-inspired Mr. Kite, a sequence that has the 'Sgt. Pepper' movie imprimatur stamped all over it. Bono doesn't fare much better as Dr. Robert, trapped as he is in one of the most poorly shot psychedelic nightmares since the Beatles' own 'Magical Mystery Tour' movie from 1967.Still, these are minor lapses in a movie that is often funny, touching and captivating in its own right. Most of the credit, of course, goes to the Beatles themselves whose songs are so musically rich and lyrically resonant that they can both define a specific era and literally reach out across the universe at one and the same time. With their film, Taymor and her crew have captured a good deal of that timelessness.",7,7,16,23 September 2007
The Incredibles," gorgeous animated tale
","The animated hit 'The Incredibles' is a parody of superhero and James Bond movies sprinkled with cynical helpings of 'Leave it to Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best.' This seems an odd sort of hybrid until one realizes that The Incredibles are really a crime-busting family made up of a dad named Bob (actually Mr. Incredible), a mom named Helen (aka Elastigirl), a daughter named Violet, and a son named Dash, each of whom comes equipped with his or her own superhero specialty.As the movie opens, we see the family in full fighting regalia, battling criminals, rescuing the innocent, and earning accolades from the city's grateful citizenry. However, even a superhero isn't immune from the excesses of an overly-litigious society, and soon more and more of these superhero crime fighters begin to fall victim to law suits and out-of-court settlements. As a result, not only the Incredibles, but all the known superheroes are forced to withdraw from society, being sent to faraway corners to live out their lives in a sort of witness-protection-program-type anonymity. Safely ensconced in their suburban sanctuary, Helen wants the family to adopt a 'normal' lifestyle, hidden away from the prying eyes of a judgmental society, but Bob is a superhero to the core and he cannot endure the stifling existence imposed on him by suburban domesticity. Thus, he spends most of his time sneaking around behind his wife's back, saving the world on his off-hours. When Paul finds himself in a spot from which even the great Mr. Incredible is not able to extricate himself, it's Helen and the kiddies to the rescue and the adventure really begins.Although the humor in 'The Incredibles' isn't as free-ranging and eclectic as it is in, say, the 'Toy Story' or 'Shrek' movies, the film still manages to generate a goodly number of laughs, primarily through the clever domestication of its superhero figures. Amidst all their battles with evil forces, the family still finds time for marital squabbles and sibling rivalry. But, rest assured, the time-honored themes of family unity and being true to oneself get plenty of play as well.There's first rate voice-over work from Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Wallace Shawn et. al. But there's none better than Brad Bird (who also wrote and directed the film) as Edna 'E' Mode, a hilarious takeoff on elitist fashion designers who makes an indelible mark in the few scenes she's in. The film does suffer a bit from over length and the problem most action-oriented films have of loading on the special effects in the action scenes to the point where the characters and storyline tend to get lost in the shuffle. But that deficiency is more than made up for in the beautifully streamlined, high-tech look of the film which seems both state-of-the-art modern and a little bit retro at one and the same time.'The Incredibles' is a little less ingenious than the 'Shrek' movies, but it has a beauty and charm all its own.",8,3,6,2 May 2005
The Mist," standard monster movie with a slightly elevated tone
","Essentially an unaccredited remake of John Carpenter's 'The Fog,' 'The Mist' is a 50's style B-monster-movie done with 21st Century special effects. It's the oldie about a group of random strangers trapped in an enclosed space - in this case, a local supermarket - while some unknown threat lurks in the world outside. But because it's based on a Stephen King novella, it comes with a veneer of deep-think philosophizing to make it seem better than it actually is.It all begins when a strange mist rolls into a small New England town, harboring within it a menace of an indescribable and deadly nature. Local artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the requisite everyman character who becomes the agreed-upon leader who helps the people trapped in the store cope with the crisis.For the most part, this is standard-issue stuff, with each of the stock characters falling into his or her assigned role - be it the soon-to-be-proved-wrong skeptic, the soon-to-be-cut-down-to-size (in some cases, quite literally) big-mouth braggart, and the curled-up-in-a-fetal-position quivering jellyfish, among others. Heck, there's even an annoying scripture-spouting end-of-days religious fanatic (deliciously played by an over-the-top Marcia Gay Harden) who gets on everyone's last nerve, and who is really just the crazy ornithologist and her drunken detractor from the diner scene in 'The Birds' rolled into one and then writ large.The first half of the movie is filled with people doing and saying some truly unlikely and stupid things, but the second half has a bit more bite to it as it explores the ways in which desperate people will turn on one another through fear and superstition, and, in so doing, become a greater threat to their own survival and safety than the thing outside. But its bleak, oh-so-predictable 'ironic' ending makes us pine for the days when 'The Twilight Zone' managed to do this sort of thing on a weekly basis with a whole lot less hyperventilation and fanfare.",6,1,3,30 July 2012
I Am Legend," a bit conventional but with extraordinary visuals
","Robert Neville is almost literally the last man left on Earth. Through some bizarre trick of fate, he's one of only a handful of people with a natural immunity to a virus that, in less than three years time, has denuded the world of most of its human population. Now, Neville, a renowned virologist himself, spends his days cruising the streets of a deserted Manhattan, and his nights hiding out from the infected cannibalistic mutants who venture forth only after dark (shades of 'The Time Machine,' 'Night of the Living Dead' and dozens of other similar films).'I Am Legend' is just the latest film version of the 1954 Richard Matheson novel that also served as the basis for 1971's 'The Omega Man,' with Charlton Heston in the lead role. Despite its occasional feeling of over-familiarity, 'I Am Legend,' is a generally more subtle and thoughtful work than the average sci-fi film, one that, in addition to its more conventional action sequences and flesh-eating monsters, explores themes like survivors' guilt and the effect of prolonged isolation on the human psyche. The movie, however, is clearly most notable for its remarkably convincing vision of a desolate, post-apocalyptic New York City, where weeds grow promiscuously through holes in the pavement and uninhabited buildings and idle cars serve as ghostly reminders of a civilization now gone from the scene (though one questions whether the place would really look quite this shoddy a mere three years after its abandonment). Kudos to director Francis Lawrence and his crack team of visual and special effects artists for so successfully bringing this concept to life on screen. For the most part, the thrills are nicely balanced with moments of tender sentiment, as Neville reflects back on the time he had with his late wife and daughter.In a role reminiscent of Tom Hanks' in 'Cast Away,' Will Smith, largely bereft of any human companionship, spends most of the movie talking either to himself or to Sam, his loyal German Shepherd. In this setup, Smith once again demonstrates that he is definitely a commanding presence on screen, keeping us interested even in those moments when not much is actually happening in the story. For, there is, admittedly, a trifle more downtime in the movie than many of the more hardcore action fans would probably like. That objection aside, however, 'I Am Legend' provides enough food for thought and a sufficient number of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills to make it worth watching.",7,0,2,16 January 2008
School of Rock," Black attack
","After distinguishing himself in any number of memorable supporting roles, Jack Black finally comes into his own in 'The School of Rock,' a sporadically funny comedy that is part 'Sister Act' and part genial spoof of all those movies about a 'super teacher' who brings meaning and purpose to the lives of his students.Black plays Dewey Finn, an aging rock'n'roller who is still awaiting that moment when he will 'make it big' in the music world. He lives with Ned Schneebly, his longtime rocker buddy, who has traded in his dreams of musical glory for a nagging girlfriend and a job as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money to pay the rent, Dewey pretends to be Schneebly and takes a job as a sub at a snooty, tradition-bound prep school, where the last thing the administration and the parents would want is a Jimmy Hendricks knockoff teaching their kids. And since Dewey really only knows one thing, this uncredentialed professorial imposter decides to make rock'n'roll the sole focus of his curriculum, turning these inward, shy, nerdish kids into a viable rock band - all under the radar screen of the ever-watchful administrators and parents of course.Although the storyline wends its way along a predictable path, writer Mike White and director Richard Linklater find a great deal of warmth and humor in the material. Dewey's utter obsession with rock music and rock history is reflected in the fact that he leads the band members in a prayer to the 'god of rock' before a concert, and screams in frustration - 'What have they been teaching you kids at this school?' - when he finds out his pupils have never been educated in the basics of Hendricks, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Dewey is so preposterously well-meaning and good-natured that the audience can't help but root for him and his students as they embark on their mad quest to appear at a local battle of the bands competition, unbeknownst to the powers-that-be at the school.The children playing the students are all winning and charming, and Joan Cusack cuts a sympathetic figure as the uptight school principal who harbors a little bit of Stevie Nicks under her prim and proper exterior. But it is Black who makes this film his own, turning what might have been a buffoonish caricature into a fully-rounded human being. Black is not afraid to cut loose and take over the screen when necessary, hitting heights of unbridled mania to rival the master, Jim Carrey. Yet, he also realizes that he is part of an ensemble effort here and understands the importance of integrating himself into the material and not always dominating it. As a result, even when certain elements of the film fall flat, as they frequently do, Black is always there to prop the movie back up.'The School of Rock' is an entertaining little comedy, but unlike a real satire which would skewer the conventions of the genre it is attacking, this film loses its nerve and winds up endorsing those conventions. Dewey, for all his talk about defying 'The Man,' is really a rebel in name only, and the film reflects the kind of feel-good populism that no true hard line iconoclast would be caught dead supporting. I guess it's too much to expect a mainstream Hollywood comedy to launch a truly savage assault on mainstream values (in the way rock, at its best, often does). Still, it might be nice to come across the unexpected sometime (after all, movies like 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'MASH' were able to do it).Until then, we'll settle for what we can get. And Jack Black is good enough for now.",7,49,74,20 December 2004
Gran Torino," Eastwood in his finest performance ever
","Growing old certainly seems to agree with Clint Eastwood. For popular as he was at the box office, Eastwood, in the early stages of his career at least, never seemed entirely comfortable in an actor's skin - his performances often coming across as stiff and wooden as he mumbled his way through perpetualy clenched teeth and the barest minimum of dialogue (it wasn't for no reason that critics always charitably described his early characters as 'laconic'). Yet, now that he's encased in an old man's body, that stiffness couldn't be more organic to the characters he's playing - or more effortlessly natural. In 'Gran Turino,' Eastwood returns for one last time to the role of the lone gunslinger - whether it be on the western frontier as the Man With No Name or on the meanest of urban mean streets as Dirty Harry - that made him an icon for a generation of moviegoers who grew up on his films. Yet, it is a return tempered by the kind of wisdom and restraint that only age and a lifetime's worth of experience can bring.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a septuagenarian who is practically the walking definition of a grumpy old man. A Korean War vet still haunted by the memories of what he saw and did there, Walt is a prickly, snarling, irreligious cynic who doesn't much cotton to the informality and lax standards of the modern world. He also happens to be the most 'lovable' bigot to come our way since Archie Bunker, a thoroughgoing racist who doesn't hesitate to spit out every politically incorrect epithet he can lay his hands on when the situation calls for it (although, in all fairness, he doesn't hesitate to refer to himself as a 'Pollack' from time to time as well). The key thing to understand about Walt, however, is that while he may be filled with venomous hatred for much of his fellow Man, he knows how to cut through a line of BS when he hears it (much to the consternation of his heighborhood priest, who keeps proferring Walt a chance at salvation if he'll just go to confession). Distraught at the loss of his beloved wife, Walt wages a one-man war against the army of immigrants that has 'invaded' his formerly all-white, lower middle class neighborhood in recent years. Walt is particularly irked by the Asian family who's moved in next door, until he's befriended by the teenage daughter, who slowly and cautiously brings him into their world. Walt, in turn, takes her younger brother under his wing, helping him stand up to the gang members who taunt and threaten him on almost a daily basis.'Gran Torino' is fraught with any number of potential pitfalls, all of which are deftly sidestepped by Nick Schenk's screenplay, Eastwood's direction and, most notably, Eastwood's performance in the starring role. The image of an old man single-handedly staring down a bunch of hardcore gangbangers could easily have elicited laughs under other circumstances, but because Eastwood draws upon our cherished memories of his well established image as a tough guy, we are able to suspend our disbelief and accept it all at face value. This is one time when the audience's previous familiarity with and affection for an actor truly pays off in a big way. Moreover, even though we know where the story is going - that this unyielding curmudgeon will eventually be won over and softened by his experience with this alien culture and the people in it - the easygoing tone of the film keeps it from becoming preachy or mawkish. In fact, what strikes one most is just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be, and this is due almost exclusively to Eastwood's sly, often playful performance. With a disarming cynic's grin and a sardonic twinkle in his eye, Eastwood makes a potentially one-note character into a fully fleshed-out human being.For while the other performances in the film are uneven at best, 'Gran Torino' contains the best work Eastwood has ever done on screen. The movie serves as a valedictory of sorts for a man whose most recent movie triumphs have all taken place on the other side of the camera. This role is like that last walk the hero takes down the middle of main street before heading off into the sunset. It's a bittersweet image befitting one of the genuine cinematic icons of all time.",8,0,3,22 January 2009
Hero," A Stunning Work of Art
","The Hollywood action crowd could learn a thing or two from 'Hero,' a martial arts picture that tells a complex story to go along with its fight scenes and generates one unforgettable image after another.Set in the period before China became a united kingdom, 'Hero' deals with such classic themes as courage, self-sacrifice, honor, revenge and romantic passion, and does so on a scale that is both intimate and epic. In this tale about the founding of a nation, the protagonist is a master swordsman, known only as 'Nameless,' who is either an assassin of other would-be assassins who are out to kill a king, or an assassin bent on killing the king himself. The beauty of the story is that it unfolds in the form of a mystery, almost 'Rashomon'-like in the way it views the same incidents from the differing and often contradictory perspectives of various characters, some of them eyewitnesses to the events and others spinning tales out of pure speculation. Like the images in a kaleidoscope, the plot points are constantly grouping, then falling to pieces, then re-grouping into other patterns until a full-blown picture of the entire story at last emerges.The kaleidoscope analogy is a fitting one, for it is in its visuals that 'Hero' truly becomes a masterpiece. The film is like an artist's canvas brought brilliantly to life, a canvas covered with the most vivid and eye-popping colors imaginable. Whether it's the sight of huge armies marching against impressive landscapes, their flags of war fluttering in the breeze, or thousands upon thousands of arrows soaring through the air in a literal rain of death, or a beautifully choreographed fight scene in a meadow strewn with impossibly yellow and red autumn leaves, 'Hero''s imagery makes an indelible impression on the viewer. As is the custom with many recent Chinese films, the swordfight scenes have been turned into slow motion ballets, with the participants defying gravity by flying effortlessly through the air to unimaginable heights. This emphasis on the surreal gives the film the mythic quality it needs to tells its ancient tale.Yet, even with all its visual sumptuousness, 'Hero' never forgets that it is, first and foremost, a story about people - their lives, their loves, and the conflicts they face as they play out the roles assigned to them by history. Rather than getting buried under all the visuals, the characters are able to stand out from the background and make their mark on the viewer's heart. This is helped immeasurably by the fine performances from Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Maggie Cheung among others.Kudos to writers Feng Li and Bin Wang, director Yimou Zhang, cinematographer Christopher Doyle, costume designer Emi Wada and all the other talented artists who have had a hand in crafting one of the most visually exquisite and intellectually satisfying films in recent memory. American movie makers please take note!",9,4,10,12 November 2005
Shrek the Third," Shrek dreck
","It would be safe to say that the third time is definitely NOT the charm when it comes to the 'Shrek' series, since 'Shrek the Third' lacks virtually all the imaginativeness, wit and magic that made the previous two installments such tremendous fun for young and old viewers alike. In this latest go-round, the writers have clearly run out of comical inspiration, leaving us with a humorless farrago of labored jokes and sappy life-lessons (mainly about the joys of prospective fatherhood and the importance of being willing to take a chance in life) guaranteed to please no target audience or age group whatsoever.In this edition, Shrek's father-in-law, the frog king of the realm of Far Far Away, bequeaths his crown to Shrek on his deathbed unless the reluctant ogre can find a distant heir (the young Arthur) to take his place. Shrek, filled with doubts about his own ability to rule the kingdom, heads off with his faithful companions, Donkey and Puss In Boots, to find the boy and bring him back with them to the castle where he will assume his rightful place on the throne. Meanwhile, the vain, conniving Prince Charming has decided to enlist the aid of all the villains of the kingdom to mount a coup so that he can proclaim himself ruler of the land.As I reckon them, there are about five hearty laughs in 'Shrek the Third,' and at least four of them come in the opening scene of the film (a very funny parody of third-rate dinner theater). Unfortunately, it's all pretty much downhill from there, as one ostensibly comic line after another crashes and burns, leaving us with little but the gorgeous backdrops and seamless animation to hold our attention. Regarding the latter point, it must be stated that movie animators have certainly come a long way in perfecting the facial expressions of their characters, but what is the point of such a technological advancement if it is placed in the service of as dismal a script as Andrew Adams, Howard Gould, Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, J. David Stern, David N. Weiss, and Jon Zack have concocted here? Somehow, you know you're in trouble when no fewer than seven writers have a hand in a screenplay, but couldn't at least one of them have come up with a funny joke or two while they were hammering it all out? Moreover, the story itself is dull and plodding and even the 'Shrek' trademark of piling on clever pop culture references falls flat in this instance (and having Medieval teenagers blabbing away in already-dated Valley Girl lingo just doesn't cut it). Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas still provide yeoman service as the voices of Donkey and Puss In Boots, respectively, but even they can't keep the whole enterprise from feeling as if blockbuster rigor mortis has finally set in. Unlike the two earlier films in the series, 'Shrek the Third' feels less the product of a magic spell than of a divine curse.",4,115,177,20 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," an extraordinary cinematic achievement
","Unlike many of the earlier films on the same subject, 'The Hurt Locker' starts off by accepting the Iraq war as a given. That is to say it doesn't try to place the issue in any kind of larger sociopolitical context or to explain why the Americans felt compelled to wage the conflict in the first place. Instead, it focuses on the everyday activities of a three-man Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit (EOD) whose job it is to dismantle, as safely as possible, the literally hundreds of still-to-be-detonated IEDs strewn across the streets of Baghdad. The leader of the trio has just been killed in the line of duty and has now been replaced by a newcomer whose seeming recklessness and flagrant disregard for protocol doesn't sit well with the other members of the team, who feel that their own survival is being needlessly threatened by his carelessness - especially now that there is less than a month-and-a-half left to go before the team is to be taken out of rotation.Before getting to the more 'literary' aspects of the film, let's just say right up front that, on a strictly 'cinematic' level, 'The Hurt Locker' is an astonishing accomplishment in every sense of the term. Director Kathryn Bigelow employs hand-held cameras, razor-sharp editing and an abundance of point-of-view shots to create a film of palpable, nail-biting immediacy that plunges the audience directly into the heart of the action. Yet, she punctuates that with the nonstop sound of jet fighters roaring overhead just to remind us that, hard as it may be to imagine at times, there is an even larger war taking place somewhere beyond the reaches of the one we see here. This story is clearly just one of many.On a thematic level, the movie explores the various ways these three men cope with the inconceivable stress of life on the battlefield. Staff Sergeant William James finds an adrenaline-pumping thrill in living life on the edge, of always being just a hair-trigger away from possible death. Specialist Owen Eldridge, on the other hand, has become so obsessed with death that he fears he will freeze up right at the moment when he needs to be most clear-headed, steady-handed and steely-nerved. And Sergeant T.J. Sanborn occupies a kind of pragmatic, middle ground between the two, willing to put his life on the line to get the job done but not to willy-nilly just tempt fate for the sake of doing so. Yet, thanks to Marc Boal's perceptive screenplay, each man emerges as a complex individual in his own right, never a 'type.' James, for instance, may be wild and reckless, but he also has a caring, compassionate side that he reveals in off-handed and unexpected moments of tenderness towards others and loyalty towards his men. And there's a stunning coda that forces us, perhaps reluctantly, to see James in an entirely different light from how we've been viewing him up to that point.Relative unknowns Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are heartbreakingly effective as James, Sanborn and Eldridge, respectively, managing to create fully realized, empathetic characters amidst all the pyrotechnic war-movie effects. And even a few familiar faces - Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly from 'Lost' - show up at various points in the film (in a way, this use of 'stars' - though obviously done for purposes of procuring financing - could easily have compromised the integrity of the picture, but the unusual way Bigelow uses them helps to mitigate that effect).The real key to 'The Hurt Locker''s success is that it never sacrifices intimacy for the grander picture, never allows the war movie setting to supercede the characters and their stories. It is first, last and always a movie about ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. It's also unforgettable.",9,1,9,16 January 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," excellent submarine saga
","`K-19: The Widowmaker' is a superb Cold War submarine saga, brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow and featuring solid performances by a first-rate cast.  Based on a true story that occurred in 1961, but which only came to light in the West after the fall of the Soviet Union, `K-19' shows how close the world came to experiencing a nuclear explosion thanks to rank Soviet incompetence.  `K-19' was the pride of the Russian navy, a nuclear-powered sub that the leaders felt would help the Soviets achieve parity with the United States in the escalating arms race occurring at that time.   But on the boat's maiden voyage things managed to go terribly wrong, thanks mostly to the gross ineptitude of the leaders in charge of building and equipping the boat.   Poorly made, inadequately supplied and lacking the necessary back up plans in case of a dire emergency, the sub set out on its mission with not one but two captains aboard, Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) and Alexi Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), the latter sent in by the Soviet higher-ups to take over the mission after questions arose as to the ability of Polenin to handle such a crucially important mission.  Much of the tension in the film arises from the conflict that develops between the humanitarian instincts of Polenin and the hard-nosed, almost maniacally rigid Vostrikov who seems almost willing to sacrifice the lives of his men rather than to admit defeat of any kind.Working off the screenplay by Christopher Kyle, director Bigalow minimizes the clichés usually associated with films set aboard submarines and concentrates instead on the human drama at the story's core.  Sure we have the obligatory scene wherein the obsessed captain, wanting to push both the boat and the crew to their respective limits, ends up ordering that the sub be taken down to near-crush level.  But that scene is kept very short and comprises only a very small part of the whole drama.  Of much greater interest to the filmmakers  and to the audience   is the way in which the men react to a crisis of almost unimaginable proportions.  When the core nuclear reactor gives way and the men are faced with the threat of death through radiation poisoning, the film becomes both a gripping suspense drama and a poignant study of fear, duty and heroism.  Bigalow keeps the tension high throughout by recording not only the fascinating details of the reactor disaster itself, but also the clash that develops between the two captains as they struggle for power and try to weigh the lives of the men against the importance of the mission and the patriotic call to duty. 
Technically, the film does a superb job keeping focused on the intense drama of the situation.  With superb editing and sound effects, the film makes us sense what life must really be like aboard that sub.  Bigalow effectively uses the moving camera techniques pioneered by Wolfgang Peterson in `Das Boot' to help keep the action flowing.  She is also blessed with a fine cast including Ford and Neeson who play off each other brilliantly, both actors showing the same stubbornness and humanity that define each of their characters, even though they seem to be at loggerheads during much of the time.  Peter Sarsgaard is also excellent as the inexperienced crewmember who struggles with his own conflict between fear and duty, heroism and cowardice. Though the film does become a bit heavy-handed and sentimental in its closing stretches, `K-19' is, over all, one of the more intelligent action movies of the past several years.  It also happens to be the best submarine picture since the classic `Das Boot.'",Null,0,0,22 July 2002
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," inert and drippy
","We've all dealt with unrequited love before, but 'New Moon,' the second installment in the popular 'Twilight' series, takes it to a whole new level. Bella Swan, the moody high school student who found herself in love with a vampire - the brooding Edward - in the first film, now finds herself attracted to a werewolf, her long-haired Native American childhood pal turned cropped-haired, muscle-bound super-hunk, Jacob. Now, that's a love triangle you don't come across every day of the week.This disappointing, time-marking follow-up to the flawed but often imaginative 'Twilight' is a tedious, slow-moving bore, consisting of little more than endless conversations about which of Bella's two 'monstrous' beaus loves her the more and which is more likely to protect her from the danger posed by his rival and the assorted associates and kinsmen who come with him. In fact, so focused is the story on the romantic travails of the three main characters that the movie ultimately stalls out in a puddle of its own sappiness. And on a purely technical level, even the CGI werewolves are not as impressive as we'd expect them to be, given the massive amount of cash clearly lavished on the project.Actually, the thing that strikes one the most about 'New Moon' is just how much of a rehash it is of the previous film, with Bella's predicament simply being played over, only this time with a lover from a different species (especially as Edward voluntarily removes himself from much of the action this time around).Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson return as the human/vampire lovers, while Lautner gets to run around with his shirt off a good deal of the time (despite the damp, rainy climate). That may be enough to keep the movie's targeted audience of teenaged girls awake and glued to the screen for the duration, but the rest of us will have no trouble snoozing our way through to the next installment.",4,5,7,9 November 2010
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," hit-and-miss sequel
","I have to admit to being one of only a tiny handful of people who DIDN'T think 'The Fantastic Four' was a terrible movie. Frankly, even though I could tell that it wasn't a particularly GOOD movie, still I rather enjoyed its breezy unpretentiousness and lighthearted refusal to take itself too seriously. However, I'm not really sure that this material was exactly crying out for further amplification, and, indeed, the inevitable sequel, 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,' is an only sporadically engaging entry in the ever-expanding and now preposterously overcrowded field of comic book superhero movies.Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben return as the chemically-altered crime fighters, who in between battling evildoers and dodging celebrity-hunting paparazzi, are bent on living as normal a life as their phenomenal superpowers and the demands of their adoring, star struck public will allow. Achieving such normalcy is easier said than done, however, for on the day when Reed and Sue are finally about to officially tie the knot and utter their 'I do's,' in on a celestial surfboard rides a silver-clad gentleman from the farthest reaches of outer space determined to wreak havoc on the planet.The film may not have much going for it in the plot department, but that Silver Surfer is sure one gnarly dude, and the filmmakers have done a truly 'fantastic' job bringing him to life on screen. It's enough to make one wish they would change the quartet to a quintet for the next inevitable go-round. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba as Reed and Sue are once again reduced to playing 'straight men' to Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis' Johnny and Ben, who, in true second-banana fashion, walk off with all the good lines in the film. The humor is mainly of the schoolyard-banter variety, but there are a few zippy zingers sprinkled in amongst the predictable cluster of clunkers. The same cannot be said for the 'serious' dialogue, however, which often drips with maudlin sentimentality and homiletic self-importance.Director Tim Story has filmed the flying scenes for maximum speed and effectiveness, and the locales have, for the most part, been well-chosen and well-photographed. The special effects are seamless and even awe-inspiring on occasion, although the shots of Reed expanding his rubberized limbs to enormous lengths do look a bit fake at times.If nothing else, it's at least a lot shorter than 'Spider-Man 3' (barely over ninety minutes). Surely, that must count for something.",5,1,3,16 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," doesn't quite rise to the level of its ambitions
","Just as its title character reverses the process of aging - beginning as a wrinkled old man and ending as a smooth-faced infant - so too does 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' reverse the quality arc we've come to expect from many of our movies - that of starting off strongly in the developmental stages then coming a cropper in the dreaded 'third act.' Instead, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' falters through much of its early and middle stretches, then achieves something akin to greatness towards the end.The main problem with 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' - which has been loosely adapted from an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story by scenarists Eric Roth and director David Fincher - is that it's trying so hard to be great that it frequently forgets to be good. To begin with, the movie frames its tale within what is possibly the hoariest storytelling cliché of them all: the dreaded deathbed confession. The dying person, in this case, is an elderly woman named Daisy, whose secret love of her life was the aforementioned Benjamin Button. As she lies in her hospital bed barely clinging to life - while Hurricane Katrina, of all things, batters away outside - Daisy has her understandably disconcerted daughter (Julia Ormond) read the journal detailing the couple's ill-fated romance. The story proper begins in 1918 New Orleans with the birth of Benjamin, a child with all the physical attributes of a dying old man. Abandoned by his father (his mother having died giving birth to him), Benjamin is taken in and raised by a compassionate black woman who lives and works at an old folk's home. As time passes, the strange child, rather than dying as predicted, slowly becomes younger and healthier, till finally he is strong enough and mature enough to venture out on his own to explore the world and make a life for himself. This includes a couple of key romances, the main one being with Daisy, a young girl he initially meets when he is still a boy trapped in an old man's body, and a stint working on a tugboat which lands him unexpectedly smack dab in the middle of World War II. To relate anymore of the story would be to do an injustice to both the movie and anyone interested in experiencing it for himself.The most serious weakness of the film lies in the assumption on the part of its makers that just because something interesting is happening TO the character of Benjamin Button that there must be something interesting ABOUT him. On the contrary, Benjamin remains such a bland and passive person throughout the course of the story that we really don't learn very much about him - this, despite the fact that Benjamin has been called upon to narrate the tale in his own words. Unfortunately, the narration has such a you-are-there, Confucius-say banality to it that Benjamin comes perilously close to slipping into Forrest Gump territory much of the time. Much more detrimental is the fact that Benjamin really doesn't act or speak all that differently when he is a man/child from when he is an older 'young' man. We see him changing physically, but not nearly enough psychologically, rendering the premise, finally, more of a gimmick than a gateway into enlightenment. Moreover, the film suffers from a built-in episodic structure that weakens the drama and vitiates the tension.All that being said, there is still much that is good about 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' and that makes it worth seeing, starting with the originality and cleverness of the premise itself. In addition, there are fine performances by Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton and, most notably, Faune A. Chambers, as the woman who raises Benjamin to believe that he is really no different from the rest of us whose biological clocks just happen to be moving forward rather than backward. Needless to say, the CGI effects and aging makeup are expert throughout, and when it finally settles down and focuses on the romantic relationship between Benjamin and Daisy, the movie becomes a thoughtful and tremendously moving meditation on aging, the inexorable passage of time, and the importance of living our lives in - and for - the present. In fact, so effective is the final third of the movie that, for all intents and purposes, it makes us forget the restlessness we may have experienced at other points in the story and leaves us feeling notably elated at the end. It is here where the movie finally begins to achieve that greatness it's worked so hard and taken us so long to get to. But achieve it it does - and that is accomplishment enough these days when you get right down to it.",7,1,2,21 January 2009
Transformers," when humor trumps even special effects
","The thing that strikes you the most while watching the movie 'Transformers' is not how spectacular its special effects are or how ferociously its action sequences come across on screen, but rather how very FUNNY so much of the movie manages to be. After having sat stone-faced through many of the alleged 'comedies' foisted upon us in recent months - 'Evan Almighty,' 'License to Wed,' even 'Shrek the Third,' to name just a few - I'm pleased to announce that I laughed quite a bit throughout the course of 'Transformers' - and I do mean good-sized belly-laughs, not mere titters or snickers. Prime credit for that obviously goes to screenwriters, Roberto Orci and Ales Kurtzman, but I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge Shia LaBeouf's contributions in this regard. In this his first certified blockbuster, LaBeouf finally achieves the superstardom he's been steadily heading towards the past several years.As everyone already knows, 'Transformers' is based on a phenomenally successful line of Hasbro toys as well as the animated series derived therefrom. Transformers are giant robots from outer space who have the ability to metamorphose into the shape of virtually any everyday mechanical device - cars, cell phones, boom boxes etc. - they so desire. In the film, the transformers have just arrived on earth in search of a mysterious box that has the power to create an army of such robots that, given unbridled freedom, would be able to take over the world. Some of the transformers have evil intentions while others have an affinity for mankind and do their best to keep us out of the clutches of the bad guys. LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a brainy, perpetually tongue-tied (especially when he's trying to impress the unreachable girl of his dreams) social outcast whose father agrees to help him buy a rundown Camaro that, unbeknownst to either of them, is actually a good transformer in disguise just waiting for Sam to become his owner.It goes without saying that, on a strictly technical level, the transformers have made a stunning transition to the live action format. There are brief moments when they appear a trifle fake, but director Michael Bay keeps the action moving along at such a dizzying pace, that we rarely have time to notice that flaw. I'm not one who normally goes in for Bay's cuisinart style of movie-making - near-subliminal quick cuts mixed in with endless explosions and rafter-rattling sound effects - but I think it works quite well in this instance. He's also blessed in having LaBeouf as his lead actor, for it is LaBeouf's non-threatening All-American Boy looks and wide-eyed innocence that give the movie the emotional grounding it needs to be more than just the lumbering mechanical creation it could easily have become without him. In fact, whenever he isn't on screen, the movie does, indeed, threaten to devolve into just the standard popcorn action movie filled with jaw-dropping special effects but minus a heart or soul (the transformers themselves are never very interesting as characters and they are stuck mouthing sappy platitudes whenever they do get a chance to speak). But LaBeouf brings to the movie the human dimension it needs to keep our interest.Kevin Dunn and Julie White are thoroughly delightful as Sam's well-meaning but utterly befuddled parents, while Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson also score high on the laughter meter. For purposes of gravitas, movie veterans Jon Voight and John Turturro are also along for the ride.And quite a ride it turns out to be, I must say. 'Transformers' has pretty much everything a modern-day blockbuster needs to be successful. But it is the rare good humor with which the movie plays its hand that is so completely unexpected - and so very much appreciated in this quarter.",7,0,4,16 July 2007
Men in Black II," bland sequel
","`Originality,' is, almost by definition, a one-time thing.  In 1997, the original `Men in Black' struck a nerve with movie audiences by showing that even a big budget blockbuster, heavily loaded down with state-of-the-art, computer-generated special effects, could still manage to seem light on its feet.  The makers of that film pulled off this feat of gravitational legerdemain by coming up with a concept and a script overflowing with creativity, wit, imagination and a cachet of `hipness' to go along with its tone of anarchic playfulness.Well, five years have passed and we now have `Men in Black II' to confirm what most of us suspected all along:  that works that rely on `uniqueness' as their prime selling point are rarely ever able to duplicate their success a second time around.   Five years can be a lifetime in pop culture and what seemed `cool' one summer can appear decidedly `old hat' the next.  Without that aura of cutting edge newness that defined the original, `Men in Black II' seems like just another loud, over-the-top summertime blockbuster.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back playing Jay and Kay, agents for the government's top secret organization whose job it is to monitor the activities of the thousands of aliens who have secretly infiltrated earth's societies and to help protect the planet from any possible threat from interstellar space.  Smith and Jones still appear to be quite comfortable in their roles and they are aided by Lara Flynn Boyle, as Serleena, the baddest alien this side of Darth Vader, and Rip Torn, delightful as Zed, the slightly cracked head of the Men in Black agency.Although the special effects in this film are, as one would expect in this day and age, astonishing and virtually seamless, the same can definitely NOT be said for the film's screenplay.  The story moves along at a fairly fast clip, but it rarely makes us laugh.  In fact, the script comes across as undisciplined nonsense, lacking both logic and coherence.  Unlike in the earlier film, we get the sense that literally everything here has been placed at the service of the special effects.  There's an awful lot of running and bouncing around but rarely to any point or purpose.  Indeed, we end up feeling at the end somehow more exhausted and drained than exhilarated and euphoric.  It would appear that director Barry Sonnenfeld thought that if he could just keep the thing MOVING we wouldn't notice that he had nothing new to offer in this retread.   It doesn't work.  In fact, if `Men in Black II' shows us anything, it is that just because something MOVES doesn't mean that it can't bore us at the same time.",Null,86,124,16 July 2002
Wimbledon," harmless piece of romantic fluff
","'Wimbledon' is a charming love-conquers-all romantic comedy set in the highly competitive world of professional tennis.Peter Colt is an aging player who has slipped to 119 in the world rankings; it is for this reason that he plans to hang up his racket after what he believes will be his swan song appearance at Wimbledon. What he isn't counting on is that he will meet and fall in love with a beautiful and sexy up-and-coming player named Lizzie Bradbury, a turn of events which seems to be having a very positive effect on his game. Soon, he's racking up surprise, come-from-behind wins in the tournament, becoming a major focus of attention for appreciative fans all over Great Britain. The problem is that, as Peter's game improves as a result of the romance, Lizzie's seems to be getting worse, a fact which threatens to put a serious strain on the young couple's burgeoning relationship.Although the story itself is rather innocuous and silly, Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst do achieve a genuine rapport on screen. It's also nice to have a protagonist in a romantic comedy who is not exactly in his physical prime and who is facing some of the rigors of advancing age (he's all of 30, practically his dotage when it comes to professional tennis!). Moreover, the setting is novel and there is just enough of that brittle British humor in the screenplay to keep the film from feeling puerile and canned. It's true that Lizzie seems to be an entirely different person off the court than she is on, but that is just one of those inconsistencies we tend to expect from a movie in which credibility isn't necessarily a prime factor in determining our overall enjoyment of it. And director Richard Loncraine manages to generate some genuine suspense in the final showdown between Peter and the odds-on favorite he isn't expected to beat.'Wimbledon' is pure Cinderella romantic fantasy crossed with a David and Goliath, underdog-takes-on-the-reigning-champ sports story.

Lincoln," A great historical film
","For his biopic 'Lincoln,' rather than try to cram a man's entire life into a two-and-a-half-hour running time, Steven Spielberg has wisely chosen to keep the focus circumscribed and narrow: on the winter of 1865, four years into the Civil War, as the President works to secure passage of the highly controversial 13th Amendment, which, when ratified, will abolish slavery as an institution in the United States for all time to come. Lincoln's main hope is to convince a skeptical and still highly racist public that such a move is essential to bringing an end to a war that has already claimed 600,000 of their young men's lives. The obstacles that remain are the Democrats in Congress who are universally opposed to such a move and many Republicans who think this constitutional amendment may well pave the way to universal suffrage, with not just blacks but women ultimately being given the right to vote. Lincoln's major hope is to convince a sufficient number of lame duck Democrats to come over to his side, while not allowing the amendment's passage to throw a monkey wrench into any possibility of surrender on the part of the Confederacy.A man of both faith and reason, pragmatism and passion, Lincoln knew that he stood on the threshold of history, that he needed to act decisively and at that very moment to wipe out the scourge of slavery that, since the young nation's inception, had brought shame and evil to a republic ostensibly founded on the concept that all men are created equal.The movie beautifully captures Lincoln as a man bowed down by the burden of his position and the times in which he not only lived but played so vital a role in shaping, a brilliant but self-effacing man, keenly cognizant of his humble beginnings, as ready to lend an ear to the lowliest foot soldier or telegraph operator as to the greatest general or politician - indeed more eager in some cases, for he knew that the common man often had more honesty in his answer and wisdom in his soul than the great one.This is the man whom screenwriter Tony Kushner and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, upon whose book 'Team of Rivals' the movie is based, present to the audience.But that isn't all. The movie also functions as both a fascinating look into the events of the time and as an illustration of how even the noblest advances in human history have often arisen out of a messy combination of moral compromise and shady back-room deal-making. The most obvious embodiment of that is Thaddeus Stephens (played with solid conviction and a sly self-awareness by Tommy Lee Jones), a Republican Congressman who has to weigh his strong abolitionist views against the pragmatic need to get things right.The script encompasses Lincoln's domestic circle as well, as it explores the complex relationship between Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), a brutally frank, sharp-tongued woman frequently brought low by debilitating migraines and steeped in grief over the loss of their young son, Todd, a few years back. We also see the effect of all this on the Lincolns' oldest son, Robert (Joseph Gordon- Levitt), who is forced to live in the shadow of a great man, convinced he will never be able to live at peace with himself unless he is allowed to fight alongside all the other boys of his age on the field of battle.A host of familiar faces - David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Walter Goggins, James Spader, S. Epatha Merkerson, among them - flesh out the canvas. And what a glorious canvas it turns out to be, thanks to meticulous set decoration and costume design as well as cinematography by the great Janusz Kaminski that filters the action through duskily-lit interiors and near-sepia-toned exteriors.Of course, 'Lincoln' would not be the triumph it is without the exemplary performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, who manages to turn a towering figure of history into a recognizable human being. Stoop-shouldered and slow of speech and motion, Day-Lewis conveys the quiet gravity that allows us to understand just how this one man could command the respect of so many of the people of his time and, in so doing, move mountains.All involved have made 'Lincoln' a portrait worthy of its subject.",9,4,6,19 January 2014
Rules of Engagement," flawed but fascinating film
","Had William Friedken's `Rules of Engagement' had the courage to travel down a different route, it might have emerged as a great film rather than merely the good one it turns out to be.  Credit this big budget action film with at least attempting to address a morally complex issue in a morally complex way.  That the film doesn't succeed completely is probably due to the restraints imposed on it by both studio and box office considerations.The film poses a number of long-debated military questions:  when used in the context of an endeavor like war - whose primary aim is to take away the lives of one's enemy - is the term 'rules of engagement' itself an untenable paradox?    Does it even makes sense to have 'rules' when it comes to war? And can there be such a thing as an `innocent victim' killed in the heat of battle?  And can a commander who orders the deaths of such people in a wartime situation be convicted of `murder'?Samuel L. Jackson stars as Colonel Terry Childers, a decorated Vietnam War hero who suddenly finds himself on trial for court martial for ordering his men to open fire on an allegedly unarmed group of Islamic protesters demonstrating outside the United States embassy in Yemen.  Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as Hays Hodges, the man whom Childers saved in a battle in Vietnam who now, as a self-described mediocre lawyer, has the chance to pay back his buddy by clearing his name in court.  `Rules of Engagement' raises a number of fascinating issues, but I contend that the film would have been even more interesting than it is (and it IS interesting) if it had left the audience in doubt as to Childers' innocence or guilt.  Instead, we know from the beginning that Childers' version of the events in question is the accurate one, which robs the film of the kind of gripping human drama that can be achieved only through an examination of the ambiguities that make up human motives and actions.  This means that we know who the heroes and villains are right away.  There is even a tell-all video of the event to be secreted and ultimately destroyed by an unctuous government official.  Thus, we end up with yet another David vs. Goliath story, yet another soldier-at-the-mercy-of-the-U.S.-military-industrial-complex scenario, when what we really crave is something more challenging, more ambiguous, more morally complex.These elements are what keep `Rules of Engagement' from being an extraordinary achievement.  Yet, there are many positive aspects of the film as well.  For one thing, it avoids the temptation to become a xenophobic, flag-waving pro-American/anti-Islamic diatribe.  It certainly doesn't shy away from portraying the tragic toll inflicted by the shooting on the protestors present.   In addition, it allows its two male leads to display honest emotions like regret, confusion and self-doubt.  They are even permitted to cry from time to time.  In a way, both actors have been cast a bit against type, since neither is portraying the self-assured, almost cocky brand of hero he is usually called on to play.Most important is that, despite the feeling of compromise, the film does raise some fascinating moral issues that too few major films even bother to consider.  If this review comes across as more negative than it should, it is merely because the potential for greatness is always regrettable when it is not achieved.  Nevertheless, `Rules of Engagement' deserves to be seen and admired for what did make it to the screen.  For all its imperfections, this  really is a very good film.",Null,0,1,8 April 2001
Children of Men," falls short of greatness due to its formulaic nature
","One of these days, some innovative filmmaker is going to make a movie set in a future where the skies are crystalline blue, governments treat their citizens with decency and respect, and people live in relative harmony with both technology and one another. But until that time we have 'Children of Men,' yet another dystopian vision of what life might be like in the not-too-distant future - and, as usual, it ain't a pretty picture.Based on a novel by P.D. James, 'Children of Men' takes place in the year 2027, a time in which the world has been thrown into chaos by war and disease, and the entire human race has been infertile for 18 years. Only Merry Olde England has, for some reason, been able to escape the generalized destruction (though not the infertility). In a bid to protect the nation from hostile outside elements, the government has begun to round up all its illegal aliens, locking them into cages and deporting them off the island (when it isn't slaughtering them outright).The overrated Clive Owens plays a Ministry of Energy bureaucrat who, much against his will, finds himself caught up in a plot to transport a young pregnant woman - the world's first since 2009 - to a place of safety so she can hopefully help to restart the otherwise doomed human race (although one wonders how a single child in the world will effectuate that outcome).'Children of Men' has much to recommend it. It has a strong sense of time and place, with a look that is just right for its subject matter. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has drained most of the color out of the picture, and director Alfonso Cuaron has filmed the scenes with a great deal of immediacy and excitement. Cuaron certainly knows how to gin up the suspense and to make us feel like participants in the action.But the film is less successful at exploring the profound implications of its theme. James has come up with an unusually intriguing premise - just what would life be like if we knew our species was going to be extinct in less than a hundred years - but the film doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. Instead, the movie turns into a surprisingly conventional 'chase' movie, with characters running for their lives from hostile parties amid a ceaseless hail of explosions and bullets. Just why is it that dystopian dramas - from 'Fahrenheit 451' to 'Logan's Run' to 'The Island' to 'Minority Report' to 'The Imposter' to 'Paycheck,' to name just a handful - all feel the need to adhere to this tired narrative formula? Every so often, the film zeroes in on its theme, yielding, by far and away, its most effective moments: people sobbing uncontrollably as they watch a news story relating the sudden death of the world's youngest person; an art collector amassing many of the world's greatest sculptures and paintings even though he knows that in less that a hundred years there will be nobody left to appreciate them; a former midwife, sitting in an abandoned schoolroom, recounting with soul-wrenching sadness the day she realized children would no longer be gracing the world with their presence; combatants momentarily stopping their gunfire to stare awestricken at a newborn babe. We yearn for more of these psychologically astute and insightful moments, but, alas, this is not to be, as Cuaron and his team of writers pour on the action scenes pretty much at the expense of everything else.Owens, Michael Caine (in the annoyingly stereotypical role of an aging eccentric hippie) and Julianne Moore are the 'name' players in the cast, but the most powerful performances come from Claire-Hope Ashitey as the pregnant woman and Pam Ferris as the person assigned to be her midwife.'Children of Men' is a good film that could have been a great one were it not redolent of so many likeminded movies that have come before it.",7,3,9,27 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," beautifully realized drama
","The thing that strikes you the most while watching 'Million Dollar Baby' is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director. Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations. In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, an aging boxer-turned-trainer who has yet to hit the big time with any of his 'clients.' The gym he runs in a seedy part of Los Angeles seems more like a watering hole for outcasts and misfits than the launching pad for the next welter-, middle-, or heavyweight champion of the world. Then one day, into his gym, strides Maggie Fitzgerald, a wide-eyed girl from the Ozarks with dreams of making it big in the arena. Even though she has set her sights on Dunn as the man who will teach her, Dunn makes it clear to her that he has absolutely no interest in taking on 'a girl' for training purposes. But when he sees her determination and fiery spirit, he agrees - however reluctantly - to show her the ropes. The film is an account of the warm relationship that develops between this old man - who has long ago lost contact with his own estranged daughter, and sees in Maggie, if only subconsciously, a chance to make some kind of amends for his own sins - and this feisty, full-hearted girl from the hills.Even though 'Million Dollar Baby' has all the earmarks of a typical underdog sports movie, the film far transcends its genre through the excellence of both its screenplay and the performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, who, in the role of a former boxer himself and Dunn's closest friend, provides the voice of practicality and reason that permeates the film. His narration (as it did also in this summer's 'War of the Worlds' and 'March of the Penguins') lends the film the gravitas and classicism it needs to stand out from the crowd.Basing his screenplay on stories by Rope Burns, Paul Haggis has written dialogue that is astute, dramatic and authentic, far more literate than what we are accustomed to finding in most mainstream American movies. And, in his direction, Eastwood establishes just the right rhythm in the speech patterns to draw the audience into the center of the drama. Of course, Eastwood would never have been able to achieve this level of greatness without evoking strong performances from his assembled cast. As an actor, Eastwood himself has never been better than he is here. Gruff and cantankerous one moment, he is tender and warmhearted the next. Dunn has many deep-seated regrets about the past, but, even though his choices have rendered him virtually alone in the world, he still manages to remain both decent in his treatment of others and optimistic about the future. In her second Oscar-winning performance, Swank provides just the right mixture of naïve sweetness, openhearted frankness and unquenchable determination to bring Margaret to vivid life. And Freeman, as always, delivers a beautifully understated performance as the man of quiet perceptions whom Dunn has leaned on for guidance and advice for nigh unto thirty years. Together, this amazing ensemble molds what might have been a cliché-ridden tale into a work of art.Beautiful in its pacing and exquisite in its details, 'Million Dollar Baby' is, without question, Clint Eastwood's finest film to date.",9,7,10,9 September 2005
Garden State," scintillating indie comedy
","'Garden State' is anything but a garden variety romantic comedy. Brilliantly written and directed by Zack Braff (who also plays the lead role), this quirky indie triumph is one of the most delightful and disarming little films to come our way in a long long time.The ironically named Andrew Largeman is a bit like Holden Caulfield, but without all the articulation about his alienation and angst. In fact, for Andrew, the angst is buried so deep within his psyche that he is completely unable to verbalize what it is that is bothering him. All he knows is that he isn't happy with either his life or himself as a person. Andrew confesses that for most of his time here on earth all he has been able to feel is 'numb.' As the movie begins, we meet Andrew as a struggling actor living in Los Angeles, having fled his hometown in New Jersey years earlier. Virtually estranged from his parents, Andrew receives the shocking news that his paraplegic mother has died suddenly in a drowning 'accident,' thus precipitating Andrew's first trip home in ages. As with many literary and cinematic characters, Andrew learns a great deal about himself and about others by making that return trek back to the place of his roots.It's hard to convey in words just how charming and lovable an experience 'Garden State' turns out to be. It is a movie filled with originality, humor, warmth, poignancy and a sly comprehension about life and how best to live it. As Andrew reconnects with his childhood buddies, he learns that not much has changed in their lives either and that they are no closer to finding true happiness than he is. So even though fleeing the town may not have been the answer, staying there certainly wasn't the answer either - or at least so he believes until he meets an idiosyncratic young woman named Sam, delightfully played by Natalie Portman. The two hit it off almost instantly, finding common ground in their peculiarities and eccentricities. What's impressive about Braff's work here is that he never overdoes the quirkiness as so many other filmmakers do. He allows it to filter through his tale in such a way that we find ourselves laughing with the people rather than at them. The folks in this town may not be the smartest or most ambitious people we will ever meet, but somehow they have managed to make life work for them and have remained generally positive and upbeat in the process.Braff, looking a little like a young Ray Romano, perfectly captures the befuddlement, fear and almost crippling self-consciousness that lay at the root of Andrew's unhappiness, while at the same time conveying the good-naturedness and capacity for loving that provide him with the hope that, against all odds, he will someday achieve fulfillment. He and Portman make such an endearing romantic couple that we just know they will wind up making it in the end. In addition, there are strong supporting performances from Ian Holm, Peter Sarsgaard, Ron Leibman and a whole host of other talented performers.'Garden State' provides a subtle little homage to 'The Graduate' in its closing line - a fitting tribute from a film that captures the offbeat vision and youthful spirit of that earlier classic of anarchic cinema. But 'Garden State' is a visionary film in its own right as well.",9,0,1,2 April 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," strong on history and relevance, weak on drama
","Although set in the past - at the height of the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950's - 'Good Night, and Good Luck' has a great deal of relevance to the world of today. For in an era in which civil liberties are again under attack due to a perceived threat to national security, and political opponents are labeled as 'unpatriotic' and 'soft on terror' merely for disagreeing with the powers-that-be in the government, this film reminds us of just how precious and vital disagreement and dissent are to the health of a democracy. The modern-day parallels are never far from the mind of director and co-writer George Clooney as he tells the true-life story of famed CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow's courageous attacks on Senator Joseph McCarthy during the politically charged era known as the Red Scare.This film is reminiscent of 'All the President's Men' in its austerity and lack of narrative adornment. Filmed in period-appropriate black-and-white, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' spends virtually no time on exploring the personal lives of the characters, choosing instead to stay entirely focused on the drama at hand. This has both a positive and a negative effect on the film. On the plus side, the film doesn't become distracted by secondary issues or wander off into irrelevant narrative by-paths. Yet, the film has an almost hermetically sealed quality to it in that we rarely leave the highly insulated world of the CBS studios. As a result, the movie sometimes feels as it it's choking on its own lack of oxygen, not providing sufficient room for the characters themselves to breathe and grow. Morrow, the host of 'See it Now' whose signature sign-off becomes the basis for the film's title, delivers his pointed speeches and the men and women around him debate the issues of the day, but we really don't get to know any of them as people in the way we would like (compare it to a film such as 'Quiz Show' which did manage to bring a three-dimensional quality to its characters).What the film does do very well is to point out the hypocrisy at work in McCarthy's witch hunt tactics, for apparently he couldn't see - or perhaps chose not to see - that, in his squelching of dissent and his terrorizing of those with political views opposite to his own, he was aping the very Communists he claimed to be reviling, becoming an even greater threat to true American values than those he despised.The performances - particularly by David Straitharn as Morrow - are good, but the overall lack of characterization makes 'Good Night, and Good Luck' more interesting as a history lesson and an allegory for today than as a full-fledged drama.",7,2,4,12 February 2006
8 Mile," impressive acting debut
","Rapper Eminem makes a spectacular screen debut in `8 Mile,' a film designed to showcase the performer's talents as singer, songwriter and, now, actor.
In this semi-autobiographical tale, Eminem plays a young white rapper named Jimmy who is struggling to achieve respectability and recognition in an area dominated almost exclusively by black artists.   We've seen this story before in films ranging from `The Hustler' to `The Cincinnati Kid' to `Rocky':  the hotshot, talented newcomer attempts to make a name for himself in some specialized area (be it pool, poker, boxing or rapping) by challenging and defeating the highly respected and established reigning champ.  In terms of plotting, `8 Mile' offers little that is new or exciting, but what makes the movie work is the fine sense of detail and texture that writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson bring to the world they are showing us.  Set in 1995 Detroit, the film superbly captures the unmitigated bleakness of its urban setting:  from the burnt-out, abandoned buildings to the graffiti-covered walls to the dank, cavernous music clubs to the rundown trailer parks.  Jimmy is caught in a world that offers the poor working class stiff little opportunity for hopes and dreams beyond those he can make for himself - and Jimmy has found rap music to be the best chance for his ticket out.  Yet, Jimmy is no pie-in-the-sky idealist.  He knows that he can't afford to put all his eggs into one basket and so he remains levelheaded and pragmatic in his aspirations and goals. Beyond the obvious handicap of his skin color, Jimmy is also having to cope with a crumbling relationship, an alcoholic mother, her abusive boyfriend and some `concerned' parties who, despite what they may say, may not always have Jimmy's best interest at heart.Each of these characters has the potential to become nothing more than a hokey stereotype, but the acting and the writing keep most of it real most of the time.  Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, Britanny Murphy and several others all turn in fine performances in their roles, but it is Eminem himself who makes the film work.  Jimmy, despite all the frustration and rage smoldering under the surface, comes across as a decent guy who wants to make something of himself and to help those people who mean the most to him in the process. Eminem is a natural on the screen, and it will be interesting to see if he will be able to so successfully inhabit a character who is not so carefully tailored to fit his ready-made persona.  My suspicion is that he will, though only time - and his next few roles - will tell.
`8 Mile' affords a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that many of us have hitherto viewed only from the outside.  Especially intriguing are the `hip-hop battles,' wherein rappers come on stage and challenge one another to perform spontaneous mutual put-downs, with the audience getting to determine the contest's winner.  No matter what one may feel about rap music itself, one has to admire the talent involved in composing these rhyming verses extemporaneously.  The music may sometimes be execrable, but the love of language that pours forth out of the mouths of these young practitioners is actually quite encouraging and captivating (though one wishes that that talent would be channeled in a more positive direction at times).
An interesting side note:  at one point, Jimmy recites a rap defending a homosexual co-worker.  After all the bad blood that has gone down between Eminem and the gay community in the past, I wonder if this is the rapper's attempt to make peace and bury the hatchet.  If so, it is a gesture well worth making.",Null,1,1,29 March 2003
Shrek 2," another marvelous DreamWork creation
","'Shrek 2' is the delightful follow-up to the original 2001 blockbuster, which was a charming fractured fairy tale about a beautiful princess and a lime-green swamp ogre who fell in love and lived happily ever after. Or did they? As the second installment opens, all seems quiet on the domestic front as we find Shrek and Fiona living in wedded bliss deep inside an enchanted forest. One day an invitation arrives from Fiona's royal parents, inviting the two newlyweds to a banquet in honor of their nuptials. Over Shrek's strenuous objections, the couple journeys to the kingdom called 'Far, Far Away,' but when Fiona's father gets a gander at who his daughter has married - as well as the ogre-like transformation that has taken place in Fiona herself - the King decides it's time to take matters into his own hands and bring an end to this union.The marvel of the 'Shrek' movies is that they function on different levels for different audiences. Children enjoy them for their fast pace, elemental slapstick and bright, splashy backgrounds, while adults savor them for their sophisticated humor, sly parody, clever puns and playful anachronisms. As with the original, the pop culture references in 'Shrek 2' come fast and furious, but the film also has fun turning the conventions of the fairy tale form inside out. What's impressive about both 'Shrek' movies is that the filmmakers are willing to follow their instincts and imaginations wherever they lead them and, thus, the writers have the confidence to throw almost anything into the mix if it suits their purposes. As a result, the film feels continually fresh and inventive, constantly renewing itself as it goes along.There is excellent voice-over work by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett and Jennifer Saunders, all of whom take full measure of each of their respective characters. But it is Eddie Murphy, as the insecure wiseacre sidekick, Donkey, and Antonio Banderas, as a Musketeering cat known as Puss-in-Boots, who wind up stealing the show.Visually, 'Shrek 2' is nothing short of a masterpiece, a seamless blending of otherworldly fairy tale backdrops with contemporary urban images. It's hard to imagine how much further animation can go in creating worlds that are both surreal and strikingly believable at the same time.'Shrek 2' is a rare treat for old and young alike.",9,2,4,6 April 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," cool, stylish, empty
","Quentin Tarentino's 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' is the perfect film for today's 'trendy chic' movie going audience. Casual in its violence, flashy in its visuals, and conspicuously lacking in content and theme, the film is a genuine triumph of style over substance and a testament to the art of 'cool.' Here is a film so self-consciously arch and emotionally detached that it plays more like a live action cartoon than a drama set in anything remotely resembling the real world (in fact, one section of the movie literally is a cartoon). The 'plot' is, essentially, one long drawn out revenge scene with Uma Thurmon as a young woman systematically seeking out and killing a band of assassins who left her, her unborn child, and her entire bridal party for dead on the day of her wedding. Yet, what person in his right mind goes to a Tarentino film in search of a meaningful storyline? Indeed, the thing that counts in a Tarentino work is the director's obvious love for both movies and movie-making, a love which is visible in every frame he commits to film. 'Kill Bill' is Tarentino's affectionate homage to the martial arts epics in which characters defy the laws of physics and gravity as they perform their deadly kabuki-type ballet with knives and swords. In this pastiche of ninja melodrama and Japanese anime, at least half the film's running time is spent on elaborately staged swordfights and kickboxing sequences, all of which are filmed with the utmost brio and verve. The violence is, indeed, gory and graphic - with dismemberments galore and fountains of spurting blood - but so preposterously overblown that the violence eventually becomes abstract and thus doesn't offend us much while we're watching it. Thurmon doesn't have much of a chance to develop a character here, but the steel-eyed intensity combined with the strange sense of vulnerability that she brings to the role makes her fascination to watch nonetheless.Yet, for all its cinematic joie de vivre and visual inventiveness, there's something a bit unsatisfying about 'Kill Bill Volume 1' after all is said and done. Perhaps it's the fact that the film feels so much like a clinical exercise in style that it lacks the power to really draw us into its world. We watch it with an air more of detached bemusement than of emotional involvement. Perhaps, too, the absence of anything much going on beneath the surface leaves us with little of substance to take home with us once we've left the theater. I suspect that this is the very effect Tarentino is going for here - that if we were made to care deeply about anything that was happening on the screen we would somehow be violating his code of 'coolness,' that we would be simply reacting to movies with the kind of programmed emotional responses the director is clearly militating against. The problem is that, while we can appreciate all that on an intellectual level, we are still left feeling relatively empty and unfulfilled by movie's end. Perhaps, the completion of the story in Volume 2 will help to rectify that condition.",Null,7,14,5 December 2004
Clash of the Titans," less personality, more action
","The original version of 'Clash of the Titans' was an infinitely entertaining - and still fondly remembered - piece of early '80s kitsch comprised of one part corn to two parts cheese. It was further distinguished by having a number of acting legends of both stage and screen (i.e., Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith) slumming their way through the project - and obviously having the time of their professional lives doing so.The 2010 version, directed by Louis Leterrier, trades in star power and campiness for improved special effects and a more straightforward action-movie approach to the material (though Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes do appear as Zeus and Hades, respectively).Sam Worthington stars as Persius, the demi-god son of Zeus, who leads the humans in a war against the gods, whom he blames for the deaths of his adoptive parents and little sister. Persius also must face-down and defeat the mighty Kracken, a terrifying, indestructible beast that serves as the gods' ultimate weapon against the people.It's all very Saturday-matinée juvenilia in spirit and tone, but the pacing is swift, the special effects impressive, and the various and sundry monsters and creatures sufficiently imaginative and larger-than-life to make us suspend our disbelief, if only for the duration.Good fun.",6,0,1,5 July 2011
Jurassic World," Basically a technically accomplished rehash of the original film
","The characters in 'Jurassic World' - which should be titled 'Will Humans Never Learn?' - keep telling one another that the paying public needs ever more elaborate sensations to keep them coming back for more. Yet, it's hard at times to tell whether they're talking about the audiences at the park or the audiences for the movie.This little bit of self-reflective self-awareness on the part of the filmmakers is one of the few interesting things about this fourth entry in a tetralogy that began with the groundbreaking 'Jurassic Park' in 1993. The problem is that it's hard to break ground more than once in the same soil, and 'Jurassic World' finds no real way to bring anything new to the project.The movie just keeps playing different variations on the same theme. Thus, instead of 'mere' (and, now, apparently passé) full-sized dinosaurs being regenerated out of ancient samples of preserved DNA, we've graduated to 'super dinosaurs' being genetically-engineered out of a mixture of all sorts of dino types. All this gene- and species-tampering is taking place at a decade-old amusement park, an improvement, we are told, over the ill-fated one that never quite got off the ground in the 1990s. But humans are humans and playing God, especially for sensation and profit, never ends very well in these sorts of scenarios, so we're primed to buckle our seats and hang on for the ride. We aren't disappointed.Once we get past that one slight deviation, the plot of 'Jurassic World' pretty much replicates the 1993 original, right down to the 'unlikely' (though, actually, quite predictable) system malfunction and two lost and imperiled kids having to be saved from becoming Dino-food by an intrepid adult at the park (Chris Pratt plays the role of trainer and dinosaur- whisperer here). In fact, virtually every scene in 'Jurassic World' has a corresponding counterpart in 'Jurassic Park,' only what was once innovative and fresh has now become derivative and stale (apparently, none of the characters here ever seen the original 'Jurassic Park' or they wouldn't keep making the exact same mistakes as the previous group).Pratt has an easygoing, good-ole-boy charm that serves him well in his role as makeshift hero, but Bryce Dallas Howard is given the thankless task of playing a rather insultingly sexist caricature as the manager of the park who's in way over her head when it comes to running the joint, not to mention coping with a crisis of this magnitude (think Kate Capshaw in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom') and is, thus, in constant need of rescuing by the stalwart Pratt.Under the directorial aegis of Colin Trevorrow, the action scenes and special effects are predictably eye-popping and state-of-the-art - helping to generate the 'wow factor' one minimally expects from this series - but the overall air of deja vu that permeates the film keeps this latest dino-blockbuster from being much more than an afterthought in the Jurassic universe.",6,6,10,2 June 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," dull, clumsy remake
","Tim Burton, normally one of the most innovative and inspired of modern American filmmakers, comes a cropper with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' a cold and crass adaptation of the beloved children's story by Roald Dahl. This is actually the second filming of the work, the first being the charming and delightful 1971 film renamed 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' to give Gene Wilder the title role.In this remake, Johnny Depp takes on the part of the famed chocolate manufacturer who decides to open up his factory to the first five children who find a gold ticket in one of his bars. Charlie is the sweet-tempered young boy who is the fifth to do so, and, thus, gets to take the tour along with four other obnoxious brats who have none of the purity of spirit he does.'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' fails to make us care about either the situation or the characters. Depp plays Wonka like a bizarre cross between Michael Jackson and Carol Burnett, and Burton, even with all his attention to detail in the sets and special effects, is unable to distract is from the fact that not a whole lot is really going on in the film. The early scenes, involving Charlie's eccentric relatives and their attempts to secure the ticket for him, have a warm, familial feel to them, but once the tour itself begins, we become as imprisoned in the claustrophobic setting as the characters themselves.Locked in a tedious monotony, the plot essentially consists of Wonka, the children, and their respective parents moving from room to room where each of the four brats meets up with his or her well-deserved comeuppance in the form of a bizarre factory accident, until only sweet little Charlie is left. Interspersed throughout are a series of inane song-and-dance sequences a la Busby Berkeley and uninteresting and undramatic flashbacks to Wonka's deprived and unhappy childhood that are somehow supposed to explain why he has become the creepy character we find at the center of the story.The art direction and set decoration are fine but not impressive enough to make us overlook the dullness and unpleasantness of so much of the film. Mr. Burton may need to go back to making the kind of small, quirky films that he cut his directorial teeth on and leave these empty, bloated big screen extravaganzas to others.",4,1,4,2 May 2006
Mission: Impossible II," tedious action film
","John Woo's `Mission: Impossible 2' represents much that is wrong with commercial moviemaking today.  Though proficient on the levels of technical expertise, visual design and state-of-the-art special effects, the film emerges as little more than a multimillion dollar exercise in cold efficiency, devoid of humor, suspense and, above all, heart.  Thus, while countless superior films - films that attempt to make some connection with the reality of the human condition - languish at the box office, `Mission: Impossible 2' and other films if its ilk play to packed movie houses.  Do people really enjoy this film, or are they just suckered into believing that any film that is sold as an `event' picture - particularly one that stars the ubiquitous Tom Cruise - must by its nature be worth the price of admission?`Mission: Impossible 2' features an opening credit sequence that proves that just because something `can' be done doesn't necessarily mean that it `should' be done - a warning filmmakers should heed now that, with computer graphics, virtually every situation imaginable has become possible to visualize convincingly.  We are reintroduced to Cruise's spy character as he is climbing up the face of a sheer cliff sans ropes or cables.  Although the shot looks absolutely convincing from a technical standpoint, we simply cannot believe that anyone in his right mind would be doing what he is doing - or even if those actions are themselves within the realm of physical possibility.  From its opening note then, `MI 2' informs us that it is not concerned in any way with making everything we see believable and involving. As a result, we tune out, detaching ourselves from the events on the screen, becoming disinterested bystanders of a trite espionage scenario that, for all its visual finesse, is strangely lacking in creativity and passion.The first `Mission: Impossible' film, made in 1996, may have been a monument to incoherence, but at least it half redeemed itself by offering two spectacular and unforgettable action set pieces - Cruise's dangling marionette act and a mano-a-mano fight atop a roaring, supersonic train. The sequel offers no such action scene equivalents.  The car chase early in the film between Cruise and the sexy thief he is pursuing is a yawn-inducing bore compared to the ones in the exciting `Ronin' from a few years back. The shootouts are equally undistinguished, far below par for a Woo film.
Like many films that rely so heavily on special effects and action sequences, `MI 2' never exerts the slightest effort to flesh out its many characters.  One would expect that a writer with the talent and track record of Robert Towne (he wrote `Chinatown' for heavens sake) would at least be able to provide some character dimension even within the tight confines of the action genre.  Unfortunately, all the characters emerge as cardboard cutout figures, substituting coolness and slickness for personality and depth.  Cruise and Thandie Newton generate zero chemistry in the romance department, and John Polson seems woefully inadequate as the film's main villain.If you must check `MI2' out, by all means do.  Just know that there are a lot more interesting, much less heralded films out there more worthy of your time and attention.",Null,0,1,23 December 2000
Black Snake Moan," not at all what you might expect
","The plot is like something out of one of those decadent-Southern melodramas by William Faulkner or Tennessee Williams: A morally righteous, blues-playing cuckold finds a scantily clad nymphomaniac beaten to a bloody pulp and left for dead on the side of the road. He carries the initially unconscious woman to his shack where he proceeds to nurse her back to physical and spiritual health. Oh, and, by the way, did I mention that she's chained to a radiator a good deal of the time? Based on the overheated premise and imagery alone, 'Black Snake Moan' could easily have been either a sadomasochistic horror film or a kinky sex fantasy (or a twisted combination of both). Instead, writer/director Craig Brewer clearly sees this material as a return to the great Southern Gothic tradition of the literary past, replete with hints of potential madness, elaborate sexual perversion, and an undercurrent of racial tension to go along with all the heat and humidity.It is difficult to pigeonhole 'Black Snake Moan,' for it is neither a parody of an exploitation film nor an exploitation film itself. Very little of it is actually played for laughs, and that, I think, is what makes the movie successful in the long run. It attacks the material with such a knowing earnestness that we are swept up into the drama despite being supremely conscious at all times of just how preposterous the whole thing is.As a thoughtful artist, Brewer uses his disturbing imagery to plumb the turbid depths of his audience's subconscious. The sight of a young woman helplessly chained to a radiator, for instance, inevitably conjures up images of slavery, rape, sexual and racial dominance, etc. in the viewer's mind (the irony, of course, is that, in this case, it is the black man who has the white person in chains). Yet, once we strip away all the aberrant imagery from the story, what we're ultimately left with is a simple tale of two bruised and potentially self-destructive individuals reaching out to one another in ways that the society around them and even they themselves can't quite understand. The relationship between the farmer, Lazarus, and the nympho, Rae, is a richly detailed and complex one, for despite his distasteful approach, Lazarus is, in reality, a compassionate man reaching out to a stranger in need to show her that there is a better, more spiritually fulfilling way for people to live. Through their superb performances, Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci (who has lost much of her baby-fat and moon-face and become very sexy indeed) turn what could have been two 'decadent Southern' caricatures into fully-rounded human beings. There are also very fine performances by Justin Timberlake, John Cothran Jr., and S. Epatha Merkerson in support of the two leads.Brewer has paced his film just right, giving the two characters time to develop their relationship amidst the more sensationalistic plot elements floating around them. He also makes the sweltering Deep South setting an integral part of the drama.Don't let the more unsavory aspects of the imagery and the plotting scare you off this movie. 'Black Snake Moan' is really an inspiring and moving story about how spiritual redemption and emotional healing come through simple acts of human kindness.",8,2,5,5 August 2007
Black Hawk Down," great battle scenes; wafer-thin characters
","In October 1993, Americans watching their TV sets at home were shocked to see the bodies of a handful of American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia.  What had begun as an effort to bring humanitarian relief to that war-torn country almost a year earlier had somehow turned into a political quagmire out of which it was becoming more and more difficult for the U.S. forces to extricate themselves.  `Black Hawk Down' is Ridley Scott's nightmarish vision of that fateful day when the mission turned suddenly and hopelessly wrong.  Based on the novel by Mark Bowden, `Black Hawk Down' is a technically astonishing look into the savagery and horror of modern day warfare.  Rarely have the resources of filmmaking been used so effectively in conveying the intensity and brutality of life in a combat zone.  It's small wonder that the film received Academy Awards for its extraordinary editing and sound. Using every technical trick at his disposal, Scott has managed to plunge us right into the heart of the action, making us feel every explosion and hear every bullet as it goes whizzing past.  Like the characters, we often find ourselves disoriented by the confusion of the scene, yet Scott also manages to keep the action geographically coherent most of the time.  This he does by providing aerial views of the scene that let us know where the men are in relation to their surroundings.What Scott is not able to do quite so well is to keep the characters themselves sufficiently differentiated to make them matter as much to the viewer as they probably should.  We tend to lose the men in the mass of confusion, with each character looking pretty much like the next and being afforded very little opportunity to step to the forefront of  this massive canvas and distinguish himself.  In all fairness to the filmmakers here, one should note that this seems to be a trait peculiarly endemic to war films in general (the fact that combatants are all dressed alike doesn't help this situation much either).  In the last decade or so, special effects artists have come so far in being able to recreate the graphic realism of the battlefield setting that writers no longer feel the need to provide much in the way of characterization to go along with the action scenes.  More and more the fight sequences are being asked to carry these pictures alone. This was the case with the recent `We Were Soldiers' and it is the case here as well.  Perhaps because of the nature of the true-life events being depicted here, Scott felt no need to ease up on the accelerator much in getting his story told.  However, we do feel as if it would be nice to be able to distinguish his characters from one another and to get to know them a bit on a personal level.  In a way, one appreciates the fact that the filmmakers have chosen to feature less well known actors in most of the roles.  That heightens the realism factor since we don't feel as if we are watching movie stars playing the part of common soldiers.  In that respect, the anonymity works well.  Yet, I wonder if using familiar faces might not have helped a bit in allowing us to focus better on the characters as individuals, permitting us to catch our bearings a little more frequently so that we might be better able to distinguish who is who at all times.
This is not to say that `Black Hawk Down' does not provide a number of emotionally stirring moments throughout, particularly as we see the young men dying heroic deaths.   Even given the minimal dialogue and character development, we do come to understand the sense of camaraderie that drives these brave men to do what they do.As a result of this imbalance between the dazzling special effects and the wafer-thin characters, `Black Hawk Down' is a great technical triumph but a less-than-great (though still damn good) film overall.",Null,11,16,20 July 2002
The Hangover Part II," Dreadful rehash of the original
","There's barely a laugh to be had in 'The Hangover - Part 2,' a dreadful sequel to the original box office smash from 2009.This time the boys - and I do mean 'boys' - are trapped in Thailand, where they've gone to celebrate Stu's nuptials and where they immediately fall into a series of misadventures after a riotous night of bachelor party celebration in Bangkok, all of which has been mysteriously erased from their collective memory.I wish I could say that, from all this, hilarity ensues. But I would be lying. As with most big-budget studio comedies these days, the tone and the performances are pitched so over-the-top that the audience winds up feeling assaulted rather than entertained long before the closing credits come rolling by. To that end, the screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin and director Todd Phillips is filled with wheezy plot mechanics, overwrought action sequences, mind-numbing slapstick, and jokes that fall consistently flat.The buddies are once again played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis and a much under-used Justin Bartha (who may have been the only one career-conscious and savvy enough to ask to be left out of most of the proceedings), while Paul Giamatti and Ken Jeong - who is much funnier on TV's 'Community' - have been added to the cast.By any standard but the most crassly commercial - the movie garnered an impressive quarter of a billion dollars in domestic box office receipts - 'The Hangover - Part2' is a colossal bomb.",3,2,4,2 April 2012
For Love of the Game," utterly tedious romance film
","Getting ready to watch a Kevin Costner movie is like preparing for a siege: one needs to stock up on a hefty assortment of supplies because, if there is one thing we can be sure of, it's that we are in for a very long haul. Actually, as Costner movies go, this 138-minute film is relatively short - though its glacial pacing makes it seem eternal anyway.  For sheer, unadulterated tedium, this movie is, at the very least, a match for Costner's previous romantic opus, 'Message in a Bottle.'Directed by Sam Raimi, 'For Love of the Game' seems like a film caught in a movie genre limbo.  Half reverential baseball movie and half sappy romance, it seems catered to satisfy two widely disparate audiences that wouldn't be caught dead standing in the same line at the local cineplex.  Perhaps, this is a pitch to come up with the perfect date movie (though 'Titanic' beat them to it - romance for the ladies, sinking ship and mass death for the boys).Costner, in another of his near-catatonic performances, portrays Billy Chapel, a 40-year old, soon to be over-the-hill pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who, in a single day, learns that his team has been sold, he is about to be traded to the Giants and his girlfriend of five years is leaving right that very moment to start a new career in London.  This set-up might have resulted in an incisive study of a man caught in an age-limited career learning to cope with the inevitable trauma of saying farewell and moving on.  Instead, the writers settle for a stale movie romance, with Chapel standing on the mound, pitching his final game and flashing back like mad to the happier days of ballfield triumphs and blossoming true love.  The film is ostensibly concerned with Chapel's success on the diamond but he soon learns that even pitching a historical no-hitter and being carried around in triumph on the shoulders of adoring team members and diehard admirers is mere ashes without that one true love to share it with.  The screenplay, in fact, is so heavily weighted in the direction of the affair he is having with Jane (Kelly Preston) that baseball fans are sure to feel slighted - until the very end.Even in the ballpark, though, the film is a failure.  Why do so many movies, including this one, treat baseball as some sort of holy rite, some sacred mission replete with corny imagery, nauseating pep talks and cliched, slow motion views of tear-soaked faces amid the euphoric masses?  The detrimental effect of 'Field of Dreams' cannot be overestimated.  Just once couldn't we see a film that treats the sport for what it is - a fun pastime, completely devoid of sentimentality?  I will say one thing for this movie though:  in comparison to itself, it does make baseball look like a fastpaced sport!",Null,1,3,8 April 2000
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Action done right
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' raises the age-old question of just how much freedom we should be willing to sacrifice in order to ensure a lasting peace. And, as a corollary, how much power should humans be willing to cede to technology, particularly in the form of artificial intelligence, to achieve that goal? It's a theme that more than a few works of science fiction have dealt with over the years.In this sequel to the box office smash of 2012, Ray Stark, aka Iron Man, has invented a program called Ultron whose purpose is to eliminate the need for war and global conflict altogether. To no one's surprise but Stark's, when the program is prematurely activated, it turns out to have less than noble intentions as it sets about creating a race of cyborg warriors to completely eradicate humans from the face of the planet and to repopulate it with others like himself.Only the Avengers (embodied by Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Don Cheadle, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Remmer, et. al.) can save the day. And save it they do, amidst supercharged action sequences and jaw-dropping special effects. Stark certainly means well as he sets about essentially eliminating the need for the Avengers at all, but we in the audience know this is a fool's errand from the start for, if successful, there would be no more entries in this highly lucrative franchise. And we certainly couldn't have that, now, could we?",7,0,5,19 March 2016
Big Fish," uneven but ultimately moving
","`Big Fish' is the latest bit of calculated whimsy from famed director Tim Burton.  With a screenplay by John August based on the Daniel Wallace novel, Burton tells the tale of Edward Bloom, a man whose whole life has been one `big fish story' after another.  Now old and facing death, Bloom needs to come up with a rousing finale to cap off his largely fictionalized life. Bloom's son, William, a realist and pragmatist, bitterly resents the `lies' his father has been feeding him ever since he was a boy, and yearns, in these last moments together, to hear the `true' story of the old man's life. But, in his investigation into the veracity of all the tall tales he's been told, William discovers that there may be more truth to these myths and legends than he has ever allowed himself to believe.  He also realizes that, in debunking all the whoppers, he will be depriving his father of the one real trait that defines him as a person and that distinguishes him from everybody else.The title of the film actually functions on two symbolic levels simultaneously.  On the one hand, it reflects the fictionalized nature of Bloom's life and the grandiose egotism of his character.  On the other, Bloom is, himself, the `big fish' in a small pond, as he leaves his mark on the world around him.  `Big Fish' is actually most effective in the scenes set in the present, as father and son come to terms with the quality that each dislikes most about the other.  William feels deceived by a father who, despite the fact that he made himself appear to be a larger-than-life heroic figure, was actually just a mediocre, often-absent dad, too busy with his secret `fantasy' life to make time for his own lonely son (the story has strong echoes of `Death of a Salesman' in its underlying vision and theme). Bloom, in a similar way, finds his son lacking in the kind of large-scale imagination that Bloom feels makes life worth living.The film is considerably less successful in the `flashback' scenes tracing Bloom's life from his own birth to his son's early childhood.  The scenes are all elaborately staged in the best Tim Burton manner  filled with hauntingly mythical settings, surrealistic events and doses of Magic Realism - but the filmmakers can't overcome the unfortunate fact that these sequences are essentially as uninteresting and irritating as real `fish stories' tend to be.  Bloom's `adventures' come across as dime-novel vignettes, which is supposed to be the point, I guess, but it still means that we are squirming with impatience through large  indeed very large  stretches of the film.  Every time we come back to the present  to real, flesh-and-blood human beings  our interest picks back up.  That's why the film, in its latter stages, becomes such a moving and profound experience, as we finally get to see and know the real man who is Edward Bloom, wrinkles, warts and all.Burton has assembled a wonderful cast for the occasion.  The marvelous Albert Finney plays the dying Bloom and invests the film with an emotional depth just by his mere presence in the role.  Ewan MacGregor does a fine job as the young, idealistic Bloom, while Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman enact the parts of Bloom's wife present and past (MacGregor and Lohman look as if they could truly grow up to be Finney and Lange).  Billy Crudup brings a subtle depth to the role of William and the scenes between him and Finney truly touch the heart.  Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny De Vito round out the impressive cast.Maybe it says more about me than it does about the film that I ended up liking the parts that were the LEAST Burton-esque the best.  But, then again, this is from someone who thinks that the comparatively earthbound `Ed Wood' is Burton's best film.",Null,0,0,15 May 2004
The Insider," solid docudrama
","Corporate whistle blowing makes for ideal storytelling material, coming fully equipped, as it does,  with many of the raw elements of great drama. For who can resist the spectacle of an Everyman underdog, driven by a courageous sense of personal righteousness and love of humanity, laying his integrity, his livelihood, often even his life itself on the line in the pursuit of truth and justice?Based on real life events, in which '60 Minutes' compromised its journalistic integrity by buckling under to pressure from the tobacco industry not to run an interview with a whistle blower,  Michael Mann's 'The Insider' provides a solid, often gripping and always interesting drama that works on several levels simultaneously: as an expose of the shocking moral turpitude occurring at the upper levels of many of our nation's corporate structures, as a view of the life-and-death power struggle that takes place in a legal system awash in corruption and mind-boggling complexity, and as an incisive examination of two men's epic struggle with morality and ethics and the exigencies of doing the right thing in a world where doing the wrong is often both easier and more handsomely rewarded.Russell Crowe stars as former tobacco executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, who, upon being fired for no accountable reason by his company, agrees to tape an interview for '60 Minutes' on which he plans to expose the tobacco industry's secret practice of enhancing the nicotine-based addiction levels in cigarettes.  Al Pacino plays '60 Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman, who befriends Wigand and talks him into granting the interview.  As `60 Minutes' itself succumbs to the pressure of the corporate entity, the film becomes, essentially, a study of TWO whistle blowers, for Bergman, every bit as much as Wigand, must question his commitment to the company he has so long served and admired.  While the two cope with their ever increasing moral dilemmas, the real life drama plays itself out, as Mann casts a scathing eye on corporate malevolence, judicial malfeasance, and, above all, journalistic timidity and compromise.  Admirably, Mann never takes his focus off the human drama at the core and he is assisted in that by the first rate performances of his two lead actors.  It is no wonder that Mike Wallace has denounced the film in no uncertain terms as a libel and a fraud if there is indeed any truth to be found in his depiction herein.  Embodied by an unctuous Christopher Plummer, the character hardly qualifies as a pillar of moral courage and rectitude.  One of the frustrations in this type of film, anchored in such recent real life events involving contemporary figures of some public standing, is that we, in the audience are not privy to all the facts as they originally played out, and with the proviso offered that not all the events depicted in the film are true blue and factual, we don't always know just what to believe and what not to believe.In style, Mann employs heavy use of the handheld camera, which effectively creates a sense of journalistic immediacy and truth.   One glaring technical error does, however, stand out.  At one point, while two men are carrying on a telephone conversation, one in Kentucky and one in Mississippi, we can see clearly that, in one shot it is nightfall and in the other bright day. Unless one of those two states drastically changed time zones, someone in Mr. Mann's film crew obviously fell asleep at the switch.Although the film cannot always shake off the sense of déjà vu created by its similarity to a number of whistle blower dramas from the past ('Silkwood,' 'The China Syndrome' etc.), its no-pseudonyms-please topicality gives 'The Insider' a power all its own.",Null,0,1,30 April 2000
The Dark Knight," A Towering Achievement
","Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' reminds us that even a product of mass-market pop-culture can, if done correctly, be a work of art. This thrilling, densely plotted and beautifully crafted sequel to 2005's 'Batman Begins' is, quite possibly, the finest comic book superhero movie ever made. In addition, it boasts, in the performance of Heath Ledger, one of the definitive screen villains of all time.As the movie begins, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) - with the unofficial aid of the 'vigilante crime fighter' known as Batman (Christian Bale) - is getting ready to indict most of Gotham City's most notorious criminals and gangsters on racketeering and money-laundering charges. The fly in the ointment is the psychotic, face-painted super villain, self identified as The Joker, who's joined forces with the seedy criminal elements of the city to bring both Batman and the terrorized inhabitants to their knees. Meanwhile, billionaire Bruce Wayne is trying to find a way to render his Batman alter ego unnecessary by finding an incorruptible civic leader who will be able to rid the city of its criminal elements through wholly legal means and, thus, become the heroic figure for the city that Batman himself can never be. He alights on Dent as the man for that job.As writers, the Nolan brothers, Jonathan and Christopher, have created a work that is so dark and despairing in its probing of the evil that infests our world that it makes the 1989 Tim Burton version look like an episode from the campy TV series in comparison. The forces of good in this movie are entirely at the mercy of the forces of evil, so terrifyingly embodied in the Joker figure. With his face painted into a ghoulish grin, Ledger's Joker strikes terror not merely into the characters in the movie but the audience as well. Not since Anthony Hopkins did his turn as Hannibal Lecter (a character Ledger himself cited as a primary source of inspiration for this role) has one actor imparted such a quality of dread and menace to the character he was playing. It is, indeed, a tribute to Ledger's greatness as an actor that, even after all the myriad screen villains we have encountered over the years, he has the power to makes us cringe every time he appears on screen. Indeed, so convincing is Ledger in the part that we sometimes wonder if even Batman himself will have what it takes to defeat him (and isn't that the measure of a truly effective bad guy?). For this Joker's true strategic advantage lies not in all the weapons of destruction he has at his disposal, but, rather, in his astute understanding of human psychology, particularly in his knowledge of how to make terror and fear work to get him what he wants. His delight in mind games, his devotion to torture, and his love of violence for its own sweet sake make him a figure fit to haunt one's dreams.There are other fine performances as well in the movie, including Eckhart as the honest D.A., Maggie Gyllenhaal as Bruce's former (and the D.A.'s current) flame, Gary Oldman as the ever reliable Lieutenant Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Wayne Industries' most erstwhile employee, and Michael Caine as Wayne's devoted and down-to-earth butler. It's inevitable, perhaps, that Bale, as the good guy of the piece, would fall under the shadow of Ledger's towering achievement, but he provides the strength and solidity the picture needs to keep it from going out of whack.Using what would appear to be a minimum of CGI effects, Nolan has mounted his film with a fine eye for detail and a great deal of jaw-dropping visual artistry. The cityscapes alone are enough to take the audience's breath away. Moreover, the screenplay weaves seamlessly between full-throttle, pull-out-all-the-stops action sequences and intense, highly intimate exchanges between characters.Like all movies that run a little longer than they should, 'The Dark Knight' does hit a point of diminishing turns long about its last half hour, as the story loses its way a bit and the thematic point-making threatens to run it into the ground. Heck, even Ledger's performance loses some of its edge towards the end, as the novelty begins to wear off due to overexposure (he is probably in one or two scenes too many in the final analysis).Still, these are minor quibbles about a movie and a performance that will go down as classics in their respective categories.",9,7,15,18 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," series showing signs of age
","In 'The Order of the Phoenix, ' the time-marking fifth installment of the lucrative 'Harry Potter' series, the teen wizard and his fellow Hogwarts sidekicks are girding for battle against the recently returned villain, Lord Valdemort. They also have to wage a battle on a second front, against a sadistic dictatorial teacher named Dolores Umbridge, who has decided to remedy the 'lax' standards at the academy and, in doing so, usurp Professor Dumbledor's position as headmaster of the school.'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' has most of what any installment in the series needs to be a success: strong performances, dazzling special effects, and generous helpings of spells and magic. Yet, there seems to be something missing in this episode that prevents it from soaring into that world of enchantment familiar to us from those earlier films. For one thing, too many of the likable secondary characters - Ronald, Hermione, Hagrid etc. - take a back seat to Umbridge, who gets way more time on screen than the interest generated by the character warrants (even though Imelda Staunton is just fine in the role). Or perhaps it's that the movie lacks the tremendously exciting action set pieces that distinguished some of the earlier editions. And why, come to think of it, does the cinematography in a fantasy film have to be so drab, colorless and dreary? It's admirable that both the filmmakers and the original author are willing to go darker and deeper in exploring the psyche of Harry now that he's become quite a bit older, but depth of theme really doesn't matter all that much if the magic of the series itself gets lost in the process (Michael Goldenberg has replaced Steve Kloves in the writing department and David Yates has taken over as director).Daniel Radcliffe still makes for a tremendously appealing hero, but one senses that the perhaps inevitable fatigue factor may finally be settling into this series. I guess we'll know for sure once the final two installments are released.",5,2,5,18 July 2007
Into the Wild," What is Man's place in Nature?
","Who among us hasn't, at one time or another, dreamed of one day chucking the whole 'corporate rat race/adult responsibility' thing and moving to an isolated cabin in the woods where we would be free to get in touch with our inner selves and become one with nature? Yet, even though many of us have fantasized about doing such a thing, few of us have had the intestinal fortitude or psychological wherewithal to actually go out and do it. Well, Christopher McCandless actually DID go out and do it - though with sadly tragic results for both the young man and those dearest to him.At the age of 22, McCandless could have had the life of privilege, comfort and financial success natural to one who had just graduated with honors from a prestigious institution like Emory University (especially one with wealthy parents). Instead, he chose a different path for himself, one that would reject the materialistic values of the world around him and send him on a journey of self-discovery which, despite the best of intentions, would prove fatal to him in the long run. Over a two-year period, from 1990 to 1992, Chris traveled all across North America - on foot, by kayak, by bumming rides off strangers - finally ending up in the wilderness of Alaska where he was to meet his tragic fate. Along the way, he encountered numerous colorful characters who made a mark on his heart. This adventure was popularized in the best-selling book 'Into the Wild' by Jon Krakauer, who reconstructed McCandless' experiences largely from notes and journal entries left behind by the young man and through interviews with certain key players in the drama.For the movie version, writer/director Sean Penn has made Chris' devoted sister, Carine, the narrator and chief commentator on the action. It is through her reflections that we come to understand some of the reasoning behind Chris' remarkable willingness to forego all the creature comforts of the modern world that the rest of us seem to cling to so tenaciously. As with any tale of a picaresque nature, 'Into the Wild' is more a series of vignettes than a fully fleshed-out drama, and, thus, it has an occasional tendency to ramble and wander aimlessly. Yet, its narrative looseness is clearly a large part of the story's charm. Moreover, Penn keeps it tightly knit together through the narration, the use of flashbacks, the scenes involving Chris' parents, and the mesmerizing fluidity of the camera-work. And, naturally, the evocative, richly variegated landscapes against which the story unfolds play a crucial role in the overall richness of the film.Some have charged the movie with romanticizing and glorifying an individual who was arguably sociopathic and whose actions and decisions ultimately led to his own death. Yet, while Penn clearly wants us to identify with Chris' sense of idealism and carpe diem spirit, the filmmaker also acknowledges that there are some serious psychological issues at play here, mostly brought on by the young man's being raised by two obviously dysfunctional parents. Yet, the movie is also about how important it is for us to forgive those who have wronged us and to not allow bitterness to determine the course of our lives.With his boyish looks and unprepossessing manner, Emile Hirsch embodies the devil-may-care spirit of what is, essentially, a 20th Century version of Henry David Thoreau. In relatively small but crucial roles, William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden leave an indelible mark as Chris's parents. The many individuals he meets along the way are embodied by Brian H. Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, and, most memorably, Hal Holbrook, heartbreaking in his Oscar-nominated performance as an old desert-dweller who offers to adopt Chris as his son.In the end, 'Into the Wild' can be read as much as a cautionary tale as one championing the cause of unbridled individuality. Like 'Grizzly Man,' it shows how an obsession with nature and an unrealistic disdain for civilization can lead to disastrous consequences for individuals unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of the natural world. If anything, both films serve as a call for reasonableness and balance in determining mankind's proper place in the overall scheme of things.",8,3,7,17 May 2008
"Girl, Interrupted"," flawed but rewarding film
","The formula for `Girl, Interrupted' is to take the basic setting and plot situation of `One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,' strip them of their high-falutin' melodramatic elements and present a somewhat more realistic image of insanity hidden behind the walls of a mental institution.  The risk in such a move is that the film will, also, strip away much of the drama as well.  `Girl, Interrupted' takes the risk and, perhaps predictably, is not a completely satisfying effort as a result.  Long stretches of the film turn into drawn out gabfests in which the girls housed in this Massachusetts institution talk out their issues at frequently excessive length. However, thanks to strong performances by an impressive cast of highly talented young actresses, as well as a script filled with occasionally sharp insights into the complexities of mental illness, the film ultimately yields a moving and rewarding cinematic experience for those with the patience to see it through to the end.The film is based on the true-life story of Susanna Kaysen, a young woman who, like many young people in the turbulent 1960's, felt disoriented in the face of great social upheaval and the redefining of traditional roles and came to question her own place in society as a result.  For a fumbled attempt at suicide, Susanna was ultimately consigned to a yearlong stay at a New England psychiatric hospital.  It is her experiences there - and the relationships she forged with other women in her ward - that form the backbone of the film.Several elements serve to undercut some of the credibility of the film. As overseen by an ever-sympathetic head nurse (Whoopi Goldberg), this ward seems woefully lax in its standards of both discipline and security.  The girls seem to run freely and wildly through the corridors at all times, popping in and out of each other's rooms, talking disrespectfully to the staff on hand, entertaining strange young men in their rooms under direct gaze of the people who work there and even bolting from the place entirely with astonishing frequency.  Moreover, the girls certainly do not seem to be kept very busy with either chores or therapy sessions and, as a result, we often wonder what exactly the therapeutic modus operandi of this hospital is.  In a weak echo of  `Cuckoo's Nest,' the girls are taken out into a public setting - an ice cream parlor - with predictably disastrous results. Even worse in that scene is the confrontation that occurs between Susanna and a friend of her parents who it seems has wised up to the fact that Susanna and her husband once had a sexual fling.  The incredibility is not in the confrontation per se, but in the fact that this mother would make such an embarrassingly public scene right in front of her own understandably chagrined daughter.On the whole, however, the film sports enough virtues of performances and writing to triumph over its flaws.  Winona Ryder, in what might well be her finest performance to date, conveys the combination of melancholic wistfulness and hard-edged cynicism essential to her essentially decent but deeply troubled character.  Neither the writers, Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan, nor writer/director James Mangold ever allow us to bank on the extent of Susanna's madness.  Since she herself is never quite sure whether she is truly insane or just deeply depressed and emotionally confused, we are never given the opportunity to peg her with a pat diagnosis either.  The same goes for her fellow inmates, particularly Lisa, stunningly portrayed by Angelina Jolie, whose often-lethal combination of beguiling charm and cold-blooded ruthlessness, keeps us as off balance as it does Susanna.Certainly, mental illness is one of the most difficult conditions to render credible on the screen.  The risks lie in either overstating the mannerisms and actions into seeming absurdity or of providing resolutions that ring hollow in their upbeat simplicity.  `Girl, Interrupted' falls into both traps occasionally, but the fact that it is a work culled from a real person's personal experiences makes us more prone to accept it at face value.   At times the girls seem too facile in their respective natures - one is a pathological liar, one a repressed lesbian, one a deceitful sociopath, one a self-deluded incest victim etc. - yet each character also contains her personal element of truth and validity.  Only Whoopi Goldberg's anti-Nurse Ratched character rings untrue.  Perhaps Goldberg has simply gone once too often to this particular well - that of the overly sympathetic authority figure dripping heartfelt sincerity all over the miserable and the hurting.  As an actress, she has long ago lost her edge.Still, for all its weaknesses, `Girl, Interrupted' emerges as a genuinely poignant and moving study of a group of hurting individuals groping towards each other for hope and understanding.  For all the voices of reason shouting at us to question its authenticity, we find ourselves wanting desperately to believe in this unusual and thought-provoking tale",Null,0,0,20 July 2000
Blood Diamond," flawed but compelling social drama
","'Blood Diamond' may well result in the biggest boon yet for the cubic zirconium business. This latest work by Edward Zwick tackles a serious social issue in the guise of popular entertainment, which turns out to be both the greatest weakness and the greatest strength of the film.'Blood' diamonds, also known as 'conflict' diamonds, are those that are mined in war zones, then sold to finance those wars. Set in 1999, the movie features Leonardo DiCaprio as a largely amoral diamond smuggler who is plying his trade in war-torn Sierra Leone on the west coast of the African continent. Through a series of complicated events, Danny Archer meets up with a native named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who knows the whereabouts of a rare, priceless diamond that Archer, along with virtually everybody else in the film, would love to get his hands on. Solomon, however, needs its as a bargaining chip to ransom his wife and children who have been turned into refugees as a result of the internecine war occurring between the government and rebel forces out to enslave people like Solomon in the local mines. Jennifer Connelly plays a compassionate American reporter determined to expose the evil and corruption involved in the blood diamond business to a largely apathetic and hitherto unresponsive world at large.With a screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on a story by him and C. Gaby Mitchell, Zwick has fashioned a generally powerful film whose occasional dramatic contrivances can be easily forgiven in light of the salutary goal of the film. One could object to the fact that, yet again, a story set in the Third World seemingly needs to be told through the eyes of white people from the West. The movie tries to overcome this handicap by making it clear that Archer is actually from Zimbabwe - and DiCaprio has the South African accent to prove it - but the air of First World condescension is faintly evident nonetheless. Still, given the sad fact that such an approach was probably necessary even to get the film green-lighted let alone funded, one cannot really hold that against the filmmakers. The movie also indulges in a few too many action movie clichés - hairbreadth escapes, in-the-nick-of-time rescues, the near-miraculous dodging of bullets etc. - but, again, the movie makers clearly know they must first get the attention of their target audience before they can enlighten them about the situation at hand. Moreover, the film is a bit too long at 138 minutes and suffers from attenuation and repetition in its final half hour.Those negatives aside, 'Blood Diamond' is, for the most part, an effective piece of serious commercial movie-making, thanks, primarily, to Zwick's skill as a director and to the fine performances by DiCaprio, Connelly and, especially, Hounsou, whose quiet dignity and fierce determination do much to personalize the plight of the innocents caught in a hellhole of wanton slaughter and crass de-humanization. Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie is that it doesn't stint in showing us the brutality and widespread individual suffering brought about by this mad rush towards profit and greed. In addition, Archer's slow awakening to the depths of the human tragedy occurring around him and his own shameful participation in it may be predictable from a narrative standpoint, but it gives the film the moral weight and thematic depth it needs to elevate it above the level of a mere exploitative action picture.",7,9,15,4 January 2007
Pride & Prejudice," gets the plot details right but misses out on some of the humor
","It seems like every time we turn around these days some filmmaker has been hard at work producing yet another adaptation of Jane Austen's most beloved novel 'Pride and Prejudice.' And even though some of the versions have been quite good actually, we can still wonder if this glut is really all that necessary. The book's two most recent incarnations came in the form of miniseries produced by the BBC, the first in 1980 and the second in 1995. However, since 1940, there has not been a 'straight' (i.e. set in the proper time period) version of 'Pride and Prejudice' designed specifically for the big screen. Well, now we have one, written by Deborah Moggach, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley in the lead role.This latest version is distinguished from the earlier efforts primarily by its grittier, grimier and grungier depiction of life in early 19th Century rural England. With its peeling paint and dusty furnishings, the film certainly has a less prettified and more lived-in look than we are accustomed to seeing in movies based on Austen works. Yet, perhaps because we have been spoiled by the marathon lengths of those earlier miniseries, this film, at a mere two hours and seven minutes, feels hurried and rushed as it attempts to cope with Austen's complex tale of the five Bennett sisters and their mother's frantic efforts to marry them off. We are moved so quickly through the story that some of the more subtle details of character and theme get lost along the way. Still, it's quite remarkable just how much of the plot Moggach is able to cram into a little over two hours, so that even the staunchest of Austen purists will have little to complain about on that score.What they may have reason to complain about is the fact that the film fails to capture much of the unique humor that distinguishes the novel. For the most part, the scenes are played much too seriously and 'straight,' particularly those involving the odious Mr. Collins and the insufferably condescending Lady Catherine de Bourg, who together supply some of Austen's most bitingly witty commentary on the superficiality of England's class-conscious society. Tom Hollander gives a spiritless, leaden performance as the sycophantic minister, and Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine as if she were taking a stab at Lady MacBeth instead. The same goes for Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, whose pivotal role as the droll, dry commentator on the absurd Mrs. Bennett's matrimonial obsessions seems to have been lost on the actor. Matthew Macfadyen fails to make an impact as the haute Mr. Darcy, although Brenda Blethyn hits the right notes as the grating mother driven to despair at the prospect of her daughters ending up old maids.In the coveted role of the high-minded, strong willed and extremely judgmental Elizabeth Bennett - certainly the most brilliant and fully realized of all Austen's creations - Knightley clearly means well but doesn't seem quite up to the task. Her annoying giggle and epicene expression make her far too silly and modern to successfully portray the rational but often misguided 19th Century heroine Austen intended Elizabeth to be.Yet, despite all these weaknesses, 'Pride and Prejudice' makes for a reasonably entertaining film, thanks, primarily, to the strength of the original source material and the liveliness of Wright's direction (the ball scenes are exceptionally well done). The film moves quickly and does a decent job telling its story. Perhaps if we didn't have better versions to compare it to, this 'Pride and Prejudice' would stand up better on its own. It's far from a failure, but watching this condensed version instead of the two BBC miniseries is a bit like reading the Cliff's Notes instead of the actual novel. You may be able to get the general gist of the thing, but not that wonderful flavoring that makes the original so special.",7,5,9,26 June 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Movie genius
","In the modern world, we've come to rely on technology as a means of deadening our pain and mitigating the unpleasant realities of our lives. We medicate ourselves to avoid both physical and psychological suffering, confident in the belief that the elimination of all sorrow and discomfort will somehow lead to happiness. But what would happen if someday we developed the technology to systematically wipe from our minds the memories of a person with whom we fell out of love or who fell out of love with us? Given the choice, which would we rather have, a painful memory of a failed relationship or no memory of that relationship at all? It's not an easy question to answer for, after all, don't sadness and pain play every bit as vital a role as happiness and joy in defining who we are as human beings? Don't we need those low points to make the high points that much more meaningful and real? These are just some of the questions posed by 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, ' a romance-cum-science-fiction tale that is yet another demanding, provocative brainchild of Charlie Kaufman, the man responsible for 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.' In 'Eternal Sunshine,' Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules stuffed shirt, ground down by routine and unsuccessful in the ways of love, who meets and falls head over heels for Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-flying free spirit who opens up new vistas of experience for the nervous, unadventurous young man. However, if it is true that opposites do indeed attract, they also have the power to repel, and Joel and Joel and Clementine soon find themselves drifting apart over their many innate differences. In fact, they are drifting so far apart that Celementine has decided to undergo a medical procedure that will effectively erase all traces of Joel from her memory. When a heartbroken Joel learns that she has done this, he retaliates by doing the same with his memories of her. The vast majority of the film takes place in Joel's jumbled mind as he is undergoing the procedure to nullify his one true love - and regretting his decision halfway through.The synopsis for this movie fails to do justice to the sheer brilliance of both the concept and the execution, as we are taken through a cascading cavalcade of reality and fantasy, memories and recollections, all highly revelatory of the relationship between these two people. The movie is like a glorious kaleidoscope in which the writer and director, Michel Gondry, continually twist the picture in such a way that we never know what the next image or concept will be, yet with their hands so firmly placed on the instrument that we always know where we are at all times. Even if we don't always understand every single scene or image at the moment we are seeing it, we know that it will all make sense once the full scenario has played itself put. If 'Eternal Sunshine' reminds us of any one movie, it is most likely Stanley Donen's 'Two For the Road,' that great 1967 film starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney that also used an ingenious structure of interlocking time periods and events to show us the growth and disintegration of a romantic relationship. 'Two For the Road' did it while operating solely on the level of conscious reality; now, Kaufman, by delving into the subconscious world of half-remembered incidents and ephemeral dreams, ratchets up the concept a notch or two higher. Even though 'Eternal Sunshine' keeps shifting the planes of its reality, the audience never loses its bearings for a single moment.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have never been better than they are here, creating characters who are compelling, likable and utterly believable as they make their way through this convoluted but wonderfully challenging maze of a screenplay. It's amazing how believable and touching Carrey and Winslet manage to be in the midst of all this seeming disorder. They root the film in the human reality all fantasies need to be compelling.Towards the end, as the film brings all its disparate elements together on a single plane of reality, the movie asks us to ponder yet another difficult and challenging question: is it possible for two people in a failed relationship to drift apart for awhile, then reunite successfully if they go into the renewed relationship fully cognizant of those elements that drove them apart the first time around? It is just one of the many intriguing ideas to consider in this brilliant, creative and thoroughly fascinating film.As with Kaufman's previous cinematic mindbenders, 'Eternal Sunshine' occasionally feels a bit too cute and a bit too clever for its own good. However, this film suffers less from this malady and feels to be more of a piece than his earlier works. With a Kaufman film - and with 'Eternal Sunshine' in particular - we know we're getting something original, unique and intellectually demanding, which is far from the normal state of affairs when it comes to mainstream American movie-making. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a film for the ages.",9,0,1,27 March 2005
Elysium," A futuristic allegory for the Occupy generation
","In the year 2154, the earth has become a veritable wasteland of poverty, pollution and overpopulation (what a surprise). The wealthy elite have long since fled to a paradisiacal spaceship named Elysium (after the section in the Greek underworld reserved exclusively for heroes and poets) permanently orbiting the planet, where they lead lives of pampered ease, leaving the great unwashed masses back home to fend for themselves. Some of those masses make occasional desperate stabs at reaching the ship, where they are captured and put into camps, if they're lucky, or blown to smithereens before being able to land if they're not. Matt Damon plays a Joe Blow schmuck who, after receiving a fatal dose of radiation on the job, agrees to get in with a pretty bad crowd in order to get to Elysium to get a cure (the wealthy have all the medicines while the poor are left on Earth to sicken and die).A post-apocalyptic tale for the Occupy generation, this allegory of class division and illegal immigration is the brainchild of Neill Blomkamp, the South African writer/director who gave us the surprise critical and commercial hit 'District 9' in 2009.Unfortunately, in a number of respects, 'Elysium' doesn't quite rise to the level of that earlier film. Damon's Max de Costa is such a dull Everyman character that he goes from relatable to boring in no time flat. And the story, though promising at first, quickly stalls out, as Max spends an inordinate amount of the movie's running time just trying to get up to Elysium - though, once he gets there, things do pick up considerably.Purse-lipped Jodi Foster hams it up as the cold-blooded defense secretary whose job it is to make sure that nothing or no one threatens the idyllic life in Elysium - a woman so evil and callous she makes Cruella Deville and the Wicked Witch of the West look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.Shortcomings aside, however, 'Elysium' uses first-rate art direction and production design to create a compelling vision of the future. Its sociopolitical subtext also lends it a gravitas that the story itself could never have achieved on its own. Add to that a genuinely touching ending and you have a movie that fails to fulfill the promise laid out by 'District 9' but which has virtues of its own to recommend it.",7,0,1,17 January 2014
Taken," serviceable thriller made special by Neeson
","Bryan Mills is a retired CIA operative whose seventeen-year-old daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of Albanian white-slave traffickers the moment she arrives in Paris. Instantly, Mills launches into secret agent mode, utilizing all the tricks-of-the-trade he picked up during his years in the service to single-handedly track down his daughter and bring her abductors to justice. Clearly, James Bond has nothing on this guy.As action thrillers go, 'Taken' is considerably less plausible than most (which is saying a great deal), filled as it is with preposterous coincidences and feats of superhuman dexterity, but director Pierre Morel does know how to get the adrenaline pumping - which, let's face it, is all one really asks for from a high-octane popcorn movie such as this one.To make the movie more 'relatable' for the audience, screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have concocted a rather dreadful scenario in which Mills has quit his job and moved to California so he will be able to spend more time with his daughter, only to find that he now has to compete with her gazillionaire step daddy for her attention and affection. But all that malarkey is done away with in the early stages and - good news for action fans - once the movie hits the throttle, it never lets up.The European tourism industry is bound to take something of a hit with this film - and, seriously, all of this just to get some rich guys laid? Don't they have just regular old call-girls in Paris anymore? - but the commercial success of the movie has been nothing less than a godsend for Liam Neeson's career and pocketbook.With 'Taken,' a new action hero is born.",6,0,0,13 July 2009
Alice in Wonderland," a cornucopia of visual delights
","Given his flair for the whimsical, the surrealistic, and the preposterous, Tim Burton would seem the ideal choice to direct a modern movie version of 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.' And turns out he is. (Terry Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro, whose 'Pan's Labyrinth' was already a variant of sorts on the story, are two others who might have done as well).Lewis Carroll's darkly humorous Victorian Era classic chronicles the adventures of a spunky, imaginative young girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole into a fantastic world of talking animals, size-altering potions, and memorably eccentric characters, a land ruled over by the evil, bulbous-headed Red Queen, played with petulant haughtiness by Helena Bonham Carter. The screenplay for the film – now called simply 'Alice in Wonderland' - by Linda Woolverton draws from both 'Wonderland' and its first sequel 'Through the Looking Glass' (as most previous film versions have done), and captures both the darkness and the humor of the material.All of Carroll's beloved creations are here, some played by actors in costumes and makeup, some generated entirely through CGI, and some – like The Red Queen – produced through a canny combination of the two. There's the mad Mad Hatter (played by a typically loopy Johnny Depp), the growling Bandersnatch, the slyly smiling Cheshire Cat, the virtuous White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the roly-poly twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the dragon-like Jabberwocky, which it has been prophesied Alice will slay, thereby liberating the people of the kingdom from their tyrannical queen.Burton breathes new life into this oft-told and oft-filmed tale thanks to a team of visual and special effects wizards who come as close to capturing the world of Carroll's imagination as any group of filmmakers could ever be expected to, given the enormity of the challenge.As the heroine who must learn to accept the impossible before she can know who she truly is, Mia Wasikowska manages to keep Alice life-sized and appealing even in the midst of all the larger-than-life pyrotechnics going on around her.A masterpiece of art direction, costume design and special effects, this 'Alice in Wonderland' is the next best thing to the books themselves.",8,3,5,24 March 2011
Avatar," astonishing visuals overcome polemics
","'Avatar' is James Cameron's $237 million parable on the evils of imperialism, corporatism and Manifest Destiny.The time is 2154, the place an earthlike moon called Pandora, where an American company has set up a major mining operation to extract a precious mineral - presumably an energy source - from beneath the planetoid's lush, verdant surface. The problem is that one of the richest veins lies directly under a massive tree that holds great spiritual significance for the indigenous folk who live there - a race of nine-foot-tall, blue-complexioned natives called the Na'vi who dwell in the forest, wield old-fashioned bows-and-arrows, fly around on giant pterodactyl-type birds, and have a strong pantheistic connection with the world around them.As the story begins, it is clear that, thus far, the earthlings have had very limited success in winning over the Na'vi through such outreach efforts as building them schools and teaching them English. Fortunately, a group of scientists have found a way to create facsimiles of the Na'vi - called Avatars - into which a human mind can be transported while the original body remains behind in a state of suspended animation. Enter Jake Sully, a young marine who's lost the use of his legs in battle and now has been chosen to enter into an avatar so he can learn more about the Na'vi by living amongst them in the hopes of eventually winning them over to the Americans' side. Unfortunately, not everyone is as concerned with making nice with the Na'vi as is Grace Augustine, the humanistic biologist who heads up the research, and Jake soon discovers that the more he comes to feel like a Na'vi himself, the more he is expected to spy on and then betray his new-found compatriots in the earthlings' cause. Jake's gradual transition from cocky, human-centric warrior to nature-loving ersatz-alien provides the dramatic and thematic arc of the film.The parallels between the conflict in 'Avatar' and America's involvement in the Iraq war are never far from Cameron's mind and the movie suffers a bit for it (ironically, 'Avatar' is a far more overtly political film than 'The Hurt Locker' which is actually SET in Iraq). I suspect that, had he wanted to, Cameron could probably have gotten his point across without taking a narrative sledgehammer to the audience. Heck, there's even a reference to 'shock and awe' as the Americans gear up for battle, just in case you missed the inference. That being said, 'Avatar' is enough of a technical triumph to overcome its occasional heavy-handed polemical tendencies and to successfully take us to a place we've never been before.Through the wizardry of computer-generated 3-D special effects, Cameron has created a magical world of shimmering forests, floating mountains, and strange and exotic flora and fauna - a place where love can convincingly flourish between creatures from alien worlds and alien species. In fact, the romance between Jake and a female Na'vi who teaches him the ways of her people - an even more unlikely coupling than Rose and Jack in 'Titanic' - has something of a 'New World' quality about it. And, indeed, Cameron's near-worshipful attitude towards nature here echoes Terrance Malick's work in that earlier film. Actually, that seems a particularly appropriate reference point given that 'Avatar' can easily be viewed as an allegory of the European white man's conquest of the American continent and the genocide perpetrated on the native population that played such a crucial role in bringing that outcome about. The look of the movie is something akin to a John Howe painting done in bold florescent colors and placed under a black light.Of the performers, it's frankly a little hard to evaluate fully Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana's work in this film since clearly much of what appears on screen is the product of CGI manipulation and enhancement. But they're both certainly adequate to the task they've been called upon to fulfill, and Sigourney Weaver as Grace and Giovanni Ribisi as the corporate administrator for the mine - and the movie's arch villain - turn in genuinely powerful performances. And once again, as with 'Titanic,' James Horner provides a soaring power-ballad to help transition the audience out of the theater and back into the real world.Almost inevitably, perhaps, 'Avatar' is one of those movies wherein the storyline is bound to become at least partially subsumed by the special effects. But, as he did with 'Titanic' - though to a somewhat lesser extent in this case - Cameron proves that he is capable of finding that happy medium between the two sides better than most.",8,1,7,26 January 2010
Toy Story 2," wonderful sequel
","'Toy Story 2,' the superb sequel to the groundbreaking 1995 'animated' hit, is simply bursting with imagination, humor, and enough technical wizardry and high spirited energy for a dozen such films.  Rare indeed is the sequel that outshines the original, but, in the case of this series, the second time around turns out to be just that exception.All the beloved original characters have made a return appearance as the film bursts the bounds of the bedroom and the neighborhood and moves out into the big wide world of crowded city streets, highrise apartment buildings and airport runways.  In this installment, Woody is 'kidnapped' by an opportunistic toy salesman who is bent on selling him and three other 'western' figures to a Japanese museum.  (It turns out Woody was once the centerpiece of his own marionette show on 1950's television - a clever and witty takeoff on that long lost genre).  The frenetic plot involves Woody's friends' desperate attempts to recover their old buddy and bring him safely back to themselves and the boy who loves him.What is most remarkable about this film is that each toy is differentiated so beautifully, given a distinctive personality that makes every one of them appear very lifelike.  Even more impressive is that, while each conveys a goodnatured sweetness that makes them palatable to children, most of them also contain that subtle touch of cynicism that makes them appealing to adults as well.  This is portrayed most humorously in the witty juxtaposition between the Buzz Lightyear who is conscious of his status as a toy and a newly-opened 'deluded' Buzz who sincerely believes he is a genuine action hero on a mission and whose exaggerated heroic mannerisms generate many of the belly laughs in the film.The film also achieves a depth of thought rarely achieved in animated features.  Woody, for instance, is confronted with a moral dilemma of either leaving his old time friends, who have braved any number of dangers to come and rescue him, or abandoning the new friends he has made who are counting on him to save them from obscurity by becoming a member of the museum entourage.  In addition, the film actually confronts the issue of toy mortality, as Woody must face up to the fact that his owner will soon grow out of his love for his playthings and that he and the other toys will one day be consigned to the inevitable trash heap that sadly awaits them all.Still, the main delight of this film is the incredibly high level of energy it manages to sustain during its near-90 minute running time.  The inventivness and humor never flag as the eye feasts on the brilliant technical accomplishments of each aspect of the film.  This is indeed animation of the very highest order and the speed with which it zooms by, with delight upon delight spilling off the screen, makes 'Toy Story 2' one of the very best of the genre.  This is one fantastically fun movie!",Null,0,0,26 November 1999
Grindhouse," fun, if overlong, exercise in style
","Two masters of modern action cinema, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, have come up with a jim-dandy of an idea for their first collaborative movie-making effort, 'Grindhouse.' They have decided to make two '70-s-style exploitation pictures (the kind of movies on which these two directors were obviously weaned), package them into a double feature, then add a coming attractions trailer and a note from the theater management to make the 'experience' complete (please note that this review is based on the split-DVD versions of the film, not the original theatrical release). Although the films are set in the present day, the directors have made them appear to be un-restored relics from three decades ago. The poor lighting, faded colors, missing frames and surface scratches all make the prints look very old and worn indeed. In fact, were it not for the cell phones and references to Chris Rock and Osama bin Laden contained in the film, one would swear Tarantino and Rodriguez had just found these long-neglected movies moldering away in some dusty vault somewhere, possibly on the lot of American International Pictures.But beyond the obvious technical triumph, is there anything of substance to 'Grindhouse'? Well, if by 'substance,' one means 'food for thought,' then the answer is probably no. But if there is intrinsic value to be had in simple camp and parody, then Tarantino and Rodriguez clearly deliver the goods. While both films suffer from over length and hit a point of diminishing returns before reaching their respective conclusions, 'Grindhouse' provides entertainment in extremis for schlock-meisters everywhere.The first up is 'Planet Terror' (directed by Rodriguez), a cheesy zombie picture decked out with absurdly over-the-top action sequences and a great deal of good humor (it's amazing just how close some of this gets, in terms of storyline and detail, to the later 'I Am Legend'). The large cast consists of Freddy Rodriguez ('Six Feet Under'), Josh Brolin ('No Country for Old Men'), Bruce Willis, Naveen Andrews ('Lost'), Rosa McGowan, and Harley Shelton, all of whom get into the spirit of the enterprise by ginning up their energy levels and playing their roles with deadpanned earnestness.The second feature, 'Death Proof,' is considerably different in style from Rodriguez' entry, with Tarantino bringing his trademark mixture of snappy dialogue and graphic violence to the offbeat tale of a homicidal movie stuntman (Kurt Russell) who employs his souped-up, 'death proof' car as a weapon of mass destruction. There are those who will find 'Death Proof' to be too talky and slow-moving for their tastes, especially in contrast to the hyper-kinetic 'Planet Terror,' but Tarantino's more cerebral approach makes it possible for him to achieve a tone of genuine menace in the second half of the story. He also undercuts audience expectations by casually doing away with most of his main characters partway through the movie. Restless action movie aficionados should also note that all the talk is merely a lead up to a spectacular car chase sequence guaranteed to have them gripping the arms of their seats in excitement. An affectionate homage to all those car-demolition epics from the 1970's - 'Vanishing Point,' 'Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry,' 'Gone in 60 Seconds,' etc. - that one scene alone is worth the price of admission. (Oddly, at about the midpoint of the movie, Tarantino suddenly drops the pseudo-'70's look in favor of a more contemporary style). Russell has a grand old time playing the grizzled serial killer, while Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Porter, Tracie Thomas, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell and Marcy Harriell provide eye-candy aplenty as the various women and/or victims who come his way (though, why oh why does Tarantino keep insisting on casting himself in his own pictures?).The faux-trailer that the directors have attached to the beginning of the movie (it's for a film called 'Machete') comes about as close as possible to looking like the real thing, with one key exception: it features swear words and nudity, something that no coming-attractions trailer, to my knowledge at least, has ever done.As a pastiche of raw-boned, off-Hollywood movie-making, 'Grindhouse' is a mixed-bag of virtues and flaws, and it won't be everybody's cup of tea by any stretch of the imagination.

The Artist," More than a curiosity
","There's always a risk with a movie like 'The Artist' that it will become all about the gimmick and nothing more. But Michel Hazanavicius's modern-day re-creation of a black-and-white silent film is so adroitly executed and artistically wrought that it transcends the gimmick and becomes an impressive work in its own right.Set in the late '20s and early '30s, the period when movie-making was transitioning from silents to talkies, the movie focuses on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a dapper matinée-idol who 's more devoted to his dog - the scene-stealing Uggie - than to his acting partner/wife (Penelope Ann Miller). The problem is that Valentin seems more suited to the silent screen than the sound one - we learn why at the end - so we watch as his career and his personal life take a turn for the worse throughout the course of the story. If that sounds a bit like the premise of 'Singin' in the Rain,' you're right, but the movie also has a touch of 'A Star is Born' about it, for as Valentin's career goes into an ever-increasing death-spiral, the beautiful young ingenue (Berenice Bejo) he helped to discover has taken to the talkies like gang-busters and is becoming a major star of the silver screen. (One can also find a couple of homages to 'Citizen Kane,' but they're a little less obvious).'The Artist' is obviously of most interest to those with a love of cinema and movie history, as it re-creates in breathtakingly beautiful terms the look and sound of silent movies (the tinkling-piano score is by Ludovic Bource). The movie is pure joy to look at, thanks to the eye-popping cinematography of Guillaume Schiffman, which captures the otherworldly elegance of a world framed in black-and-white images. The story may strike some as facile and simplistic to say the least, but that's clearly in keeping with the temper of the times and the era of motion picture history in which it is set. I could have done with a little more of the behind-the-camera glimpses into old-time movie-making and a little less of the foreground romance, but that is a minor quibble in a movie that works on so many other levels. One of those is the acting, with Dujardin and Bejo managing to create effective characters with only a minimum of mugging, and John Goodman and James Cromwell doing the same in supporting roles. And little Uggie, who also appeared in 'Mr. Fix-it' and 'Water for Elephants,' puts Toto and Rin Tin Tin to shame in the canine-acting division.With movies like 'Moneyball,' 'The Descendents' and 'The Tree of Life' hanging around, I wouldn't have voted for 'The Artist' as the Best Picture of 2011, but I wouldn't have missed the one-of-a-kind visual experience it affords for anything in the world.",8,0,2,18 July 2012
Invictus," Making the world a better place one rugby match at a time
","One of the best movies of 2009, 'Invictus,' written by Anthony Peckham and directed by Clint Eastwood, takes us to a fascinating moment in modern history.It's the mid-1990s; the racist and repressive system known as Apartheid has recently been overturned in South Africa, and former political prisoner Nelson Mandela has just been elected the nation's first black president. Tensions are running high among the Afrikaners, who fear that the majority blacks will use their new-found power to exact revenge on the white minority. Many of the blacks, on the other hand, find it difficult and distasteful to work in tandem with a people who had degraded, oppressed and even imprisoned them for so long.Into this quagmire steps Mr. Mandela, a true believer in the power of redemption and reconciliation to change hearts and influence policy, who hits upon a scheme to unite the two factions through their mutual love of rugby, rallying the nation behind the team known as the Springboks, which, for the blacks, once represented all the things they despised about the Apartheid regime. Against massive odds of both history and human nature, this amazing man manages to heal old wounds and forge a new nation based on equality and respect for all.Derived from the novel 'Playing the Enemy' by John Carlin, 'Invictus' (the title of a Victorian poem Mandela uses as a guide for his own life) could easily have been just another self-congratulatory exercise in 'do-gooder' drama - but its heartfelt honesty, its accomplished direction and its world-class acting make it so much more. Morgan Freeman gives a towering, yet carefully understated, performance as the near-saintly Mandela, a role he was clearly born to play, bringing true conviction to the moral strength, innate compassion and basic decency of a man who suffered so much at the hands of others, yet who refused to allow personal bitterness and a desire for revenge to determine the course his life - or his nation - would take. Instead, Mandela, at great personal risk to his own popularity, used his experience to build bridges and to set his nation on a path towards healing that would allow it to take its rightful place in a modern, more enlightened world where every man is equal and where citizens work together for a common good. Indeed, Mandela is probably the greatest argument for the Great Men Theory of history the past half century has had to offer. And Matt Damon, boasting a flawless South African accent, has probably never been better than he is here, playing Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springboks, who is so impressed with Mandela's continued faith in the human race despite all he's been through that he rallies his own team members (most of them white) to join with the president in playing for the glory of the new South Africa - an effort that led them to winning the Rugby World Cup in 1995.The beauty of 'Invictus' is that it doesn't find it necessary to over-dramatize the racial tension or to indulge in ginned-up melodramatics to get its message across. The racism here is often of a more subtle kind - a careless word here, a thoughtless put-down there - and the movie does an expert job conveying that fact.Recently, I wrote that I couldn't imagine seeing a more inspiring and uplifting film than 'Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.' Well, now I've just seen one. It's called 'Invictus' - and it is not to be missed.",9,1,2,8 August 2010
Mama," Conventional ghost story with some stylistic flourishes
","A young man (Nicholas Coaster-Waldau), distraught at the 2008 economic collapse, guns down his ex-wife and kidnaps his two young daughters, dragging them to a deserted cabin in the woods, planning to kill them and himself in a horrendous murder/suicide. But before he can enact that horror, he is dispatched by some strange, supernatural force residing in the house. Flash-forward five years when the girls are finally discovered by the killer's twin brother and brought back to civilization, having been 'raised' by whoever or whatever it is that resides in the place. Needless to say, the girls are a mess psychologically, but that's only half the problem that the uncle and his girlfriend (Jessica Chastain) face in trying to re-acclimate the children to life in the real world.'Mama' is a horror movie with a lot of elaborate bells-and-whistles but not a great deal of originality or insight. For beneath all the fancy genre trappings - the creaking boards, the creepy voices on the soundtrack, the half-glimpsed figures in the background, the high-tech CGI effects - it's still just the same old hooey about the spirit who simply can't rest until some personal injustice from the past has been rectified and who believes that scaring the bejeezus out of the living will somehow bring that outcome about.Yet, despite a really dopey finale, the scare tactics work reasonably well for most of the duration, and the movie succeeds in developing and sustaining a creepy atmosphere thanks to the direction of Andy Muschietti and the cinematography of Antonio Riestra. And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse are very good indeed as the haunted youngsters.",5,1,3,26 June 2013
Super 8," tries to recapture an era but just feels derivative
","J.J. Abrams' 'Super 8' hearkens back to the days of early Steven Spielberg (who co-produced the film) - a time when summer blockbusters could appeal as much to the heart as to the eye, when a group of intrepid suburban kids could unravel mysteries and take on evil forces, when the military-industrial complex was clearly up to no good, and when tear-stained characters could look in wide-eyed, tight-shot amazement at wonders unraveling above them in the heavens.Set, appropriately, in 1979 - in a time before digital cameras and CGI technology, when children had to express their creativity and imagination with what was then the technological equivalent of chewing gum and baling wire - 'Super 8' centers on a group of nerdish preteens who are attempting to make their own amateur zombie-splatter film for an upcoming contest. While filming one night, the kids are witness to a horrifying freight train crash, the repercussions of which go far beyond just the mass of mangled, twisted metal strewn across the area. For it seems the Air Force has taken a more than casual interest in the event, and soon strange and inexplicable occurrences begin happening in town.The focal point of the story is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young boy whose mother has just been killed in a tragic factory accident, and whose grieving father (Kyle Chandler from TV's incomparable 'Friday Night Lights') serves as the town's deputy. Joe also has a crush on the pretty and alluring Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), who has been brought into the boys' film project at the last moment.The similarities between 'Super 8' and any number of Spielberg - or at least Spielbergian - films (most notably, of course, 'E.T.') are both so numerous and so obvious that they really don't bear repeating here. Yet, while I admire much of what Abrams is trying to do in this movie, so much of it falls flat that I really can't recommend it in the final analysis. What's actually missing is that special Spielberg touch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like 'E.T.' into a timeless classic. One never questions Spielberg's belief in his material, but I'm not sure one can quite make the same claim about Abrams, at least not in this particular instance. Abrams' story lacks the streamlined clarity of an 'E.T.' and, by extension, the emotional resonance that comes along with it. 'Super 8' seems to be going off in so many different directions at once that it winds up going nowhere. And, frankly, the sci-fi aspects of the story feel awfully stale at this late stage in the game. In addition to 'E.T.,' there are bits and pieces of 'The Goonies,' 'Stand By Me,' 'Gremlins,' and 'War of the Worlds' in the film as well. And that, in the final analysis, is what's most wrong with 'Super 8.' It's made up of so many borrowed parts that, in the end, it's left with nothing it can truly call its own.",Null,7,13,18 July 2011
The Last Samurai," An American in Japan
","Set in 1870's Japan, `The Last Samurai' is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood- soaked battle scenes and avoids the softening effects of its two-bit philosophizing.Tom Cruise is stoic and stolid as Nathan Algren, a former captain of the United States army who is having trouble coming to grips with the part he played in slaughtering a village of innocent American Indians.  Now drifting aimlessly through life, Algren disinterestedly agrees to go to Japan to help train its military in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the samurai forces who are still using swords as weapons.  Once he is captured by the `enemy,' however, Algren falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honor and switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the samurai (whom he views as the equivalent of `Indian underdogs' in the struggle) against the people he was brought over to train.  The film, thus, becomes a study in redemption as this one man attempts to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the life-crippling guilt of his past actions.Director Edward Zwick, who made one of the best war films of modern times (`Glory'), has had less success here, mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we can't help feeing manipulated all throughout the film.  In many ways, `The Last Samurai' is as guilty of one-sidedness as those old time Westerns that used to portray the Indians as faceless savages and the White Man as noble adventurers and heroes.  Each perspective seems equally unhistorical and phony.   It's hard for us to see much meaning in Algren's redemption when the people he is following spend much of their time garroting themselves and chopping off one another's heads.  And all the talk about `honor,' `shame,' the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen-type lifestyle don't amount to too much when we stand back and realize that the samurai were basically bloody warriors who often terrorized the general populous with their acts of brutality and violence.  The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them, but it is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.  So when we are asked to cheer on Algren and his compatriots in battle or weep over their fate, the movie loses its grip on us in a major way.  The film becomes just another case of glorifying and romanticizing a way of life that we somehow suspect was a bit less noble and honorable than we have always been led to believe by the countless movies on the subject.Technically, `The Last Samurai' is a mighty impressive achievement.  In addition to the eye-catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city, the film's large-scaled battle sequences have been stunningly mounted and executed - though the faint-of-heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout.  There are, also, some admittedly touching moments scattered throughout the film, though the Hollywood corn is never too far from the surface (particularly in Algren's romantic attachment to the wife of a man he killed).`The Last Samurai' is a joy to look at, but its unsubtle approach to its material and lack of evenhandedness make it far less meaningful and moving than, I'm sure, it both wanted and intended to be.",Null,35,67,10 January 2004
3 Idiots," likable if bloated screwball comedy
","When it comes to running-time, why does Bollywood treat every movie as if it were a sweeping historical epic on the order of a 'Lawrence of Arabia' or a 'Doctor Zhivago?' A case in point: '3 Idiots,' an amiable enough little screwball comedy that has been padded out to a wrist-slashing 164 minutes. It also happens to be the most commercially successful Bollywood feature ever released in India. Go figure.The story centers around a trio of promising but mischievous young engineering students who rebel against the high-pressured rigidity - both academic and personal - of the exclusive school they're attending.'3 Idiots' has two things going for it: its cranked-up energy level and its appealing actors, especially Aamir Khan, who portrays the ringleader of the group. These alone are enough to compensate for the silliness of much of the action, the corniness of the jokes (with irritating cue music in case we couldn't pick up on the corn on our own) and the stickiness of the sentimentality. And, in its own playful way, the movie makes some important points about the intense pressure placed on Indian children to achieve beyond their parents' wildest expectations, and about the need to pursue the path that will make one most happy in life.It's a pretty entertaining feature, overall; I just wish it didn't take so darn long to play itself out.",7,1,6,14 July 2012
Up," loses its way at times but endearing in large part
","For a few perilous moments in the middle of 'Up,' I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as 'king' of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with 'Toy Story' all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.So far, so good, as 'Up' captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as 'The Red Balloon,' 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Around the World in 80 Days.' There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.The trouble for 'Up' begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.Yet, what eventually saves 'Up' from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the 'adventure' that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of 'The Wizard of Oz'). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, 'Ratatoille' and 'Wall-E,' but the less spectacular look actually makes 'Up' a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.",7,7,14,27 July 2009
The Hurricane," more about writing than boxing
","The most startling revelation about Norman Jewison's film `The Hurricane' is that this true-life account of middleweight champion Ruben `Hurricane' Carter turns out to be more about the glories of writing than of boxing.  In fact, almost no time at all in the film is dedicated to chronicling the details of Carter's fighting career but rather to the attempts made by him and others on his behalf to prove his innocence in a murder case that resulted in his serving a nearly 20-year long prison sentence.The sympathies of the filmmakers clearly lie with Carter, although a number of people have, since the release of the film, challenged some of the film's reliability and veracity.  As one completely unacquainted with the facts of the case as they initially played themselves out, I am certainly in no position to adjudge the authenticity and accuracy of the film.  As a piece of drama, however, `The Hurricane' generates an impressive amount of interest in the viewer and even attains emotional greatness in a few scenes. Because the film is trying to come at the story from so many different angles, it occasionally feels a bit like a patchwork  part boxing film, part prison drama, part investigative thriller, part inspirational feel-good drama - rather than a completely unified work of art.  And, understandably, the film is more successful in some of those areas than in others.The first half of the film is pretty standard issue stuff.  We get, perhaps, a somewhat overly sketchy portrayal of the events in Carter's life before the fateful night in Paterson, NJ when he found himself the prime suspect at a murder scene.  We see Carter as an 11-year old boy getting in trouble with the law for defending himself against a pedophile who turns out to be a well-respected and highly placed figure in the local community.  This incident introduces him to the Paterson sergeant (Dan Hedaya) who plays the Javert to Carter's Jean Valjean, dedicating his life to seeing that Carter never lives his life outside prison, hounding him out of a misguided sense of self-righteous zeal  an obsession aggravated by the galling fact that Carter has since gone on to achieve international notoriety in the ring.  As in many of the early sections of the film, the writers Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon fail to portray the incidents in Carter's life in a well-rounded, totally believable way.  We find it hard to understand just why this one black child  among a vast number in Paterson one presumes  would fire up this sergeant's passion so intensely.  We also are rushed along through Carter's early stints in prison, his time in the military, his rise to fame in the boxing world, sometimes with little more than voice-over excerpts from Carter's novel to inform us of how much he has learned and changed from his experiences.  The script is so jumpy at times that we never feel we get to know much about the young Carter at all.Luckily for us, this is not all there is to `The Hurricane.'  The writers and director wisely enlarge the canvas of their story to include the teenager, Lesra Martin, whose contact it was with Carter, languishing almost forgotten in prison, that ultimately set the wheels of justice rolling that would lead to Carter's eventual release.   And herein lies the real emotional core of the story.  Lesra, a near-illiterate inner city boy from Brooklyn, living with some benevolent white liberals in Canada, purchases an old copy of the autobiographical best-selling novel Carter wrote in prison  the first book Lesra has ever read  and becomes so caught up in the similarities to his own life pouring off the pages that he decides to write to Carter in prison.  A warm relationship develops between the aging convict and the budding youngster which eventually leads to Lesra's introducing Carter to his mentors who then take up the cause of getting Carter's case overturned.  The highlight of the film is clearly the mesmerizing, emotionally riveting first encounter between Lesra and Carter; we sit spellbound as the two hurting individuals grope tentatively towards one another, each seeking that connection with (and recognition from) the other on the common ground of their parallel life experiences that they need so desperately.  As the two discuss the liberating effect their writing has on both of them, the film becomes a glorious paean to the power and might of the written word.  It is a truly unforgettable scene.Unfortunately, the film only achieves that gripping emotional power a few times afterwards and in each occasion it is the connection between Lesra and Carter that brings it about.   The three Canadian activists who take on the case for Carter's innocence remain underdeveloped as characters.  We wonder how they can afford to leave their jobs in Canada and dedicate themselves exclusively to Carter's cause.  And why are they always together?  Do they have any other relationships in their lives or have they taken a vow of celibacy to go along with their social crusading?  Their successful attempts to unravel the mystery of what really happened on that night in 1966 are interesting on the level of historicity but these sequences weaken the emotional drama at the film's core.  Since we do not get to know these characters as fully fleshed-out human beings, we watch these scenes with an attitude of detached disinterest rather than intense emotional involvement Perhaps, the story of Ruben `Hurricane' Carter is too diverse a one to be successfully encapsulated even in a film that runs an impressive 146 minutes.I realize, of course, that I have not yet mentioned Denzel Washington's impressive performance as Carter.  He literally holds the film together since there is virtually no scene in which he is not present.  This tour-de-force role allows him to run the emotional gambit from sullen rage and explosive fury to warmhearted tenderness and stoic idealism (and how many 40-something actors could still convincingly portray a man in his early '20's)?  Equally impressive, though, is young Vicellous Reon Shannon's work as the disadvantaged but ever idealistic Lesra.  Together these two extraordinary actors take `The Hurricane' to impressive emotional heights. This is their film all the way and it undoubtedly does `The Hurricane' himself proud.",Null,2,4,14 July 2000
Woman in Gold," 'Monuments Men' done right
","Set in the late 1990s, 'Woman in Gold' is a true-life David-and- Goliath story about a headstrong elderly woman who, essentially, takes on an entire nation in her pursuit of justice.The woman is 82-year-old Maria Altmann, a native Austrian from a well-to-do Jewish family, who fled with her husband to America to escape Nazi persecution. Now that Maria, who currently resides in Pasadena, is nearing the end of her life, she's decided to try and get back some of the priceless artwork that was confiscated when the Nazis ransacked her family's home, pieces that now reside in various museums around Austria. Even though the country has ostensibly adopted a policy of 'restitution' to the Jewish families whose artwork was stolen, the government is actually loath to relinquish its hold on the pieces, which it now considers to be national treasures. Maria, thus, turns to her friend's son, Randol Schoenberg, for help in getting back a series of paintings that once belonged to her family, in particular, one (unofficially referred to as the ''Mona Lisa' of Austria'), a portrait of her beloved aunt who died at a young age in the 1920s. Because the identity of the woman in the painting was unknown for so long, the work became known in the art world as 'Woman in Gold.'Schoenberg is a neophyte attorney whose own grandfather perished in a concentration camp. Initially reluctant to become involved with this eccentric old woman and her seemingly hopeless case, Schoenberg, despite having little experience in restoration law, eventually relents and dedicates much of his waking life to seeing that the paintings - and especially 'Woman in Gold' - are restored to their rightful owner. Written by Alexi Kaye Campbell and directed by Simon Curtis, 'Woman in Gold' is a legal thriller and an historical drama centered around the burgeoning friendship between two vastly different individuals who likely would never have met or, at least, never connected emotionally under other circumstances. Together, this determined duo triumphs over one bureaucratic setback and one legal hurdle after another on their way to ultimate victory (the case even makes its all the way to the United States Supreme Court). Throughout, the screenplay regularly flashes back to Maria's harrowing experiences living under Nazi rule. In both format and style, 'Woman in Gold' is a fairly conventional 'feel-good historical drama,' a bit bland and risk-averse, and, as such, it misses the opportunity to really distinguish itself in a major way. But despite the temptation to view it through cynical eyes, I must say that it's awfully hard not to give 'Woman in Gold' the benefit of the doubt, partly because the scenes set in the past can't help but be affecting, and partly because Mirren never falls into the trap of becoming the starch, brittle, cranky old-lady stereotype that a lesser actress might have had a much more difficult time avoiding. It's also nice to see Ryan Reynolds taking on a more challenging role than the ones he usually gets to play (his slightly nerdy appearance is an obvious attempt at downplaying his matinée-idol handsomeness and thus generating some gravitas for the character), but he feels slightly overmatched when put up against Mirren (as who wouldn't be?). He has some very good moments, no doubt, but a certain overall callowness in the performance limits its effectiveness and knocks the movie off-balance.'Woman in Gold' explores some interesting themes, the most notable being whether a victim of something as incomprehensibly horrific as the Holocaust can ever really achieve any kind of peace in this life or whether the wounds simply run too deep to ever really heal. The outcome of Maria's quest provides one answer, while the lovely coda with which Campbell chooses to end his film seems to provide another.Incidentally, 'Woman in Gold' might make an interesting double feature with 'The Monuments Men,' a lesser movie that, nevertheless, deals with some of the same subject matter as 'Woman in Gold.' But the latter is the far richer film.",7,0,2,7 May 2015
National Treasure," DaVinci Code lite
","For those who simply can't wait until 'The DaVinci Code' makes its way to the big screen, there's 'National Treasure' to serve as a sort of second hand substitute in the meantime. Like the Dan Brown bestseller, this is a wildly improbable caper tale set in the context of historical fiction.Nicholas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a man who has spent his whole adult life in pursuit of a treasure that he believes the Founding Fathers hid in the late 18th Century, a search that has obsessed and ruined the lives of his own forebears for generations. He is teamed with Ian (Sean Bean), a less savory fortune hunter who has no qualms about breaking the law or eliminating anyone who stands in the way of getting what he wants. When these two men become convinced that there is an invisible map leading to the treasure hidden on the back of the original Declaration of Independence, the highly-principled Ben opts to forego the treasure, while Ian decides to steal the priceless document. It is only when Ben realizes that he must steal the document in order to save it from Ian's diabolical clutches that he springs into action. From then on, it becomes a race against time, as Ben and his cohorts try to unearth the clues and crack the codes that lead to the treasure before Ian and his henchmen can do the same - all while being chased by FBI agents who are hot on his tail. Frankly, one would have thought that the Founding Fathers - what with a war to fight and a nation to found - would have had more important things to do with their time than devise all the elaborate plotting necessary to set up this search. But, apparently, one would have been wrong.The movie may be fine fun for 12-year-old boys of all ages, but the rest of us will find much of it cheesy and unconvincing. There's always a certain satisfaction that comes with watching stories like these - that of following the clues and then piecing together all the fragments to achieve the full picture - but 'National Treasure' is really only mildly diverting even in its best moments. Those generally come when we find ourselves at great historic sites such as Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Old North Church etc. Unfortunately, the dialogue is generally inane, and the acting - well, let's just say that's it's performances like this one that make it increasingly difficult to remember that Cage once walked off the stage clutching an Academy statuette for best actor in his hands. Too often the film feels juvenile and slapdash, especially in the romantic pairing of Cage and Diane Kruger, as a curator of the National Archives who reluctantly comes along for the ride.The Founding Fathers must be rolling over in their graves.",5,0,1,26 June 2005
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," The Birth of a Nation
","Ken Loach's 'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' is a stirring, beautifully realized film that chronicles Ireland's struggle for independence from English rule. The story is set in 1920, four years after the Easter Uprising, in which the citizens of this British-ruled isle unilaterally declared themselves to be a sovereign nation. To make that assertion a reality, bands of armed volunteers, calling themselves the Irish Republican Army, began fighting against the English troops who were suppressing, terrorizing and executing many Irish citizens during the time depicted in the movie. This war lasted from 1919-1921, resulting finally in a partitioned Ireland, consisting of an independent nation called the Irish Republic in the South and an area still voluntarily subject to British rule in the North.However, 'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' (which takes its title from an old Irish folk song) is less concerned with the politics of the situation than with the human cost of war. The events of the story are seen mainly through the eyes of a promising young doctor named Damien (played by the fine actor, Cillian Murphy), who is at first reluctant to join the guerillas, believing the British army to be just too well armed and too well manned to be successfully overcome by such a piddling, homegrown force as the IRA. However, after witnessing some particularly brutal treatment of his people by English soldiers, Damien gives up his promising career as a doctor to become a passionate, full-time warrior in the cause of independence and freedom.Writer Paul Laverty has constructed a simple, straightforward narrative that shows what life is like in a wartime setting. Damien understands that the cause he believes in so passionately is requiring him to commit acts he would never even dream of doing in a time of peace, including executing a boyhood friend of his for betraying him and his fellow fighters to the enemy. A war of freedom requires fortitude, sacrifice and courage from its participants, to be sure, but it also demands a part of their humanity as well. Damien soon learns that one often has to compromise one set of values in order to fulfill another. Laverty makes it plain that no one on either side of such a conflict will ever be able to live entirely at ease with his conscience even if the goal he is fighting for is eventually achieved. This is brought out with particular vividness in the second half of the film, after a treaty has been signed between England and Ireland, granting 'independence' to the latter, though with many unsavory strings attached. It is at this point that the rebel forces spilt into two diametrically opposed factions and engage in a civil war, with men who were just recently allies suddenly turning their weapons against one another. Indeed, the pro-treaty fighters begin utilizing the same tactics of torture and terror against the anti-treaty fighters that the British forces had once used against them. This leads to a heartrending and shattering conclusion that exemplifies the horrifying personal cost of just such a conflict.Through the character of Damien, Laverty and Loach turn what could have been a fascinating, if dry, history lesson into a deeply moving human drama that reminds us of the high price that often must be paid if future generations are to live in freedom.

How to Train Your Dragon," Superb on every level
","In this day and age when quality animated features are the rule rather than the exception, 'How to Train Your Dragon' still manages to beat all comers with its charm, imagination and honest sentiment.Based on the story by Cressida Cowell, the movie focuses on Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (Jay Baruchel), the scrawny young son of a Viking leader (Gerard Butler) who worries that his boy may not possess the mettle a true Viking warrior must have to smite the many dragons that periodically swoop in on the village to steal its food. It's not that Hiccup doesn't WANT to be a dragon-slayer; heck, he's even enrolled in a dragon-slaying course replete with real dragons for the students to practice their moves on. No, the problem is that Hiccup has met and made friends with an injured dragon in the wild (a beast he calls Toothless) and the lad soon discovers that dragons are not the natural-born enemies to Man that he and the other Vikings thought they were.Beyond its glorious visuals, eye-popping action sequences, and terrific voice-over work, 'How to Train Your Dragon,' written and directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, emerges as a surprisingly compelling human tale of a boy who wants desperately to live up to the high standards his demanding father has set for him, but who just can't betray his new-found best friend in order to do so. Without getting sappy about it, the movie provides fine moral lessons for the youngsters - though, one should point out that the intensity of the action scenes may prove a tad disturbing for the very littlest in the audience. Its soaring flight scenes are some of the best we've ever encountered in an animated movie, and its canny combination of humor, adventure and sentiment catapult it to the head of the class among recent animated films (along with 'Toy Story 3,' that is).",Null,0,0,31 July 2011
The Red Violin," ambitious, beautifully crafted tale
","'The Red Violin'  is a fine, beautifully crafted film that follows the life of a rare Italian violin as it bears witness to the lives of various unrelated people who come in contact with it throughout the centuries. Through these characters, we explore the universal human propensities for fear, passion, jealousy, love, greed, oppression and survival in even the most dire of circumstances. Like many anthology films, 'The Red Violin' loses some of its emotional force through the fact that the characters, by their very nature, cannot be fully developed and therefore tend a bit toward 'type'.  However, each segment is so lovingly created in terms of setting, costume and cinematography, that the viewer is drawn into the many worlds the film creates. The most impressive part of the film is the brilliant overlapping time structure that is remarkably complex and creates a tremendous amount of excitement and tension in the last half hour of the film when all the elements from the various narrative skeins are pulled together to reveal the whole picture.  In fact, the last half hour, in which the violin is restored and the man in charge (played by Samuel L. Jackson) must confront a moral dilemma, lifts the film to a plane far higher than one expects it to go. The surprise ending is also very brave for trusting the audience to accept a morally ambiguous resolution. All in all, this is a mighty impressive achievement.",8,1,1,6 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," flawed Kubrick opus
","Is it heresy or sacrilege to suggest at this late date - and particularly in light of his recent death -  that Stanley Kubrick's films have almost always been better at promising than delivering greatness?  Almost without exception, Kubrick's carefully crafted works have emerged as brilliantly clinical 'exercises' rather than fully involving works of timeless art. Audacious, visionary, always willing to push the envelope and challenge an audience to go where it may not want to - these are the hallmarks of Kubrick's directorial genius.  But, along with these virtues, comes a heavy list of counterweighing weaknesses that somehow distance an audience emotionally from what is occurring on the screen:  pretentiousness, laborious pacing, narrative choppiness, often static camerawork.  'Eyes Wide Shut' fits perfectly into this standard Kubrick mold.  Starting with a fascinating premise, Kubrick takes his audience into unexpected and challenging directions, yet fails to really cope with the complexities of the theme and make the audience care.  Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman portray a young, upwardly mobil couple, who live in New York City with their young daughter.  When Kidman, in one of the year's best scenes, reveals in a wrenching monologue that she has had serious thoughts of infidelity, Cruise discovers he can't cope with the visions this admission conjurs up.  Thus, he embarks on a sexual odyssey through the streets of the city which leads him into many bizarre and unexpected avenues of depravity including a club made up of the idle rich dressed in costumes and masks who stage orgies replete with secret passwords and portentous organ music.  The problem lies essentially with the Kubrick/Frederick Rafael screenplay which can't seem to connect these scenes of flamboyant nastiness with the theme that is at the film's core.  Cruise drifts into each of his adventures out of an understandable urge to experience this world of sexual perversity, but he seems to end up as a passive observer each time, with little or no revelation registered.  This concept - of examining the effect that even implied infidelity can have on relationship - is such a rich one that it becomes a shame to see it buried under these scenes of often extraneous ostentation.  Kubrick seems so enamored of his little 'visions' that they begin to dominate the proceedings and bury the theme and the characters. This weakness is reflected in the film's far too tidy resolution, which is thoroughly unconvincing from a psychological viewpoint and makes one wonder how Kubrick could linger so long over scenes with no purpose beyond the sensational yet take so little time with the one that truly matters.  Cruise and Kidman both turn in fine performances, but Sydney Pollack, as a wealthy friend who later in the film sets Cruise straight, hams it up shamelessly. The music is hauntingly effective and helps immeasureably to establish and sustain an atmosphere of portentous weirdness. The title 'Eyes Wide Shut' will not describe most people in the audience - Kubrick is too skilled at creating an always riveting visual motif for that - but, for me, it will serve as a lasting testament less to his genius than to his maddening inability to fulfill his always great promise.",6,2,6,29 July 1999
Sicario," Cinematically charged social drama
","Whether it's the limitless expanse of the Desert Southwest or the danger-filled streets of Ciudad Juarez as captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins, 'Sicario' is a film utterly attuned to the drama of its spaces - especially when, within those spaces, there is occurring an intractable drug war that threatens to lay waste to the land and the people on both sides of the U.S./Mexico border. Directed with brio and style and an unerring instinct for visual impact by Denis Villeneuve, 'Sicario' stars Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya as two FBI agents brought in to lend 'legitimacy' to a shady CIA operation headed by Josh Brolin. The ostensible goal is to bring the head of a Mexican drug cartel to justice, but could there be another, more personal reason for the mission - and exactly how far should two federal officers, sworn to uphold the law, be willing to go in overlooking some of the questionable means being used to achieve that end?The screenplay by Taylor Sheridan takes us to a dimly-lit world of bloody cartels and government malfeasance where morality is murky and all sorts of ethical lines are crossed in pursuit of some larger goal - be it 'justice' in a cosmic sense or just plain revenge for a wrong done and a personal loss suffered. Sheridan keeps not only Blunt and Kaluuya's characters in the dark much of the time but the audience as well, generating and sustaining an air of mystery and heightening the suspense.'Sicario' features excellent performances from its cast, with a special shout-out to Benicio del Toro as an enigmatic, shadowy figure whose role in the proceedings is initially unclear but who steps forward, in sometimes shocking ways, as a major player in the series of events as they play themselves out.'Sicario' is rare among American movies in that it refuses to provide the kind of neatly packaged conclusion we've come to expect from commercial enterprises, choosing instead to show that there are no easy solutions to complex problems and no happy endings for anyone involved in the messy, violent business we euphemistically call 'the war on drugs.'",8,0,1,7 April 2017
Inside Man," disappointing entry by Lee
","Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' is probably the most commercially viable and least cutting-edge film the maverick director has ever made. I wouldn't exactly call it a sellout - Lee is as entitled as anyone else to make money off his projects - but it is a bit disheartening seeing Lee aiming his sights and his estimable talents as low as he has here.'Inside Man' starts out like a dozen other bank robbery tales, with a gang of masked gunmen storming into the establishment and turning the terrified customers and employees into ready-made hostages, then hunkering down for a prolonged standoff with the law enforcement officials outside. Denzel Washington plays the hostage negotiator whose job it is to bring the perpetrators to justice with a minimal loss of innocent life.The movie deserves credit for bringing a few novel twists to the storyline, but, frankly, most of what happens in this film simply defies credibility. We don't believe for a moment the goings-on here. Despite a 'surprise' ending and a plethora of Lee's trademark cinematic flourishes, we leave the movie shrugging our shoulders uttering, 'Is that all there is?' Washington does the best he can with a halfheartedly written character, but Clive Owen, Willem Dafoe and the ubiquitous Christopher Plummer aren't given much to do in their various roles. Only Jodie Foster - playing a ruthless real estate agent inexplicably brought in to assist in the case - seems to be having any fun at all with the film. She brings a much needed note of high-spirited camp to a movie that really doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.'Dog Day Afternoon' this ain't.",5,4,8,4 May 2006
"McFarland, USA"," Predictable but manages to hit most of the right notes
","We all know the drill by now: a teacher, usually white (the one exception seems to be Sidney Poitier in 'To Sir With Love'), is sent to teach in a tough, predominately minority high school, filled with troubled teens and burned-out faculty members. At first, the hapless newbie is met with bemusement and resistance from the recalcitrant students, but, eventually, said teacher ultimately earns the trust and respect of all, often leading the kids and their school onto victory and glory in some sort of high-stakes contest (sporting event or whiz-kid competition, preferably). The granddaddy of them all, 1955's 'The Blackboard Jungle,' established the blueprint that all the others that have come after it have felt obliged to follow. Indeed, the narrative arc is so familiar to us by now that only the names, places and specific details offer anything in the way of novelty.Enter 'McFarland, USA,' the umpteenth version of the above scenario, this one featuring Kevin Costner as Jim White, a real life PE teacher/football coach who, out of desperation, takes a position at a high school in an impoverished farm community near Bakersfield, California circa 1987. The population of the town is composed almost exclusively of first and second generation Hispanic immigrants, mostly pickers, leaving White, his wife (Maria Bello) and their two young daughters ('Homeland's' Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) feeling a bit like fish-out-of-water in their new home.When he discovers that several young men in his PE class are phenomenal runners, Mr. White decides to start a cross country team at the school, bucking a skeptical principal, school board and rival teams every step of the way - not to mention straightening out the various personal and familial problems of the boys on his team (as well as coping with his own inadequacies as a father to his teenage daughter). Yet, after some early setbacks competing against a series of snooty white schoolsah well, you get the picture. And, of course, there's the inevitable offer of a position at a 'better' school, leaving White with the dilemma of either leaving his charges in the lurch or staying on for the long haul.The thing is, though, that, while it would be easy to dismiss 'McFarland USA' for its lack of freshness and originality, formulas are formulas for a reason, I suppose, and that is because they work. So, while you can resist it all you want, in the end you'll probably find yourself cheering on the boys as they cross the finish line, just as you'll be championing Mr. White for his ability to lead and inspire his charges both on the field and off. In short, though your brain may be looking for ways to reject 'McFarland USA,' your heart will be telling you to let it in. It's pretty easy to predict which will emerge victorious in that battle.Nobody does the inspirational phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes bit better than Costner, and he is backed by a first-rate cast of young performers (Carlos Pratts, Johnny Ortiz, Rafael Martinez, Hector Duran, Sergio Avelar, Michael Aguero) who exude both naturalism and charm in their roles as disadvantaged youth who find meaning and pride in personal accomplishment and camaraderie. The movie also does a nice job showing how the bridges between various cultures are best built on the willingness to suspend preconceived judgments and to be open to new experiences.",7,5,6,13 September 2015
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," entertaining, high energy crime comedy
","'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a fun, highspirited and ingeniously plotted caper film from the 'good crooks vs. bad crooks' school of crime drama.  This British comedy plunges us into a dizzying maelstrom of doublecrossing petty thieves, drug dealers, gamblers and assorted other criminal lowlifes whose paths cross in the streets and alleyways of London in clever and often fatal ways.The complex plot almost defies description.  Suffice it to say the film focuses on a quartet of likable smalltime hoodlums who amass a decent stake from the fencing of stolen property and  decide to risk it all on a high stakes card game with a notorious gangster named Henry, who has rigged the game, unbeknownst to Eddie, the cardsharp of the group.  When Eddie loses the money, the stage is set for a wild series of plots, counterplots, crosses and double crosses, all executed by writer/director Guy Ritchie with a refreshing cinematic flair that includes frenetic pacing and editing, clever use of slow and fast motion photography, and barely perceptible freeze framing, all backed up by a dynamic score humming along on the soundtrack.As a writer, Ritchie fills the screen with a delighful gallery of eccentric, offbeat and slightly off-kilter characters.  These are all too numerous to mention, but special note should be taken of Henry's chief henchman, Chris, who politely scolds  his young son and partner in crime for his use of unseemly language as he bashes the brains out of one of Henry's delinquent customers or insists on his buckling up for safety as they take off on one of their wild rides through ths crime-infested streets of London.Despite it's '90's level of graphic violence, the film strikes echoes of classic British crime comedies of the gentler 1950's.  It reminds one, in fact, of 'The Ladykillers', wherein the bad crooks manage to eliminate each other through a maze of comic misunderstandings, leaving the 'good' crooks thoughtfully untouched. Not that they don't learn their lesson, though, for, in the high stakes world of doubledealing criminals, our heroes discover that it takes a ruthless old pro to ultimately come out on top.  And that's as it should be in the world of crime drama.",8,0,0,13 August 1999
Les Misérables," Well worth the wait
","The long-delayed movie version of the stage musical 'Les Miserables' has finally arrived - and the good news is that it is well worth the wait. For the film hearkens back to those glory days when musicals were massively-scaled, big-time events, and when all involved in their making wore their hearts unashamedly on their sleeves for all to see. 'Les Miz' is, of course, based on the beloved Victor Hugo novel about the hardened convict, Jean Valjean, who devotes his life to helping others after a kind bishop shows him compassion and forgiveness at the darkest moment of his life. Through the course of the story, Valjean touches the lives of many people, but none so significantly as those of Fantine, the waiflike prostitute who has fallen on desperate times, and her daughter Cosette, whom Valjean dedicates his life to raising after her mother's death. Valjean's main antagonist is Inspector Javert, an unyielding stickler for the law who has made it his life's mission to bring what he sees as a flagrant lawbreaker to justice, unmoved by all the good Valjean has done.With its vast array of larger-than-life figures, its melodramatic plotting, romantic flourishes and great themes of legal vs. natural law and the possibility of personal redemption - all set against the backdrop of sweeping social injustice in 19th Century France -'Les Miz' was obviously ideal material for composer Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyricist Alain Boublil ( with English translation by Herbert Kretzmer) to work with. In fact, so rich is the vein they're mining here that 'Les Miz' is closer to operetta than it is to those musicals of a bygone era, with very little spoken dialogue throughout the course of the movie. And this brings us to one of the minor quibbles I have with the film and with the show as a whole.For if there is a weakness to the film, it is probably the result of two factors: the inevitable difficulties inherent in trying to cram a 1200-page novel into a two-and-a-half-hour film, and the fact that the movie is entirely sung. The result of both of these limitations is that we lose some of the connective tissue that provides the characters' motivations. The story tends to move in fits and starts and lacks the cohesive flow that at least some dialogue might have provided. The constant singing also prevents the characters from engaging one another in conversation, which would help to clarify some of the finer details of the plot. For instance, we don't get a sense of why Valjean is so beloved as mayor of his town (he showed them how to manufacture jewelry more quickly and economically, thereby saving the community from ruin). We're also deprived of the intense back-and-forth struggle between Valjean and Javert for Fantine's soul. Moreover, Valjean's moment of great self-sacrifice, when he turns himself into the court to save the man falsely accused of being him, goes by so fast that many people, unfamiliar with the story, may not even understand fully what's going on there. Even worse, Cosette and Marius, the impulsive revolutionary who becomes the young girl's love interest, aren't even allowed a moment of communication before they're pledging undying devotion to one another in verse. Yet, even with these flaws, 'Les Miz' is a tremendously moving and uplifting experience, unabashed in its sentimentality. Much has been made of the fact that the singing was recorded live on set, a breakthrough that does indeed add a quality of immediacy to the production, even if the soundtrack will probably suffer in comparison to one of the many stage recordings that have been released over the decades. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway do a particularly fine job in the singing department, with only Russell Crowe as Javert failing to rise to the challenge to any appreciable extent. And there are many scenes, particularly in the second half, that are positively transporting: a poignant Hathaway nailing 'I Dreamed a Dream,' Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne singing 'In My Life,' Samantha Banks as Eponine performing 'On My Own,' Redmayne singing the heartbreaking 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,' the whole cast joining in on 'One Day More' (the show's homage to 'The Quintet' from 'West Side Story'), and the chorus performing the majestic 'Do You Hear the People Sing?' which can't help but lift your heart into your throat. And indeed your heart will be lodged there through significant portions of this movie.Tom Hooper ('The King's Speech') has directed the film largely as a succession of close-ups, which does deprive us of a sense of spatial geography from time to time but which helps to enhance the operatic nature of the piece. And, oddly for a musical, there is no choreography to speak of, just as there wasn't in the stage production. For compensation, we have Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter having the time of their professional lives portraying the campy, comic-relief villains, the Thenardiers.Let's just hope that the making of 'Les Miserables,' and the audience's clear appreciation of it, will finally bring back the old-fashioned movie musical. It's been far too long.",9,2,4,17 February 2013
The Da Vinci Code," better than many critics have given it credit for
","From the way the critics have gone after 'The Da Vinci Code,' you'd think that Ron Howard himself had been jealously guarding the location of the Holy Grail all these years and was just now revealing it to all the world for his own nefarious (i.e. commercial) purposes. Actually, despite all the critical hostility and rancor, this turns out to be a reasonably entertaining adaptation of a reasonably entertaining novel, far from a classic or a work of art, but hardly the pile of cinematic refuse so many of the reviewers have led us to believe it is.As a work of history, the novel is a passel of nonsense, and only those with a bent towards conspiracy theory overload would be foolish enough to believe a minute of it. But as a work of imaginative fiction, 'The Da Vinci Code' certainly gives its audience the neck-twisting workout they've paid good money to receive.It would be pointless to reiterate the plot of a novel that has probably had the biggest readership of any literary work since 'Gone With the Wind.' Suffice it to say that a mysterious murder in the Louvre sends a Harvard symbologist and the dead man's granddaughter on a clue-driven search for the famed Holy Grail. Along the way, the two uncover a grand conspiracy on the part of a renegade Catholic order to protect a secret that, if it were revealed, could shake the whole of Western civilization down to its very foundations.Despite the phenomenal - one is tempted to say 'unprecedented' - commercial success of his work, Dan Brown is no great shakes as a writer; his characters are, almost without exception, drab and two-dimensional, and his dialogue, when it isn't being overly explicit in pouring out explanations, sounds like it was written by a first-year student in a Writer's 101 workshop. But the one undeniable talent Brown does have is his ability to knit together a preposterously complex web of codes and clues into an airtight tapestry, and to make it all convincing.The movie is very faithful to the novel in this respect. It moves quickly from location to location, never giving us too much time to question the logic (or illogic) of the narrative or to examine the many gaping plot holes in any great detail. Writer Akiva Goldsman has encountered his greatest trouble in the scenes in which the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters can lay out in laborious detail the elaborate story behind the clues. Yet, this is as much the fault of the nature and design of the novel as it is of the man given the unenviable task of bringing it to the screen. Moreover, perhaps in the interest of time and keeping the action flowing, Robert and Sophie come up with solutions to the myriad riddles much too quickly and accurately, with a 'Golly, gee, could it mean_______?' attitude that borders on the ludicrous. But, somehow, Howard makes most of it work. Perhaps, it's the clunky literal-minded earnestness with which he approaches the subject that ultimately allows us to buy into it against our better judgment.Tom Hanks is stolid and passive as Dr. Robert Langdon, the college professor involuntarily driven into all this cloak-and-dagger intrigue, but Audrey Tautou has a certain subtle charm as Sophie, the woman who may play more of a part in the unraveling of the mystery than even she herself can imagine. Jean Reno and Paul Bettany have their moments as two of the less savory players in the story, but it is Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on all things related to the Holy Grail, who walks off with the film. His scenery-chewing shtick pumps some much needed life into a tale essentially populated by underdeveloped stick figures.The religious controversy surrounding both the novel and the film is as ludicrous as it is unjustified. Anyone whose belief system could be seriously shaken by this absurd mixture of unsubstantiated myth-making and plain old-fashioned wild speculation couldn't have had a very solid foundation of faith to begin with.The rest of us can appreciate 'The Da Vinci Code' for what it is, an overblown but epic exercise in code-busting and clue-decoding - in short, the 'Gone With the Wind' of whodunits.",7,74,111,5 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," starts off well but can't sustain itself
","I must admit right up front that I have never read the J.K. Rowling novel on which `Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone' is based.  As a result, I come to the movie `cold' as it were, being neither a full-fledged aficionado nor an inveterate denigrator of this phenomenally popular book series that, in the past few years, has taken the literary world by storm.  Thus, I will not be able to say to what degree Chris Columbus' handsomely designed film adaptation does or does not do justice to its source.  All I can say is how the film struck someone like myself who comes to the material fresh and without expectations of any kind. Well, the verdict, I must say, is a decidedly mixed one, so please allow me to elaborate.Let me state, at the outset, that the movie starts off splendidly.   We are introduced to the infant Harry Potter as he is mysteriously dropped off one night at the home of his maternal aunt and uncle in suburban England.  We quickly move ahead in time to find Harry, now aged 11, living a sort of male Cinderella existence, mistreated and overlooked by both his surrogate parents and Harry's precocious, spoiled brat cousin, appropriately named Dudley.  In the early stretches, the film does a superb job subtly injecting the excitement of magic into a real world setting.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor as Harry begins to slowly awaken to the fact that he has these strange and inexplicable powers to manipulate the elements of his world to his own advantage.  The film retains its spirit of fun as Harry, led by the mysterious but lovably burly Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid, journeys to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the tools of the trade towards which his eccentric destiny is leading him (his parents were also witches, killed by the evil wizard, Voldemort, who obviously has designs on Potter himself).  The preparations for Harry's enrollment in school (i.e. purchasing a magic wand) and the attempt to find his way to this magic hidden land are executed with fine, deft strokes, and Columbus keeps the movie blithely bouncing along at just the right momentum and speed.  Harry's introduction to the school itself is well done as well, as he meets an assortment of colorful characters (both faculty members and schoolmates) and boggles at the amusement park-like atmosphere he finds there, with an imaginative surprise seemingly lurking around ever corner.Yet not too long after we hit the school, something seems to go out of `Harry Potter.'  Perhaps the anticipation raised by the first half of the film leads us to expect too much, but, if the truth be told, the storytellers don't seem to have thought much about what to do with Harry once they get him to his destination.   Though we like Potter's two chums, Ron and Hermione, and a number of the faculty members, the adventures Harry ends up encountering while at the school seem rather tame, bland and ordinary when you get right down to it.  The monsters the writers have dreamed up for him to conquer aren't particularly interesting or intriguing and the plotting itself lacks excitement and suspense.  In fact, structurally, the film seems more like a series of elaborate set pieces designed more to show off the special effects than to provide a unified narrative that builds and grows to a cumulative impact.  Even worse is that much of the ribald humor of the earlier part disappears as well.  Had more of that dry British wit we are treated to in the initial stages been carried all the way through the film, `Harry Potter' might not have come across as quite so flat and attenuated as it does.On the positive side, Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance as Harry, capturing the innate goodness, wide-eyed innocence, and no-nonsense practicality of the character he's been called upon to play.  He makes of Harry a very real, very recognizable and very likable young boy.  Radcliffe is more than matched in performance by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, Harry's two finely drawn companions in adventure.  It's a pleasure, too, to see the wonderful Maggie Smith doing her Miss Jean Brodie bit again after all these years.  No one can convey the brittle starchiness of the English schoolmarm better than she.`Harry Potter' is also a beautiful looking film, thanks to outstanding cinematography, production design and art direction.So there you have it:  as I said earlier, a decidedly mixed bag of virtues and drawbacks.  Those already enamored of little Harry Potter will probably balk at my carping.  Those already driven mad by Potter-mania may think I am too indulgent in my overall assessment.   But for one who feels little personal stake in the Harry Potter deification/demonization battle, I must say that this is a pretty good film that, I suspect, could have been much better.",Null,1,3,4 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," another fine installment
","In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,' the fourth installment in the perennially popular series by J. K. Rowling, the young wizards seem to have a bit more on their minds than just flying around on broomsticks and casting spells. For along with puberty come activated hormones and a sudden burgeoning interest in the opposite sex. This brings a nice grown-up dimension to a series that continues to enchant young and old alike with its constantly renewing creativity and imagination.All, however, is not puppy love romance and fancy dress balls, for there is still the serious business of wizardry to be done at Hogwarts Academy. In this edition, Harry is compelled to take part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a sort of Olympic Games for magicians that is so intense that it has resulted in the deaths of a few of the participants in the past. In order to win the prize of the goblet of fire, the contestant must face three challenges - a battle with dragons, an underwater rescue of some kidnapped friends, and a trip through an elaborate maze, with the goal in each case being the capturing of a mysterious giant egg. At the base of the contest lies the evil Lord Voldemort (a creepy Ralph Fiennes), who is, as always, trying to eliminate young Mr. Potter by any means necessary.Although a bit long at two hours and thirty-six minutes, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' still manages to breathe new life into a franchise that should by all rights be turning pretty stale by now. It does so partly through some really fine set pieces - i.e. the challenges - partly through the high flying imaginativeness of so much of the storyline, partly through the endearing relationships among the various characters, and partly through the performance of Daniel Radcliffe, who keeps Harry Potter lifelike, compelling and interesting as an everyman hero. The tone is also remarkably dark in the later stretches of the film, as is befitting the advancing ages of the characters, although very young children might find some of the scenes a trifle disturbing, so be forewarned.Filled with beautiful images and dazzling special effects, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is another worthy addition to a series that is fast becoming a modern day classic in its own right.",7,0,1,22 May 2006
The Happening," ain't much happening here
","End-of-the-world scenarios have become such a cottage industry in recent years that M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Happening' can't help but feel like a straggler to a party that's already begun winding down. In this case, the apocalyptic horseman comes in the form of a strange natural phenomenon which causes people to engage in mass suicides. The usually reliable - but here way too over-earnest - Mark Wahlberg plays a high school science teacher who flees with his wife and the daughter of a friend from their home in New York City (where the plague begins) to a remote area of western Pennsylvania.As always, Shyamalan relies on subtlety and indirection rather than explicit violence and over-the-top special effects to achieve his thrills. Yet, while there is a certain undeniable creepiness to some of the film, 'The Happening' ultimately comes a cropper through annoying performances, lackluster storytelling, dopey dialogue and more laugh-out-loud moments than any ostensibly serious horror film should ever have to put up with. It also doesn't help that 'The Happening' feels like so many other recent movies that have come before it ('War of the Worlds,' 'I Am Legend,' 'Cloverfield,' the '28 Day' series etc.) or that it pales in comparison to the much livelier, intentionally funny 'The Signal' (albeit, in that film, the afflicted individuals were killing other people rather than themselves, making them a bit more of an actual threat).As seems to be the case with Shyamalan's most recent output, one winds up admiring 'The Happening' much more than one likes it.",5,3,7,16 February 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," decent sequel
","By combining groundbreaking special effects with a heavy dose of religious symbolism and allegory, the original `Matrix' (1999) quickly became a cult classic, generating a legion of fanatical followers almost immediately upon its release (films often have to wait many years to attain a cult following, but `The Matrix' did not).   More than just a movie to many of its fans, `The Matrix' has become something of a religious icon, an object to be studied over, memorized and worshipped by the faithful as if its text were some sort of pop culture, New Age scripture and its creators the enlightened gurus of our technological time.In `The Matrix Reloaded,' Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, the Messiah/Christ figure set apart to help overthrow the massive computer program that has taken over the world.  The many allusions to the Bible and Greek mythology - particularly in the names assigned to various characters and places in the film - are really only window dressing for all the eye-popping CGI effects that are the true justification for the film's existence.  And, indeed, the special effects are mighty impressive, a quantum leap over those in the original film, but all this technical wizardry does come with a bit of a price.  Some of the action scenes are so over-the-top in fashion and style that they actually end up draining the film of much of its inherent suspense.  When characters can do ANYTHING and get away with it - defying all laws of physics and gravity in the process - then they lose that quality of vulnerability that makes the audience care.  We watch these sequences, dazzled by their brilliance, yet we do so as detached outsiders and not the insiders we would be if the characters' lives seemed more threatened. Perhaps a few more ground rules - i.e. who can be hurt and how - would be in order to take care of this problem.Despite that flaw, and despite the fact that the sequel lacks the sense of unraveling mystery we found in the original, the Wachowski Brothers deserve credit for churning out an enjoyable big budget action film that at least tries to create an interesting world and doesn't just settle for tired old stereotypes and clichÃ©s.  Special praise must go to the art directors who have done a spectacular job visualizing the city of Zion, home base to the resistance forces who are hell bent on defeating the evil machines that have reduced humanity to a perpetual dream state located inside a computer mainframe.  We will even forgive the filmmakers for turning Zion - however briefly - into a giant milling mosh pit early on in the film.  The idea of machines taking over and crushing our humanity has been a staple of science fiction ever since the dawn of the industrial age.  Still, `The Matrix' movies have found a clever way to tap into our specific paranoia related to the cyber world in which we find ourselves living.Although `The Matrix Unloaded' is an entertaining film in its own right, anyone unfamiliar with the original will most likely be totally confused by the action on the screen, since very little attempt is made to explain the intricacies of the plot to the uninitiated.  As a result, anyone who dares venture forth to see this second installment without intimate knowledge of the first had best beware.To be continued.",Null,0,2,7 July 2003
Mystic River," Falls sort of greatness but superb nonetheless
","Lovers of great acting had best not pass up 'Mystic River,' Clint Eastwood's powerful, award-laden adaptation of Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon play three working class Bostonians forever bound together by a mutual childhood tragedy that has since gone on to define the kind of people they've become and the kind of lives they've led. The film begins with a brief prologue as we see the three youngsters - Jimmy, Sean and Dave - out playing in the street one day, when they are confronted by a pedophile who, posing as a policeman, tricks one of them, Dave, into getting into the car with him and another man. Fast forward to the present as we pick up the trio as grown men who have, for all intents and purposes, gone their separate ways. Penn is Jimmy Markum, a former petty thief who spent two years in the slammer but who has since turned straight and now owns a neighborhood liquor store. When Jimmy's daughter from his first marriage turns up murdered, the three men's lives intersect in ways they could never have imagined. Bacon is Sean Divine, a homicide detective assigned to the case, and Robbins is Dave Boyle, a sporadically employed man who may be a prime suspect in the murder. Dave still lives with the trauma of that earlier soul-shattering experience, while Jimmy and Sean wrestle with why they managed to escape the cruel finger of fate that pointed so grimly at their hapless playmate. The film is about how the events of our early lives (and, in the case of Jimmy, it doesn't stop at this one incident) can end up coming back to haunt us later down the road.The Brian Helgeland screenplay makes the pain that each of these men experiences vivid and palpable. The grief Jimmy feels over the loss of his beloved child, the psychological torment Dave suffers as a result of his abuse, and the bewilderment and loneliness Sean experiences from a failed marriage all become integral to this dark tale of bitterness, revenge and attempted healing. At times, we do find ourselves wishing that the script would concentrate less on the details of the murder investigation and more on the inner workings of the three main characters. Too often we feel as if we are only scratching the surface of the roiling psychological torment taking place deep in the bowels of these men. The plotting, particularly towards the end, often feels more contrived than it needs to be, with heavy-handed ironies and obtruding parallelisms that don't seem to know when to leave well enough alone. Laura Linney, as Jimmy's second wife, has a key Lady Macbeth moment late in the film that might have been effective had we been more fully prepared for it and had her character been more thoroughly developed throughout the course of the film. As it is, the scene seems to come out of nowhere and leaves us both bewildered and hanging.Still, these are minor quibbles when it comes to a movie as finely acted and directed as this one is. Penn hits all the right notes as a man facing the worst experience life could possibly throw at a person - the murder of one's child - trying to make sense of a tragedy that defies any rational explanation. Robbins beautifully underplays the role of a man scarred forever by what happened to him in his youth, now endeavoring to function as an adult when he was robbed of any semblance of a childhood. Bacon is excellent as the man who attempts to put all the pieces together, not only of the case but of the shattered lives he and his two buddies have been living all these years, and Marcia Gay Harden is outstanding as Dave's loving wife who struggles with what is perhaps the greatest moral dilemma faced by any character in the movie. Linney, Lawrence Fishburne and Tom Guiry offer fine supporting performances.As director, Eastwood allows his superb cast ample time to develop their characters, never hurrying the proceedings along and always allowing the conversations to play themselves out. He recognizes the quality of the material and feels no need to gussy it up with self-conscious camera angles or fancy editing. He also uses the bleak settings of blue collar Boston as an effective backdrop to the stark, chilly tale he is telling.Perhaps it is just an odd coincidence that three of the very best movies of 2003 - '21 Grams,' 'The House of Sand and Fog' and 'Mystic River' - all suffer from the same tendency on the part of the filmmakers to move away from reality and towards melodrama and contrivance in the final act. Of the three, '21 Grams' and 'The House of Sand and Fog' are harmed less by this than 'Mystic River' because they have a somewhat deeper thematic base and richer character development than does the Eastwood film. Still, 'Mystic River' is a mighty impressive achievement for those who made it and a rich, memorable experience for those who see it.",Null,233,311,30 November 2004
Enemy at the Gates," good war picture
","Jean-Jacques Annaud's `Enemy at the Gates' opens with an extended sequence depicting the 1942 Siege of Stalingrad that is almost as impressive, in its size, scope and battleground realism, as the Normandy Invasion scene in `Saving Private Ryan.'  Although `Enemy at the Gates' never again returns to this level of greatness, it does emerge as a pretty decent war movie, nonetheless.  The film is based on the true story of a Soviet marksman, Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev, who finds himself - as much through fate and the efforts of an officer friend of his as through any act of bravery on his own part - suddenly thrust to the forefront as a national hero, a position created to bolster the fading morale of the Russian troops who are, at that moment, being mercilessly pounded by the Nazi war machine.  So famous  and, thus, so much a threat to Nazi security - has Vassili become, that the Germans have even sent their greatest sniper, Major Konig, to find and dispatch him.Thus, the film becomes at times a fascinating depiction of a cat-and-mouse duel of wits between two evenly matched antagonists both bent on the same outcome.  Ed Harris plays Konig with all the steely-eyed intensity of a bloodthirsty killer, as much driven by his need for personal triumph as his love of the greater cause.  In contrast, Vassili is portrayed as an almost reluctant hero, a man who would gladly relinquish the burden placed on him if circumstances could be different.  Part of the fascination of his character rests in the struggle Vassili undergoes as he tries to reconcile the heroic image of himself as portrayed in the newspapers with the all-too-human man of flesh and blood he knows himself to be.  Jude Law, despite his grating and wholly anachronistic English accent, underplays his role nicely, as does Joseph Fiennes, as Commissar Danilov, the Marxist idealist who comes up with the plan of turning Vassili's acts into the stuff of legend.  In addition to covering an aspect of World War II that has long gone untouched by moviemakers until now, `Enemy at the Gates' provides us with an interesting plot - even though, at 130 minutes, it does tend to fall into a dramatic monotony every now and then.  Furthermore, the film is saddled with a romantic triangle of such surpassing banality that it threatens to reduce the movie in the final scenes to as great a pile of rubble as those we see so skillfully created by the set designer.  Speaking of which, the single greatest element of this film is clearly its meticulously mounted imagery of both chaotic battle scenes and the burned out remains of a devastated war torn city.  Kudos go out to all the film's technical people, its production designer, art directors, set decorator, editors, cinematographer, special effects technicians etc.  They have done a truly monumental job on this film.  Only James Horner's score turns out to be a bit problematic, since the first ten or so notes of the recurring main theme sound exactly like John Williams' work from `Schindler's List.' Yet, `Enemy at the Gates,' though not a perfect film, has much to offer in terms of its plot, its performances and, above all, its grand visual style. For that last aspect alone, the film should not be missed.",Null,1,2,12 August 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," uneven but generally entertaining film
","2001's `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' the first in the series of films based on the J.K Rowling novels, had a strong first half and a weak second.  The follow-up feature, `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' reverses that formula, actually becoming better as the movie goes on.  In this new film, we miss that air of freshness and novelty  as well as the wit - that came with the getting-to-know-you opening section of `Sorcerer's Stone.'  As compensation, `Chamber of Secrets' offers a better overall storyline and a greater sense of mystery.Devotees of the novels will require no plot iteration here.  Suffice it to say that, in this installment, Harry becomes involved with unearthing the deep dark secret that has the whole Hogwarts Academy in an uproar - a secret involving a mysterious hidden chamber, the death of a student 50 years previous, and an assortment of creatures and monsters that Harry must battle in order to save the school and everyone in it.  This film appears to be far darker in tone than the original, so much so that one wonders if very young children might not be unduly disturbed by some of the proceedings.  For adults, the darkness may make the whole thing a little less cutesy and a little more palatable than the first time around.  Once again, director Chris Columbus has gathered a veritable who's-who of wonderful British performers to flesh out his enormous gallery of characters.  Of the seasoned veterans, the late Richard Harris (in what turns out to be his final screen appearance in fact) brings a quiet dignity to the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and Maggie Smith provides just the proper balance of humanity and stiff-upper-lipped starchiness in the part of Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.  Kenneth Branagh, cut loose from his Shakespearean shackles, seems to be having the time of his life, hamming it up as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a vain charlatan who makes the Wizard of Oz look like the soul of veracity.  Of the neophytes, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are still wonderful as Harry and his buddy, Ronald, but, alas, Emma Watson's role as the spunky Hermione has been sadly minimized in this story for she seems to be off screen more often than not during much of this movie's action.   That's a real shame.In the special effects department, `Chamber of Secrets' does a first-rate job bringing much of the story's magic to life on the screen.  The superb art direction and set design help to create an entire world where witchcraft and sorcery are commonplace occurrences.  Cinematographer Roger Platt brings a nice burnished glow to the film's look, particularly in the castle interiors, which always seem to be lit by soft candlelight.   John Williams' musical score never hits the heights of his great works (`The Empire Strikes Back,' `E.T.' etc.), but it is adequate to the task at hand.`Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' won't exactly carry you away in the way that the great fantasy films invariably do, but it does make for a couple of diverting hours nonetheless.  Considering what else is out there at the moment, that may be the highest praise one can offer.",Null,0,0,15 December 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," takes awhile to find its footing but delivers the goods
","In 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie make love with blows and bullets rather than with hearts and flowers. Could this be the new paradigm for romance for the 21st Century? Pitt and Jolie portray a couple whose marriage, after six years, has become so boring and routine that they have literally nothing left to say to one another. This despite the fact that both lead extraordinary double lives as secret agents - so secret, in fact, that neither of them knows that the other is really a hired assassin working for a rival company. When the truth finally comes out, the film turns into a sort of James Bond version of 'The War of the Roses,' with both parties devising ever more elaborate ways to rub one another out. However, the equation changes a bit when they discover that they have both been targeted for assassination by their respective agencies who fear that having two married spies from opposing camps might result in a serious conflict of interest for both sides. Soon, John and Jane come to realize that there's nothing like shooting it out with a common enemy to put a little zing back into a marriage.Written by Simon Kinberg and directed by Doug Liman, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is a clever, stylish dark comedy jerry-built out of equal parts star power, high concept cleverness and cartoon violence. Although the actors sometimes seem to be having a better time doing their thing on screen than we in the audience are having watching them do it, the fact remains that 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' after a somewhat faltering start, catches us up in its skewed view of marital relations gone wild. For the more threatened and knee-deep in danger and trouble the two of them get, the more they begin to communicate and reconnect as lovers - proving, I suppose, that two people can indeed make both love AND war despite what the slogan says. Most of the humor, in fact, is generated by the incongruity that arises from hearing them air their marital grievances against the backdrop of life-threatening gunplay and explosions. Who ever would have thought that facing death under a hail of bullets could be a more effective form of marital therapy than conventional counseling? As the bickering couple, Pitt and Jolie achieve a genuine romantic chemistry on screen, hitting just the right note of urbane sophistication and sly detachment necessary for what is, essentially, a slick, post-modernist comedy for star struck audiences. Both are suave, laid-back and utterly unflappable in their presence and demeanor, as befits the tone of the film. My only complaint is that the gun battles do go on a bit long at times and the film does have some trouble finding its footing at the beginning. But once the elements finally come together at about the midway point, the film turns into a cool and relaxing summertime entertainment.",6,1,4,14 July 2005
The Departed," a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas
","In Martin Scorcese's 'The Departed,' Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling 'moles' working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law. Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a 'rat' planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations. The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick 'Infernal Affairs,' finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence. In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director. Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, 'The Departed' falls short of the 'Goodfellas' glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion. In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles. Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don't mind watching it yet another time. The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion. There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side. One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film's success.Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in 'The Departed' - a kind of unity and focus that turned 'Goodfellas' into an instant classic of the gangster film genre. The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art. The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in 'The Verdict'). The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against 'Goodfellas.' Moreover, even the violence in 'The Departed' is handled much less effectively than it was in 'Goodfellas.' In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in 'The Departed,' the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to 'Goodfellas,' a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film-making. It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product. A good film but not a great one.",7,4,6,22 February 2007
Glory Road," conventional but entertaining sports flick
","'Glory Road' tells the true story of Don Haskins, the basketball coach for Western Texas College, who in the mid 1960's, broke the color barrier in the NCAA by being the first to feature a majority of black players on his team. The movie chronicles the obstacles he and his players faced, as well as their ultimate triumph when the team won the national championship in 1966.'Glory Road' worships at the altar of just about every underdog-sports-movie cliché one can imagine, yet the viewer can't help getting caught up in its story anyway. The scenes in the first half of the movie definitely have a familiar ring to them, as we see the coach first alienating his players with his hardnosed tactics, then winning them over by building comradeship and showing them how much they can accomplish when they work together as a team rather than as individuals. However, as with 'Remember the Titans,' 'Glory Road' is more interested in examining the social background of its time period than in merely telling yet another sports-oriented David and Goliath tale. The second half of the film concentrates more on the overt racism the team members face and the surprising courage they and their coach demonstrate in confronting it (could this really be set a mere 40 years ago?). The young actors are uniformly excellent, but it is Josh Lucas as Coach Haskins who delivers the powerhouse performance here. And director James Gartner manages to keep the film moving at a fast clip, never allowing it to get bogged down in message-mongering or overt preachiness.Almost in spite of itself, 'Glory Road' turns into a genuinely inspiring story about courage and determination in the face of societal pressure and incalculable odds. And that's pretty much what sports stories, familiar though they might be, are really all about.",7,28,34,9 March 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," Impressive re-creation of recent history
","'Zero Dark Thirty' chronicles one of the greatest successful manhunts of all time - the one that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on May 1, 2011. With a screenplay by Mark Boal and direction by Kathryn Bigelow, the movie provides a methodical, step-by-step re- enactment of the decade-long hunt as seen through the eyes of Maya Lambert, a fictional CIA analyst who is actually a composite of several female analysts who played key roles in locating the ever-elusive al Qaeda leader. Much has been made of the fact that the movie seemingly endorses the view that the use of torture led to the discovery of bin Laden's whereabouts. This assertion caused such a controversy at the time of the movie's release that many felt it ultimately hurt its chances of walking home with the Best Picture Oscar that year. In all fairness to the movie makers, however, the film actually doesn't seem to be making that case, since the scenes early on depicting torture all lead to eventual dead ends, while the piece of information that initially sets the investigators onto the right path clearly comes much later, after torture is no longer being used as a tactic. Yet, had the filmmakers NOT shown torture being used in the early stretches of the film - which take place not too long after 9/11 - they would not have been truthful to the times in which the story is set.But it is as a drama that we must ultimately judge 'Zero Dark Thirty' - and, in that respect, the news is mainly positive. The movie stays intensely focused on the matter at hand, not allowing itself to get distracted by side forays into too many irrelevant factors or overly- detailed character back stories. Yet, while this is generally a virtue, it does result in a certain weakness as well, mainly, a lack of depth in the characters, particularly the main one. One need only compare 'Zero Dark Thirty' to something like Showtime's 'Homeland' to see the advantages the long-form format has over the short-form when dealing with subjects as complex as this one. And one need only compare ZDT's Maya with 'Homeland's Carrie (Claire Danes) to see how much more fully developed the latter is as a character. Maya is allowed to register fear, anger, frustration, determination, disappointment, etc., but we never feel that we really get to know her as a person. For one thing, we never see her in a single relationship with anyone other than her colleagues (or even hear of one mentioned, come to think of it), even though the movie spans nearly a decade. That being said, the movie does convey, through Jessica Chastain's riveting performance, the very real toll exacted on individuals who dedicate their lives to a dogged pursuit of terrorists and who feel heavily the burden of heading off any attacks in the future. Perhaps the lack of any reference to Maya's personal life is an implicit acknowledgment of that fact. Regardless, Chastain provides so luminous a beacon for us to follow along the journey that we can't help but connect with the pursuit on a deeply human level.Chastain gets strong support from Jason Clark, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, James Gandolfini and Chris Pratt ('Everwood,' 'Parks and Recreation') in the atypical role (for him) of a heroic Navy Seal.In fact, the movie's meticulous re-enactment of the Navy Seals' successful raid on the Abbottabad compound is alone worth the price of admission. It really does make us feel as if we were a part of history.",8,0,1,17 February 2014
Crazy Heart," Fine performances and film-making refresh an oft-told story
","Every few years or so, some aging male star will take on the role of a broken-down has-been to remind us all of just how fine an actor he can be when he's given material that doesn't rely primarily on youth and good looks to get the job done. In 2008, it was Mickey Rourke who got to show off his acting chops in 'The Wrestler,' and now it's Jeff Bridges' turn in 'Crazy Heart,' playing a once-legendary, but now pot-bellied, whiskey-soaked country singer/songwriter - who goes by the stage name Bad Blake - who's so far past his prime that he's been reduced to performing in bowling alleys and two-bit bars just to stay financially afloat and to keep his name before the public. But, unlike Rourke, Bridges was actually rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar for all his pains. And, to top it off, he gets to sing too! (Quite well, actually).Bridges certainly deserved his award for a performance that far transcends the stereotypes and clichés that might have foiled a lesser actor, and which lifts the movie to a plane it might otherwise never have achieved without him. The insightful, thoughtful screenplay by Scott Cooper (based on the novel by Thomas Cobb) plows some pretty familiar territory, but Bridges makes it all seem real and fresh. The same can be said for Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose role as an attractive single-mother and local writer who becomes romantically involved with Blake after she pens a story on him could easily have become stale and trite. Instead, these two fine actors play off one another so effectively that we forget we've seen this setup umpteen times before. The relationship between the two uncovers many truths about a man who's so enslaved to the bottle that he has never really grown up into a fully functioning, responsible adult - and his growing awareness that it may be high time he took some concrete steps towards rectifying that situation.Another interesting, though less fully developed, relationship in the movie is the one between Blake and Tommy Sweet, a hot young singer (superbly played by Colin Farrell, who does his own performing as well) who, although he originally started as Blake's protégée, now enjoys the celebrity status and critical acclaim that once were Blake's for the taking.As directed by Cooper, the movie nicely captures the look and feel of both the dusty Southwest countryside in which it's set and the seedy bars and cheap motel rooms where a good deal of the indoor action takes place.With its world-class performances (throw Robert Duvall into that mix), intelligent writing and sensitive direction, 'Crazy Heart' has all the down-home wisdom and blues-driven heartache of a good ole country tune.",8,3,5,7 July 2010
War of the Worlds," pulse-pounding sci-fi thriller
","With his stunning remake of H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds,' Steven Spielberg has created one of the most intense and terrifying visions of the coming apocalypse in motion picture history. Here is a film that makes 'Independence Day' look like a Sunday school picnic or a casual stroll through Central Park on a warm sunny afternoon. The utter darkness of this film is rather amazing considering the fact that Spielberg practically cut his teeth as a director on benign (albeit brilliant) sci-fi fantasies like 'Close Encounters' and 'E.T,' movies in which visitors from outer space were seen as emissaries of peace rather than invaders bent on destroying the human race (I don't think it's merely a coincidence that the unnerving sound the alien machines make in this film resembles some of the notes from Bernard Herrmann's score for 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'). In 'War of the Worlds,' the aliens are anything but benign; they are cruel, vicious, bloodthirsty and unstoppable, creatures more akin to the ones in 'Jaws' and 'Jurassic Park' than those in 'Close Encounters' and 'E.T.' And, indeed, there are far more echoes of scenes from 'Jurassic Park' in 'War of the Worlds' than any other previous Spielberg work. 'War of the Worlds' is certainly a case of Spielberg returning to his more 'primitive' roots, for after his recent ventures into the world of cerebral sci-fi ('A.I.' and 'Minority Report'), the director pulls out all the stops in this film, turning out a full-throttle, no-holds-barred orgy of non-stop death and destruction. In 'War of the Worlds,' Spielberg has found the perfect source material for his roller coaster ride mentality and it pays off beautifully for all concerned. As always, Spielberg turns a mere 'genre' picture into a work of art.Tom Cruise stars as Ray Ferrier, a working class stiff living in northern New Jersey who seems barely able to take care of himself, let alone the teenaged son and eleven-year-old daughter who have come to stay with him while their mother is away in Boston visiting her parents. Ray is obviously anything but a model parent, having alienated both children, particularly his son, with his absentee parenting style and casual indifference to the lives they are leading. All that is about to change, however, when, without any real warning, the earth suffers a massive invasion by creatures from outer space whose killer machines have been lying dormant underground for seemingly millions of years. As the monsters wreak havoc upon the planet, Ray flees with his children, searching for a place of safety in a world suddenly turned upside down and apparently headed for extinction and annihilation.Spielberg has wisely chosen to paint Ray in less than heroic terms. In addition to the fact that he has trouble assuming the role of protector and comforter for his own children, he is often at a loss as to what to do to escape the threat and ensure their survival. The director has Cruise work against type here, helping us to identify with his plight in a way we might not have were he conceived as a more conventional heroic type. Although it's a little hard to accept Cruise as such an uncaring father, we go along with the premise, knowing that he will eventually become closer to his kids though the life-threatening situation in which they find themselves.As this is a Spielberg film, it goes without saying that 'War of the Worlds' is a model of state-of-the-art visual and sound effects, and that the director exploits every moment for its full intensity and impact. This is as tightly-wound and suspenseful a thriller as I have seen in years. But what really puts it over is the way in which Spielberg manages to bring an end-of-the-world eeriness and paranoia to so much of the film. The first half, in particular, is almost unbearable to watch, so unsettling is the sense of inexplicable dread and doom that hangs over the work, so intense our feeling of powerlessness before the unknown. About a half hour into the picture, I realized that this film was striking chords in my psyche that most movies never even come close to touching. Spielberg really makes us feel what it would be like if everything we took for granted were suddenly snatched away from us and we were forced to confront a menace we didn't understand and against which we had no defenses. In a post-9/11 world, that is a very chilling and powerful concept indeed.Cruise and young Dakota Fanning do a beautiful job playing off one another in their many scenes together, making a real connection with us in the audience. Tim Robbins is effective as a somewhat crazed survivor who allows the family to hide in his farmhouse, even if the scenes there, though good, turn out to be the weakest in the film.Some people have objected to the rather abrupt ending of the movie, but anyone familiar with the Wells original knows that Spielberg is merely being faithful to the author's own vision. It seems rather petty to be getting on the man's case for his fidelity to a well-respected source when movie makers are so often criticized for not remaining true to their material.'War of the Worlds' is that rare genre film that seeps into your bones, taps into some of your most primal fears, and makes you look at the world in a different way the moment you step out of the theater. But then that has been Spielberg's hallmark as a director all along. Chalk up another triumph for the master.",10,3,7,1 August 2005
Love Actually," flawed but entertaining romantic comedy
","The half dozen or so love stories that comprise 'Love Actually' are neither highly dramatic nor emotionally earth-shattering in nature - and I suspect that this is exactly how writer/directer Richard Curtis intended it to be. This epic paean to the glory of romance involves, for the most part, run-of-the-mill (albeit middle or upper middle class) Londoners just trying to find a little happiness for themselves in the arms of that one true love.Hugh Grant, as the newly elected Prime Minister of England, unskilled in the ways of romance, leads a large and gifted cast through this roundelay of love, actors of no less a stature than Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson, just to name a few. They all portray characters in various states of romantic upheaval. Some are headed towards blissful, happily-ever-after endings, while others suffer the pangs of jealousy, infidelity and unrequited love. The best thing about 'Love Actually' is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and it isn't afraid to take its time introducing and developing its large roster of characters. The film, as a whole, has the kind of unhurried, laidback charm that one expects from a movie with Grant in the lead. The worst thing about the film is its over reliance on those fairy tale 'only in the movies' moments that seem to be an integral part of virtually every romantic comedy that comes down the pike these days (there's a scene set in Wisconsin that is so lacking in basic credibility that I was absolutely positive it would turn out to be a dream of one of the characters. It didn't). The film culminates in a jaw-droppingly bad scene near the end in which a young boy crashes through airport security with full approval of his beaming stepfather so that the tyke can tell a little classmate of his who is boarding a plane that he loves her. The sequence is a bit tough to take in this post-9/11 world, especially when the violins start swelling, cuing our tear ducts to well up in approval for this horrific stunt. There's also a bit of gratuitous America-bashing in Thornton's portrayal of the President of the United States, a rather mean spirited diversion in a film whose tone is otherwise all sweetness-and-light. It's perfectly fine for American films to portray the president as a venal, lecherous bully, but it takes a certain amount of gall for a British film to do so.'Love Actually' suffers the fate of many films that attempt to write large on too broad a canvas; some of the characters and stories inevitably turn out to be more involving and compelling than others. That is simply the nature of the beast. I certainly wish that the troubled marriage of Rickman and Thompson could have been explored in more depth, since Thompson provides the few moments of genuine feeling and heartbreak in the movie. And certainly one or two of the other lesser stories could have been dropped from the lineup with little or no harm done to the film overall. Given that limitation, however, it must be stated that 'Love Actually' succeeds more often than it fails. This is partly because the cast is so appealing and partly because much of the writing is really very funny. The choice of background music is occasionally obvious, though the songs frequently make wry and witty commentary on the action taking place on screen. 'Love Actually' is definitely a long movie (135 minutes to be exact) and it does leave a few loose ends untied at the closing credits. But that, perhaps, is as it should be. Life, after all, leaves some loose ends untied as well.",Null,12,22,19 September 2004
12 Years a Slave," A movie every American must see
","Steve McQueen's Oscar-winning masterpiece '12 Years a Slave' is one of the first movies about slavery to actually be told from the viewpoint of the slaves. I know that seems an odd thing to say, but Hollywood's past is littered with well-intentioned dramas that, driven by the need to appeal to the widest possible audience, have filtered their racially- charged stories through the eyes of sympathetic white characters, who are there not merely to right moral wrongs and to alleviate the sufferings of the afflicted, but to make the audience feel better about themselves, secure in the knowledge that THEY would surely never have participated in anything so vile or unjust had they been there at the time. Not that that aren't a few 'decent' slave owners around - 'decent' being but a relative term here - but those who made '12 Years a Slave' have no intention of letting the audience off the hook so easily. As Eliza - a woman who has had her two children cruelly ripped away from her and sold to someone else - points out to a fellow slave when he begins to describe the plantation master as a decent man, no person who buys and sells other human beings as property can ever be described as decent or good.'12 Years a Slave' is based on the experiences of Solomon Northrup, a freeman living in New York who literally woke up one day in 1841 to find himself kidnapped, shackled and sold into slavery in the South. Northrup was an educated man, a farmer, a violinist, a husband and a father of two, but none of that was enough to protect him from the scourge of slavery that had imprisoned so many of his fellow black men and women in the country. Upon his eventual release, Northrup wrote a memoir entitled '12 Years a Slave,' chronicling his years in captivity, which has now been adapted into an Oscar-winning screenplay by John Ridley. Among other things, '12 Years a Slave' is probably the most honest and unflinching portrayal of the realities of slavery ever captured on film, a reality that regularly included rapes, lashings, lynchings, the rending of families, and the non-stop degradation and de-humanization - all sanctioned by society and codified into law - of a whole race of people. On a broader scale, the movie also conveys what it was like having to live in a constant state of fear that a mere look, word or gesture - or even the slightest hint of self-defense or standing up for oneself or others - could result in a beating, a flogging or perhaps even death. It also shows what it was like being constantly at the mercy of some racist overseer's mood or whim, with no legal recourse or hope for justice - and the despairing belief that it would forever be thus. That is the world McQueen brings so vividly to life in '12 Years a Slave.'The movie also portrays how slaves were often forced to turn on each other to alleviate their own suffering or perhaps improve their own chances of survival.In a highly risky but ultimately effective move, Ridley has chosen to provide dialogue whose elevated diction and syntactic complexity sounds vaguely strange to the modern ear. Even the uneducated slaves talk in this manner. It's a bit unsettling at first, but it underlines just how dedicated these filmmakers are to exploring the truth. Also unsettling is the harsh discordant horn that blares at various moments of intense suffering or high drama throughout the film.As Solomon, Chiwetel Ejiofor has the difficult task of bringing depth and wisdom to a character who is forced by circumstances to be reticent and passive. Yet, Ejiofor, in many small and subtle ways, allows us to see the man of strength and determination lurking behind the servile exterior. In a relatively small role, Lupita Nyong'o made enough of an impression on the Academy to walk off with the Best Supporting Actress Oscar portraying a young slave named Patsey, who may have found 'favor' with the plantation master but who's life has become a living hell as a result. There are excellent performances as well by Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye, Alfre Woodard and Brad Pitt.Because the movie IS so faithful to the brutal realities of slavery, it has earned the rather unfair reputation of being 'too difficult to watch,' a fact that may have limited the size of its potential audience both in theaters and at home. Let me just say that, for all its harshness, '12 Years a Slave' is no more violent or 'unwatchable' than any number of movies or TV shows from now or the recent past. Not by a long shot. In fact, I can think of at least a half a dozen shows currently running on cable TV that are far more violent than '12 Years a Slave' is. So if this is the reason why you may have been avoiding checking out one of the finest films of recent years, you might want to rethink that decision and at least give it a try. You won't regret it.",9,0,2,24 April 2014
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Fails to live up to its promise
","With his roles in mainstream hits such as 'Superbad' and 'Juno,' Michael Cera catapulted himself to the head of the class as the modern-day geek of choice for teen comedies (he's sort of to the 2000s what Molly Ringwald was to the 1980s, a figure average adolescents can relate to). In 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,' Cera continues in that mode, playing a straight member of an otherwise all-gay rock band who can't get over the fact that his pretty but snooty girlfriend, Tris, has dumped him for another guy. One wild night, while in the city with his band mates, the lovesick Nick hooks up with Norah Silverberg, a less pretty but far more authentic girl who attends the same Catholic girls' school as Tris and who discovers, much to her delight, that, in Nick, she may have finally found her 'musical soul mate.' With a screenplay by Lorene Scafaria (derived from the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan) and direction by Peter Sollett, 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' is an amiable but scattered little comedy that never seems to completely find its footing or to come up with any kind of purposeful meaning or direction. Filled with jokes and comic concepts that either don't lead anywhere or that simply fall flat, the movie fails to do justice to its youthful and exuberant cast that includes, in addition to Cera, Kat Dennings, Alexis Dziena, Aaron Yoo, Rafi Gavron, Ari Graynor and Jonathan B. Wright.The movie does an impressive job not overly stereotyping its gay characters (though a little of that sneaks in anyway), and there are fleeting moments of tenderness and charm as Nick and Nora work on cementing their relationship, but the movie's lack of a clear-cut focus proves yet again that 'niceness' alone isn't enough to guarantee a quality movie.",5,6,8,19 April 2009
Wedding Crashers," hit-and-miss comedy
","John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey have come up with a full-proof scheme to get women to sleep with them: they go to weddings of total strangers, pass themselves off as distant relatives of either the bride or the groom, charm the living daylights out of the other guests, then put the make on any pretty young thing that happens to come their way. And up till now, John and Jeremy have been able to pull off their little ruse pretty much without a hitch - until, that is, the day they decide to crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary of the United States. Then all hell breaks loose 'The Wedding Crashers' is a comedy vehicle built for speed. The dialogue comes so fast and furious that it's occasionally hard to absorb everything the characters are saying. David Dobkin has followed suit in his direction, keeping the film going full-throttle at all points. That's the good news about 'The Wedding Crashers.' The bad news is that, as the movie goes on, the jokes and setups have a tendency to become a trifle strained, forced and labored, and the laughs begin to diminish as a result. It's not that there aren't some very funny moments in 'The Wedding Crashers,' just that there aren't nearly as many as there should be.As the two party crashers, Owen Wilson takes the role of the smooth-talking romantic lead, while Vince Vaughn gets to be the cynical victim of circumstances that such buddy comedies seem to require. Both are very good, but Vaughn, in particular, hits all the right notes as a man who finally meets his match with a girl (charmingly played by Isla Fisher) who has no intention of letting him get away from her after just a one night stand. Rachel McAdams, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, Rebecca De Mornay, Dwight Yoakam, Henry Gibson and Ellen Albertini Dow - who, apparently, needs to make an appearance in any movie that has the word 'wedding' in its title - round out the cast. And, ah yes, there is a fairly large, albeit uncredited, cameo appearance by none other than Will Ferrell late in the film.This is no bell-ringer of a comedy, to be sure, but it is at least harmless and watchable.",6,1,3,13 May 2006
There Will Be Blood," audacious but uneven film
","'There Will Be Blood' - Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, 'Oil' - runs for a good fifteen minutes before a single word is ever spoken. Yet, that prolonged reticence is probably the least peculiar aspect of a movie that becomes progressively more bizarre the longer it goes on.In the role that won him an Oscar, Daniel Day-Lewis - who, with his stentorian tones. sounds as if he's channeling John Huston for large portions of the film - plays Daniel Plainview, an ambitious oil man in turn-of-the-century California who, in his ruthless quest for money and success, finds he has no room left over in his heart for either God or his fellow man. Plainview's main antagonist is Eli Sunday, a fire-and-brimstone faith-healer who turns out to be every bit as opportunistic and empty-souled as the godless Plainview (and considerably more hypocritical).With two such unsavory and unsympathetic lead characters, Anderson really didn't have much choice but to go for the abstract in his approach, turning Sinclair's tale into an exercise in art house style that is as liable to alienate 'general audience' viewers as pull them in. Anderson is dealing with some mighty resonant themes here - greed, deception, abandonment, religion, filial relationships, Man's place in the universe - and he brings an appropriately 'grand opera' sensibility to the film. He lets Day-Lewis swing for the fences in his performance, resulting in a mesmerizing admixture of over-the-top histrionics and soul-searing subtlety. Anderson has mounted the film in such a way as to make the visuals and the landscape as integral to the storyline as the characters - at times even more so, as the script frequently fails to sufficiently clarify the motives for why the characters do what they do. Their actions often feel so arbitrary and inexplicable that we begin to wonder if crucial portions of the film might not have actually ended up on the cutting-room floor. This is particularly the case in the later stretches of the movie as Plainview descends ever more into paranoia and madness.Paul Dano ('Little Miss Sunshine') and Dillon Freasier are both excellent as the callow preacher and Plainview's young son, H.W., respectively; and Robert Elswit's award-winning cinematography evokes the beauty of the setting without ever downplaying its bleakness. Finally, Jonny Greenwood's haunting score nicely underlines the purple-prose nature of the piece.Alternately visionary and pretentious, 'There Will Be Blood' may not be for all tastes and audience demographics, but its uniqueness, daring and style remind us of why many of us enjoy going to the movies in the first place.",7,1,5,8 March 2008
Ice Age," cute, clever, entertaining
","`Ice Age' emerges as one of the better animated films of recent years, cleverly designed and even more cleverly written.  Scenarists Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman have devised a story set 20,000 years ago about an unlikely trio of companions who find themselves making a long trek through a harsh environment in an effort, ostensibly, to return a baby human to the tribe from which he has become separated.  The triumvirate is made up of a deadpan, cynical mammoth, a wisecracking, over-the-top sloth (whose mile-a-minute mouth more than makes up for his legendary slowness) and a malevolent saber-tooth tiger, who learns a thing or two about friendship and teamwork before the adventure is over.`Ice Age' is at its most amusing in those scenes in which the characters make prescient jokes about their own place in the evolutionary scheme of things.  One particularly clever scene involves the three travelers discovering what looks like an underground museum of natural history encased in ice, replete with ancient creatures caught in naturally occurring, chain-of-life exhibits.  Like most animated films set in the past, `Ice Age' derives much of its humor through the use of anachronism.  We chuckle to hear these creatures applying modern, scientific knowledge to the pre-scientific era in which they are living.The animators and designers have done a beautiful job in achieving just the right look for this tale.  The backgrounds have a colorful, clean, streamlined look to them, and the animals themselves, in their appearance and design, provide a witty commentary on evolutionary history.   Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary do superb voiceover work, each achieving just the right tone for the character he has been assigned to play.  One could wish, perhaps, for a bit less sentimentality at the end, but that is a minor quibble in a film that works so well for both children and adults.  The kids will revel in the cuteness of the animals and the clever action sequences, while adults will savor the sly knowingness of the evolutionary and historical in-jokes.  Not bad in an era when most films can't find a way to please even ONE audience demographic.",Null,42,54,28 November 2002
Man on Fire," flawed but gripping crime thriller
","You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, 'Man on Fire' is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed. So far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either. As the movie opens, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community. Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge, Pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections. The last two-thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama, as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, 'Man on Fire,' astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. In addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini. But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.'Man on Fire' would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller.",7,75,135,20 September 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," Intelligence-flavored popcorn
","Try as one might, it is virtually impossible to discuss 'Edge of Tomorrow' without making at least a passing reference to 'Groundhog Day,' the 1993 comedy whose very name has become synonymous with - and, indeed, pop culture shorthand for - the act of living the same experience over and over again. Directed with quirky inventiveness by Doug Liman, 'Edge of Tomorrow' takes this concept into the realm of futuristic science fiction, using the novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka as its source of inspiration. Once again we find ourselves in the near-future, after an alien invasion has all but wiped out continental Europe. Now, it's time for the surviving nations to launch a new D-Day-type assault on the coast of France, this time with super-sophisticated weaponry and armor that may or may not stand up against this most formidable of enemies. Tom Cruise plays a glib and cowardly public relations officer who is only too eager to stand on the sidelines offering encouragement while other young men and women go off to do the fighting, but who is none too happy when he's ordered by one General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) to go take up arms himself. Things don't go too well for Major William Cage in his first foray into mortal combat - he's killed, actually - but through some inexplicable fluke of nature, he wakes up alive in the time before the battle, destined to relive the incident over and over again till he finally gets it right.By far, the best element in 'Edge of Tomorrow' is the fun and lively performance by Tom Cruise, who gets to run the emotional gamut from paralyzing fear to swaggering bravado, from pleading desperation to raging cock-sureness all within the confines of a single role. In fact it's entertaining to watch how Cage's confidence grows in direct proportion to his knowledge each time he comes back from a trip to the future. Cruise has been at this sort of popcorn-entertainment gig for an awfully long time now, and it's clear he's lost none of his touch. Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton are additional standouts in an excellent cast.Unfortunately, as with even the better forays into big-budget movie-making, 'Edge of Tomorrow' does eventually hit a point of diminishing returns, as we get flummoxed by the occasional plot hole and overwhelmed by a surfeit of special effects (though the CGI here is, indeed, very impressive). Still, 'Edge of Tomorrow' has a sophistication and an intelligence rare to modern blockbusters, and it actually manages to mine a surprising amount of humor from its set-up. It doesn't insult its audience, which is saying quite a bit when it comes to the fare we're generally offered when it's summertime at the movies.",8,4,7,6 July 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Humorless fiasco

Downfall," grimly fascinating film
","Ever since his death in a Berlin bunker at the end of World War II, there has been endless speculation and conjecture surrounding the final days of Adolph Hitler and his long time mistress Eva Braun. A few years back, a documentary entitled 'Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary' interviewed one of the few people who claimed to be an eyewitness to those events, a young woman hired to take dictation for Der Fuehrer for the last two and a half years of his life. 'Downfall' is a dramatized account of what she saw.Indeed, this new film begins and ends with clips from that earlier work, in which a now aged Traudl Junge attempts to explain why she allowed herself to become a devotee of both Hitler and the Nazi party (she chalks it up, basically, to 'curiosity'). After that brief preamble, 'Downfall' plunges us immediately into that hellish time when the world lay in ruins and The Third Reich was breathing its long overdue final gasp.The beauty of 'Downfall' is not merely that it affords us a glimpse into one of the most fascinating bits of 20th Century history, but that it opens up aspects of human nature that we may not always wish to acknowledge. It shows Hitler as a man accustomed to being able to control events and the people around him suddenly rendered impotent in the face of a force - in this case the Russian army battering away at Germany's capital city - greater than himself. As events spiral more and more out of control, the dictator becomes ever more paranoid and divorced from reality (by the end he's issuing orders to an army that , quite literally, no longer exists). For him, the world suddenly divides itself up into those who will remain loyal and faithful to the bitter end and those who will become traitors both to him and to the 'glorious cause' that defined their lives for so many years. For one thing the movie is clear to acknowledge is that, even in his final moments, Hitler remains unrepentant and convinced that not only was he right in what he did, but that future generations would come to recognize that rightness and honor him for it. In many ways, this is the story of any failed dictator whose dreams of worldwide domination end in the smoldering ruins of his own hubris.But it is not merely Hitler who exhibits bizarre behavior in the face of onrushing doom. Even though most of the people who have chosen to remain in the bunker with their leader are fully aware of the fate that awaits them, they maintain many of the rituals and accoutrements of 'civilized,' 'gracious' living: they hold dances, sing patriotic songs, drink champagne from crystal glasses, read magazines, all the while calmly discussing the ideal way to kill themselves. Despite their fear, they are so caught up in the vision and the man to whom they have sworn allegiance that they are willing to die - and take their children with them into death - rather than live in a world without their beloved Fuehrer.The makers of 'Downfall' run the risk common to any work that attempts to provide a three-dimensional portrait of Hitler: the accusation that they are trying to 'humanize' a man whose epic disregard for human life puts him in the category of the greatest monsters who ever lived. And, indeed, the movie does show Hitler displaying moments of warmth and tenderness, mainly aimed towards the women in his life (and, of course, his dog). Yet, who among us really believes that Hitler NEVER showed affection to those who were close to him? It was the fact that he COULD treat the people he loved in this way yet was unable to extend that same sense of empathy and concern to the faceless, nameless millions he slaughtered that made him the true incarnation of evil on earth.The film also does a great job showing the varied reaction of Hitler's military commanders as they argue back and forth over whether to level with him about the hopelessness of the situation and thereby risk incurring his wrath or to continue to feed his delusions and let him go out thinking he was still master of his fate.The performances are all first rate, but I would like to single out especially the lively and vivacious Juliane Kohler who manages to make Eva Braun's blind devotion to a murderous madman and fearlessness in the face of death touching, understandable, and - dare I say it? - strangely heroic. As Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara shrewdly portrays a woman whose own devotion to the man and the cause is tempered by a certain degree of rationality and fear, to the point where she can ask, in a moment of candor, how Hitler can be so kind on a personal level, yet so brutal in his comments and actions. And, of course, Bruno Ganz gives a bravura performance as Hitler, running the gamut from full-throttle mania to tender solicitude while never losing sight of the man at the core.Despite being set in the past, 'Downfall' has a great deal of relevance to our own time. To see Magda Goebbels methodically and systematically poisoning each one of her own children before having herself killed is to understand a little better how family men can fly planes filled with innocent men, women and children into skyscrapers. It's a scary and sobering sight indeed. Now if only we as a species could learn some of the lessons put forth by this film.",8,7,9,24 July 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," more a pleasant parody than a biting satire
","'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' takes us back to those halcyon days of the 1970's, when the hair was as big as the lapels and women were just beginning to assume their rightful place in America's television newsrooms.Will Ferrell plays a Ted Baxter-type anchorman (is it mere coincidence that his dog is named Baxter?) - vain, narcissistic, none too gifted in the brains department - who has worked for years as the sole news dispenser at a top-rated San Diego station. All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more 'diversity' and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board. Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news. Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants). Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy's professional territory.'Anchorman' is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like 'Network'), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb. The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial ('Panda Watch: Day 46') that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits. Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in 'Anchorman' ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever 'West Side Story' parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles. Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.'Anchorman' goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now. Still, 'Anchorman' is fun while it lasts - and these days we'll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs.",7,55,94,3 September 2005
American Gangster," Top notch gangster picture
","In what is possibly the best gangster picture since 'Goodfellas,' Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas, a real life drug lord who reigned over Harlem from the late 1960's to the early 1970's. Lucas rose to prominence when he began buying his supplies directly from a military connection in war torn Vietnam, allowing him to push a 'purer' product at a cheaper price than any of his mob competitors. Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, an 'honest cop' from New Jersey who leads an undercover investigation into the source of all this suddenly abundant street heroin, a search that ultimately leads him to Lucas himself.As written by Steven Zaillian (derived from an article by Marc Jacobson) and directed by Ridley Scott - two old pros who certainly know how to craft a quality movie - 'American Gangster' is an epic tale of crime and punishment that pays due homage to all the classic gangster pictures that have come before it. Americans have always had a love/hate relationship with law breakers and gangsters. Although we may be appalled by their callous indifference to the suffering of others, we can't help but admire their steely-eyed determination and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as their ability to turn the American Dream on its head with impunity (until they're finally caught that is). And Lucas is no exception, for here is the classic figure of gangster mythology - a boy from the streets who rises from obscurity to command his own empire, only to have it crumble before his very eyes when his own hubris and overreaching prove too much even for the gods themselves to countenance. In a strange moral paradox, much as we may like to see gangsters succeed, we also like to see them brought low and given their just desserts - if for no more morally admirable reason that that we envy them. Lucas comes replete with that special cognitive dissonance that all gangsters seem to possess, and which allows them to live two entirely separate and compartmentalized lives, free of the guilt and hypocrisy that keep the rest of us duty-bound and law-abiding. For despite his ferocious temperament, indifference to human suffering, and callow willingness to exploit human tragedy for his own personal gain, Lucas protects his neighborhood, dotes on his mother and family, and loves his wife.Ironically, Roberts, the cop, has less worth celebrating in his own life - his wife is divorcing him and moving with their son to Las Vegas, his fellow cops don't trust him (for the reason that he ISN'T on the take), and his hopes of becoming a defense attorney may come to naught if he can't conquer his paralyzing fear of public speaking. Yet, Roberts has one thing going for him that Lucas doesn't - he knows the difference between right and wrong, even though he doesn't always act on that knowledge when it comes to his own personal (as opposed to professional) life.Yet what truly distinguishes 'American Gangster' from its recent movie counterparts - more even than the storyline or characterizations - is the tremendous amount of texture Zaillian and Scott bring to the picture. Every scene is filled with intense interactions between characters, intriguing background information (especially the TV reports from Vietnam), and spot-on period details. And even though Washington and Crowe appear together only in the closing moments, their powerhouse performances make the two concurrently running stories feel all of a piece. It should also be noted that, for a gangster picture, 'American Gangster' doesn't feel the need to wallow in excessive violence or gratuitous sadism. It is much more concerned with the people involved than with their on-the-job activities.As with even the best of movies these days, 'American Gangster' could use a little trimming in its later stages, where it suffers a bit from distention and attenuation. Moreover, the final scenes feel a trifle implausible and pat despite the fact that they are reportedly based on fact.Still, these are minor shortcomings in a movie that is firing on all cylinders for most of its running time.",8,0,2,18 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," interesting idea that feels underdeveloped
","Like many a successful comic before him, Will Ferrell goes for his own 'Truman Show'-like bid at legitimacy with 'Stranger Than Fiction,' a high concept comedy/drama, written by Zach Helm and directed by Marc Foster, about a man who discovers that he's actually a fictional character in an author's yet unfinished novel.Harold Crick is a straight-arrow, stuffed-shirt IRS agent who lives a life of highly regimented solitude completely cut off from any real social interaction with the people around him. One day he begins hearing the voice of an unidentified woman portentously intoning the details of each of his actions as he goes about the business of living out his daily life. As it turns out, the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel, a neurotic, reclusive novelist who is suffering from severe writer's block as she attempts to complete her latest work of literary fiction. Blissfully unaware that the character she has created has actually taken form as a flesh-and-blood human being, Eiffel plots ways to kill him off in the final scene. When Harold finally figures out what is happening to him, he seeks advice from a local English professor (Dustin Hoffman) who comes to believe Harold's bizarre predicament and tries to help him avoid his preordained fate before it's too late.Highly reminiscent of such reality-bending movies as 'Groundhog Day,' 'Being John Malkovich,' 'Adaptation' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' among others, 'Stranger Than Fiction' earns points for pushing the envelope in terms of storytelling, but its themes - of a man finding meaning in his humdrum existence and of an author realizing that preserving real life is more important than preserving art - are so retrograde and shopworn at this late date that the movie comes across as far less cutting-edge and innovative than its post-modernist premise would lead one to expect. There are some very sharp and amusing moments in the film, but often we feel as if the movie's creators found themselves at a loss as to what to do with the clever idea once they came up with it. In short, 'Stranger Than Fiction' feels more like an outline for a movie than a fully worked-out film in its own right.Nevertheless, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is worth seeing for the low-keyed performance by Farrell who never steps out of character as the socially backward but essentially warmhearted schnook Eiffel has invented for her printed page. The resplendent Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the tax-cheating ultra-liberal storeowner whom Harold is sent to audit and who opens his eyes to the possibility of true love for the first time in his 'life.' Their scenes together are genuinely well-played, touching and romantic. With her stiff-upper-lip British accent and crisp enunciation, Thompson is perfect as the frazzled narrator and author desperate to break through her writer's block and bring closure to her literary creation. Queen Latifah effectively underplays the role of the rational assistant sent to help Eiffel find a way to kill off her character, while Hoffman, in a wonderfully playful mood, gets to deliver most of the screenplay's funniest lines.There's a great deal of poignancy in the final act as Eiffel has to decide between literally killing off her creation to preserve her work or letting her creation live even if that means spoiling a potential literary masterpiece. It is at this moment that Eiffel learns the true burden of being God - or at least the demi-god that artists automatically become through the nature of their work. It's a shame that the movie slouches along for so much of its running time on its way to the finale.",6,1,2,10 December 2006
The Green Mile," long superficial tale
","`The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist.  Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey.  Like the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic, `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or particularly meaningful.  Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power of miraculous healing.  Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point.  The story here - which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's innocence.`The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place, but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys.  Perhaps the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their just (or unjust) rewards.  Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest cliché of all:  an uneducated, marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind, though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through which God is able to work his wonders.  Except for this last fact, Coffey's pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster.  Is this possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character, features a mouse in a prominent role?   Similarly, one doubts it is mere coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein  - albeit, in this case, Coffey, of course, is innocent;  after all, having him be guilty of the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience.   Also, this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well.  In addition to dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with Christ per se).Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their villains.  Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the sweetness.  This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner.  The guard, Percy, is a craven, sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of its owner's death.  The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men.  By so neatly divvying up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it some real meaning.As to the film's rather startling and, initially unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story.`The Green Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film.  It sports a number of excellent performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it patiently gathers the strands of its story together.  As with a good long novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to give it the benefit of our attention.  Therefore, we regret even more that the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality.  Those of us willing to dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve better.",Null,7,16,14 July 2000
The Reader," Powerful Holocaust drama
","Like all works of art that endeavor to 'illuminate' the Holocaust, 'The Reader' ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found. Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task. Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all 'means.'Though it is set in a number of different time periods, the story proper begins in 1958, when a 15-year-old German boy by the name of Michael Berg is seduced by a 38-year-old woman named Hanna Schmitz. For a summer, the two carry on a secret, illicit affair, wherein the woman introduces the boy to the joys of physical love, while he reciprocates by reading the classics to her between bouts of passionate lovemaking. Flash forward to 1966 when Michael, now a university law student, discovers, much to his horror, that this very same Hanna who meant so much to him in his youth is actually a former concentration camp guard currently standing trial for war crimes. The story goes even further ahead in time as a now middle-aged Michael keeps up the relationship by sending his personalized recordings of books to Hanna as she serves out her time in prison.There has been some criticism leveled against the film that it aims to cast a Nazi mass murderer in a 'sympathetic' light. Yet, what ultimately comes across in the story is not how 'likable' a person Hanna is but how sadly tragic. Like all fine drama, 'The Reader' goes beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes of heroes and villains to examine the complexity of human relationships and the messiness of the human condition. The movie keeps us emotionally off-balance throughout. Even in the early stages of the courtship, we are torn between our attraction to the characters as individuals and our revulsion at the difference in their ages. Hanna is particularly enigmatic as she embraces a child two decades her junior yet seems to find some strange fulfillment in him that goes beyond the obvious physicality of their relationship. Despite the touchy nature of these scenes, we get a feel for what brings these two very different characters together at this particular moment in time.As the story moves on, the screenplay confronts many of the thornier issues surrounding what exactly happened in Germany in the middle of the Twentieth Century, questioning how so many 'average' people could, at best, have turned a blind eye to the events that were occurring, and, at worst, have allowed themselves to become complicit in the mass atrocities. There's a beautifully incisive scene in which a young law student confronts his professor, demanding to know how the man has been able to live with himself for all these years, knowing that he did not do everything within his power to try and stop what was happening. In that brief, shining moment, we get a sense of what it must have been like for the people in Germany in the decades following the war when so many, Hanna included, simply turned their backs on the past in an effort to move on with their lives.Perhaps the most complex character in the story is Michael, who, as he ages and learns more and more hidden truths about his first love, must come to terms with the fact that the woman he thought he knew on the most intimate of terms may, in fact, be an unrepentant mass murderer. Yet, love is not something that can be turned on and off at will, and it takes Michael decades to figure out just how best to deal with the moral dilemma raging in the very depths of his soul.Michael is played first by David Kross in the period from 1958 to 1966, and then by Ralph Fiennes in the time thereafter. Both are superb, with Kross, in particular, delivering a performance of such delicacy and sensitivity that he sets the groundwork for what Fiennes is called on to do later in the film. And, of course, Kate Winslet, in the role that won her an Oscar, demonstrates yet again why she is one of the screen's great actresses.Kudos must also go to screenwriter David Hare, who has adapted Bernhard Schlink's complexly structured novel with integrity and taste, and to director Stephen Daldry and cinematographers Chris Menges and Roger Deakins for the sumptuous look they have achieved with the film. Together, these fine artists have created a work that challenges the intellect and roils the emotions.",9,17,18,23 May 2009
The Wrestler," When the actor becomes the role
","Darren Aronofsky's superb drama 'The Wrestler' provides Mickey Rourke with the role for which he will undoubtedly be most remembered - that of 'Randy 'the Ram' Robinson,' a professional wrestler long past his prime, who is attempting to mount a comeback both as a fighter and as a father to the daughter (beautifully played by Rachel Evan Ward) whom he abandoned earlier in life.Rarely does an actor get the chance to inhabit a role quite as fully as Rourke does here. With his bulging muscles and greasy, long-flowing, bleach-dyed locks, Rourke - who did his own stunts for the film - brings an amazing physicality to the character, making us feel every ache, pain and body blow the man suffers, both inside the arena and out, as he hauls his massive, badly bruised carcass through life. Randy shows that he suffers no illusions about that life, as he confesses to his daughter, 'I'm an old broken-down piece of meat, and I'm alone and I deserve to be alone.' But there's something about Randy - call it his gentleness of spirit or his self-effacing modesty - that nevertheless wins us over to his side. Indeed, for all his physical imposingness, Randy is a surprisingly tender individual who knows he's screwed up in life and now wants to make amends and rebuild bridges with the one person he cares most about in his life.This 'soft' side of Randy is most evident in his relationship with 'Cassidy,' a stripper who is herself getting on in years. In fact, Randy and Cassidy are united in the fact that they are both trapped in professions that are less than kind to those who are aging. Even though the role of Cassidy could easily have slipped over into the-stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold territory, the intelligence of the writing and the subtle richness of Marisa Tomei's performance prevent that from happening.Screenwriter Robert D. Siegel keeps the story spare and simple, not cluttering it up with fancy narrative flourishes or overblown melodramatics. With the wintry coastal New Jersey setting as his backdrop, director Aronofsky lets the drama unfold at a seductively leisurely pace, letting us get to know each of these characters and the rhythm of their lives in finely-drawn, intimate detail. And even though Rourke has elicited richly deserved praise for the physical pounding he endured for the role, it is in the quieter and subtler moments, when we get to see the inner workings of the character he's portraying, that the actor's talent and dedication to the role truly shine through. It is, indeed, a performance for the ages and one that students of acting will be studying and attempting to emulate for decades to come.",9,0,0,26 April 2009
Hancock," failed attempt at something different
","Despite his generic-sounding name, John Hancock is not your average, run-of-the-mill reluctant superhero; he's a reluctant superhero with a drinking problem and anger management issues. Disheveled and unshaven in his appearance - and equally rude, crude and belligerent in his demeanor - Hancock lives by himself in a broken down trailer on the outskirts of L.A., a self-appointed outcast, for all intents and purposes, from the society around him. Alternately either inebriated or nursing a hangover, Hancock seems to have as little use for other people as they have for him. For even when he's out and about thwarting crime and rescuing the innocent, he's doing so more out of a sense of duty to his superhero DNA than any overwhelming love for humanity. Plus, his antics usually result in so much collateral damage to any buildings and motor vehicles that happen to be in his vicinity that the ungrateful citizens of the city would just as soon he leave them to their own devices and find some other metropolis that might be more amenable to his services. One day, however, he saves the life of Ray Embrey, an image consultant who believes he can turn the public's perception of Hancock around if only the superhero will allow him to work his magic on him. And perhaps, along the way, Ray will also be able to somehow reach that untapped vein of goodness residing at Hancock's core.Directed by Peter Berg, 'Hancock' deserves kudos for at least attempting to inject some new life into a genre that seems well on its way to cannibalizing itself out of existence through tiresome repetition and massive overkill. It tries for a slightly more intimate experience by concentrating on Hancock's all-too-mortal weaknesses and by not having him go up against one of those arch villains that come as part of the standard package with the genre (Hancock has enough internal demons to wage battle against to have much time left over for anything else, I suppose). Unfortunately, after coming up with a fairly original and promising premise, the filmmakers let it get away from them through a combination of unfocused storytelling, gear-grinding tone changes, and CGI work that seems a trifle on the substandard side for an action film of this size and scope. Part 'My Fair Lady,' part 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' part 'The Pursuit of Happiness,' and part whatever-else-they've-managed-to-throw-into-the-mix, the Vincent Ngo/Vince Gilligan screenplay wanders all over the map before finally settling into the slushiest, most rheumy-eyed superhero finale this side of 'Spiderman III' (though let me just state right up front that 'Hancock' is still miles above that fiasco). That's a shame, too, since Will Smith is as amiable and likable as ever, while Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman and adorable little Jae Head (from TV's 'Friday Night Lights') are equally appealing in their supporting roles.'Hancock' is not a bad movie really, just one that feels halfhearted and half-baked, earning it a Gentleman's C+ in the final analysis.",5,1,3,14 July 2008
Hitch," so-so romantic comedy
","In 'Hitch,' Will Smith plays a modern-day Henry Higgins, who, for a tidy fee, will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn Eliza Doolittles - only, in this case, the Elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams. Of course, the irony is that Hitch doesn't adhere to his own formula, being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself. Until, that is, he meets the woman of his own dreams, Sara, a New York City gossip columnist who has no idea what it is Hitch does for a living.It occurs to me that, when it comes to certain movie genres - action movies and romantic comedies in particular - it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we've already seen a hundred times before. Even the best romantic comedies can't entirely avoid paying homage to 'the formula,' and 'Hitch' is clearly no exception. As such, the film has some mildly amusing moments, some endearingly sweet scenes, and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental clichés, lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films. (I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co-worker sidekicks is a light-in-the-loafers, preposterously effeminate gay man?). It seems like every time 'Hitch' is about to win us over, it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious.Smith makes for a smooth romantic lead, but Eva Mendes doesn't always seem up to the challenge of her role, particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity. Actually, of the performers, it is Kevin James ('King of Queens'), as an overweight klutz who has hired Hitch's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress, who walks off with the film. Even though he's only a supporting player, it doesn't take him long to assume center stage in the film, essentially relegating the leads to second banana status.",6,0,0,22 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," spectacular finish to the saga
","With 'Star Wars: Episode III - The Revenge of the Sith,' we finally end up back where we started 28 long years ago with the original groundbreaking film. In this final piece of the puzzle, we learn what it is that causes Anakin Skywalker to finally give up his Jedi knighthood, cross over to the Dark Side, and become the dreaded Darth Vader.'The Revenge of the Sith' is more consistent in tone and feels more of a piece than the previous two installments, though, I must confess, that those earlier works - especially 'Attack of the Clones' - have grown some in stature on subsequent viewings. What makes 'Sith' an effective film is that it has a real human drama at its core, as an individual of great potential undergoes a tormenting inner struggle between light and dark, love and hate, good and evil. And even though we know which of those choices he will end up making, we are still fascinated to finally see how exactly it comes about. For the most part, Lucas paints Anakin's conversion in believable, telling strokes, and we are surprised to discover that it is prompted more by fear and love than by greed and hunger for power. And if the dialogue isn't always up to snuff, well, one doesn't necessarily expect Shakespearean language in a work designed for mass media consumption - even if that work deals in such grand Shakespearean themes as pride and honor, courage and envy, jealousy and betrayal.Although Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) have been granted ample screen time in this episode, it seems a shame that Padme (Natalie Portman) has gone from being an elected queen in 'Phantom Menace' to a senator in 'Attack of the Clones' to little more than a simpering housewife in this installment. It sure doesn't do much to enhance Lucas' reputation as a 21st Century feminist. Oh well, at least Jar Jar Binks has been reduced to little more than a silent walk-on part. That's some compensation at least.On the technical level of computer-generated backgrounds and special effects, the work here is on a scale and of a quality never before seen in any motion picture. Indeed, it is safe to say that every single shot in this film is a visual masterpiece, an extraordinary evocation of a world that could only exist in the mind of a creative genius like Mr. Lucas. He has achieved wonders here far beyond anything we thought even he was capable of doing. For that alone, the film will earn its niche in movie history.But even more impressive is the fact that, with 'Sith,' Lucas has accomplished something no filmmaker ever has before. He has brought his audience full circle, completing an epic adventure at the place where it originally started. The sense of satisfaction is immense at the end, as we see the seeds being sown for the adventure we know lies just down the road a bit, with characters whom we came to love three decades ago. He almost single-handedly proves that media res works can have their own poignancy and power.Our hats are off not only to Lucas and his army of master craftsmen who have brought this monumental effort to completion, but to the audience who never wavered in their faith and who had the fortitude and patience to stick it out with him even when the prospects didn't always appear so encouraging. All I can say ison to Episode 7?!",8,3,7,5 July 2005
Ray," A top film of 2004
","One of the top films of 2004, 'Ray' is a stellar biopic that charts the life and career of one of the certified musical legends of the twentieth century. Ray Charles was a man who battled bigotry, blindness and his own personal demons to find fame, fortune and a place in the history books as one of the world's premier entertainers, leaving behind him a legacy of great music that is as powerful today as it was when he originally recorded it.Structurally, the film takes a more or less conventional approach to its subject matter, starting in 1948 when Charles (then known as Raymond Charles Robinson) headed out on his own to play in seedy, all-black nightclubs, and ending in 1979, on the day when the state of Georgia officially rescinded its ban on Charles and adopted 'Georgia on My Mind' as its official state song. Interspersed along the way are frequent flashbacks to Charles' childhood growing up poor and fatherless in rural Florida under the guiding hand of his hardworking, demanding and tough-as-nails mother, who, even after the tragic drowning of her youngest son and Ray's onset of blindness at age seven, never gave up instilling the basic values of perseverance and self-reliance into the young boy (what a contrast to Howard Hughes' mother in 'The Aviator,' who taught her child to basically fear everything life could possible throw at him!). Armed with this sense of independence and determination, which helped him to out-maneuver those who would exploit him, Charles eventually made his way to the top, even though, as is often the case with artists and performers, his personal life was often at odds with his success. The film shows us the good along with the bad, not shying away from the womanizing and heroin addiction that often threatened to derail both his career and his marriage. Writer James L White and director Taylor Hackford have a fine eye and ear for the period in which the film is set, as we see Charles struggling for recognition in a race-sensitive society, finally achieving crossover success in the 1960's, and even becoming the first major performer to defy Jim Crow laws in the segregated South.In his superb, Oscar-winning performance, Jamie Foxx literally inhabits the role of Charles, capturing each of the singer's trademark movements and inflections with utmost accuracy and precision. Yet his is no slavish re-creation of a well-known figure, but rather a full-bodied portrait of a flesh-and-blood human being whose genius and talent often took a back seat to his misdirected obsessions and passions. The filmmakers have wisely opted to use Charles' own recordings rather than having either Foxx or someone else re-record them. The entire cast is excellent, but special kudos go to Kerry Washington, Regina King and Sharon Warren as the three key women in Charles' life.Old-fashioned in the very best sense, 'Ray,' which was released in the same year that Ray Charles himself passed away, serves as a fitting tribute to a man whose life and talent inspired generations of music lovers past and present.",9,0,2,30 September 2005
Shooter," well-worn storyline with some refreshing elements
","Though little more than a strung-together collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clichés, 'Shooter' provides a veritable feast for conspiracy-theory paranoiacs and a decent enough time at the movies for the rest of us.Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, an embittered ex-marine gunnery sergeant who's been living a hermitlike existence ever since he and his sharpshooter buddy were left to perish on an Ethiopian hillside by the American forces that had sent them on the mission in the first place. After three years holed up in the wilderness of Wyoming with no one but his devoted pooch to keep him company, Swagger is coaxed out of retirement by the FBI to help foil a planned assassination of the President of the United States. When Swagger discovers at the last minute that he is actually being set up as the fall guy for the killing, he barely escapes with his life and spends the rest of the movie dodging the authorities while attempting to clear his name and bring the true culprits to justice.Wahlberg, all brooding stoicism and macho-man swagger (pardon the pun), continues his run of tough guy roles in this film, though one wishes he would return to the more nuanced, multi-layered portrayals he managed to put forth in movies like 'Boogie Nights' and 'Three Kings.' As the woman who befriends Swagger, the attractive and talented Kate Mara has considerably more screen time in this film than she did in 'Brokeback Mountain,' but far less worthy material to work with. The most compelling performance is by Michael Pena as the low-level FBI agent who believes Swagger is innocent of the crime and who winds up joining forces with Swagger to uncover the conspiracy. The Average Joe demeanor that Pena brings to the character provides a proper counterbalance to Wahlberg's strutting self-confidence and superhuman athleticism. Danny Glover seems to be phoning in much of his performance here as the leader of the covert FBI cabal, and Ned Beatty does his best as a stereotypically smarmy senator who's up to his ears in venality and corruption.The plot often doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and it is easy for a layperson to get lost in all the arcane machinations that come flying fast and loose off the screen. Still, the screenplay does a nice job fitting the pieces of its puzzle together, merging the two story lines that run along parallel tracks for the first half into a unified whole at about the midway point. The action scenes are strikingly well done, even though they often sacrifice verisimilitude and plausibility for mass explosions and preposterously lopsided gun battles.The movie makes a lot of grand speeches at the end about governmental corruption and what it truly means to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, but 'Shooter' is designed to be a generic thriller not a big-think social drama. And, on those terms only, the movie succeeds more often than it fails.",6,55,95,1 April 2007
Inception," the re-vitalization of a genre
","Finally, a mega-budget Hollywood blockbuster worth raving about!Christopher Nolan, the genius behind the last two 'Batman' movies, hits new heights of creativity and imagination with 'Inception,' a sci-fi masterpiece about a technology that allows people to enter into the dreams of others with the express purpose of planting ideas into their subconscious. The concept is dealt with on such a complex level that, for a large portion of the movie, the characters are floating around in a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream. Yet, so intelligent is the writing and so meticulously thought-out the premise that the audience almost never gets confused about what's happening and, thus, can just sit back, relax and go along for the ride.And what a ride it turns out to be! Without getting too deep into the nuts-and-bolts aspects of the plotting itself, suffice it to say that the story involves a group of 'dream manipulation experts' - Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ellen Page, among others - who employ the technology known as Inception to enter into the pre-programmed dream of a young man (Cilliam Murphy) whose ailing father owns a giant energy firm. Their goal is to convince the son to break up the company after the old man (the late Pete Postlethwaite in one of his final performances) dies, so that a wealthy competitor (Ken Watanabe) will be able to pick up the pieces for himself. It's a tribute to Nolan's astuteness as a storyteller that he gives us this rather mundane overarching plot device rather than having the mission be about convincing someone to blow up half the civilized world or something equally over-the-top. This simpler motivation keeps the movie from sliding over into cautionary-tale territory - where most serious sci-fi works seem to eventually wind up - and allows us to concentrate more fully on the content and style of the dreams themselves.Another triumph for the genre is that the movie gives us a central character who's actually worth caring about. DiCaprio, the head of the team that goes into the dream, is a generally reformed 'corporate espionage thief' who lost his wife (Marion Cotillard) as a result of a dream-traveling scenario gone awry and who has been wracked with grief and guilt over the incident ever since. As if that weren't bad enough, he's been forbidden to return to the United States, where his two small children reside, because the authorities mistakenly believe he was responsible for her death. It is only when Watanabe promises to get the murder charges dropped if DiCaprio does this one last job for him that he agrees to take on the mission. As embodied by DiCaprio, who, by the way, has never been better, Dom Cobb becomes the heart and soul of a movie that, given the genre's track record in that regard, could easily have had neither a heart nor a soul. Instead, Nolan and DiCaprio draw us into the picture with an emotional force rarely found in even the most intimate indie drama, let alone an effects-laden super-spectacular such as this one.And spectacular is certainly the word for the cornucopia of visual delights the movie offers up to its audience, as a team of FX wizards creates dream worlds of eye-popping complexity and design.Like even the best of films, 'Inception' is not without its flaws. I could certainly have done without some of those skiing scenes near the end, and I'm sure there are enough holes in the plot line to keep perfection-seekers nitpicking and carping for years to come. However, I also imagine that 'Inception' will be dissected and studied over by film students and film lovers alike in endless fashion, and that their efforts will lead to the discovery of themes, motifs, symbols etc., that are not readily apparent on a single viewing, when we're just dazzled by all the brilliance and ingenuity that's gone into the work.That's all the more reason for movie watchers to return to this cinematic treat regularly and often.",9,1,9,22 January 2011
Lord of War," incisive black comedy
","'Lord of War' is a genuine cinematic rarity: a mainstream black comedy that doesn't soften its material or compromise its vision to cater to audience sensibilities. Nicholas Cage plays the world's foremost private small arms dealer, whose key to success lies in the fact that he never chooses sides in any armed conflict, opting instead to be an equal opportunity 'merchant of death' to all. For Yuri Orlov, peace is the only real enemy, and if innocent people have to die to keep him in clover, well, hell, he didn't make this world, and there's no reason why he shouldn't get his if everybody else is getting theirs.Like a master chef working his way to the heart of an artichoke, writer/director Andrew Niccol peels back the layers of his story to reveal the truths of the international gunrunning trade. Yuri is a chilling and disturbing character precisely because he is so utterly ordinary and difficult to read. Niccol does not portray him as evil incarnate, but, rather, as a reasonably well-adapted family man who just happens to be good at what he does and has the requisite capacity for self-rationalization that allows him to do his job and still live with himself. To his own way of thinking, Yuri is really no different from the man who sells tobacco or automobiles - both products, he explains, that actually result in the deaths of more people than firearms - then goes home to the love and adoration of his wife and kids. Yuri doesn't sell arms because he had an unhappy childhood or out of any sense of entitlement because he feels the world has treated him badly. He simply knows that if he weren't doing business with these murderous dictators - or as they like to call themselves 'freedom fighters' - around the world, somebody else would be.Most of the dark humor of the film comes from the detached, flippant and unemotional commentary Yuri provides as the film's narrator. He is quick to point out the ironies and absurdities inherent in so much of the arms business, and it is only the gruesome seriousness of the consequences that makes us catch our throats as we laugh. And Niccol certainly makes it clear that Yuri is only small potatoes compared to the governments who put far more weaponry into the hands of thugs and mercenaries than Yuri ever does. That little detail, snuck into a title card in the final moments, is the ultimate depressing reality Niccol uses to bring down the curtain on his film. In fact, Niccol bravely refuses to 'redeem' his character at the end. Yuri loses just about everything and everyone he cares about at the end thanks to his activities, but the world goes on and he's decided he's going to go right on along with it. And why in the world not? Selling arms is 'just what he does.' In a very nuanced and balanced performance, Cage conveys just the right note of dispassionate detachment without ever becoming either too callous or too maudlin. Yuri seems to genuinely like people and obviously loves his parents, his drug addict brother, his wife and his young son. That only makes his ability to compartmentalize his morality that much more frightening. Ethan Hawke gives a strong performance as the Javert-like Interpol agent obsessed with bringing Yuri to international justice, and Bridget Moynihan is stoic and sweet as the beautiful young wife who is willing to turn a blind eye to Yuri's activities for only so long before finally confronting her husband.Funny as well as chilling, 'Lord of War' will give you a whole new terrifying perspective on how the world actually works.",8,0,0,12 January 2007
Sherlock Holmes," good performances hampered by indifferent script
","Well, what do you know? Guy Ritchie has gone all high-tech and mega-budget on our arses in 'Sherlock Holmes,' the umpteenth movie incarnation of the world's most famous literary detective.As embodied by Robert Downey Jr., this Holmes is no brandy-sniffing, pipe-smoking effete intellectual, spending his time peering at clues through an enlarged magnifying-glass, but rather a rough-and-tumble, athletic bad boy who boxes in his spare time, swan dives into the Thames to escape a villain, and performs more acts of gravity-defying derring-do than 007 on a busy day. In this installment, Holmes is locked in mortal combat with the dreaded Lord Blackburn, a murderous cult leader who miraculously returns from the dead after being hanged for his crimes. Jude Law plays Dr. Watson, Holmes' friend, confidante and personal physician, who is thinking of dissolving their crime-fighting partnership in favor of blessed domesticity in the form of marriage to one Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). Rounding out the cast is Rachel McAdams as Holmes' one true love who just happens to be entangled in Blackburn's nefarious schemes.As written by Robert Michael Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg, 'Sherlock Holmes' is long and loud and filled with enough explosions and detonations to keep the most restless 21st Century action movie fan rooted firmly to his seat. But all the stunt work and pyrotechnics are ultimately wasted in the service of one of those trite and tiresome plot-to-take-over-the-world scenarios that have become practically de rigueur in the world of big budget spectaculars these days. The Victorian Era period detail is nice, but it would have been a great deal nicer had cinematographer Philippe Rousselot seen fit to crank up the lighting a notch or two so we might actually be able to SEE some of it (hopefully, this flaw will be rectified in the DVD version).That leaves us pretty much with the acting, which is dependably good given the caliber of the players involved. So revel in the performances and ignore the rest.",5,2,6,4 January 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," very powerful war film
","The Korean film 'Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War' stands as one of the most unsparing and harrowing films about men engaged in armed conflict to come our way in many years.'Tae Guk Gi' shows us the Korean War through the eyes of two brothers, Jin-tae and Jin-seok, both of whom are pulled away from their family and conscripted into the army right at the start of the conflict. Jin-tae feels very protective of his younger brother and devises a scheme to get himself a medal so that Jin-seok will be able to be sent home. Thus, Jin-tae begins to volunteer for dangerous assignments, much to Jin-seok's great fear and consternation. Over time, however, Jin-tae comes to savor his hero status, eventually becoming so desensitized to human suffering that he begins to commit atrocities of his own both on and off the battlefield. The film raises the issues of what it means to be a 'hero' and of where loyalty to family as well as to country truly begin and end.Alternately horrifying and heartbreaking, 'Tae Guk Gi' is a war film done on an epic scale that, nevertheless, rarely loses focus on the intimate human drama at its core - even though the plotting leans a bit towards the artificial and the melodramatic at times (further heightened by a musical score that is far more soupy than it needs to be). Still, with battle scenes that are every bit as graphic, realistic and unflinching as those in 'Saving Private Ryan,' the film effectively captures the unrelenting savagery of the ugly business we call war.The performances by Dong-Kun Jang and Bin Won, as the two literal brothers-in-arms, are moving and authentic, and the action scenes have an immediacy and scope that help the film override some of the weaknesses in the script. Astutely directed by Je-gyu Kang and superbly edited by Kyeong-hie Choi, 'Tae Guk Gi' is a powerful film about war and the men - be they heroes or common soldiers - called upon to wage it.",8,3,3,1 August 2005
WALL·E," visually astonishing but somewhat lacking in drama
","'Wall-E,' the latest offering from the movie-making geniuses at Pixar Studios, is a certifiable visual masterpiece that provides an endlessly inventive vision of what life might be like in the 29th Century - although, come to think of it, the term 'life' may be something of a misnomer, for in 'Wall-E''s post-apocalyptic image of the future, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution and garbage that have risen to toxic levels. The humans have long since fled to a high-tech way station located somewhere out in the far reaches of outer space, leaving the planet virtually deserted except for a sweet trash-compressing robot named Wall-E and his indestructible cockroach sidekick. Like all good little robots, Wall-E tirelessly performs the one function he has been programmed to carry out, even after the reason for that task no longer exists. Thus, he spends his days dutifully collecting all the litter generously strewn about the deserted city and converting it into skyscraper-high mounds of compacted trash. At night, he wiles away the hours watching an old videotape of 'Hello Dolly' and pining away for a female companion who will alleviate his loneliness and bring some meaning to his life. Then, one fine day, his dream becomes a reality when a sleek, sexy little number named Eve - actually an environmental robot sent from the way station to see if any signs of life have returned to the planet - shows up unexpectedly in Wall-E's neighborhood.The early section of the movie, in which Wall-E wordlessly goes about his business against a haunting backdrop of a decaying infrastructure and heaps of garbage, has much of the delicate beauty and sense of wonder we find in the opening moments of 'E.T.' (whose main character obviously served as the model for Wall-E). Written and directed by Andrew Stanton and brought to life by an army of miracle-working animators too numerous to mention, 'Wall-E' is one of those rare films that, through sheer visual design alone, is able to magically transport us to the unique little world it's created. The burgeoning romance between the two mechanical creatures is handled with a great deal of tenderness and wit, and the film is sprinkled with subtle little homages to 'West Side Story' (in the aerial views of the city), '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Titanic' for the more cinematically astute among us to revel and delight in. In the second half of the movie, 'Wall-E' travels to the spaceship housing the colony of ex-patriot earthlings, where he encounters problems with a sophisticated computer who wants to control the humans and prevent them from returning to a planet that just may be becoming inhabitable once again.This is a sweet and wistful fable about not only how each individual must find his own special place in the universe but how we as a species must cherish and preserve this one special place we all call home. Yet, for all its rare and wonderful qualities, I wish I could say that I loved this movie more than I do. For like some of Pixar's other products, 'Wall-E' is more impressive in its visuals than in its storytelling. Too often in 'Wall-E' we feel as if the narrative is lagging a few paces behind all the technical ingenuity. Indescribably beautiful as it is to look at, the movie doesn't generate sufficient conflict and drama to pull us all the way into the story. And for that reason, 'Wall-E,' while a true cornucopia of visual delights and easily one of the most spectacular-LOOKING films ever made, still falls just a hairsbreadth short of greatness when all is said and done.",8,13,23,10 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," long but involving drama
","Robert De Niro's second directorial effort 'The Good Shepherd' purports to tell the story of the birth of the CIA during the heyday of the Cold War. Based very loosely on the lives of two intelligence officers, James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell Jr., the movie is a strong but patience-demanding work that will have some members of the audience sitting up in rapt attention while others squirm restlessly in their seats. At 168 minutes and with little real action to speak of, 'The Good Shepherd' is admittedly not the easiest sell for a mass audience, relying as it does on atmosphere and dialogue - and the patient goodwill of its viewers - to get its message across. I can easily imagine a person watching this film with one eye planted firmly on his wristwatch and the other on the theater exit. I'm happy to report that I was not one of those people, for despite a few longueurs that occur towards the end of the movie, I found this film to be both compelling and eminently watchable for most of its duration.Matt Damon, who ages remarkably little throughout the 23-year time span covered by the story, plays Edward Bell Wilson, an agent specializing in the fine art of counterintelligence. With a screenplay by Eric Roth, the movie uses as its framing device the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the spring of 1961 and the suspicion that a mole in the agency must have tipped the Cubans off as to the American government's plan of invasion. From there we flash back to 1939 where we meet Wilson as a student at Yale recruited by the FBI to perform surveillance on a poetry professor with possible ties to the then-burgeoning Nazi Party. From then on, the film traces the arc of Wilson's life as he gets rooked into a largely loveless marriage (if one can call having to marry Angelina Jolie being 'rooked'), trains as an agent with British Intelligence and then the O.S.S., then helps to lay the groundwork for the American 'peace time' organization known as the C.I.A. The movie cuts back and forth between the two different time periods with only a few moments of confusion evident along the way.Wilson is probably the most button-downed, completely internalized character to hit the screen since Heath Ledger's Ennis del Mar in 'Brokeback Mountain' (though the character here is not nearly as fully realized as that one was). Wilson is a man almost totally devoid of humor and emotions - in many ways, the ideal person for the life of commitment and loneliness that spy work, by its very nature, demands. Wilson barely cracks a smile throughout the course of the story, and he is so thoroughly absorbed in his work that he doesn't see his wife and young son for literally years at a stretch. Wilson is surely one of the least audience-friendly of recent movie protagonists - or at least he would be if Damon did not convey the sort of puppy-dog vulnerability that actually makes us care about the character. Despite the fact that we know he has dedicated his life to a cause that he considers worthwhile and noble, we have a hard time approving of the way he treats his wife and family. Yet, Damon is able so show us that Wilson is not all that crazy about himself either and that he would lead a different life if only he were able to crawl out of his own skin and start all over. But this he cannot do, so he remains locked in his fate, true to what he knows how to do and hoping for a little redemption at the end if the gods should deem him worthy of that blessing. Damon plays his cards so close to the vest that he makes us continually re-evaluate the character without ever revealing more than we need to know about him. Wilson may at times be taking stock of his life, but the filmmakers don't feel the need to blatantly spell all the details out for us. It's in what's going on BEHIND those bespectacled eyes that the true drama lies.The movie does not shy away from the ugly realities of life as a CIA agent, showing us the cold-blooded ruthlessness and mounting paranoia that come with any life built, as this one is, on deception and distrust.Rather than aiming his film at the action crowd, De Niro has decided to focus on the characters and dialogue and simply hope that his audience will follow along with him. As a director, he brings a quiet, subdued tone to the story, the better to match the persona of his main character. In order to create a mood of contrasting emotions, cinematographer Robert Richardson uses a dull palette for the scenes set in the present, and a glowing, sepia-toned look for those set in the past.De Niro has assembled a veritable who's who of Hollywood's biggest and brightest to flesh out the minor roles - William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro, Joe Pesci, even De Niro himself - but, frankly, their parts are so limited that none truly stands out, thus clearing the way for Damon to take center stage. Jolie has rarely looked so dreamily beautiful before, but even her screen time is too minimal for her to make more than a glancing impact on the film as a whole (it's hard to believe any man would be as callously indifferent to the Jolie charm as Damon is here, but then, hey, that's Hollywood).This is clearly Damon's film and he proves once again that acting does not need to be 'theatrical' and 'showy' to be effective. His performance is the glue that holds this long, potentially unwieldy film together.",8,4,6,10 January 2007
The Terminal," about as much fun as being stuck at the airport
","Viktor Navorski is a man without a country - literally. On the very day his plane touches down at JFK, Viktor learns that a coup has occurred back in his fictional home country of Krakozha. Among other inconveniences, this international crisis renders his passport invalid until the United States government agrees to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the destabilized country's new leadership. Until then, Viktor remains a virtual prisoner in the terminal, unable to leave the premises and forced to live under the watchful eye of airport security. There's a certain irony in the fact that Viktor, who was presumably raised in a draconian communist country, becomes the ultimate victim of a de-humanized bureaucracy and a mountain of red tape the minute he sets foot on American soil. From that moment on, he has to find a way to survive in this strange new environment, but eventually he learns to make the airport his home, winning friends and wooing a love interest (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) into the bargain.Certainly, there are those who will find this fable about a simple man, trapped somewhere between the worlds of Capra and Kafka, heartwarming and charming. All I can say is that I found it, for the most part, aggravatingly contrived and cutesy, too infatuated with its own premise to develop a sustainable storyline. The problem begins with Tom Hanks who has milked the Average Joe/ Mr. Nice Guy shtick so much throughout his long career that it has long since lost any impact it once might have had. Adding a cutesy Eastern European accent to the brew just makes the performance all that more insufferable. In essence, Victor is reduced to little more than a 'man/child,' hardly a character worth developing a full length, tour de force feature film around.Steven Spielberg, who normally can do no wrong as a director, for some reason is unable to make an effective go of things here. Could it be because Spielberg handles sentiment well when he's working in a generally unsentimental genre like science fiction where he has some built-in tension to work off of, but that when he's dabbling in a highly sentimental genre like romantic comedy, he runs out of energy and vision? He's done a terrific job recreating an entire functioning airport terminal on a soundstage, but none of that really matters very much when we begin feeling as trapped inside the setting as Viktor himself does. Throughout the whole movie, I just kept wishing Viktor would bust his way through the terminal doors and find his way into a more interesting story. Almost all the secondary characters are shallow, stereotypical and uninteresting, while Stanley Tucci's nasty little airport manager is not only annoying and repulsive but completely incomprehensible from a psychological point of view.'The Terminal' is one of those movies that is so impressed with its own sweetness and goodness that it winds up patronizing all the 'little people' it thinks it's celebrating. This is a film strictly for those who actually enjoy being stuck at the airport.",4,1,5,1 October 2005
The Blind Side," standard-issue crowd-pleaser with compelling performances
","It would be easy to be cynical about 'The Blind Side' - to point out how it's just another tale of a do-gooding rich white person condescending to help out a struggling minority; that it once again shows a minority at the mercy of the generous white folk; and that it is filled with heart-tugging but implausible Kumbaya moments designed to make us feel good about ourselves and our own nobility. Yes, it would be easy to do that, but the fact that it is based on a true story - that of Michael Oher who went on to play in the NFL - goes a long way towards nipping at least some of that cynicism in the bud.Based on the book 'The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game' by Michael Lewis, 'The Blind Side' is what 'Precious' might have been had it been designed with a mass-audience in mind - a lump-in-the-throat, feel-good crowd-pleaser about a generally inarticulate, plus-size black youngster who's falling through the cracks big time due to poverty and wretched parenting. Only, in Michael's case, he's 'rescued' by the Tuohy family - primarily the feisty, socialite mom, Leigh Anne - who not only provides him with a beautiful home and a loving environment but lessons on how to be a world-class football player as well. A behemoth of a kid who's as shy and reticent off the field as he is aggressive and domineering on - at least once Leigh Anne has given him a good talking to - Michael doesn't seem nearly as scarred by his upbringing or as embittered towards humanity as one might expect given all he's been through as a child (he's certainly miles ahead of Precious in the coping department).True story or not, none of this comes across as all that convincing, and there are times when 'The Blind Side' threatens to drown itself and us in a sea of sanctimony and almost constant sentimental uplift. But it also manages to pull itself back from the precipice, at least periodically, thanks to the performances by Sandra Bullock - pushy and aggressive without being off-putting - and Quinton Aaron, who turns Michael into a sweet, likable kid. And little Jae Head ('Hancock') steals every scene he's in as Michael's wise-beyond-his-years little 'brother,' S.J. Writer/director John Lee Hancock doesn't bring a whole lot of ingenuity to the plotting or depth to the characters, but he gets the job done, which, I suppose, is all one can really ask for from a film in this genre.As a drama centered around high school football in the South (in this case, Memphis), 'The Blind Side' can't hold a candle to the magnificent TV version of 'Friday Night Lights,' but its inspirational story may get to you anyway - whether you choose to give yourself over to it or not.",6,1,2,13 June 2010
Music and Lyrics," comic romance hits all the right notes
","With its tune-filled tale of songwriting lovebirds, 'Music and Lyrics' pokes good-natured fun at the accoutrements and defining elements of '80's pop music and culture.Alex Fletcher is one half of a chart-topping duo known as POP! (obviously modeled on the real life WHAM!), that reached icon status in the mid 1980's. Since that time, while his opposite half (the George Michael of the team) has managed to blaze an amazing career as a solo performer, Alex has had to content himself with life as a certified has-been, appearing as a theme-park attraction and on 80's retrospective shows just to keep his name before the public. Suddenly, however, Alex is given the chance for a comeback when a Brittany Spears-like singer offers him an opportunity to write a new hit song for her. At just that critical moment, Alex meets Sophie Fisher, an insecure young woman with a talent for writing poetry, whom Alex asks to supply the lyrics for his melody. Soon, the two of them are writing up a musical storm and falling in love in the process.Boasting a litany of snappy one-liners and spectacularly engaging performances by Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, the movie manages to hit its satirical points without reducing its targets to stereotypes and caricatures. The story, it's true, can't entirely escape the strictures of its romantic comedy formula (Alex has the requisite nervous-Nelly manager who lives in fear that his client will make all the wrong career choices, and Sophie has an overprotective, celebrity-obsessed older sister, who feels compelled to advise her younger sibling on all matters relating to the heart), but writer/director Marc Lawrence at least manages to insert a few narrative surprises along the way. Above all, the movie wins us over with its wit and charm, its knockabout humor and ebullient spirit, and its dead-on parodies of '80's fashions and music. The original score by Adam Schlesinger is pleasant and catchy in a slick, commercial-jingle sort of way, and the movie starts and ends with an uproarious takeoff on glam music videos from the mid 1980's. Finally, Kristen Johnston, Brad Garrett and Haley Bennett manage to bring warmth and depth to characters who could easily have been relegated to the status of cardboard cutouts in less capable hands.'Music and Lyrics' may not be the most credible movie ever made on the theme of romance, but this upbeat tale of love in the music biz hits all the right notes.",7,2,4,23 June 2007
The Conjuring," Nothing new here
","The main problem with a movie like 'The Conjuring' is that it assumes that none of us have ever been to a haunted house movie before (perhaps not an entirely unwarranted assumption given that the characters in these movies clearly never have or they'd know better than to move into one of these houses in the first place).You know the drill. Unsuspecting family from the city buys an old place in the country. Weird things begin to happen. Ghostbusters are brought in to investigate. Turns out some restless spirits, the victims of various ghastly crimes in the past, are roaming around the place searching for someone to free them from their predicament so they can move on and find eternal peace. Supernatural pandemonium ensues. Roll credits. The End.This one is set in 1971 (the girls are watching 'Brady Bunch' reruns in the middle of the afternoon long before the show ever went into syndication, but then I doubt that facts are high on the agenda for these filmmakers). Lily Taylor and Ron Livingston play the parents of five daughters who become bedeviled by some evil forces lurking in the dark recesses of the creaky old fixer-upper they've purchased in rural Rhode Island. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the world-famous paranormal researchers, the Warrens, who attempt to exorcise the demons from the place.The kind of movie for which a spoiler alert is practically superfluous, 'The Conjuring' is allegedly based on a true story, a come-on that might have been more convincing had the movie not seemed so much like every other haunted house movie we've ever seen. I'd like to believe that even ghosts can't be this boringly predictable.Maybe someday someone somewhere will come up with something new that will breathe some much-needed life into the genre. Till then, I guess, movies like 'The Conjuring' - and there will be many more to come, I'm sure - will just have to do.",5,3,6,26 November 2013
Never Back Down," uninspired Karate Kid knock-off
","'Never Back Down' takes place in one of those only-in-the-movies high schools where the students spend so much of their time partying, brawling and posting videos of themselves on the internet that they have no time left over for studying.Jake Tyler is the football hero with the stereotypical name who reluctantly moves from Iowa to Orlando, Florida with his mother and kid brother after the death of his father. Jake has trouble adjusting to life in his new school where the law of the jungle clearly predominates and where the favorite extracurricular activity consists of beating one another senseless between classes. That survival-of-the-fittest mentality is further reinforced by a sort of underground fight club whose existence is apparently known to everyone on campus except for the clueless faculty who seem utterly oblivious to all the black eyes and bruised faces that keep popping up in their classrooms on an almost daily basis. But then what can one expect from a school in which the girls all dress like streetwalkers and the boys are all granite-jawed jocks who are suffering from a major case of testosterone-overload? This cheapjack rip-off of 'The Karate Kid' even boasts its own version of Mr. Miyagi - a character-building mixed martial arts teacher who takes Jake under his wing, imparting two-bit life lessons while he instructs his pupil in the fine art of how not to get his butt kicked at school.The movie adheres to every single cliché endemic to the genre, including an arch villain whose super hot girlfriend switches her allegiance to the sensitive, misunderstood hero when it suddenly dawns on her what an irredeemable cad her boyfriend truly is. And all this is done to a surfeit of fighter-in-training montage sequences backed by a generic rock soundtrack.Sean Faris has sufficient charisma to make us care about Jake, and the always splendid Djimon Hounsou brings some much needed gravitas to the proceedings as the philosophy-spouting mentor. But the movie, as a whole, is just way too formulaic to engage our interest much beyond the ferocious and well executed fight scenes.If you're hankering for a genuinely great teen drama, check out the latest installment of 'Friday Night Lights' and skip 'Never Back Down' altogether.",4,0,1,27 March 2009
Despicable Me," fast-paced, colorful and inventive
","Gru, a Russian-born inventor and thief, desperate to be known as the number one villain on the planet, comes up with a scheme to steal the moon and hold it for ransom – all with the help of an army of cylinder-shaped minions he made himself. But Gru's life is eventually turned around after he adopts three adorable tykes whom he initially intends to make unwitting participants in his diabolical plan but who, instead, wind up making him question his own commitment to a life of crime.Directed by Peter Coffin and Chris Renaud, 'Despicable Me' is a colorful, witty and fast-paced animated feature that has just the right amount of humor, sentiment and moral lessons to make it a well-balanced treat for children and oldsters alike. The frequent and exciting action sequences also make this ideal viewing for those with deficient attention spans (which seems to include just about all of us these days). The design of the characters is clever and amusing, and the voice work – by Steve Carrell, Will Arnett, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, and a virtually unrecognizable Julie Andrews - is excellent as well.",7,0,0,6 July 2011
The Queen," an audience with Her Majesty
","'The Queen' provides us with a fascinating glimpse into the heart of a royal - or, in the case of Queen Elizabeth II, quite possibly the void where that heart ought to be.The movie takes place in the weeks following the death of the beloved Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 (Diana had just recently gotten divorced from Prince Charles, so technically, she was no longer a part of the royal family). It was during this period of intense national mourning that the Queen demonstrated that she had a tin ear when it came to gauging the mood and feelings of her subjects. For many days, as the grieving multitudes gathered outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, weeping uncontrollably and laying down a veritable sea of flowers in the Princess' memory, the Royals remained holed up on a country estate, voluntary captives to 'protocol,' making not so much as a single public statement acknowledging Diana's death or providing any words of solace to a hurting nation.The coldness of the reaction prompted many in England to seriously consider abolishing the monarchy altogether, once and for all consigning it to the ash heap of history as a quaint relic of a bygone era, an anachronistic institution that had long since outlived its usefulness. Yet, the film is much more sympathetic in its treatment of the monarch than that barebones synopsis would suggest, for more than anything else, it sees the queen less as a heartless monster than as an old-fashioned woman ill-equipped to deal with a modern world where baring one's soul in public has become the unquestioned norm and even a dignified solemn funeral is turned into a celebrity-laden, made-for-TV spectacle. She seems genuinely baffled and stunned by the unprecedented outpouring of grief over Diana's death, partly because of the queen's own animosity towards the woman whom she felt demeaned the court by many of her actions, and partly because the queen herself hails from a time when one did one's grieving in private, and when the sole role of a leader in a time of national crisis was to project an image of 'stiff-upper-lipped' stoicism and strength for her people.It would have been easy for writer Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears to have concentrated exclusively on the queen's aloofness and coldness, to have turned her into a caricature of the snooty, self-absorbed, 'let them eat cake' aristocrat. Instead, the filmmakers insist on seeing her as a fully rounded human being, strong willed and unemotional, yet capable of being wounded by the disapproval of her subjects and of extending a hand of compassion to others in her own uniquely subtle way.Small wonder that Helen Mirren has been showered with every conceivable acting honor for her incomparable portrayal of this complex woman. Mirren has been handed the challenge of illuminating a character who is, by her very nature, unimpassioned and undemonstrative. As such, the actress has had to rely almost exclusively on the subtlest of expressions and gestures to convey the brittleness, stoicism and genuine royal dignity of a woman who literally grew up in the role of one of the world's longest-serving monarchs (she notes early on in the film that the first person to serve as her Prime Minister was a certain someone named Winston Churchill). Yet, Mirren's ability to also show us the queen's compassionate and vulnerable side is what brings the character to life and engages our interest.Mirren is matched by the brilliant Michael Sheen, whose performance as the newly elected Tony Blair is every bit as mesmerizing as hers. Blair comes off so favorably in this film that one is tempted to suspect some sort of collusion on the part of the scriptwriter and the Prime Minister himself. As envisioned by Morgan, Blair is the perfect foil for the queen, a 'modern' man who is able to ever-so-gently prod her highness into saving her royal butt by doing the right thing politically. For Blair is, if nothing else, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, when all around him are calling for imperial heads to roll, shrewdly knows that a palace coup would not be in the best interests of England at this time.There are fine performances too by James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mum, Alex Jennings as a very milquetoasty Prince Charles, and Helen McCrory as Blair's straightforward, no-nonsense wife who can't understand how her Labor Party husband could be so willing to help the queen extricate herself from the rather sticky wicket she's gotten herself into. The film supplies a generous helping of actual newsreel footage from the time to effectively flesh out the context of the drama.Almost in spite of itself, the film winds up moving us, even though, in terms of style, 'The Queen' is every bit as dry, brittle - some might even say 'stuffy' - as the woman who is its subject. Which is precisely why - for all us Anglophiles out here in particular - it makes for such a jolly good show at the cinema.",9,0,1,27 January 2007
Blow," weak spined drug saga
","Coming as it does so hot on the heels of the brilliant, multi-leveled `Traffic,' `Blow' emerges as a superficial, shallow and second-rate survey of the drug-dealing world.  Spanning close to five decades, the film chronicles the true-life account of one George Jung, a hotshot cocaine trafficker from the 1970's who is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence for his crimes.Very little about this film feels original or authentic, as it travels a dramatic arc that seems totally predictable for films of this genre (`Traffic,' by the way, did NOT follow this path).   We start with George's unhappy home life growing up in Massachusetts in the 1960's, then it's onto his introduction to drug selling on the beaches of California, his trips to Colombia for meetings with the famous drug cartel leader, Pablo Escobar, his seemingly endless arrests, imprisonments and releases from prison and finally, of course, his too-late realization that the only thing of any value in his life is his little daughter whose life he is managing to screw up in a royal way.  The early days of his `career' - when he is just a young punk making his connections and getting his feet wet in the `glamorous' world of the burgeoning late-60's drug culture - are dramatized on screen with tedious predictability.  Even the youthful looking Johnny Depp may be getting a bit long-in-the-tooth to be portraying a late teen, early twenty-something beach bum.  The film picks up a little dramatic energy when George is introduced to Escobar, but this aspect of the film is dropped almost immediately in order to concentrate on the tiresome interpersonal backstabbing between George and a number of his drug-running cronies.  I realize that this is supposed to be based on a true story, but it is still a shame when the movie ends up having to downplay and eventually even jettison the one subplot that carries with it at least some dramatic validity.  Equally uninteresting is George's relationship with his wife, Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a stereotypical cocaine-snorting, Latina sexpot, more concerned with her drug supply than with her husband and daughter.  The filmmakers even try to draw some heavy-handed parallels between George's family (weak but loving father, emasculating, self-centered mother) and the family he has formed with his own wife and daughter.The biggest failure of the film comes in its clunky attempts to make George into some kind of admirable, sympathetic figure.  Fully the last half hour of the film is spent showing us just what an `innocent victim of circumstance' George turns out to be.  Even when he is trying his damnedest to go straight, the vagaries of fate keep conspiring against him to draw him back into the world of crime and prison.  We are supposed to feel sorry for him because he can't seem to get his life together well enough to be able to raise the daughter he so obviously loves.  Yet, when he is finally given the chance to prove his love to her by supporting her and her mother financially, what does he end up doing but arranging for yet another (and in this case abortive) drug deal.  It is one thing to provide us with an emotionally complex, morally ambiguous character.  It is quite another to expect us to feel pity for a man whose modus operandi is that of sheer stupidity.  All our empathy for the character ends up flying out the window and all we can do basically is to feel that the character got what was coming to him.As George, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking through the part, although it may not be entirely his fault.  Writers Bruce Porter and David McKenna and director Ted Demme never establish that feeling of explosive dramatic intensity so crucial to a film of this nature.  In fact, for a film dealing with the dangerous world of drug trafficking, `Blow' seems to just sit there lackadaisically on the screen for most of its duration, devoid of energy, tension and drama. Needless to say, `Blow' ain't no `Traffic.'",Null,1,2,10 November 2001
1408," Top notch supernatural thriller
","If your horror movie tastes run less towards chainsaw-wielding maniacs and more towards things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, then this is the movie for you. Based on a short story by the great Stephen King, '1408' is one of the genuine movie sleepers of summer 2007.John Cusack gives a tour-de-force performance as Mike Enslin, a successful writer who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity with a particular emphasis on hotel rooms that have the reputation for being haunted. The twist is that Enslin is, essentially, a nonbeliever who spends most of his time and energy debunking the very subject off which he is making his living. The 1408 of the title refers to a room in a swanky, five-star Manhattan hotel in which, we are told, no fewer than fifty-six guests checked in but never checked out, having met their untimely demises there in the decades since the establishment opened. Determined to put an end to the 'foolishness,' Enslin moves into the room convinced he will ride out the night in utter peace and safety. He has, of course, another think coming.As adapted by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, '1408' succeeds mainly by keeping it straight and simple and by focusing so intensely on the character of Enslin and his relevant back story. The multi-layered plotting keeps us guessing from first moment to last, so that we never quite know whether what Enslin is experiencing is really happening or whether he is suffering some form of mental breakdown brought on by the death of his young daughter and the subsequent breakup of his marriage a few years back. Along with director Mikael Hafstrom, the master craftsmen responsible for the film's phenomenal art direction and sound recording draw us into the strange world they've created where nothing is quite what it appears to be and where we spend most of our time nervously scanning the edges of the frame to see what surprise is next poised to jump out at us.Cusack, who has long been underrated as a performer, gets the chance to really show us his acting chops in this role. He allows us to clearly see the fear and vulnerability hidden beneath his character's wisecracking, cynical exterior. Samuel L. Jackson and Mary McCormack also excel in the small but crucial roles of the wise hotel manager and Enslin's estranged but faithful wife, respectively.For those who can remember a time when fright films had more on their minds than simple blood and gore, '1408' is like a refreshing, restorative tonic on a hot summer day.",8,63,72,3 July 2007
The Iron Giant," nifty animated tale
","A young boy, living in suburbia with his single-parent mother, befriends a friendly outer space alien he finds in a nearby forest and teaches him to communicate while hiding him from both his mother and the diabolical forces of the uncomprehending military industrial complex bent on the interloper's total annihilation.Sound familiar?  Say one thing for 'The Iron Giant':  if you have to model your tale on an earlier film, you could do a lot worse than Steven Spielberg's timeless masterpiece, 'E.T. - the Extraterrestrial.'  The good news too is that, derivative as this new film is - it plays at times almost like a scene-by-scene remake of the previous film, - 'The Iron Giant' is quite a charmer in its own right as well.  It is a rare pleasure to see an animated film so rooted in the real world.  So many of them take us to such exotic places - for the obvious reason that animated films, by their very nature simply CAN, - that all too often we feel distanced from what is taking place on the screen before us.  By setting this film in the recognizable world of 1950's America, the makers establish a tone of unfrenetic charm and tranquility that plays well as a background for the sci-fi elements of the tale.  The film also becomes a beautiful reflection on the strange coexistence of scientific idealism and trepidation that took hold of the imagination in that early era of space exploration and nuclear gamesmanship - an uneasy amalgam that found its way into many of the science fiction films of the time.The dialogue in the film enhances the gentle tone of the story without resorting to either maudlin sentimentalilty or sardonic cynicism. Hogarth, the boy, is simply a curious, well intentioned young lad, a bit smarter than most perhaps but not a budding genius (one of the wittiest lines comes when he bemoans the fact that other boys tease him because he is so much smarter than them when really the only difference is that he STUDIES).  'The Iron Giant' manages to instill a number of such subtle life lessons as these without straining the point or becoming pedantic about it - although the 'guns kill' theme, obviously designed to infuriate NRA members, does come across as a bit heavyhanded.The use of widescreen yields a number of tremendously beautiful moments of visual splendour, and the giant himself is especially impressive.  Again, though, the animation is always placed at the service of the material;  we are not subjected to a barrage of meaningless flashy images for their own sweet sake.  'The Iron Giant' may feel overly familiar - and it will never replace 'E.T.' as the definitive version of this story - but it is definitely a film well worth seeing, an animated film that will indeed appeal to audiences of all ages.",Null,0,0,19 March 2000
Shrek," a delight from beginning to end
","`Shrek' is the ultimate fractured fairy tale, a film that manages to simultaneously honor and lampoon the conventions of its genre without becoming smug or condescending in the process.  For while it is sardonic, `Shrek' is never cynical, so confident and assured are its makers in establishing and maintaining just the right tone for a revisionist exercise such as this one.  The film certainly conveys a modern sensibility, yet it is a gentle sort of iconoclasm that allows us to enjoy the more conventional aspects of the story (the happily-ever-after ending, for example) even as we are laughing at the obvious absurdities contained within them.   
The revisionism begins with Shrek himself, as unromantic a figure as has ever earned the title of `hero' in a fairy tale adventure.  For Shrek is an ogre, plain and simple, an ugly, cranky, decidedly standoffish beast who wants nothing more than to rid his swamp of all the classic fairy tale figures (Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, The Three Bears, The Three Blind Mice et al), who have been consigned there by the dastardly Lord Farquaad, who is attempting to purge his land of all those bothersome folkloric personalities.  To earn the deed to his land and thereby have authority to evict the squatters, Shrek agrees to go in search of the beautiful Princess Fiona, rescue her from her dragon-guarded castle, and bring her back for Lord Farquaad to marry (thereby earning the latter the legitimate title of Prince of the Land).  Of course, every valiant hero needs his own wisecracking sidekick to accompany him on his journey and Shrek finds his in Donkey, a companion whose sardonic humor serves as both a thorn in the side and as a source of moral inspiration for the unlikely, often socially backward hero.It is hard to overestimate the seemingly boundless originality, ingenuity and creativity that have gone into the making of `Shrek.'  Here is a film that can truly be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  Children will revel in the glorious animation and the assorted lowbrow comic antics of Shrek, Donkey and even Princess Fiona, while more seasoned adults will delight in the sly in-jokes, bawdy innuendoes and clever anachronisms that pour forth in amazing abundance from the mouths of the characters.  There is never a dull moment, since the writers, William Steig and Ted Elliott, and the directors, Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, always seem to have new and clever tricks up their sleeves.  Donkey, in particular, is the most amusing and endearing sidekick since the Robin Williams genie in `Aladdin.'  
The script pokes marvelous fun not only at the whole fairy tale mentality, but also at the romanticized conventions of medieval life.  There are jousting knights, damsels in distress and an Inquisition-like rounding up of all those caught demonstrating any proclivity for the supernatural and the magical.  So much seems to be happening throughout the course of the film that a second viewing is surely in order, just so one can catch all those delicious details that might have slipped by on the first go-round.  (The gingerbread man interrogation scene is particularly hilarious).Despite its tone of sardonic playfulness, `Shrek' is, happily, not afraid to indulge in a bit of heartwarming sentimentality at times.  The romantic feelings that develop between the Princess and the Ogre are genuine and heartfelt, made palatable by all the flippancy going on around them.  In fact, Princess Fiona is very much a modern heroine, shrewd, matter-of-fact and able to roughhouse with the best of the boys this strange land has to offer.Special note must be made of the superb voice work, which is largely responsible for bringing these extraordinarily well-delineated animated characters to life on the screen.  Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad) and, especially, the brilliant Eddie Murphy (Donkey) all turn in bell ringer performances.In every area of the filmmaking process, `Shrek' excels like no general audience film since `Toy Story 2.'  Like that earlier work, `Shrek' provides audiences of all ages and all types with the joy that comes from seeing a superb idea superbly executed.  `Shrek' is an intelligent, witty and imaginative family film.  Be sure to catch it.  Films like this don't come along very often.",Null,0,0,2 December 2001
Saints and Soldiers," well intentioned but weakly executed
","Based on a true story, 'Saints and Soldiers' is an honorable failure, a low-keyed, understated film set in the closing days of World War II. Five men - four Americans and a Brit - are trapped behind enemy lines, desperately attempting to get a message to the Allied troops who are stationed miles away across a frozen wilderness.This is a small-scale war film in which character and theme are more important than battles scenes and big-picture strategy. This is both the strength and the weakness of the film, for while the men talk about God and the Bible and the brotherhood of man, the script too often feels as if it is straining to make a philosophical or theological point and not allowing the men to truly develop as living, breathing human beings. Instead, they come across too much like mouthpieces for their respective causes - the committed Christian vs. the cynical atheist, for instance. Although well-intentioned, the movie could use a bit more sophistication in both its dialogue and its characterizations. The revelations and lessons also feel a mite trite at times, as if we didn't already know that we are all just the same under the various and sundry uniforms, languages, accents etc. Moreover, the actors, for the most part, seem to be reciting most of their lines by rote.Although, in many ways, I admire what the makers of 'Saints and Soldiers' were trying to do - going beyond the surface concerns of the traditional war film to explore the psychology of the common soldier - the film, quite frankly, simply doesn't have the depth and intelligence it needs to bring it off.",6,2,5,12 June 2005
Fifty Shades of Grey," Not as bad as advertised but also not very good
","Based on the phenomenally popular best-seller by E. L. James, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' tells the story of a shy and sexually repressed - so sexually repressed she's still a virgin - English Lit. major (Dakota Fanning) who falls under the spell of a handsome yet extremely eccentric 27-year-old billionaire and corporate mogul named Christian Grey (a charisma-challenged Jamie Dornan) who just so happens to be heavily into S&M. As Grey slowly introduces her to the world of sexual pain and domination, Anastasia becomes more and more intrigued by what the attractive young man has to offer. But how long can this go on before her natural instincts for self-respect and independence begin to assert themselves and drive the couple apart?But don't harbor the illusion that their relationship is just about sex; there are trips in private helicopters, as well as iron-clad, no-disclosure contracts to be signed and prescribed diets to be followed. In short, this is a 24/7 master/servant relationship entered into by two willing partners. In fact, the movie underscores the irony that such dominant/submissive relationships are actually built upon the paradox of freely giving up one's freedom in an effort to be more free. The film also explores how being a part of a mysterious and often misunderstood sexual subgroup requires one to present one face to the outside world and an entirely different one behind closed doors - and the often debilitating effect that such a dual existence can have on a person's emotional and psychological well-being.Though the critics pretty thoroughly savaged the movie upon its release in early 2015, there are a few things I actually found myself admiring about 'Fifty Shades of Grey.' First, it scrupulously avoids many of the tired clichés and tropes normally associated with romantic movies. Second, it isn't afraid to present characters - Christian, in particular - who are often hard to like and identify with, and the movie appears to be content with that fact. Even beyond his fetishism and affinity for kink, Christian comes across as downright weird at times, and the movie doesn't try to soften or 'redeem' him over the course of the story. The authors make it quite clear that Christian is, at some deep psychological level, a pretty messed up person and that many of his proclivities are the result of the abuse he suffered at the hands of an older woman. I'm not sure this is necessarily fair to the people who comprise this particular sexual subgroup, but, at least as portrayed in the movie, it doesn't come across as all that erotic or appealing an avenue of sexual expression, especially when carried over into the non-sexual realm of their lives as well. In fact, Christian's obsessive need to control Ana becomes positively off-putting at times.Now onto the movie's defects. One of the weaknesses inherent in adapting a piece of erotica like 'Fifty Shades of Grey' to the screen is that the simulated sex scenes tend to become more clinical than erotic when visualized on film. Far from tantalizing or arousing us, the sex scenes take on the quality of mere curiosities, with the audience placed in the role of dispassionate observer rather than engaged voyeur. Moreover, to call the movie's pacing glacial would be doing it an injustice. So concerned are writer Kelly Marcel and director Sam Taylor-Johnson with not generating any real excitement or passion that they go overboard in the opposite direction, leaving us checking our watches (or cell phones) instead of becoming fully engaged in what is taking place on screen.So, in the final analysis, is 'Fifty Shades of Grey' an endorsement of the S&M lifestyle, or is it more in the nature of a cautionary tale? For the most part, I think it is the latter (I can't speak for the novel, never having read it). After all, as previously stated, Grey is portrayed as pretty much psychologically damaged, and Ana ultimately rejects the arrangement that threatens to turn her into little more that a slave, even if a voluntary one. The feminist ending also seems to hint at the notion that this is probably not the healthiest relationship for the young woman in the long run. The final shot certainly implies that Ana has opted to sever ties with the man who intrigued her initially. I guess we'll just have to wait for the seemingly inevitable sequel to find out for sure.",5,0,1,11 August 2015
The Wolverine," Dull plotting negates the movie's virtues
","Pity poor Logan, aka The Wolverine, that immortal lycanthropic mutant with retractable adamantine claws played by that Jack-of-all-trades entertainer Hugh Jackman. All Logan wants is to be left alone to live as a hermit, spending his boundless days working as a logger, brooding over his condition and occasionally talking to the dead wife he accidentally killed who shows up occasionally to convince him to do away with himself and join her on the other side (apparently, she doesn't quite get this whole 'immortality' thing).But like Michael Corleone in 'Godfather III,' every time Logan thinks he's out, someone pulls him back in. In 'The Wolverine,' that person is a sword-wielding Japanese seer (Rila Fukushima) who convinces Logan to travel to Japan to say goodbye to the aged and dying Japanese prison guard whose life Logan saved during the bombing of Nagasaki. But things are never quite as simple as they seem in the movies, and soon Logan finds himself involved with the Yakuza, ninja warriors, the man's beautiful young granddaughter (Tao Okamoto) and some pretty messy intra-family politics.Though it features some impressive sword fighting and some cool mano-a-mano fisticuffs atop a Japanese bullet-train, 'The Wolverine' ultimately feels empty and half-hearted, a soulless exercise done in by longwinded speechifying and mediocre plotting. Better luck next installment.",4,2,3,15 January 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Sharp drop-off in quality from the earlier two
","As 'The Dark Knight Rises' opens - picking up eight years after the events chronicled in 'The Dark Knight' - we find eccentric billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a rather depressed state of mind. He has essentially withdrawn from the world, given up his crime-fighting ways and hung up his Batman cape, having largely fallen out of favor with the citizens of Gotham City who see him less as a hero and more as an out-of-control killer. Only his loyal servant/father-figure, Albert (the venerable Michael Caine), cares enough to give him a swift kick in the rear-end every now and again to try to get him to move on with his life. All this changes, however, when the fascistic Bane comes to town, a figure so consummate in his villainy that he is willing to blow up the whole blasted metropolis with an atomic bomb if he doesn't get what he wants.Though Christopher Nolan's latest entry in the series is nowhere near as engaging or as gripping as the previous two (especially the second), the movie attains a certain historical and contemporary significance with its echoes of both the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street, though, oddly, the movie seems intent on putting us on the wrong side of history in both cases (rooting for a corrupt status quo and against a grass-roots uprising against that corruption).And, let's face it, Heath Ledger's Joker - one of the richest villains in all of movie history - would be a hard act for anyone to follow, and Tom Hardy's Bane, even with his mask and amplified voice, seems a mite tame in comparison. On his own terms, however, Bane is reasonably effective, if only because of the implacable nature of his evil, which manifests itself in his willingness to sacrifice masses of innocent people to enrich his own power.Thanks partly to the muddled politics and partly to the overstuffed nature of the storytelling, the movie never finds a way to fully engage its audience in the world it's created. In fact, in comparison to the narrative sturdiness of its two predecessors, 'The Dark Knight Rises' comes across as a bit of a messy affair overall, with subplots spinning off in all directions, with little gravity at the core to bind it all together. A case in point: while Anne Hathaway brings a degree of flirtatious charm to the role of cat burglar-turned-Cat Woman, the character as a whole seems like an afterthought, tacked onto the story to provide some counter-balancing romantic interludes for the sullen, all but monastic Wayne.The cast is rounded out by Gary Oldman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Aaron Eckhart and others, but, more so than in the two previous entries in the series, the real stars of 'The Dark Night Rises' turn out to be the visual pyrotechnics and special effects.",6,3,8,2 February 2013
The Croods," Lively, thoughtful crowd-pleaser
","A Stone Age family of six, The Croods live in a world where life is a nonstop struggle for survival and where anything new is to be feared and avoided at all cost. Or at least that's what young Eep (Emma Stone) has been taught to believe by her well-meaning but over-protective dad, Grug (Nicholas Cage). But Eep is a naturally bright and curious sort, and when she meets a cute boy, Guy, (Ryan Reynolds) living out on his own who's discovered this new-fangled thing called 'fire,' she makes it her life's mission to start venturing out a bit more on her own. Guy also offers her a more optimistic view of life and the future than she gets from her scaredy-cat dad who prefers to huddle with his family in a tiny cave safe from the threats outside. But when an earthquake destroys the family's cave, they are all forced to hazard out into the big bad scary world of threats by nature and hungry prehistoric predators.Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMicco, 'The Croods' is lively and fun and built upon the theme of learning to face one's fears and of finding the courage to move on to bigger and better things in spite of the potential dangers lurking along one's path..In addition to the amusing, nicely differentiated family members, there's the customary bevy of cute and cuddly prehistoric creatures (even the threatening ones are kind of cuddly) to make this a fine, non-threatening look at life in prehistoric times, fit even for the more impressionable kiddies.The computer-generated animation is clean, if not exactly envelope-pushing or spectacular, and it makes up in speed what it lacks in sophistication.",8,0,0,19 November 2013
Any Given Sunday," pumped-up but cliched film
","Unlike `Jerry Maguire,' which found a way to appeal to a broad segment of the movie going public, Oliver Stone's `Any Given Sunday' pretty much requires that one be a hardcore aficionado of professional football to really appreciate it.  Stone and co-writer John Logan deserve credit for attempting to create a comprehensive panoramic view of the sport, warts and all.  For example, they don't shy away from portraying the drug abuse and shady medical practices that run rampant both in the locker room and out. Nor do they minimize the detrimental effect that has come about as professional football has become more and more about obscenely huge salaries, product endorsements and individual stardom and less and less about the values of winning and sticking together as a team.Unfortunately, the canvas becomes simply too broad to keep all this profundity in focus.  For every sharp psychological insight into the people and values that comprise this sport/industry, the film provides half a dozen hoary clichés, stock characters and predictable plot turns that consistently undercut those quality elements.   Al Pacino plays the typical aging coach who, as his losing team begins to become the laughingstock of the league, must decide whether to bow to corporate pressure and remove the injured, aging quarterback (Dennis Quaid) or stay true to his ideals and demonstrate loyalty to his players.  Cameron Diaz plays Pacino's major foil as the hard-driven team owner whose only motivating factor seems to be the Almighty Buck.  By making this character a beautiful woman, the authors get to play it both ways:  they satisfy the feminists by showing that a woman can be just as ruthless and cutthroat as any man in a position of decision-making power, yet, by making her so evil, they also placate all those men who have been smugly assuring us for years that `professional football is no place for a woman.'  (The filmmakers even have her cry in a few places).  Around these two main antagonists swirl a dozen or so equally stereotypical characters including the nefarious team doctor (James Wood, in yet another of his one-dimensional villain roles), whose shameless disregard for the health of the players is set in obvious counterpoint to the righteous young intern (Matthew Modine) who is frankly shocked at this senior doctor's cavalier indifference to the Hippocratic Oath.  LL Cool J has a minimal and undeveloped role as a cocaine-sniffing rival to the upstart young quarterback (Jamie Foxx) whose lack of understanding about the role team spirit plays in a winning strategy provides much of the driving force of the plot.  Not only does Foxx give by far and away the finest, most intensely dramatic performance of the film, but also his character provides the few moments of really solid insightful drama in the entire movie.  However, so intent are Logan and Stone in providing an upbeat ending to the film that they completely abandon the truths of this character and send him through a 180-degree conversion that is never adequately dramatized in the screenplay. He simply awakens one morning a new man, all ready to take his rightful place as a rah-rah team player.  In fact, the neat way in which all the characters and loose plot ends somehow resolve themselves into the happiest possible outcome contradicts the tone of thoughtful seriousness the filmmakers have been trying to establish all throughout the film.This soft final section of the film is not the only element that undercuts the verisimilitude of the story.  For some reason, in a day and age in which Brand X has long since passed from the scene in the world of advertising and the most minor of sports films routinely use real life teams as focuses for their stories, Stone has opted to create not only a fictional franchise but a fictional league as well.  Moreover, because the team allegedly hails from Florida, the entire season seems to be played under the glowing auspices of blazing sunshine and balmy tropical breezes.  For a sport one associates with crisp fall weather and bone-chilling blizzards, this entire summer-like atmosphere seems a bit disconcerting.As a director, Stone buries the drama under a flurry of MTV-like stylistic flourishes.  Too cute by half, this pretentious directorial method merely serves as a device to distance us from the characters whose plights should be drawing us deeper into the film.  In the middle of quietly dramatic scenes, Stone intercuts, in rapid succession, utterly irrelevant shots of lightning storms, roiling clouds and even snippets from the `Ben-Hur' chariot race (as a possible sop to Charlton Heston who makes a cameo appearance herein?).  Similarly, the never-ending cacophony of blaring rap tunes cluttering up the soundtrack cannot cover up the essential emptiness of the film's characters and message.  Stone has rarely seemed so transparent in his facile slickness.   Even the football scenes are pumped-up beyond necessity.  Part of the beauty of the sport lies in seeing the players' movements as all of a piece.  In the visually fractured view that Stone accords us, he does not heighten our excitement and involvement, but rather diminishes them.`Any Given Sunday' is definitely a long haul and it does offer a few moments of effective drama scattered along the way.  But if you are going to devote 157 minutes to the subject of professional football, you might find that time better spent watching the real thing.",Null,1,2,9 September 2000
Iron Man," the way action movies should be done
","Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age). A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion. He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a 'merchant of death,' but he balks at being called 'the Da Vinci of our time'). Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity. Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and vanquishing the wrongdoers.'Iron Man' soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards. But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time. He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made 'Iron Man' what it is without him. Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory. These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen. James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in 'Iron Man' - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie. It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film. And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be. It's nice to see that somebody finally got things right.",8,9,14,19 January 2009
Bruce Almighty," God Almighty!
","`Bruce Almighty' is yet another `high concept' comedy starring Jim Carrey, this time as a self-pitying, put-upon TV news reporter in Buffalo who finds himself endowed with all God's powers when the Almighty Himself decides to take a little vacation.This material may seem tailor-made for Mr. Carrey's manic talents, but the makers of the film  screenwriters Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk, and director Tom Shadyac  have failed to discover any really innovative ways of approaching it.  When Bruce learns that he has the power to alter the world's reality at will, he spends most of his time playing foolish little parlor tricks on people who irritate him.  Carrey can still be wildly funny when the script calls for him to do that rubber-faced-and-bodied slapstick routine for which he is justly famous, but `Bruce Almighty' is not content to be a cynical, outrageous farce.  It also wants to be a `meaningful' love-thy-neighbor comedy, and falls down miserably in the process.  Morgan Freeman as God gets to do little but deliver high-toned, sappy homilies designed to make Bruce see the importance of the power that's been entrusted to him.  True to the formula  one that goes at least as far back as Frank Capra films in the 1930's  the film turns hopelessly mawkish and sentimental in its final third.  That would be forgivable had `Bruce Almighty' at least given us some cutting-edge outrageousness in its early stretches.Jennifer Aniston exudes the requisite amount of charm as Bruce's devoted girlfriend, but the role is hardly one to challenge this obviously gifted young actress (see last year's `The Good Girl').  And there are a few moments when the filmmakers seem to have latched onto a clever or creative concept.  But those moments are quick to pass and, before we know it, we are once again mired in the predictability of yet another manufactured, by-the-numbers Hollywood product.  An additional problem with the movie is that it often defies the essential credibility that even an absurdist scenario such as this one demands.  At least twice in the film, for instance, a flipped out, ranting reporter is allowed to stay on the air long after any halfway competent news show producer would have pulled the proverbial plug on him.   If it weren't for the presence of the gifted Carrey, `Bruce Almighty' would seem like just another `Bewitched' episode expanded out to feature length. Come to think of it, it feels that way anyhow.",Null,16,31,17 July 2003
Monsters University," One of PIXAR's best
","Monsters University is where creatures go when they want to be instructed on the fine art of scaring the bejesus out of unsuspecting tykes lying all snug in their beds at night. Yet, while many aspire to such a career, few are called. And no one wants to learn to be a first-class scarer more than little Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a short, green, one-eyed, retainer-wearing, utterly nondescript blob-with-limbs who frankly couldn't scare a bed sheet on Halloween. And it doesn't help that his greatest competition in the school's annual scare-off is a hulking furry brute by the name of Sulley (John Goodman) who comes from a long line of scarers. But in the great opposites-attract tradition, Mike and Sulley soon learn that they can achieve more by working together than working apart. This is particularly the case after they join a fraternity made up of other wanna-be scarers who are determined to win the contest against a half-a-dozen other teams of more reliably frightening monsters.'Monsters University' may not be as emotionally resonant or cerebral as some previous PIXAR productions, but this prequel to the 2001 mega-hit 'Monsters, Inc.,' is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever to come out of that studio - and that is saying a great deal indeed. It has terrific fun parodying the rituals of college life - fraternities, cliques, the high-pressured stress of exams - yet still manages to relate to the younger set's concerns with the need to be accepted by the 'in' crowd while at the same time finding the inner strength to remain an individual and to stand up for oneself and all the other misfits in society (think of this as a monster-sized riff on 'Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer').As this is a PIXAR release, it's practically superfluous to praise the wit and ingenuity of the script (by Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird and director Dan Scanlon), the beauty of the animation with its gorgeous collegiate-Gothic backgrounds, and the spot-on voice-over work that have long been the hallmarks of that studio's output. The all-star cast includes, in addition to Crystal and Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Sean Hayes, Helen Mirren, Aubrey Plaza, John Kraskinski, Bonnie Hunt, Bill Hader, and a whole lot more.So sit back, relax and enjoy the delicious treat that is 'Monsters University.'

Casino Royale," Reinventing Bond
","The long-running James Bond franchise gets a much-needed shot in the arm with 'Casino Royale,' a film which gives us, in the person of Daniel Craig, the least foppish, most rough-and-tumble 007 since the early days of Sean Connery. Here's a Bond who's more at home in jeans and a polo shirt than in a perfectly tailored Giorgio Armani tuxedo (though he isn't above wearing one, if the situation calls for it). Gone, too, are many of the high-tech gadgets and preposterous, over-the-top villains that had begun to push the series increasingly into the realm of fantasy and further away from reality.As conceived by writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and the seemingly ubiquitous Paul Haggis, Craig's Bond also has a noticeably darker side to his personality. The authors have gone back to the source here, to Ian Fleming's first novel in the series, 'Casino Royale.' This has allowed the writers to re-invent Bond almost from scratch as it were, and, indeed, the first scene of the movie - filmed in appropriately old-school black-and-white - shows us Bond literally gunning for his promotion to double O status (an agent can become an 00 only after he's successfully dispatched two victims). Yet, despite this Bond's seeming indifference to human life, Craig brings a vulnerability and depth of character to the role that nicely counterbalance the dry cynicism, flippant tone and callous womanizing that are still crucial elements of the character's mystique and makeup. Yet, even in that latter category, this new Bond deviates from the old one by striking up a genuinely romantic relationship with the beautiful Vesper Lynd, nicely portrayed by Eva Green.The main plot - in which Bond finds himself on the Riviera playing in a high-stakes poker game against a notorious small-arms dealer - is secondary to the tense action scenes, wry humor and moral dilemmas that make 'Casino Royale' a triumph for director Martin Campbell as well.After years of delivering one fine performance after another in a string of less high-profile but often very worthy films, it's gratifying to see Craig finally achieving the acclaim and stardom he so richly deserves with 'Casino Royale.' With the help of his fellow filmmakers, he has nearly single-handedly resurrected this moribund franchise and reminded us of just how good a Bond picture can actually be.",9,1,7,14 June 2007
Toy Story 3," a beautifully realized story about friendship
","Lee Unkrich's 'Toy Story 3' plays a little like an expanded version of 'Puff the Magic Dragon' crossed with Rankin/Bass' 'Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer' - with a bit of 'Stalag 17' and 'The Great Escape' thrown in for good measure.It's eleven years since we last checked in on Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie and all the other occupants of little Andy's toy box. Only little Andy ain't so little anymore, and as he embarks on a new life in college, his once-beloved companions fret over what is to become of them now that they'll no longer be getting the kind of attention and affection all toys need to be happy (actually they haven't been getting much play time at all for the past few years of Andy's adolescence). Woody insists that they must stay loyal to Andy, but the others fear it may be time to move on to friendlier, more kid-centric territory or face an ignominious end, thrown to the curb so some giant garbage truck can scoop them up and mash them into plastic pulp. Instead, through a series of crazy misunderstandings, they all wind up in the local daycare-center-from-hell (sort of a more sinister version of the Island of Misfit Toys), where they are placed at the mercy of both a band of overexcited toddlers and a bunch of sadistic playthings who rule the place with an iron fist. Only Woody manages to escape their evil clutches and, like the true cowboy hero of old, he comes up with a plan to rescue his desperate compadres from this virtual armed camp, ironically named Sunnyside.It seems redundant at this point to keep heaping praise on these Pixar productions, so let me just say that 'Toy Story 3' is a true crowd-pleasing delight, a witty, endlessly inventive, and visually stunning animated movie that works equally well for youngsters who are still playing with their toys and old folks who might well become inspired to head up to that old attic and dust off some long-forgotten buddies of their own. The voice work by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, et.al., brings each and every one of these charmingly diverse and beautifully differentiated characters to vivid life. We're so familiar with them ourselves at this point that they almost feel like they came out of OUR toy boxes. It's also fun watching the movie make villains out of some seemingly innocuous, even cuddly, toys like the embittered, strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the joint and a diaper-clad baby doll that serves as his loyal henchman.In addition to high comedy, Michael Arndt's script provides a careful balance of breath-bating suspense and heartbreaking sentiment (believe me, there won't be a dry eye in the house at the end), as it explores the universal themes of camaraderie, friendship and the importance of working together in a common cause.Whether young or old, 2-D or 3-D, at 'Toy Story 3,' everyone can be a kid again.",9,1,2,26 January 2011
La Vie En Rose," good film, great performance
","'La Vie en Rose' is the highly acclaimed biopic of Edith Piaf, France's most famed chantreuse, who died in 1963 at the tragically young age of forty-seven. With a childhood worthy of a Dickensian waif (ripped away from her alcoholic mother and raised in a brothel), Piaf began at an early age singing for her supper on street corners, first with her unemployed father then with a close girlfriend by the name of Momone. It didn't take long for Piaf's talent to be 'discovered,' and she was soon performing in cabarets and nightclubs, eventually achieving stardom on an international scale before the age of thirty. But, as appears to be the case with virtually all successful artists, Piaf waged a lifelong battle against a whole host of personal demons, prime among them booze, an addiction to pain killers, and an undying love for a man she could never fully have (the married boxer Marcel Cerdan). And, again, as with so many artists, Piaf suffered from that paradoxical combination of raging egotism and massive insecurities, resulting in a high-strung, temperamental personality that served to drive even her closest companions away at times when she needed them most.For the first hour-and-a-half or so, 'La Vie en Rose' is an impressively mounted but relatively conventional and undistinguished biography, charting the rise and fall of its subject though a complex (though occasionally rather confusing) crazy quilt of flashbacks and flash-forwards. But in the story's final act, as Piaf moves inexorably closer to the end of her life, the movie becomes a deeply moving and heartbreaking study of a talented woman brought down by the cruelties of fate (she suffered from crippling arthritis) and her own self-inflicted wounds.Clearly, the chief selling-point of 'La Vie en Rose,' written by Isabelle Sobelman and Olivier Dahan and directed by Dahan, is the stunning tour de force (and Oscar-winning) performance by Marion Cotillard, who inhabits the character so completely that we truly feel we are watching Edith Piaf herself in the flesh (an illusion enhanced by the filmmakers' reliance on actual Piaf recordings for the singing). Cotillard goes from portraying a budding and spirited young woman learning to survive on the streets to a decrepit old woman whose body has betrayed her - all without missing a beat. She is particularly impressive in the latter stages of the movie as Piaf, after years of illness and addiction, seems to wither away before our very eyes. Special kudos must also go to make-up artists Jan Archibald, Didier Lavergne, Matthew Smith and David White for some of the most impressive aging work I have ever seen on screen.The film itself approaches greatness only near the end, but Cotillard's performance is genuinely great throughout.",8,2,5,6 April 2008
Signs," almost perfect sci-fi film (SPOILERS)
","For approximately the first 90% of its running time, `Signs' is a terrifically entertaining sci-fi suspense thriller.  As he did a few years back in `The Sixth Sense,' writer/director M. Night Shyamalan shows that he has the ability to rethink old genres, mainly by providing enough philosophical ballast to help counter the more farfetched aspects of the subjects he is tackling.  In this case, the subject turns out to be those mysterious `crop circles' that have periodically dotted the world's landscape for the past three decades or so.   Shyamalan centers his story around a Pennsylvania farmer named Graham Ness (Mel Gibson) - actually FATHER Graham Ness, since we discover early on that the man is a former minister who has recently become an atheist after the sudden death of his wife in a grisly car accident (though his denomination is unspecified, one wonders why his former parishioners refer to him as `Father' and ask him to listen to their confessions when he was obviously NOT a Roman Catholic priest).  Graham lives with his two young children and his younger brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix).  One day they awaken to discover that some crop circles have mysteriously appeared in their own fields overnight.  As more and more of these strange images begin to spring up around the world, the thought that the earth may be facing an invasion from hostile extraterrestrial forces starts to take hold.It would be hard to overestimate just how effective Shyamalan is at generating suspense throughout the film.  For close to ninety minutes, we sit utterly spellbound as the story unravels itself, never quite sure where the author is taking us, but being more than willing to go to wherever that destination might be, fully confident that the author will not disappoint us (that turns out not to be the case, but more about that later).  Shyamalan has the artist's touch of being able to terrify his audience more through anticipation and indirection than through scenes of actual violence and carnage.  The creepiness of the imagery is what makes all this work.  The director can take the most mundane object and infuse it with feelings of portentousness and dread.  One thinks, in particular, of Phoenix staring into an ordinary cornfield, made menacing by the howling wind and the fact that we know something sinister may be lurking deep within it ready to pounce out at any moment.  Or of Gibson confronting an ordinary pantry door, behind which may be a creature too terrifying to even imagine, let alone do battle with.  The sound effects in the film are extraordinary, heightening the suspense tenfold by allowing us to picture the threat in terms that most frighten us.  Actually, Shyamalan reaches back to some pretty impressive earlier works for his imagery in this film.  There are echoes of `E.T.' in Gibson's journey through a cornfield at night, flashlight in hand, as he searches for a mysterious creature he has not yet seen but knows most likely exists.  We are reminded of `The Birds' and `Night of the Living Dead' when the family begins boarding up the house as a protection against the supernatural threat from the outside.  And, of course, there are elements of `Close Encounters' in the rural setting and of `Independence Day' and `War of the Worlds' in the sight of alien spaceships parking themselves above cities filled with terrified and bewildered citizens.   Yet, each of these images comes across not as slavish thievery, but as heartfelt homages to some of the most effective suspense films ever made.One intriguing aspect of the film is that Shyamalan does not provide us with a prologue to his story.  We are afforded no glimpses into the `normal' everyday life of this family before all this begins to happen.   From the very first moment of the film, we are plunged into the nightmare scenario. This corresponds nicely to Shyamalan's other two films in that he likes to create worlds that seem somehow off-kilter right from the very start.  The generation of atmosphere is clearly one of this filmmaker's greatest strengths.Yet, given all these undeniable virtues, what exactly is it that keeps `Signs' from being the masterpiece it so obviously wants to be - and that it falls just short of becoming?  I think the problem is that Shyamalan does such a fantastic job raising our expectations that we just can't help but be disappointed when the somewhat flatfooted resolution is ultimately unspooled before us.   For all his intelligence and talent, the author can't quite seem to get his theme and his storyline to coalesce into a profound, meaningful whole.  Graham Ness is obviously a good man caught in a major crisis of faith.  He has come to doubt not only the efficacy of prayer but of the existence of God Himself.  So far, so good.  But where does Shymalan end up really taking this theme?  Nowhere really, and that is the problem. The fantastic, sci-fi plotting ultimately seems too elaborate to be just making the simple point that life is not merely a series of random chance happenings and that Graham needs to go back to believing in God again. All of this just to show THAT?  Frankly, any number of events could have led Graham to this epiphany.  It wouldn't require extraterrestrials to do it. Given the devices used to get us there, the storyline starts to seem arbitrary and the resolution PALTRY (which was certainly NOT the case with `The Sixth Sense').  And in many ways, the final shot - of Graham once again donning his clerical collar - seems to ring untrue, since if the world really were to be made cognizant of the existence of highly developed life existing on other planets, wouldn't people be more inclined to turn away from the old time religious belief systems, which would most likely seem antiquated and unexplanatory, in favor of some new theological paradigms? In this aspect alone, the ending rings strangely hollow.Shyamalan has evoked extraordinary performances from his gifted cast, particularly from Gibson who hits just the right note of bewilderment, sadness and fatherly devotion to turn Graham into a fully developed, three-dimensional character.  Joaquin Phoenix provides humor and strength as Graham's devoted younger brother, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin all but steal the picture as Graham's resourceful and savvy children.   James Newton Howard has provided a variegated and haunting score, often echoing the great work by that all-time master of suspense music, Bernard Herrmann.
`Signs,' in the final analysis, is a flawed but still tremendously powerful and entertaining film.  Don't let the disappointing ending color your overall impression of the work.  Despite its imperfections, `Signs' clearly emerges as one of the outstanding films of 2002.",Null,0,2,21 August 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," the trials and tribulations of the rich and beautiful
","In his latest romantic escapade, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona,' Woody Allen, that wry purveyor of modern relationships, turns sexiness into a purely aesthetic experience. Of course, that's not all that hard to do when you have a cast of drop-dead gorgeous actors exploring the fine art of love and lovemaking in a drop-dead gorgeous setting.The two main women in the story represent diametrically opposed views of love and men. Vicky is the clear-thinking pragmatist who, when it comes to the opposite sex, opts for the stodgy and reliable type over the dashing romantic ideal - a preference reflected in her choice of fiancé, the stuffed-shirt Doug, whose dutiful dullness makes him a perfect fit for Vicky's middlebrow conception of domestic bliss. Cristina, on the other hand, fancies herself more as the free-living Bohemian type, a gifted amateur photographer who prefers the more 'dangerous' breed of man - one whose propensity for living life in the moment simmers just beneath the surface of a handsome appearance and smoldering sexuality.When they travel to Spain for the summer, the two best friends almost immediately find themselves entangled in a complex romantic relationship with Juan Antonio, an abstract painter who inflames the women with his cultured temperament, his devil-may-care attitude, his smooth-talking ways, his raw animal magnetism and his Old World passion for life. And as if all that weren't enough, we get a fourth ingredient added to the already spicy brew: Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's beautiful, volatile and possibly mentally unbalanced ex-wife whom the artist has clearly never gotten over - and apparently never will.As always, Allen achieves a remarkable complexity both in his characters and in his view of how romantic and sexual attraction actually work. This is reflected most intensely in the character of Vicky who, after a brief but sizzling encounter with Juan Antonio, comes to question her old willingness to settle for staid conformity and emotional security over all-consuming passion and romance. This, of course, puts her whole future marriage in jeopardy as well as her friendship with Cristina, once the latter becomes the live-in lover of Juan Antonio. But Cristina has problems of her own to contend with when an emotionally distraught Maria Elena pops up unexpectedly, taking up residence with the newly formed couple in Juan Antonio's home. With each additional twist of the plot, Allen brings new color and depth to his canvas, as now the complexities of Juan Antonio and Maria Elena's self-destructive love/hate relationship suddenly come racing to the fore.At times the emotions are so raw and close to the bone - and the truths about human relationships so pinpoint in their accuracy - that the movie becomes almost unbearable to sit through. Or at least it would if the tone itself weren't so consistently scintillating and lighthearted and the setting so eye-popping and sensuous. In fact, I predict that Barcelona - so richly photographed here by Javier Aguirresarobe -will be experiencing a tourism boom for years to come thanks to this film.Although it was Penelope Cruz who earned a number of awards (including the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress) for her work as Maria Elena, all the actors in this film - Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, Javier Bardem, Patricia Clarkson and Chris Messina - deliver rich, outstanding performances. And it may just be me, but the singsong, deliberately simplistic narration that Allen has attached to the story appears to be an homage of sorts to Truffaut's 'Jules and Jim,' probably the most famous romantic roundelay ever committed to film.The conclusion 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' seems to come to is that NEITHER approach to love really works in the long run - that while too little passion in a relationship may lead to a life of endless regrets over unrealized possibilities, too much passion can result in burnout, serial infidelity and mutual self-destruction for the individuals involved.Perhaps, Friar Lawrence's advice to the impetuous Romeo and Juliet - 'Therefore, love moderately: long love doth so; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow' - was right after all.",8,1,3,9 May 2009
Sweet and Lowdown," minor Allen work
","Minor Woody Allen is better than no Woody Allen, I suppose, but `Sweet and Lowdown' raises the question of whether being as prolific as Allen has been in his moviemaking career has actually begun to diminish him as an artist. Is it better to be a Stanley Kubrick or a Terrance Malick, producing films sparingly and with long intervals between them, or someone like Allen who, for the most part, releases a film every six to twelve months, almost without giving the previous film time to vacate the theater?  Is it indeed possible for a creative genius to eventually run dry in his inspiration and thereby suffer from the law of diminishing returns?  For fans of the more dilatory directors, the wait between works may be grueling and aggravating but, at least, those devotees don't end up taking the artists for granted. In Allen's case, one fears that, when his career is done and his entire body of work evaluated, it will seem to be a plain - an elevated one it is true - but one whose peaks and monuments stand few and far between.Strike one against `Sweet and Lowdown' is the fact that Allen himself does not appear as a character in the story (he does, however, make a few brief appearances in interview form).  Something happens when Allen pulls himself out of the center of his films; they cease to be true Woody Allen movies and become strangely ordinary.  Endearing and charming as Sean Penn is in the lead role, the absence of Allen also means the absence of the dry, acerbic wit that makes the best Allen films so much fun.  Allen has always been better as a writer of first-person rather than third-person comedy. Somehow, the films in which he stays strictly behind the scenes lack the comedic passion and sharp-edged wit of those works in which he is up front and center stage.  This same problem occurred, for example, in `The Purple Rose of Cairo.'  Allen simply doesn't reach the comic heights he invariably achieves when he is writing for himself.Penn stars as the fictional character Emmet Ray, the second greatest jazz guitarist during the 1930's, a sweet-natured but lost soul who suffers from kleptomania, runs a second-rate prostitution ring, brags incessantly about his greatness - yet panics when confronted with the prospect of meeting the world's first greatest guitarist - and thinks watching passing trains and shooting rats at the local dump are the height of entertainment.  He also suffers from a deep-seated terror of emotional commitment, throwing up when his ever-loving mute girlfriend informs him she loves him, then flees in panic, breaking her heart and living on in everlasting regret for the foolish mistake he has made, letting the one true love of his life get away. All this makes for mildly amusing entertainment, but Allen's film often seems muted itself in its comic temperament.  Penn provides a stellar and delightful interpretation of this well-meaning but confused genius, yet the scenes themselves rarely make us laugh.  Having Ray's love interest be a charming but mute young woman may be clever and cute in its conception, but it leads to coyness and archness rather than depth and revelation.   We are, ultimately, left with whimsy rather than big laughs, sentimentality rather than character development.  All the people we are involved with seem merely to be acting out parts, not truly interacting in a way that is meaningful. Particularly annoying is the continual intercutting of musical `experts' commenting on Ray in pseudo-interview style, mouthing statements that, politely put, are simply too cute by half.  I hasten to add that, visually, the film is a knockout.  The set designers miraculously transport us back to a glorious time of elegance and style, recreating, among other things, the haunting beauty of a stroll down a beach boardwalk in the 1920's and 30's.  There is a spareness and simplicity to the art direction and set decoration that works more effectively than the crass visual overstatement that afflicts so many big budget period pieces.
Yet, for all its virtues, `Sweet and Lowdown' somehow falls flat, leaving the audience bemused but strangely unexhilarated.   Perhaps, Allen does best when he injects his own unique brand of clear-eyed cynicism into the world of heartbreaking romance (just the combination that made `Annie Hall' such a timeless masterpiece).  Here there is simply too much `sweet' and not enough `lowdown.'",Null,1,2,5 July 2000
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," somewhat better than advertised
","'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' picks up pretty much where 1998's 'Elizabeth' left off. The time is 1588, a full thirty years into Elizabeth I's phenomenal reign as Queen of England. On the continent, Europe is caught in the grip of a papal-decreed Holy War, while, in Britain, the Virgin Queen faces numerous threats to her throne and person from enemies both within her realm and without. The latter include King Phillip of Spain, who views the Protestant Elizabeth as nothing less than the devil himself come in female guise to tear down the one true apostolic faith, while the former consist mainly of her own disgruntled citizens, loyal to the Catholic Scottish queen (and Elizabeth's own cousin), Mary Stuart, currently being held prisoner for suspected acts of sedition against the Crown.Whereas the first 'Elizabeth' was a remarkably dark and brooding study of the times in which it was set, this follow-up takes a much more feel-good approach to the era (despite the occasional torture sequence or the random tongue-removal or beheading). Returning as director, Shekhar Kapur has mounted this film with an eye toward mass audience consumption, focusing far more on the rather jejune - and largely fictionalized - romantic escapades of the Queen and Sir Walter Raleigh, than on the far more intriguing sociopolitical issues of the time. The scenes depicting this more or less 'platonic' love affair are the most poorly written in the film, utilizing dialogue that ranges from the pedestrian and the pretentious to the downright laughable and silly. Clive Owen certainly looks dashing enough as the legendary, cloak-dropping 'pirate,' Sir Walter, but he plays him with such an Errol Flynn air and demeanor that he quickly reduces the character to a movie-swashbuckler anachronism.Cate Blanchett, who turned herself into a virtual household name with her star-turn in the earlier film, scores a similar triumph in 'The Golden Age.' She helps to humanize a figure who has all too often been encased in wax when presented on screen. In an obvious effort to make her more 'identifiable' to modern audiences, the writers, William Nicholson and Michael Hirst, may have erred in making her just a mite too petulant and petty at times, but Blanchet is scrupulously careful to avoid crossing the line into buffoonery at any point in the film. This Elizabeth is definitely feeling the burdens of her position and she often finds herself caught between reveling in her position of authority and privilege and secretly desiring the unscrutinized life of the anonymous, 'regular' commoner. The always reliable Geoffrey Rush also returns as her now-aging adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham.Yet, for all its flaws, and despite its tendency to wander off into the realm of soap opera and melodrama a bit too often, 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining piece of historical drama, and certainly nowhere near the unmitigated disaster many critics have accused it of being. For despite the extreme elaborateness of its clothing and sets, the film never really devolves into a stagnant or stale costume drama, thanks, in large part, to the richness of Blanchett's performance and to the reasonably fast-paced nature of the narrative. Luckily for the audience, Kapur keeps the movie going by never dwelling too long on any given scene. (I do wish, however, that he had toned down the music a scosh.)There's no question that the first 'Elizabeth' was a genuinely great film. Yet, while this second installment may not be quite as 'golden' as either its title or its pedigree might lead one to believe, it's still hard to resist the lure of that olde Elizabethan magic.",7,1,10,13 October 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Fantastic is certainly the word for it, all right
","For those who've grown just a wee bit tired of all those 'family-friendly' animated features we've been inundated with over the years, I commend to you 'Fantastic Mr. Fox,' Wes Anderson's sly little creation that, for once, is aimed less at the kids in the audience than at the adults. Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no 'Fritz the Cat,' and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic 'cuss' - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that? But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.Like Anderson's live-action works, 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and 'Rebel Without a Cause,' a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time.",8,1,3,4 April 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," proof that action-movie overload can be a good thing
","After a twelve-year-long hiatus in which he was off doing other things, Bruce Willis finally returns to his signature role of NYPD detective John McClane in 'Live Free or Die Hard,' a pulse-pounding action film guaranteed to confirm every paranoid suspicion you've ever had that humans are indeed at the mercy of technology.In this installment, McClane has gone far beyond rescuing people trapped in a burning building; he's moved into saving-the-world territory as he takes on a disgruntled security expert who, after his warnings about massive system failure are ignored by the United States government, devises a plan to bring society to its knees through a mind-boggling display of techno terrorism.Director Len Wiseman doesn't fool around when it comes to giving the action audience what it's paid good money to see; from the very first scene, he shifts into full-throttle mode and never once lets up throughout the course of the movie. In fact, so skillful is he at staging the elaborate action scenes that one barely notices that a mere human being like McClane winds up withstanding a tougher pounding than any genuine super-powered superhero ever have had to put up with even on his worst day. Indeed, McClane engineers so many hairbreadth escapes and arises unscathed from so many predicaments that would have killed a lesser man ten times over that we begin to think he should be given a comic book of his own for all his efforts.Clearly, credibility is never a very high priority for any action movie, and 'Live Free or Die Hard' compensates for its weakness in that area by being fast-paced, seamlessly stitched together and surprisingly good-natured despite the rather alarming body count it manages to pile up in time for the closing credits. Nobody embodies the sardonic, wisecracking, stoic hero better than Willis, and even in his early 50's, he displays an agility and athleticism that would turn many younger action stars green with envy. Willis receives fine support from Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Cliff Curtis and the beautiful Maggie Q. Although easily nine-tenths of the movie is straight-on action, writer Mark Bomback still manages to sprinkle in the requisite one-liners all such protagonists need if they are to be taken seriously as action figures, and he has fun with the irony that the bad guys with all their cybernetic gizmos and technological thingamabobs are no match for McClane's good old-fashioned ingenuity and brainpower.What would the world do without John McClane?",7,3,6,30 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," less cerebral, more conventional than the original
","`X2: X-Men United' is the widely admired sequel to `X-Men,' one of the finest movies ever to be derived from a comic book series.  The original film, in addition to being a superb piece of action cinema, dealt with such weighty issues as prejudice and alienation, showing how groups of people who are seen as `different' from the norm are often ostracized from and mistreated by society as a whole.  By creating an entirely new set of people to serve as its outcasts - in this case, mutants endowed with extraordinary physical and mental powers - the film was able to strip the issue of bigotry down to its barest essentials and to make us see anew just how great a part `irrational fear of the unknown' plays in determining the ways we treat others.  Quite an accomplishment for a film that was designed, essentially, to be little more than a commercial popcorn entertainment.This second entry in the series, though it has generally received more positive reviews than the first one, seems less concerned with message and theme and more concerned with action and plotting.  Part of the reason for this may lie in the fact that the initial film, because it was introducing both the characters and the concepts to the audience, was forced by necessity to deal with the theme in a more direct and comprehensive manner. Perhaps when it came to `X2,' director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter simply felt that the theme had been explored sufficiently in the first installment and that any further concentration on it would appear redundant.  The problem is that, without that added intellectual and sociological dimension, `X2' starts to feel an awful lot like every other comic book action film - heavy on adventure and special effects and weak on character development and point.  In fact, even with the added bonus of almost 30 extra minutes in this episode (it runs an overlong 134 minutes), many of the characters in the film do little but stand around and look helpless while a select few run around saving the day and getting all the valuable screen time.There's a wonderful scene about halfway through the film in which a teenage mutant boy `comes out' to his genuinely astonished parents, informing them that their `ordinary, average' child (whom they had just considered `highly gifted') has been harboring a deep dark secret within himself, a revelation that no parent would ever want to hear and no child would ever want to have to make.  The reaction of both stunned disbelief and reluctant acceptance (`We still love you no matter what you are') on the part of the boy's family speaks to anyone who has had to face a similar situation in his own life. `X2' could use more scenes like this one to help the audience connect better with both the characters and the events taking place on screen.   And it was scenes like this one that made the original `X-Men' soar as a movie, for that film really seemed to be able to zero in on universal aspects of human nature.  `X2' doesn't do nearly as impressive a job in this regard.Every so often, `X2' feels as if it too is getting ready to expound on one of its potentially intriguing themes - as when the President of the United States has to decide whether to take draconian action against what he believes may be a `terrorist' organization among the mutants - only to have the concern fizzle in a welter of action movie clichés.  After all, what could be more pertinent, timely or relevant to today's world than the threat of terrorism and the potential for civil rights abuses arising from the fear it causes?   Instead of making this premise the crux of their movie as they should have, the filmmakers drag all the characters over to some secret underground complex next to a snowbound lake to do battle with a pretty conventional villain and have them indulge in all the explosions, gun battles, kickboxing fight sequences etc. that are the standard accoutrements of any self-respecting modern day action film.People seem to be enamored of `X2,' even more, perhaps, than they were of the original `X-Men.'  I wish I could count myself among them.  But as one who genuinely loved the original, I must say that I am less than enamored with this particular installment.  I may be a minority dissenting voice in this regard, but I view `X2,' for all its special effects wizardry, as a disappointing missed opportunity, a film that fails to develop on a deeper level the great themes that were laid out for it in the original.  I have my fingers crossed for `X-Men 3.'",Null,14,32,20 December 2003
Moonrise Kingdom," enjoyable but ultimately overdoses on quirkiness
","Highly original in both concept and style -as is customary with a Wes Anderson production - 'Moonrise Kingdom' nevertheless proves that, even in the most skillful of hands, a little quirkiness can go a long way.Set in 1965, this surrealistic indie comedy focuses on two misfit children - one a twelve-year-old orphan and the other the daughter of two whacked-out parents - who run off to a remote New England island so they can live in isolation with one another, right as a hurricane is about to hit the area. The talented Jared Gilman and Kara Haywood play the two social outcasts, while the adults are portrayed by Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Harvey Keitel as an assortment of parents, troop leaders, detectives and social services officials. The irony is that most of the adults turn out to be even more bizarre and dysfunctional than the children who've run away because they just don't fit in.Co-written by Roman Coppola and Wes Anderson and directed by Anderson, 'Moonrise Kingdom' is overflowing with wit, striking imagery and on-the- mark deadpan performances. But the archness does get to be a bit much at times, and the atonal, emotionless line readings eventually take their toll on the audience.It's a clever and likable enough little trifle that, even at a relatively brief 94-minute running time, winds up overstaying its welcome. But the critics sure seem to love it.",6,2,4,30 March 2013
The Sixth Sense," solid suspense film
","The concept of people who are able to see the dead has served as the foundation for any number of suspense films in the past, including the greatest horror film of all time, 1962's 'Carnival of Souls.'  Now comes the most commercially successful of such films, 'The Sixth Sense,' which, although it does not begin to approach the quality of that earlier film, still emerges as a solid supernatural thriller that eschews graphic violence and gratuituous gore for understatement and thought-provoking creativity.Bruce Willis stars as a renowned child psychologist who has just been awarded a major honor by the city of Philadelphia where he works and lives. On the same night, however, a former child patient breaks into his house and shoots Willis while his terrified wife looks helplessly on.  Cut to a year later as a recovered Willis pursues his latest patient - a troubled child who harbors a terrifying secret: he is, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone, able to catch fleeting glimpses of dead people, whom the little boy argues, are not aware they are dead.  As Willis begins to slowly learn to believe the child, a warm relationship of mutual trust and bonding develops.It is this concentration on character rather than the more customary grue and gore that separates this film from so many other horror films of recent vintage.  Also, the director manages to create and sustain an atmosphere of slightly off-kilter otherworldliness through the use of visual correlatives: the eternally grey October sky, shots of creepy statuary or gloomy buildings caught at odd angles, a lyrical use of shadows, leaves blowing forlornly along an empty, windswept street, a glancing glimpse of a graveyard as it momentarily catches a frightened child's sight as he races by on a city bus.  It is these moments, taken as a tapestried whole, that give the film its cumulative suspenseful power.As to the film's widely heralded surprise twist ending, it will come as less of a revelation to those with a knowledge of such films as 'Carnival of Souls,' 'Jacob's Ladder' and 'Ghost' from which 'The Sixth Sense' seems to derive much inspiration.  Still, the audience does leave the film feeling that it has, at least, been in the hands of a group of filmmakers who respect its intelligence and have carefully thought out the elements of the narrative before rushing the production before the cameras.  In this day and age, that is a rare treat indeed.",7,0,0,24 October 1999
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Satisfying conclusion
","Thus endeth one of the most popular - and profitable - series in movie history. And the good news is that it ends more with a bang than with a whimper. For once we push through the clutter of wand-waving, spell-casting and jaw-dropping CGI effects that have been the hallmark of the works, we're left with a moving, deeply human tale of an honorable man (Daniel Radcliffe) putting his life on the line for those he loves.The movie finally reaches the climax that the series has been leading to all along: the fight-to-the-death battle between Harry and his arch nemesis, Voldemort, the man who killed his parents. The one criticism one might have with this scenario is that it essentially reduces most of the other characters - including the lovable Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson) - to mere onlookers of the action.As directed by David Yates, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Harrows - Part 2' has drama and action to spare, but it's the human element - along with an epilogue that hits all the right notes - that brings the beloved series to such a satisfying conclusion.",8,1,4,19 February 2012
Final Destination," imaginative thriller that overdoses on special effects
","`Final Destination' is a fairly creepy, moderately entertaining little horror film dedicated to the proposition that, although one may not be able to exactly `cheat' death, one may be able to beat it on its own terms fair and square  provided one can figure out the rules that is. 
The movie begins as a group of forty high school students and three of their teachers board a plane departing from JFK on a field trip to Paris. Immediately before takeoff, one student receives a premonition that the plane will explode moments after becoming airborne, a vision that manages to get himself and several other passengers safely off before the inevitable occurs.  But as Alex and his fellow survivors soon discover, Death is not to be avoided quite so easily, as each becomes the target of a systematic plan of elimination. If the details of the initial premise sound familiar, it is probably because they match almost perfectly those surrounding the downing of Flight 103 back in 1996.  Waving aside questions of taste and propriety  is it really right to use the details of a real life tragedy as fodder for a silly little horror flick?  let us concede that `Final Destination' taps into some pretty basic fears about the uncertain, random and arbitrary nature of Death.  The idea itself is enough to make us all stop and ponder the truth of our mortality and the truly tenuous thread by which we daily cling to this thing we call life.  But like so many horror films in the modern era, the premise is better than the execution.  The various deaths depicted herein become so choreographed and preposterous in their details that they actually end up diluting some of their own ability to disturb and terrify. Indeed, the more elaborate and high tech the death scenes become, the less creepy they seem.  We become bemused and detached when we should be cringing and empathetic.  Death simply has to work too hard in some of these scenes and the strain shows. Thus, for all its originality of premise, the film, by making Death seem like nothing more disturbing than a conventional special effects showoff, robs Man's greatest enemy of his awe-inspiring and overwhelming power and sting!",Null,1,4,18 March 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," a monumental achievement
","`The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' - though, in my view, not quite as compelling as the monumental `The Two Towers' that directly preceded it - is, nevertheless, a worthy conclusion to this one-of-a-kind cinematic achievement.  In the final installment of the trilogy, the hobbit Frodo, his loyal companion, Sam, and the nefarious cretin Gollum, are still heading toward Mount Doom to destroy the ring which threatens to hold the world in its diabolical grasp.  Meanwhile a whole host of other characters do further battle with the forces of evil massing to take over Middle Earth.Under Peter Jackson's skillful directorial guidance, never have the resources of cinema  cinematography, art direction, matte design, special effects  been marshaled with more effectiveness in bringing a fantasy world to vivid life.  As with `The Two Towers,' the eyes pop and the jaw drops at the sheer magnificence of the spectacle taking place on screen.  The seemingly endless vistas, sweeping camera movements, ferocious battle sequences and one truly terrifying giant spider offer some of the most visually astonishing moments in motion picture history.  It will be a long time before we encounter a film project of this size and scope again.What struck me most while watching `The Return of the King' was how Tolkien had created a view of the Middle Ages as it might have been had Christianity never existed  a view that film, by its intrinsically visual nature, only enhances.  As the camera scans the horizon, we are struck by the fact that there are no cathedrals, no country churches, no spires dominating the landscape.  In a similar way, there are no clergy present, no Christian symbols such as crosses or rosary beads, no sacred artwork  all visuals that define our image of the Middle Ages.  Instead of priests there are wizards and elves; instead of crucifixes, we find magic rings and New Age medallions.   `The Return of the King' allows us to re-imagine a period in history, bereft of the single most dominating influence that came to define that era.  It's still the classic battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil that have defined human history - but as filtered through Tolkien's Teutonic imagination and vision, that conflict becomes the stuff of mythology and legend.In the mass of special effects, it's easy to overlook the fine performances of Elijah Woods as Frodo, Sean Astin as Sam, and Andy Serkis as Gollum, who together provide the heart and soul needed to keep this sprawling epic tale life-sized and moving.   If truth be told, impressive as this film undoubtedly is, a certain  perhaps inevitable - fatigue factor does creep in during portions of this third installment.  Perhaps the elements that seemed so fresh in `The Two Towers'  the epic battle scenes, on a scale far grander than any we had ever before encountered, or the schizophrenic conflict between good and evil being waged inside Gollum's twisted psyche  seem like just more of the same here.  Unlike the second part, `The Return of the King' provides little that is new to take us to that higher level we keep hoping for and expecting.That being said, I must also add that the emotional impact of the final moments is simply overwhelming, as the characters we have come to know and love over the course of the tale engage in the most moving scenes of leave-taking and parting since `The Wizard of Oz' and `E.T.'  There are some who have balked at the sentimental nature of these moments, calling them anticlimactic and self-indulgent, yet after having invested so much time getting to know these characters and sharing in their adventure, the audience has earned the right to a bit of over-the-top sentiment, and I see no reason to criticize the filmmakers for pulling out all the emotional stops here.  If anything, these scenes demonstrate the intense bond Jackson and his crew have forged with their legions of loyal, appreciative fans.There's no doubt about it, taken as a whole, this nine-hour-plus saga of `The Lord of the Rings' is one of the great epic experiences of our time.",Null,0,1,21 July 2004
Munich," another powerful work from the master
","There could hardly be a film more relevant to our times than Steven Spielberg's 'Munich,' the master filmmaker's grim and controversial rumination on how violence only begets violence and how the philosophy of 'an eye for an eye,' when taken to its extreme, only winds up with two men who cannot see. It certainly wasn't a 'safe' subject for Spielberg to tackle, especially in the extremely sensitive post-9/11 world in which we live, but Spielberg has never been a filmmaker content to rest on his laurels and he certainly isn't doing so here.Based on the book, 'Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team' by George Jonas, the film uses as its starting point the tragic killing of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games. To get revenge for the murders, the Israeli government secretly hires a handful of assassins whose job it is to hunt down and kill those responsible for the act. Avner, the man chosen to be the leader of the operation, is forced to abandon his pregnant wife and later their newborn baby to perform his mission. As the body count begins to pile up, Avner is forced to question his actions, becoming more and more morally confused, guilt-ridden and paranoid as the story develops. Spielberg has been harshly criticized for being too egalitarian and non-judgmental in his approach, for implying a kind of moral equivalence between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I don't really feel qualified to answer those charges, but from an artistic standpoint, I believe the director has taken the right approach, for in art, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating and challenging than moral certainty. Spielberg certainly generates sympathy for the Israeli athletes who are the first in the movie to fall victim to the bloodshed, and the Jewish individuals called on to exact the nation's revenge are shown as generally righteous men motivated by a desire for justice and concerned that innocent victims not fall prey to their violence. It's true that the Israeli government doesn't fare nearly as well here, and it is in this area that Spielberg opens himself up to the most criticism. However, this is something for the more politically inclined to deal with. Those of us interested in fine film-making will have less trouble with this aspect.For as a movie, 'Munich' is a powerhouse of a drama, thanks to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's thought provoking, intelligent screenplay and Spielberg's incisive, tightly disciplined direction. The movie doesn't wander off into side alleys or irrelevancies but stays intimately focused on the characters as they go through the grim business of hunting down suspects, detonating explosives and even engaging in challenging moral discussions from time to time. Spielberg makes every moment count, whether it be showing us the intricate step-by-step process through which these men eliminate their targets or capturing a man's moment of joy and anguish as he talks on the phone to the little daughter he's never met. As a humanist, Spielberg seems less concerned with heroes and villains than with the devastating toll escalating violence takes on both the individual psyche and society as a whole. He seems to be saying that we're in all this together, and until we begin to acknowledge our common humanity, the peaceful world we all long for will never come to pass. The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the one by Eric Bana, who, as Avner, manages to make a complex and morally ambiguous character both believable and touching. 'Munich' is not an easy film for many in the audience to warm up to or sit through. It demands concentration and a willingness to look at some of the harsh realities of the world we live in with an open mind and unaverted eyes. But for those willing and courageous enough to do so, 'Munich' is a provocative and richly rewarding experience.",9,5,9,28 January 2006
The Matrix," uninvolving sci-fi thriller
","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives.  In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres.  Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of 'The Matrix', a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner.  What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail.  Unlike say 'Enemy of the State', which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, 'The Matrix' takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality.  Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies.  We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention.  'The Matrix'  borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time.  Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.",6,5,9,30 October 1999
Shall We Dance," winning romantic comedy
","The Japanese film, 'Shall We Dance?' was one of the most commercially successful foreign language films ever released in the United States. The almost inevitable American remake, now set in Chicago, follows the original very closely in terms of both storyline and spirit.John Clark (Richard Gere) is a successful middle-aged lawyer who has spent virtually his entire adult life devising wills for other people. He has a happy marriage and two teenaged children who adore him, yet something still seems to be missing from his life. One night, while riding the train home as he has done hundreds of times before, he finds himself transfixed by the image of a beautiful young woman staring out from an upper-story window of a second-rate dance studio. Intrigued by the sight, John musters up the courage to get off the train, mosey on into the studio, and sign up for dance lessons. As John begins to find meaning and purpose in his life, his concerned wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), fearing that he may in fact be having an affair, goes to a detective agency, headed by Richard Jenkins, to have the man she loves discreetly followed.Gooey moments and plot contrivances not withstanding, this is a sweet and charming film that, in its own quiet way, makes a profound statement about finding meaning in the second half of one's life. Although the narrative and humor often have a sitcom feel to them, the overall breezy tone and good-natured ambiance of the movie win us over anyway. And although many of the subsidiary people who populate this tale are really more caricatures than characters, at least they're colorful and well-delineated enough to add to - rather than subtract from - the central drama.Gere, Sarandon, Jenkins, Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale and Lisa Ann Walter all give winning performances. In fact, of all the actors, only Jennifer Lopez, as the beautiful young woman who teaches John a thing or two about dancing, falls short of the mark. Ms. Lopez, for all her other undeniable talents, simply has not developed an actor's confidence on camera, and, as a result, she is unable to rise to the level of the professionals.On the other hand, the dancing alone makes the film worth watching.",7,0,0,23 October 2005
Hart's War," slow, plodding POW film
","There's scarcely a believable moment in `Hart's War,' a World War II POW-drama that concentrates more on the internecine squabbles among the American prisoners than on the conflict between the captives and the captors.  Such an approach might have lent the film a certain amount of uniqueness and distinction had director Gregory Hoblit not driven it into the ground by turning the whole thing into a long, windy gabfest.  Indeed, except for a few promising actions scenes at the beginning, most of the film boils down to endless conversations between various characters and a tedious, drawn out courtroom drama that defies credibility even from the outset.  Even though Bruce Willis receives top billing in the credits, it is really Colin Farrell who earns both the lead and title character role as Lieutenant Thomas W. Hart, a somewhat pampered officer who has managed to rise in the ranks and to avoid real combat duty thanks to his influential daddy back home.  Riddled with guilt at everyone's seeming recognition of his own inexperience and cowardice, Hart soon finds himself a surprise prisoner-of-war in a German camp in 1944 Belgium.  There he is forced to finally prove both his mettle and his manhood when a couple of recently downed black army officers are placed into the prisoners' barracks.  Racial tensions quickly erupt leading to the deaths of two of the men under Hart's command.  Willis plays Colonel McNamara, a West Point careerist who, frustrated by his inability to participate in the `real war' happening outside, decides to wage a little war of his own inside the camp, using his very own men as pawns and weapons  even going so far as to allow an innocent man to die  in order to achieve his ends.Beyond the fact that the trial itself seems highly improbable given both the setting and the circumstances in which the characters find themselves, the director just never seems to be able to generate any real dramatic tension either in the conflicts among the prisoners themselves nor from the threat posed by the German commandants and guards, who seem far too weak, befuddled and accommodating to be very convincing as real life Nazis.  Despite the personal agonies experienced by many of these characters, the audience always remains outside the film's emotional circle, becoming little more than disinterested, detached observers.  We never feel much personal stake in the movie's outcome.  Part of the blame goes to the bland performances by Willis and Farrell (who is much more effective in Steven Spielberg's `Minority Report.'), neither of whom register much beyond surface expressions.  But the majority of the blame goes to the writers and to the director for allowing the film to become so inert, plodding and tedious that we lose all interest in what they are presenting.Despite its salutary dedication to the values of courage, honor and self-sacrifice, `Hart's War,' turns out to be a battle not worth fighting.",Null,1,3,11 July 2002
What We Do in the Shadows," Clever vampire parody
","Ever wonder how vampires always manage to look so spiffy and dapper in their appearance and attire even though they can't see themselves in a mirror? This and many similarly pressing ghoul-related questions are addressed in 'What We Do in the Shadows,' a macabre mockumentary about four roommates (Ben Fransham, Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh), sharing a home in New Zealand, who just happen to be bloodsucking creatures-of-the-night. Eventually, they're joined by Nick (Cori-Gonzalez Maceur), an unsuspecting victim who comes over for 'dinner' one night, then pals around with them after his transformation, and Stu (Stu Rutherford), Nick's human friend whose genuine likability keeps the foursome from turning him into one of them.Written and directed by Clement and Waititi, 'What We Do in the Shadows' is a fitfully amusing parody of all the conceits and tropes of a genre that has become a mainstay of popular culture in recent years - and that's putting it mildly. Some of those works have even been satirical in nature, but 'Shadows' ups the ante by setting its spoofery in the context of one of those slice-of-life documentaries so dear to the hearts of reality-TV aficionados everywhere.Like 'The Addams Family' and 'The Munsters,' 'Shadows' derives much of its humor from the domestication of our own bogeymen and fears, as well as the incongruity of a bunch of centuries-old (in one case, millenia-old) undead creatures living and relating in the modern world. Yet, while the humor is decidedly dark in nature - there is no stinting on graphic bloodletting being performed on innocent victims - it's also very clever, even though the movie does hit a point of diminishing returns after awhile, perhaps inevitably, given its somewhat self-restricting one-joke premise. Ultimately, though, it's an original and fun celebration of male camaraderie and bonding - even in its most outlandish form.",7,0,1,13 September 2015
Thirteen Days," gripping historical drama
","In just the past few months - since the United States has once again been put on a state of high alert after the September 11th terrorist attacks - `Thirteen Days' has assumed a position of much greater pertinence than it did when it was first released in theatres in late 2000.  What at that time might have seemed like little more than a quaint history lesson - dealing with issues and events from a bygone world and era - now suddenly throbs with a contemporary relevance it didn't have before.`Thirteen Days' derives its title from the two-week period in October 1962 when, during the famed Cuban Missile Crisis, the world was brought almost to the brink of nuclear annihilation.  In this Halloween horror to end all Halloween horrors, the citizens of the planet held their collective breaths as President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev faced off over the Soviets' attempt to employ nuclear weapons, aimed directly at the United States, in Castro's Cuba.The most admirable aspect of `Thirteen Days' is that the filmmakers understand the power of their material and feel no need to hype or gussy it up with irrelevant side issues or cheap melodramatics.  For 147 minutes, we are thrust into the center of this volatile moment in time as President Kennedy, his Attorney General (and brother) Robert Kennedy, and Special Assistant to the President Kenneth P. O'Donnell - who serves as the Everyman focal point for the audience - weigh what options they have in trying to avoid the hitherto unthinkable possibility of global, all-out nuclear war. Complicating their decisions are many of the contending forces in their own ranks - be it Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the media - all of which have a particular point to make, job to do, or political ax to grind. The film is fascinating just on the level of allowing us to see the complex and often ugly nuts-and-bolts aspect of high governmental drama.  Yet, although the film never wavers from the issue at hand, it manages to achieve remarkable depth of character as we see these three men of goodwill struggling with an issue of unprecedented life-or-death global importance. We come to see the toll such stress brings to bear even on men who, in our tendency to romanticize our heroes, often seem superhuman from our outside-looking-in perspective.Despite the fact that the movie rarely leaves its Washington setting, we are still afforded chilling images of life on the outside during these two amazing weeks:  anchorman Walter Cronkite intoning a bleak sign-off to his broadcast during one of the gloomiest hours of the crisis, hordes of somber Catholics queuing up outside a church where round-the-clock confessions have been instituted, and masses of people depleting grocery store shelves in preparation for the worst-possible-case scenario.Kevin Kostner as O'Donnell, Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Steven Culp as RFK all deliver superlative portraits of serious minded and compassionate adults who comprehend the gravity of the situation in which they find themselves.
What is most amazing about `Thirteen Hours' is that, even though we already know how it is going to end, we still find ourselves caught up in the tension and suspense of the situation.  Particularly gripping is the scene in which Adlai Stevenson, then U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., confronts head-on the Soviet ambassador who attempts to deny the truth of the allegations made against his country.  It is a moment of high political and emotional conflict worthy of Greek or Shakespearean drama.One wishes that the makers of `Pearl Harbor' had taken the same approach to their historical event as the makers of `Thirteen Days' did to theirs. Then we might have been spared the inane, puppy-love scenario that all but sank that later film.  Imagine if the focus in `Thirteen Days' had been on John having to break the news to Marilyn while a jealous, rheumy-eyed Bobby looked on from the wings.  Thank God saner heads prevailed and we have a film on this subject that serves both as a fascinating lesson in history AND as a gripping study of human behavior in a time of crisis.  Given what the world is going through right now, `Thirteen Days' emerges as a film deeply relevant to our time.",Null,0,0,5 January 2002
300," an advancement or a regression? You decide
","I guess it's true that everything old is eventually new again.In the early days of movie-making - thanks primarily to budgetary restraints and the logistical problems raised by having to work with primitive sound equipment - directors rarely ventured outdoors to film even their most epic-type adventures. Instead, they were forced to do their filming mainly on a soundstage, shooting their actors in front of a painted backdrop or - when it became available - a more technologically advanced 'blue screen,' which allowed them to add an array of previously impossible special effects to the picture as well. Then, in the 1950's and 1960's, facing stiff competition from a burgeoning new medium known as television, filmmakers turned to 'on-location' shooting as a means of both increasing the realism of their pictures and drawing people back to the theaters. This was seen as a great leap forward for the movies both as an art form and as a business. Now, in 2007, Hollywood would appear to have come full circle with '300,' a rousing sword-and-sandal epic that has been filmed entirely in a studio, using only CGI effects to recreate its ancient Mediterranean setting. Ironically, this is being hailed as a great 'innovation' by the very youngsters who would be yelling 'That looks so fake' at all the similar themed movies from the 1930's and 1940's. Go figure.If '300' has the look and feel of a comic book or video game, that is clearly no accident, for it comes from the highly acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The story is based on the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. between the Persians, with a fighting force estimated at between 60,000 to 300,000 soldiers, and the Spartans, with a force of a mere 300 (plus around 700 Thespian volunteers). The Spartans, trained from childhood to be professional fighters, ended up losing the battle but not before inflicting heavy losses on the Persian army and becoming a symbol and a source of inspiration for all those unafraid to march into battle despite tremendous odds against them.If it weren't for its unique look, there wouldn't be much to distinguish '300' from a hundred other action films. The characters are wafer-thin and stereotypical, and the movie evinces a kind of xenophobia that is more than a trifle disconcerting in a world in which relations between the East and West are none too friendly in the first place. All the Spartans, including their leader, King Leonidas, are light-skinned, noble warriors, while the Persians are dark-skinned, ignoble barbarians, whose general, King Xerxes, comes across as a lisping, mincing, make-up-wearing drag queen. The dialogue and narration, provided by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon, and director Zack Snyder, is invariably cheesy, corny and insufferably self-important, while the actors Gerald Butler, Rodrigo Santoro and Lena Headey pretty much fade into the obscurity of the computer-generated background.But trying to evaluate '300' apart from its visuals would be as meaningless as judging 'Jurassic Park' without its dinosaurs. For the look of the picture is what '300' is clearly all about, and on that level, the movie succeeds spectacularly. The sepia-toned images of roiling land- and sky-scapes, massing armies, and storm-tossed oceans are indeed something to behold and give the film an otherworldly quality that goes a long way towards mitigating the weaknesses in the acting and writing. Even the ultra-violent, blood-soaked battle scenes, though a trifle redundant after awhile, take on a legendary quality thanks to the unreal aura of the scene.'300' is an interesting enough experience as a one-time thing, but I hope it doesn't signal a long term trend in movie-making. Personally, I rather like the great outdoors.",7,3,6,16 April 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Even a surfeit of blood can't tarnish the fun
","Deftly directed by Matthew Vaughn, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is a nostalgic throwback to those early Bond days of the 1960s, when just about every other comedy coming out of Hollywood was a spy-movie send-up ('Our Man Flint,' 'In Like Flint,' 'The Silencers,' 'Agent for H.A.R.M.' etc.). This latest addition to the genre, based on the comic book 'The Secret Service' by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, tells of a spy agency so secret that even other spy agencies don't know it exists. Kingsman is made up of a cadre of highly trained, dapperly dressed 'gentlemen' spies who consider themselves to be the descendants - in spirit, if not in flesh-and-blood - of the knights of yore (they've even given each other code names like Lancelot and Galahad). That dapperest of dapper gentlemen Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, aka Galahad, a veteran agent who recruits a directionless youth (Taron Edgerton) from the streets of London - the son of an agent who over a decade earlier saved Hart's life - to train in the art of spying (like in 'My Fair Lady,' the eager trainee pipes in). Eggsy's first major assignment will be to thwart the dastardly high-tech plot of a crazed gazillionaire, played by a lisping Samuel L. Jackson, who intends to save the planet by eliminating the 'virus' (i.e., humanity) that seems bent on destroying it.The humor in the Jane Goldman/Matthew Vaughn screenplay ranges from brittle and dry to pitch-dark satire, so dark in fact that the movie occasionally threatens to run off the rails into a tonal train wreck. Luckily, however, it always manages to right itself just at the point where we're about to bail out on it. It's true that the violence may probably be a tad too graphic for a movie of this type but the overall spirit of good cheer and unalloyed fun triumphs in the end.",7,3,11,8 March 2015
Tarzan," fairly dull version of the classic story
","'Tarzan', the newest animated feature from the Disney studios, has gotten such universally positive reviews that it is a bit surprising to discover it actually ranks several notches below the best of the recent Disney fare. Lacking the sophisticated wit of 'Aladdin', the rich emotionalism of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame', and the frenetic imaginativess of 'Hercules', 'Tarzan' settles for a basically dull, straightforward take on the Edgar Rice Burroughs' legendary tale of a human orphan raised by gorillas who makes the jungle his home.Like many Disney films, 'Tarzan' continues the tradition of the sentimentalizing of nature, wherein wild animals become either cuddly lowbrow comics or mushyheaded preachers of strictly human virtues.  The message of 'Tarzan' - respect for both nature and the differences of other - is certainly an admirable one, especially for youngsters, but the heavyhandedness with which it is conveyed weakens its effectiveness.Much of the weakness of the film lies with its screenplay, which fails to deviate much from the formula we have come to expect from children's films.  Tarzan is, essentially, a misfit among his peers, trying desperately to earn acceptance from the 'stepfather' who refuses to acknowledge Tarzan's value as an individual.  Tarzan's childhood peers - a gorilla 'cousin' and a sissified elephant - are simply weak echoes of far more entertaining sidekicks in other Disney films.  With the arrival of Jane, her eccentric explorer father and the traditional muscled villain who wants to trap the gorillas and ship them back to England, Tarzan is forced to choose between loyalty to his own kind or to those who raised him.  This leads to dull romantic overtures, some impressive action sequences and even a little much needed wit in the interplay between Jane's father and the other characters in the story.On the positive side, Phil Collins has provided a soaring, driving score, which is beautifully orchestrated and recorded and which, wisely, is performed as voiceovers rather than in the more traditional form of character's themselves singing.  Moreover, much of the animation is impressive, especially Tarzan's swinging frantically through the jungle, and many of the backdrops are lushly gorgeous.It is hard for me to evaluate how well children will respond to this film.  For an adult, requiring a bit more imagination to help fill up the time, 'Tarzan' requires more patience than those with less time left may care to give.",5,3,8,11 August 1999
The Hangover Part III," Where are the laughs?
","It may be hard to imagine, I know, but 'The Hangover Part III' is an even worse movie than 'The Hangover Part II.' I won't bore you with the details of the 'plot;' just know that the movie begins with a giraffe decapitation, then goes downhill from there. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms play virtual straight men to Zach Califianakis and Ken Jeong, the latter as the notorious Mr. Chow, whose theft of $20 million worth of gold from mob boss John Goodman winds up getting all the boys in trouble. The least member of the Wolf Pack, Justin Bartha, lucks out yet again by being safely escorted off-screen for most of the duration. Clearly, he has a more influential agent than the other actors.The movie might have been better - and certainly more honest - if it had just been titled 'The Chow Show,' since he pretty much takes over every scene he's in - and not always to the movie's or the audience's benefit.If Hollywood had any mercy at all on its paying customers, it would immediately announce that there are currently no plans for a 'Hangover Part IV,' nor will there ever be.",3,3,6,9 December 2013

Honey," well-intentioned but silly film
","Credit `Honey' with at least having its heart in the right place  even if its brain isn't always so easy to find.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life  a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day.  She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video, a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis.  Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance, but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.  As is typical in these strive-and-succeed tales, Honey soon discovers that success is not all that it's cracked up to be when Michael reveals his true colors, setting up conditions for her continued employment that she hadn't quite counted on (in other words, `put out or pull out').  But the always-undaunted Honey is not about to be knocked down that easily.  She uses this little setback to start thinking less about herself and more about the street kids whom she sees turning into drug dealers and gangsters right before her rose-colored eyes. Filled with a righteous zeal and determination, she rallies the neighborhood to raise money for a new dance studio that can get the youngsters off the street, channel their energies in a more positive direction, and turn their lives around.Only the most Scrooge-like curmudgeon could object to the positive, laudatory, pull-yourself-up-bythe-bootstraps message the film is trying to convey, and one would have to be downright inhuman not to feel uplifted by the final dance sequence.  But good intentions and noble aspirations do not, in and of themselves, make for a quality film, and `Honey' is a long way from fitting that bill.  The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true, starting with Honey herself who, with her invariably perky demeanor, seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top.  Everything that happens to her  from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project  all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part.  We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.  Thus, `Honey' is really little more than an urban fairy tale, fine for children, I suppose, but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.  Jessica Alba is no great shakes as an actress, though she has an infectious smile and a bubbly demeanor that work well on screen.  But it is Zachary Williams, as the adorable, gap-toothed eight-year-old Raymond, who steals the show.   Now that is one hell of an endearing little kid.",Null,20,32,14 August 2004
Fantastic Four," not as bad as some have said
","Four so-called 'scientists' take a trip into outer space to study a cosmic storm passing very close to planet earth. Unfortunately, due to a freak accident, they are exposed to a dangerously high dose of radiation that plays havoc with their DNA. Once back on earth, they discover that they have each acquired some strange 'super power' which allows them to do 'fantastic' things. Reed, the leader of the mission and a first class 'commitment-phobe,' turns into some sort of rubber man, whose limbs can stretch to astronomical lengths; Sue, his ex-girlfriend, becomes the 'invisible woman,' able to appear and disappear at will; her brother, Johnny, a frat-boy practical jokester, suddenly becomes a human fireball capable of flying all over the city (he thinks that's really 'cool'); and Ben, Reed's practical assistant, gets the worst of the deal, turning into a Hulk-type creature who faces a life of loneliness and rejection because of his looks. The villain of the piece is a power-hungry CEO, who is also caught in the radioactive cloud and who is slowly but surely morphing into a literal 'man of steel' bent on - what else? - using his new found power to rule the world.'The Fantastic Four,' based on the Marvel Comic of the same name, is a hokey, harmless little time-waster that may appeal to superhero devotees with lax standards when it comes to movies based on such works. The real problem with the film is that the heroes spend more time talking about their powers than doing anything very interesting with them. There's a fairly nifty little fight scene at the end, but it takes way too long to get there for it to be really worth the trip. On the other hand, there's a breezy quality to some of the writing, particularly in the put-down exchanges between Ben and Johnny, which helps to compensate for the rather sappy conversations between the former lovers, Reed and Sue. And the special effects are very good for the most part.All in all, this is a minor addition to the over-saturated superhero genre, but it's also not quite the unmitigated disaster many critics claimed it was.",6,0,1,31 July 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," uneven entry in the 'Twilight' saga
","Written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by David Slade, 'The Twilight Saga: Eclipse' is the third installment in the highly popular vampire-cum-werewolf teenage angst-fest based on the novels by Stephanie Meyer.Although Bella's tiresome romantic predicament – should she choose the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) or the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner)? – has been pretty much played out by this time (it's what ruined the second film, 'New Moon'), the script here does provide an intriguing internal conflict for the young woman (Kristen Stewart) as she debates the pros and cons of becoming a vampire herself after high school graduation. She has to decide whether what she'll be gaining from such a move – eternal youth, a fulfilling life with Edward - outweighs what she'll be giving up – her father and mother, Jacob's friendship, and any hope of ever having a family of her own. The movie also ramps up the drama a bit when a band of out-of-control 'newborn' vampires start wreaking havoc across the Pacific Northwest, leading the more mature vampires and the werewolves – bitter, sworn enemies of one another – to join forces in defeating them.These 'Twilight' films lack the cutting-edge wit and irony one finds in a series like 'True Blood,' as Meyer opts for romantic sappiness over postmodern sophistication every step of the way. And the over-earnest and self-important tone leads to some intense silliness along the way. Still they do have their moments.",6,2,6,12 May 2011
Click," Capra with cusswords
","'Click' is a be-careful-what-you-wish-for comedy about a driven and harried, up-and-coming architect (Adam Sandler) who finds a unique and 'Twilight Zone'-inspired way to balance both work and family. On a trip to find a 'universal remote,' he stumbles into a Bed, Bath and Beyond (one would love to know how much money BBB shelled out for this product placement par excellence) where he meets a strange man (who else but Christopher Walken?) who gives him a state-of-the-art remote that can single-handedly control not only all his electronic devices but his life as well. For Michael Newman soon discovers that, just by clicking buttons, he can freeze moments or fast forward through all those little unpleasantries that can make daily life so burdensome and onerous. The trouble begins, however, when the remote little takes control and starts racing Michael through his life at warp speed.This is the kind of thing they used to toss off in a typical half-hour long episode of 'Bewitched' or 'I Dream of Jeannie' - minus, of course, all the cusswords, flatulence gags and dog-humping jokes with which the writers have seen fit to pad out the extra hour or so of screen time they need to fill. (Anyone who goes into 'Click' thinking that this will be a family-friendly film is in for a very rude awakening). Then, after about an hour of repetitive, sitcom-level silliness, the film takes an abrupt turn into Capra-esquire sentimentality, of the you-never-know-what-you-have-until-you've-lost-it variety. Yet, although the writing at this point has all the consistency of a melted marshmallow, this still turns out to be the best part of the movie - which tells you a great deal about the quality of the rest of the film. It's odd, too, because for all its we-are-the-world mushy-headedness, the movie can't resist taking the usual egregious swipes at Arabs, gays and overweight people.Sandler has done this sort of shtick so often in the past that he goes through the film virtually on auto-pilot. In addition to Walken, of course, the gifted supporting cast - which includes Kate Beckinsale, David Hasselhoff, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and SNL's talented Rachel Dratch do what they can with the material and provide shining moments that help us get through the whole ordeal. But 'Click,' on the whole, is mass-market movie-making done on a very low scale.",5,3,7,20 July 2006
Pineapple Express," Apatow still on a roll
","If last year's hits, 'Knocked Up' and 'Superbad,' were the movie-comedy equivalent of grand slam homeruns, then the latest concoction by producer Judd Apatow - this one entitled 'Pineapple Express' after some killer weed - is at the very least a solid triple. More contrived in its storyline than those two earlier films, but no less hilarious on that account, 'Pineapple Express' is the tale of two certified potheads, Dale and Saul, who are forced to go on the lam after Dale accidentally witnesses a murder by a big-time drug dealer.As both a producer and a writer, Apatow's distinctive trademark is lowbrow slapstick crossed with highbrow wit. In 'Pineapple Express,' Apatow and his co-scenarists Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg are not afraid to let their scenes run on a bit, resulting in a natural comic rhythm that allows the humor to grow organically out of the dialogue, characters and situations. This has been billed in some quarters as the 'pot comedy,' and while there are indeed many jokes that revolve around being stoned, the drug aspect is often incidental to what is really going on in the movie. Directed by David Gordon Green, 'Pineapple Express' joins a long list of recent comedies about men who refuse to grow up and accept the responsibility of being adults. Yet, unlike, say, 'Step Brothers,' 'Pineapple Express' never talks down to its audience. Even the slapstick is performed at a surprisingly high level of sophistication, and the movie features one of the most gut-bustingly hilarious car chase sequences we've encountered in quite some time. The movie stumbles only in its closing stretches when it abandons its character-driven humor in favor of action-comedy hijinks.Seth Rogen duplicates his comical Everyman triumph from 'Knocked Up,' while James Franco emerges as the most endearing stoner since Sean Penn first burst upon the scene in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' all those years ago.Add yet another one to the Apatow 'win' column.",8,3,8,8 August 2008
Inside Llewyn Davis," The Coens in a minor key
","Llewyn Davis is, what one of the characters in the movie calls, a 'loser.' That is, a struggling folk musician in 1961 Greenwich Village who's so bad off he doesn't even have a place to call his own. Instead, he's been reduced to sleeping on friends' couches for as long as they're willing to put up with him. Then it's on to someone else's place (he seems to have a rotation system set up amongst a group of regulars). Llewyn has also recently become a solo act following the suicide of his partner, and no one seems much interested in hiring Llewyn to play on his own. To further complicate matters, it seems Llewyn might just have impregnated his best friend's wife during a recent one-night stand, a woman, by the way, who really can't stand a thing about Llewyn, least of all the prospect of being a mother to his child.In comparison to the flamboyance of some of their more recent works such as 'No Country for Old Men' and 'Burn After Reading,' 'Inside Llewyn Davis' finds Joel and Ethan Coen at their most subdued, spare and inward-looking. More somber mood-piece than narrative-driven drama, this is what we get when the boys decide to compose in a minor key. As such, the movie may try the patience of some in the audience and appear too slight to others, especially with its lack of a clear-cut resolution come fadeout time. The movie becomes especially stripped-down when Llewyn heads off on his own to Chicago in search of a gig, sharing a ride with an enigmatic and eccentric musician/heroin addict played by who else but John Goodman (this IS a Coen brothers movie after all).Llewyn finds his identity and purpose in music and in the counterculture persona he displays to the world. The only trouble is that, while he feels superior to all the unenlightened 'squares' whom he sees as having sold out to the Man and to crash commercialism, he's still dependent on those people to lend him a helping hand. After all, what's the point of being your own man when you have to keep throwing yourself on the mercy of others just to find a warm place to bed down for the night? Llewyn's troubles seem to be the result of a combination of factors: a lack of ambition, grief over his partner's death, and his decision to hide behind nonconformity as a justification for never growing up and never accepting the responsibilities that come with being a man. It could also be that he's just a bit of a jerk by nature.Oscar Isaac gives an effectively understated performance as the title character, and the rest of the cast (including Carey Mulligan, F. Murray Abraham, and Justin Timberlake) is fine as well. Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is starkly beautiful, especially in those scenes set against the bleak landscape of a wintry Midwest.'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't quite the engaging survey of the music scene or of Bohemian life in that specific place and time that the critics have claimed it is (the soundtrack is not really all that impressive), and it is no crowd-pleaser by any stretch of the imagination, but if you lower your expectations a mite, you may just get find yourself getting into its subdued portrayal of a social misfit.",6,0,0,30 March 2014
Sin City," generally effective comic book film
","Robert Rodriguez' 'Sin City' is a highly stylized adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who, along with Quentin Tarentino, assisted Rodriguez in the directing). The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain-soaked, crime-infested cities and narrated in florid fashion by a world-weary private investigator or gumshoe. 'Sin City' has that in spades along with deliberately arch dialogue, self-conscious acting and a visual schemata designed to knock your eyes out.'Sin City' tells the episodic tale of three virtually unrelated 'super heroes' (played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke) who take on crime and corruption in what is, as the title implies, a veritable metropolitan den of vice and iniquity. The three leads are supplemented by Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in various smaller roles.'Sin City' is far more about style than it is about substance, and, indeed, the story is the least engaging aspect of the film, often becoming repetitious and aimless and devoid of cohesion and unity. The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested. Filmed primarily in black-and-white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post-modern/retro look it needs to be effective. As in the 'Kill Bill' movies, the violence in the film is graphic but so highly stylized that we never take any of it very seriously, although there may be just a tad too much dismemberment for some people's taste - though, strangely, the people who are killed never seem to stay dead for very long in this movie. The art direction is less sensational than it is in many of these comic book movies, but the streamlined simplicity of the look keeps it from overwhelming the film.The child molestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film. Still, this is an intriguing and generally entertaining comic book movie that really does a good job recreating the look of the source material on which it is based.",7,2,5,30 April 2006
Gangs of New York," great filmmaking overcomes banal story
","Finding yourself brooding over the sorry state of civilization lately? If so, I would strongly recommend you take a trip to `Gangs of New York' and see how much worse things USED to be in the not too distant past.  The film is Martin Scorcese's epic paean to the Lawlessness That Made America Great, a theme most often explored against a Far West backdrop, out on the open prairie or in two-bit towns like Tombstone, Arizona or Dodge City, Kansas. Here it's been transferred to 1860's New York City, which in Scorcese's vision, turns out to be a veritable Dickensian hellhole of vice and corruption, a place teeming with rival gangsters, pickpockets, corrupt politicians, lawbreaking policemen, and even firefighters so obsessed with matters of jurisdiction that they do physical battle with rival departments while an unattended building goes up in flames behind them.  This is a world where life has no value and where a man's existence can be snuffed out without so much as a by-your-leave or a single person left behind to mourn him.  The members of these rival gangs make the Sharks and the Jets - who would make their appearance on the same turf a full century later - look like mere pantywaists in comparison.Visually, the film is a masterpiece, offering some of the best cinematography, art direction and costume design of any film released in 2002.  With the help of some master craftsmen, Scorcese has created a complete world unto itself, one that doesn't look quite like anything we have ever seen on film before.  The setting provides a stunning mixture of the real and the surreal, with everything from the clapboard buildings to the foot-tall hats deriving their style from extrapolated exaggeration. It is truly an astonishing, eye-popping achievement.The same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of the film, however. Based on a story by former film critic Jay Cocks, the screenplay by Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan and Cocks himself never quite achieves the level of greatness promised by the setting.  The main drawback is the story itself, which is basically just a trite revenge melodrama all gussied up in fancy period clothes.  Leonardo DiCaprio takes center stage as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man who, as a boy, witnessed the murder of his father at the hands of Bill `the Butcher' Cutting, the meanest man ever to terrorize the streets of this fledgling metropolis.  Bill, who is an expert with knives and other cutting instruments, is the man all the denizens of the section of the city known as The Five Fingers fear, and he is able to use that fear to make himself undisputed king of the area.  After a 16-year absence, Amsterdam returns to the scene of the crime, determined to even the score and make Bill pay for his offense with his life.Despite the glories of the setting, Scorcese is never able to bring the story itself to life.  Perhaps DiCaprio is just too weak and passive to make a very convincing foil for the hard-as-steel Bill Cutting (who seems heavily derived from Dickens' Bill Sikes character in `Oliver Twist,' a literary source that never seems too far from the minds of the movie's authors). Perhaps Daniel-Day Lewis is just too convincing in the role of villain to make it seem like anything even close to an even match.  Perhaps, too, the obligatory romantic plot strand involving DiCaprio with a miscast Cameron Diaz is simply too hokey to fit into the grim tale being told here. Whatever the reason, the core of the film turns out to be the weakest element of  `Gangs of New York.'  Moreover, the dialogue is utterly banal and uninspired, consisting mainly of syrupy platitudes and half-baked philosophizing.  Lucky for us, then, that the director has provided us with enough visual stimulation to keep us at least intrigued, if not quite fascinated, throughout.What does fascinate us, however, is all the historical detail that permeates the outer fringes of the story.  These include the ever-present backdrop of the Civil War, which keeps encroaching into the world these people inhabit, and the anti-war riots that tore virtually all of New York City apart - both of which the filmmakers use as a kind of macrocosmic comment on the petty battles and rivalries taking place in this hellish part of town.  In moments like these, `Gangs of New York' almost touches greatness.  Also of interest is the way in which the film highlights the fervid anti-immigration attitude that has so completely permeated the history of a country that, in a bewildering paradox, has always prided itself (in theory, at least, if not always in practice) on being the great `melting pot' for the world's downtrodden and disenfranchised to flock to - and the film reminds us of how prevalent that anti-immigrant attitude still is today in many quarters. Truly, some things never change.In some ways, this film might make an interesting companion piece to Scorcese's `Casino,' in that both films deal with the theme of lawlessness and corruption making way for legal conformity and respectability.  Each of these works, so distant from one another in time and place, manages to portray the kind of epic birth pangs that cities and countries often have to go through before they can call themselves truly `civilized.'  This theme is, undoubtedly, what led Scorcese to compose a kind of visual ode to New York City in his closing shot, his own personal valentine to a city that has suffered so much in the past few years.  It is his way of saying that, from such squalid beginnings, New York City has grown into the great cultural center that it is today and that it can be proud of its heritage and the people who helped make it.  After the events of 9/11, that is a very powerful and stirring sentiment indeed.Yes, `Gangs of New York' is a severely flawed film in a lot of ways, but it is also a work of vision and of almost unparalleled technical accomplishment that deserves to be seen.  Even if there is not much here to engage the mind or the heart, you can always feast your eyes on the glorious visions unfolding up there on the screen.",Null,112,150,26 January 2003
Windtalkers," great battle scenes, weak script
","There's been such a surfeit of war pictures coming out of Hollywood in the past few years that it's small wonder `Windtalkers' failed to ignite many box office sparks when it was released in the summer of 2002.  Famed action director John Woo has served himself well by mounting spectacularly effective and brilliantly orchestrated battle scenes, but the writers, John Rice and Joe Bateer, have let him down big time in the story department. Woo has flooded the screen with moments of uncompromising graphic realism, only to have them mitigated by trite dialogue, predictable ironies and corny melodramatics.  Both the director and the men who actually lived through the events of this true-life story deserve better.`Windtalkers' does have history going for it.  In World War II, the Allied Forces in the Pacific needed to come up with a brand new code that would be `uncrackable' by the Japanese.  The military decided that it would base that code on the Navajo language, thus precipitating the need to recruit young Navajo men to come to the battlefields as `code-talkers.'  The film focuses on one such man, Ben Yahzee, and the officer, Joe Enders, whose sole duty it becomes to protect Ben in battle and keep him out of the hands of the Japanese.  Joe, naturally, balks at the idea of having to perform `babysitting' duty on the front line, and he is not afraid to show Ben just how he feels about the situation in the early stages of their relationship. Joe has other problems as well.  Recently injured in battle himself, he also struggles with the guilt accrued from having led all the men of his previous platoon to their deaths while `following orders like a good Marine.'There is certainly plenty in terms of character and conflict for the screenwriters to work with here, yet somehow they never find a way to bring those characters or conflicts to convincing life.  Joe's initial reluctance to accept Ben is as predictable as his inevitable change of heart at the end.  And `predictable' is really the key word here in describing much of this film.  Are we really surprised when the most vocal racist in the group  who says `Injuns' aren't much different from the Japanese they're all fighting  has his life saved by the very man who's been the target of all his ridicule?  And don't we just know that a soldier will be gunned down the moment he offers a piece of chocolate to a distraught little Japanese girl? Or how about the fact that the two men, one white, one Navajo, who have been literally making beautiful music together  one on the flute and the other on the harmonica  demonstrating colorblind brotherhood in action, are cut down right next to one another in the same battle?  Thus, the unsettling, cluttered `messiness' of the battle scenes is undercut by the too carefully contrived nature of so much of the actual narrative.  By trying so hard to move and uplift us, the film feels manipulative and calculated when it needs to feel most sincere.`Windtalkers' might have been a more compelling film were it not for the lackluster, wooden performance Nicholas Cage delivers in the lead role. Cage has never been very adept at conveying complex emotions and his inability to provide any depth or shading to the psychologically tormented Enders goes a long way towards minimalizing the film's impact.  Adam Beach, on the other hand, brings a fresh-faced likability to the part of Ben, the Navajo, who, in many ways, takes on the Private Ryan role in the story. 
For all the amazing battle scenes in the film, `Windtalkers' may just be one war film too many for us to cope with.",Null,1,2,2 August 2003
Coach Carter," letting a thousand clichés bloom
","How is it that a film based on a true story can wind up seeming more like other movies than like real life? That is the question you may well find yourself asking during 'Coach Carter,' a two-for-the-price-of-one social drama that combines the clichés of the super teacher saga with those of the underdog sports story.Ken Carter was a small business owner who agreed to coach a losing high school basketball team in a rundown section of Richmond, California. What Carter discovered when he arrived on the scene was that the team was little more than an undisciplined rabble, its troubled players as unserious about life off the court as on. Through a tough-love regimen of high scholastic standards and grueling training, Carter managed to turn a motley group of antisocial delinquents into not only a championship team, but upstanding citizens and college-bound students as well. Despite initial opposition from both the players and the community, Carter eventually earned the respect and admiration of all. And if this plot synopsis doesn't conjure up memories of 'The Blackboard Jungle,' 'To Sir, With Love,' 'Up the Down Staircase,' 'The Bad News Bears,' 'Dead Poets' Society,' 'Stand and Deliver,' 'The Mighty Ducks,' 'Dangerous Minds,' 'Mona Lisa Smiles' and 'Miracle,' then you really haven't spent much time at the movies.Although there isn't a single unpredictable moment in the entire film, excellent performances from Samuel L. Jackson and a cast of gifted young actors elevate the film to a level higher than one could reasonably expect. Jackson provides such a strong, solid center for the story that it's hard not to be uplifted by all his inspirational words of wisdom even though we know that we are being shamelessly manipulated every step of the way. The film makes the pertinent, if not exactly earth shattering, point that low expectations in the academic arena lead only to substandard results. The opposition Carter receives from the community to his unconventional, though highly effective methods, provides some of the true drama of the piece.'Coach Carter' is way too long and doesn't show us much that we haven't seen countless times before, yet it's hard to get mad at any film whose intentions are as upstanding and noble as they are here. Don't go in expecting too much and you might get more out of it.",Null,1,3,4 February 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," enjoyable if occasionally outlandish melodrama
","Winner of eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 2008, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is like a Charles Dickens story updated to the techno-savvy 21st Century. The movie focuses on a trio of impoverished orphans living and loving and contending with a slew of heartless villains in the slums of Mumbai, India. Jamal, his older brother, Salim, and their compatriot, Latika, a young girl they take under their wing, undergo enormous trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in a world that has pretty much abandoned them to the vagaries of fate. In true Dickensian fashion, the story also provides generous doses of melodrama, implausible coincidences, hairbreadth escapes and heart-tugging sentimentality to help mitigate the suffering.Based on the novel 'Q & A' by Vikas Swarup, the movie starts off with a now 18-year-old Jamal being interrogated - and, indeed, tortured - by the Indian authorities who don't believe that an ordinary kid from the slums could be racking up so much money as a contestant on 'Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?' (he's fast approaching the 20,000,000 rupee mark) without somehow cheating. With this unlikely but clever narrative device serving as a framework, the movie then travels back in time to show the skeptical police investigator just how it is that Jamal does indeed happen to know the answers to all those questions.Written by Simon Beaufoy and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan and Danny Boyle ('Trainspotting,' '28 Days Later'), 'Slumdog Millionaire' somehow manages to push the envelope in the areas of plausibility and credibility without sacrificing its authenticity in the process. One moment it may be being brutally honest in its depiction of the effects of grinding poverty and cruelty on the human body and spirit - and the next it's indulging in the veriest of feel-good fantasies, as Jamal stands on the brink of the ultimate rags-to-riches fable, getting both the money and the girl, in the best Horatio Algers tradition. Yet, the movie never feels exploitative or compromised as a result of this dichotomy - a dichotomy, in fact, that clearly reflects the Indian culture of both wealth and poverty, traditionalism and modernity from which the story arises.The flashiness of the editing and the liveliness of the directing keep the film hurtling ahead at a breakneck pace, while the cast of mainly amateur actors - playing the children at various ages - engages our sympathy from the outset. Dev Patel and the gorgeous Freida Pinto are both splendid as the oldest incarnations of the two main characters. And don't step out before the closing credits, a fun and lively bit of Bollywood hoopla designed to send audiences out of the theater with a spring in their steps and a smile on their faces - a smile that is well and honestly earned, I must say.",8,4,10,14 June 2009
Gladiator," impressive spectacle (some minor spoilers)
","Hindsight is 20/20 - and in the world of movies that is as true of surprise box office successes as it is of unexpected box office failures.   Ridley Scott's `Gladiator' struck such a deep chord with spectacle-starved audiences this past summer that one tends to forget that the project itself was anything but a sure bet in its initial planning stages and that the studios and filmmakers who produced it took quite a financial gamble in bringing it to the screen.The good news is that `Gladiator' emerges as a respectable return to both a subject and a style of filmmaking long abandoned by Hollywood.  Here is an epic tale filmed with the kind of sweep and scope not seen much since the passing of David Lean - though `Gladiator' doesn't even begin to approach in quality that director's greatest work.  Still, this film offers any number of rewards even beyond its grand scale and epic vision.  Although one doesn't naturally expect profound psychological insights from a film of this nature, `Gladiator' seems to be a bit more character-driven than most similar multimillion-dollar extravaganzas.  Utilizing the same basic set of historical characters that were chronicled in the 1964 film `The Fall of the Roman Empire,' `Gladiator' manages to flesh out its principle figures in impressive and exciting ways.  Richard Harris as the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius sets a very high bar at the outset of the film.  Here is a man wearied by his many years spent spilling blood to keep his vast empire together who, as his death approaches, yearns to restore Rome to its basic philosophical roots as a peace-loving republic.  Fearing that his amoral son Commodus will be constitutionally unable to fulfill this wish, Aurelius appoints his premiere general Maximus (Russell Crowe) as his successor. Commodus, when he is informed of this decision, does what every self-respecting candidate for Roman emperorship must do - he kills his father and orders the death of his nearest rival.  But fate being what it is, Maximus is not quite ready at this point to bid a fond farewell to this mortal coil and he finds himself instead not only sold into slavery as a gladiator, but eventually earning a reputation as a crowd-pleasing fighter, his popularity far surpassing that of the emperor himself, much to the latter's eternal chagrin and frustration.The most fascinating character from a psychological point of view turns out in fact to be Commodus, whose innate weaknesses and insecurities serve as the underpinnings for his immoral behavior and actions.  Joaquin Phoenix does a superb job capturing the many facets of this complex character, seething with petty jealousies as he blazes a path to his own destruction and the destruction of the once glorious empire.  Unfortunately, Maximus as the hero fails to rivet our attention in quite the same way.  Though Crowe brings an impressive physicality to his role as a reluctant killer, the writers don't seem to be able to fully flesh out the character in the same way that they do Commodus.  We sympathize with Maximus' plight, but his internal motives occasionally seem too conventionally sentimental, particularly with that tiresome standard plot device - of seeing his loved ones slaughtered - that seems to be practically a requirement for reluctant hero characters.  Maximus is just never all that convincing as a central figure.  The late Oliver Reed delivers a dynamite performance as the ex-gladiator turned promoter but his quality of wry cynicism is unfortunately undercut by a final character turnabout that is strictly cornball Hollywood.  And it is nice to see Derek Jacobi donning a toga again after all these years since 'I, Claudius.'  (Another strange phenomenon: why does the penultimate image of the film replicate almost exactly the final shot from `West Side Story'?  I merely observe and ask).Although it doesn't approach the subject directly, `Gladiator' does make oblique reference, in its basic imagery of the arena and the bloodthirsty audience contained therein, to the paradox inherent in a culture that prided itself on its `civilized temperament' while at the same time indulging itself in so clearly barbarous a form of entertainment.  We are then struck by the fact that here we are in the beginning of the 21st Century finding our own adrenalin flowing at the very same sights - albeit with the comforting filter of make believe and fiction separating us from the ugly realities of the actual thing itself.  Who can avoid noting the stunning similarity in tone and image between what we are seeing here and what we see when we sit down to watch a boxing match or the latest episode of WWF Smack Down?  More than anything else, `Gladiator' becomes a bit of a mirror in which we see something of ourselves reflected (`Fight Club' did the same thing but in a more direct and intentional way).  The excitement of the gladiatorial fight sequences only serves to draw us in and make us complicit in the very same brutality we find ourselves decrying intellectually.  In many ways, Scott may be making a more profound comment than he realizes on a conscious level.  For that aspect alone, `Gladiator' deserves to be seen.",Null,0,1,14 January 2001
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Fun first half, bloated second
","I realize that the 'Transformer' movies are generally regarded as the non plus ultra of soulless commercial movie-making and that their popularity is supposed to presage the very demise of Cinema itself as an art form. But such an assessment fails to take into account the movies' sense of high-spirited fun, their playful wit and their over-the-top but sometimes amusing caricatures, human and otherwise (I can't speak for the universally reviled second installment, which I haven't seen).Part 3, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon,' starts with a clever premise: that the original lunar landing was really just an elaborate, for-public-consumption-only ruse to launch a covert operation to explore a spaceship - the one carrying the initial wave of autobots - that had recently crash landed on the surface of the moon. Now a new race of evil bots, known as Decepticons, are becoming activated, threatening to destroy the good bots and take over the earth for their own nefarious purposes.On the human side, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) may have saved the world in the past, but he still can't find a job. But mere unemployment can't keep an honest-to-goodness, dyed-in-the-wool hero from saving humanity once again after the evil creatures pretty much raze Chicago in a literal scorched-earth policy of rampant death and destruction.The one saving grace of the 'Transformer' movies - which would indeed otherwise be the epitome of soulless movie machines - has been their sense of humor, their refusal to take themselves too seriously (especially the first one). Unfortunately, the wit and fleet-footedness of the first half of 'Dark of the Moon' dribbles away in a welter of overwrought CGI effects and self-congratulatory seriousness towards the end. And LaBeouf gets stuck playing romantic lead to any number of automatons: his metallic buddies and his flesh-and-blood girlfriend Carly Spencer - and he isn't too terribly convincing in either role. But as an action comedy superhero, the kid definitely brings the agility and skills necessary to get the job done. Which pretty much describes the film itself, come to think of it.",6,0,2,18 March 2012
The Social Network," a movie of and for our times
","'The Social Network' captures the zeitgeist of the moment better than any movie of recent times.This Aaron Sorkin adaptation of the Ben Mezrich nonfiction novel, 'The Accidental Billionaires,' purports to tell the story of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, who rose from simple Harvard student to become the youngest billionaire in the world. I say 'purports' because clearly the movie takes certain liberties with many of the facts of the story (most egregiously, perhaps, the fact that Zuckerberg actually had a girlfriend during the time depicted here) and, thus, the movie isn't really all that valuable as a documentary account of the way things actually went down. What the movie does do incredibly well is to capture the mood of an era and to tell a compelling story for our times.One of 'The Social Network's' greatest strengths is its willingness to feature a protagonist who is not all that easy to like. As portrayed in the film, Zuckerberg is a brilliant, amoral, petulant, socially inept, overcompensating nerd who doesn't really care who he hurts on his way to the top. Yet, oddly, Zuckerberg seems to have no real yen for fame and fortune; indeed his initial impetus for creating Facebook seems to arise as much out of a desire to get back at his girlfriend for breaking up with him as to become rich and famous (those being mere ancillary benefits). Zuckerberg also spends much of his time trying to backstab those around him, including his best friend and roommate, Eduardo Severin, who is the initial source of funding for the project and who becomes the tale's ethical counterweight to the morally bankrupt Zuckerberg. But Zuckerberg is also eventually sued by the Winklevoss brothers, some fellow Harvard students, for allegedly appropriating their initial social-networking idea and making it his own. Zuckerberg's motive for being a first-class jerk seems to be jealousy born out of his inability to fit in with the 'jock' class at the school. Yet, every attempt he makes at ingratiating himself with others – particularly women – only serves to reinforce the sociopathic nature of his personality.Yet, there's something about Zuckerberg that keeps him from becoming entirely loathsome and that actually makes us identify with him to some extent. Perhaps, it's that very awkwardness - that inability to master or even understand the social codes by which relationships work - that makes Zuckerberg a more sympathetic figure than he perhaps deserves to be. As one of the characters late in the film says in assessing his character, 'You're not an a-hole, Mark; you're just trying so hard to be.' Or perhaps it's the subtlety and depth that Jesse Eisenberg brings to the role that results in that effect.'The Social Network' is like a fine Greek tragedy being played out in modern dress, except that Zuckerberg's 'fall' occurs mainly in the realm of human relationships and fineness of character and not of fame, fortune or status (since Zuckerberg still seems to have all three still pretty much intact at this point). When, at the end, the creator of Facebook sits all alone at a laptop, having lost the one person who was ever really a true friend to him, and meekly asks permission to use the law office's computer, we see the tragic emptiness of a man who's sold his soul to the devil – if, indeed, he had a soul to sell in the first place. It is that ambiguity that lifts 'The Social Network' above the traditional morality play and makes it speak directly to our time.There is literally not a single performance – whether major or minor – in this film that is less than outstanding. In addition to Eisenberg, there is tremendous work from Andrew Garfield as Eduardo; the perpetually underrated Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, the crassly manipulative creator of Napster; and Armie Hammer as the Harvard rowing twins (lots of CGI here) who fall victim to Zuckerberg's conniving - and become surprisingly sympathetic figures as a result. There are also fine performances from Rashida Jones ('Parks and Recreation') and David Selby (Quentin Collins from 'Dark Shadows' for the really old-timers in the audience), among many others.As director, David Fincher keeps the movie racing along at a breakneck pace while maintaining a complex balance between flashbacks and flash forwards that at no time become confusing for the audience. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also composed a simple but haunting piano score that nicely underlines the seriousness of the piece. Fincher and Sorkin make every moment count, and the final confrontation between Zuckerberg and Eduardo - in which years of unspoken resentments suddenly erupt to the surface - is the most dramatically explosive scene I've seen in ages.For all its topicality and relevance, 'The Social Network' definitely seems more attuned to the down side of modern technology than the upside (see the recent populist uprisings in Egypt), highlighting how obsessive social networking can lead people to behave in ways that tear at the very fabric that holds society together. After all, in the old days, one could vent one's grievances against others in private and be done with it. Now, with the ability to do near-constant blogging, our hurtful words, petty tantrums and malicious actions can go out to a mass audience, ruin other people's reputations, then come back and bite us big time in the end. That's the lesson Zuckerberg is forced to learn all throughout the movie - and it is one we would all be wise to heed.",9,1,2,24 February 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," impressive espionage thriller
","Matt Damon returns as secret agent Jason Bourne in 'The Bourne Supremacy,' a first-rate espionage thriller that boasts a fine performance from the always reliable Joan Allen as well.The character made his first screen appearance in the wildly popular 'The Bourne Identity' in 2002, a film based, as this one is, on a Robert Ludlow novel. Bourne is one of a handful of agents who have been turned into little more than mindless killing machines through a (now defunct) top secret mind-altering program. Despite suffering from a case of amnesia that has effective wiped out all memory of that time in his life, Bourne still has to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing all the horrible things he must have done while under the influence of the diabolical programming. As 'The Bourne Supremacy' opens, we find Jason living in India, trying to maintain a low profile as he attempts to create some kind of a 'normal' life for himself and his girlfriend. But, as always happens in these kinds of scenarios, reality intervenes, this time in the form of assassins sent out to kill him. As if that weren't enough, Bourne is also being hunted by some CIA bosses who mistakenly believe that he has recently killed two of their own agents. Thus, Bourne finds himself running for his life in a chase that takes him from India to Berlin to Moscow before the movie is over.With the Ludlow novel as his source, Tony Gilroy has written a complex screenplay that respects the audience's intelligence even when what is happening on screen doesn't always rate too high on the plausibility meter. Amidst all the convoluted plotting, espionage doublespeak and hi-tech hardware that are the standard accoutrement's for the genre, Gilroy manages to stay focused on the human drama at the story's core, as a man struggles to piece together the puzzle of his life. Allen makes an effective foil as the agent who first suspects Bourne of killing some of her undercover operatives, then comes to believe in his innocence. Director Paul Greengrass keeps the action percolating along, maintaining a high level of suspense throughout. He uses a hand-held camera to convey the desperation of Bourne's plight and the fragmentation of his mind, often showing us incidents and events from the character's own point of view inter cut with subliminal snatches of disconnected memories. In addition, the lively, hurly burly editing keeps the picture constantly moving forward. Personally, I could have done with fewer car chase scenes towards the end, since I have always found characters interacting to be more compelling than automobiles interacting, but I suppose that, when it comes to action film audiences, the beast must inevitably be fed. On the positive side, John Powell has composed a dramatic musical score that really knows how to gin up the tension at crucial moments.As an actor, Damon combines the seemingly paradoxical elements of strength and vulnerability necessary to make his character believable and touching. In Bourne, he seems to have found his perfect role.",7,0,1,23 May 2005
The Great Gatsby," A mixed bag
","Attempting to adapt a literary classic like F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' to the screen is always a tricky proposition. Just ask the makers of the 1974 version who got their rear ends handed to them for their efforts - by both critics and audiences alike. The risk, of course, is that devotees of the work will balk at any attempt to expand or modernize it beyond what is contained on the printed page. After all, great works of literature exist primarily in the individual's imagination, and the way one reader envisions a particular scene or character is likely NOT how another reader - or filmmaker - sees them. The result is that literary adaptations all too often turn into stuffy affairs, with movie makers taking the safest possible approach to the material in an attempt not to offend anyone while still trying to make the piece work in an entirely different medium.All of this is prelude to saying that when it comes to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of 'The Great Gatsby,' regardless of how one feels about the final product, one has to at least admire the chutzpah of the effort. (His trumped-up modernized version of 'Romeo and Juliet' similarly divided audiences in the 1990s).A high school English class staple if ever there was one, the highly prescient 'Gatsby,' published in 1925, is often considered to be THE archetypal novel of the Roaring '20s, focused on the party-like decadence, conspicuous consumption and spiritual emptiness of a decade sandwiched between a Great War on one end and a Great Depression on the other. At the center of the piece stands Jay Gatsby himself, the self-made millionaire who achieves the American Dream through a combination of dreamy-eyed determination and corrupt opportunism (with much of his wealth gleaned through bootlegging and gangsterism). Yet, for all the wealth and material possessions he's managed to accrue for himself, Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio) can never find true happiness until he re-connects with the girl of his dreams, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), an alluring Southern-belle he fell in love with while still a penniless officer in the army. In the five years since their last encounter, Daisy, who is willing to go a certain distance with a fantasy romance until the going gets too tough for her, has gone on to marry the brutish womanizer Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby, in that same period, has bought a mansion across the bay from Daisy's house, hoping against hope that she will one day wander into one of his parties and that they will be able to rekindle their love as if nothing had happened in the interim. It is to this end that he befriends his next door neighbor, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a naïve bondsman from the Midwest, who's moved to New York to make his fortune on Wall Street and who also happens to be Daisy's cousin. It is Nick who narrates the tale (in this version from a sanitarium after suffering a mental breakdown from the trauma of the events he's witnessed), claiming to be an objective observer of what's going on around him, but in reality casting moral judgments on the people he encounters all along the way.It's easy to understand why the filmmaker was drawn to the material in the first place. With its wild parties and overall air of carefree abandon, the era practically screams out for the Baz Luhrmann treatment. But does the novel? I'm not so sure. The problem is that 'The Great Gatsby' is about so much more than just unrestrained partying, and the director (along with his co-writer Craig Rearce) often seems oblivious to that fact. Luhrmann typically drenches his film in all sorts of visual razzmatazz, but the result is that the movie is so over-stylized that the characters are all too often reduced to caricatures and the whole thing to the level of a cartoon. The parties themselves become out-of-control orgies as seen through the lens of Simon Duggan's hurdy-gurdy, hyper-kinetic camera. Meanwhile most of Fitzgerald's nuance and subtlety are wiped away in the phantasmagoria. A case in point is the first appearance of Gatsby in the story. In the novel he literally sneaks up on Nick - and us - as just another anonymous and inconspicuous party guest who engages Nick in conversation. In the movie, his entrance is greeted with a literal display of pyrotechnics. The stylization extends to the décor as well, which often reflects 'Alice in Wonderland' more than 1920s Long Island. Nick looks like he lives in an enchanted forest attached to Gatsby's mansion, which has more turrets than Blahousie Castle and manicured grounds that would put the Palace of Versaille to shame.Viewed another way, however, Luhrmann's approach seems to make a certain amount of sense. The grandiose, over-the-top theatricality, and stiff, yet, at the same time, over-emotive acting are aptly reflective of the silent movies of that era. It's hard to actually evaluate the performances since the actors have clearly been instructed to ham it up as much as possible (especially Edgerton). At times, they come across as little kids engaged in dress-up and playacting. But in the context of this particular film, is that necessarily a bad thing? (I will say that Robert Redford cut a more impressive figure as Gatsby than Di Caprio does here).And there's one other thing that can be added to the movie's win column: its overall manic energy, which seems a direct attempt to avoid at all costs replicating the mistakes of the heavy, inert 1974 version.Luhrmann knows that he is treading on sacred ground here and he clearly doesn't care. He's going to give us 'The Great Gatsby' as HE envisions it and to hell with the rest of us. In this age of artistic timidity and over-cautious commercial calculation, that attitude turns out to be both admirable and refreshing when you come to think of it.",6,4,5,23 November 2013
Shark Tale," The True Chicken of the Sea
","Set on a reef that resembles a pulsating, bustling, underwater Manhattan, 'Shark Tale' is a reasonably diverting DreamWorks film that makes up in charm what it lacks in Shrek-level sophistication. Lets' face it: the 'Shrek' movies have set the bar awfully high for animated features and it's hard not to compare every new one that comes our way with those earlier works. Even with that caveat, 'Shark Tale' still manages to involve us in the world it's created and to make us laugh from time to time.Lenny (voiced by Jack Black) is the ultimate evolutionary anomaly - a great white shark who just happens to be a vegetarian. This is a particularly dicey problem because Lenny is no ordinary, run-of-the-mill shark; he is the son and heir apparent of a Don Corleone-type mob boss (Robert De Niro) who worries that his son may not have what it takes to assume his rightful place as 'godfather' of the sea. Down at the very opposite end of the food chain is Oscar, a fast-talking, self-described 'little fish in a very big pond,' voiced by none other than mega-star Will Smith. All his life, Oscar has felt like an unappreciated 'nobody,' until, one day, through an utter fluke of fate, he inadvertently finds himself heralded as a fearless 'shark slayer,' a position that gets him into deep trouble when De Niro and his henchmen descend on the reef looking to stir up a little trouble with the defenseless locals..'Shark Tale' doesn't have quite the sharpness and wit of certain recent animated films, but it is fast-paced and clever enough to keep us entertained for most of its running time. Many of the gangster movie references may be lost on younger viewers, but adults will smile in knowing recognition at the gentle bits of parody thrown in from time to time (we finally get to see that Luca's been doing more than just sleeping with the fishes all these years). The film is lovely to look at, with the urban aquatic landscape beautifully rendered in multi-colored splendor. The three leading actors provide lively and energetic voice work and they are matched by Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Martin Scorsese and Katie Couric in somewhat lesser roles.As stated before, 'Shark Tale' is no 'Shrek' in either the cleverness or laughs departments, but it should keep young and old alike entertained if not exactly enthralled.",7,1,1,30 June 2005
Hustle & Flow," movie never quite matches Howard's performance
","Terrance Howard earned a well-deserved Best Actor nomination for his strong performance in 'Hustle and Flow,' a modern urban fairy tale about a two-bit drug dealer and pimp who dreams of making something better of his life. 'D-Jay,' a singer/songwriter who long ago gave up his ambition of hitting it big in the music business, barely ekes out a living selling dope and pimping cheap hookers in his rundown Memphis neighborhood. Lately, he's been suffering from what he himself calls a 'mid life crisis,' as the realization has begun to dawn on him that his life is going nowhere fast. By chance, he runs into a high school acquaintance with some recording equipment who agrees to hook up with him and start cutting some records. But will D-Jay be able to break into an industry that seems closed to all but a select few hardworking and lucky enough to break down the doors? Although Howard hits all the right notes in his performance, the movie itself is never quite as good as he is in it. As written and directed by Craig Brewer, the film lacks the authenticity and grit that a sturdier, more seasoned hand (a Spike Lee, for instance) might have brought to it. The scenes often have an air of contrivance about them, as if Brewer didn't trust the audience to get the meaning without his spelling it all out for us. The storyline often veers dangerously close to melodrama (as in D-Jay's encounter with a big star hip-hop artist) and the dialogue often has that overly explicit, self-revelatory quality that makes it sound forced, unconvincing and phony. Moreover, with the exception of Howard, the acting is woefully uneven and even downright amateurish at times. One admires what Brewer is trying to do in the film - providing a sort of upbeat antidote to all the downbeat urban black dramas we are always being subjected to these days - but 'Hustle and Flow' never manages to convince us of its own authenticity.Still, the movie is worth checking out for Howard's acting, which is indeed rich, varied and amazingly subtle at times, and for some nice moments of emotion and insight scattered along the way.",6,0,1,6 May 2006
Warm Bodies," Now we know what all those zombies are REALLY thinking
","In the long annals of walking dead fiction, 'Warm Bodies' is likely the first work to ever actually get inside the head of a zombie. And it turns out his thinking process is not all that different from yours or mine - if you can just get past that whole 'I want to eat your brains' thing, that is.Skillfully written and directed by Jonathan Levine, 'Warm Bodies' may not be the first attempt at a zombie-movie parody - 'Shaun of the Dead,' 'Zombieland' and 'Fido' got there before it - but I'll bet it's the first to apply a 'Romeo and Juliet' template to the genre (his name is 'R' and hers is Julie, and there's even a charming balcony scene between the two to clinch the parallel). Nicholas Hoult plays a young walker who's been reduced to shambling aimlessly through the zombie-infested airport, playing vinyl records on the grounded jet he's converted into a comfy little 'home' for himself, and mulling long and hard over what it means to be living out one's existence as one of the undead. He's not exactly proud of what he's become, but he's pretty much learned to accept it - that is until he devours the brain of Julie's boyfriend, thereby appropriating his memories and falling immediately in love with her. Our unlikely chivalric hero thereupon takes it upon himself to become the young woman's sole companion and protector as she tries to make her way through this dangerous and hostile world. And as Julie (Teresa Palmer) and R grow together in closeness and mutual understanding, R slowly but surely regains many of those precious qualities that once made him human.Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, Levine's screenplay, with its romantic tone and wry voice-over narration, is a subtle, gentle movie parody rather than a smart-alecky one on the order, say, of the 'Scary' movie franchise or 'Date Movie' and such. And it works beautifully from beginning to end, thanks in no small measure to the extraordinary chemistry between Hoult and Palmer in the starring roles (and Rod Corddry is equally great as R's best friend among the living dead). Corpse or no corpse, it's been a long time since the ineffability of young love has been captured so winningly on film. And the movie caps it all off with a coda that is about as sweet and uplifting as anything you're likely to see at the movies all year, guaranteed to make you feel proud to be a member of a species that, for all its faults, can still be pretty darn terrific when it puts its collective mind to it.It's nice to be reminded of that every now and again.",8,3,4,21 July 2013
Cinderella Man," solid Depression Era drama
","Although the comparisons may not be entirely obvious at first, could it be that Ron Howard's 'Cinderella Man' is actually a sly, under-the-radar remake of 'Seabiscuit' - albeit with a boxer rather than a racehorse as its inspirational underdog character? In a performance of immense restraint and subtlety, Russell Crowe plays James J Braddock, a Depression era fighter who, at one point, was so hard up that he could barely afford to feed his wife and three small children. For awhile it seemed as if Braddock was all washed up as a boxer, a has-been whose body seemed incapable of taking any further punishment and whose glory days all lay behind him. However, when his luck turned and he began to make a comeback in the ring, knocking off one sure-bet opponent after another, Braddock caught the imagination of a suffering nation, becoming in many ways a symbol of hope and renewal for the beleaguered, downtrodden, out-of-work masses who flocked to his bouts or listened to them enraptured on the radio at home. It was for this reason that he was dubbed Cinderella Man by an astute and appreciative newspaper columnist.Let us say, first of all, that Braddock was no Jake La Motta, either in the ring or out. From what we see of him in the film, Braddock was a kind, gentle man who loved his wife and tried to be the best father he could to his adoring children. It is always more difficult to weave an interesting drama around a 'good' character than a 'bad' one, and Howard's film can't always overcome that limitation. Frequently the film feels a mite softer and less hard-edged than we would like it to be, more 'Rocky' than 'Raging Bull.' Still, I guess the makers of the film were simply trying to remain true to their subject and for that they are to be commended. The scenes between Crowe and Renee Zellweger as Mae, Braddock's concerned but supportive wife, serve as the fulcrum that keeps the story balanced and interesting. Ditto for the relationship between Braddock and Joe Gould, his devoted manager, beautifully played by Paul Giamatti. We also see Braddock instilling a strong sense of moral values into his children despite the harsh conditions under which they live. For 'Cinderella Man' effectively conveys just how difficult life was for many ordinary Americans in the 1930's, just how close to starvation many of them came in their daily struggle with poverty. Braddock's tale is emblematic of life in that difficult era.Howard generates a tremendous amount of suspense in his closing scenes in which Braddock challenges the world's reigning champ, Max Baer, in a bout in Madison Square Garden Garden. Howard brilliantly intercuts between the boxers, the fans and Mae, who is listening to the fight on the radio at home, terrified that her beloved husband may not survive the bout.Thus, despite the occasionally lackluster storytelling and overindulgence in sentimentality, 'Cinderella Man' scores as a moving tribute to a decent man who never gave up.",7,0,1,9 July 2005
Valkyrie," informative if superficial true life story
","If the plot to assassinate Hitler in the summer of 1944 had gone off as planned, you can be sure some enterprising studio mogul at the time would have made a film about the incident even before the ink on the ensuing peace treaty had had a chance to dry. But as the effort did, in fact, fail, we've had to wait more than sixty years for this particular piece of World War II history to find its way onto the silver screen. Well, better late than never, I always say.In 'Valkyrie,' Tom Cruise plays Claus von Stauffenberg, a battle-scarred corporal in the German army, who helps to spearhead the conspiracy to bring Hitler's worldwide reign of terror to an abortive end. Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander had really two basic options to choose from in approaching this material: either treat it as a thoughtful character study, probing deep into the psyches of the men involved, or handle it as a straight-ahead action picture, emphasizing the minutiae and the step-by-step process of the plan itself. In choosing the latter, the filmmakers have made a movie that is interesting on a superficial level (and certainly informative as a re-enactment of a fascinating event in history), but not nearly as memorable or compelling as it might have been had they chosen the former.As director, Bryan Singer keeps things moving along at a fairly fast clip, even though the profusion of characters all dressed in similar uniforms sometimes makes it hard to tell who exactly everyone is and which side of the Fuhrer dividing-line each happens to fall out on. In fact, at times, the people who are involved in the conspiracy actually seem to outnumber those who know nothing about it. Moreover, Cruise's generally wooden performance prevents us from delving very deeply into the inner workings of the man he is portraying. In addition, Kenneth Branagh and Terrance Stamp are given too little screen time to register much of an impact in their roles as fellow conspirators.Still, it's impossible not to be moved and inspired by the tremendous bravery and heroism demonstrated by these men or by the incredible personal sacrifices they were willing to make to do what they knew was right. Of course, 'Valkyrie' comes with the same built-in limitation as 'Titanic' - which is that we know even before we enter the theater how the story itself will turn out. It's a tribute, therefore, to Singer's skill as a director that he still manages to generate as much genuine suspense as he does with the material.'Valkyrie' succeeds more, perhaps, as a history lesson than as a stark human drama, but what an eye-opening lesson it turns out to be.",6,3,4,29 January 2009
The Simpsons Movie," not great but very good
","With an extended running time of one hour and twenty-six minutes and a wide screen ration of 2:35 instead of the usual 1.33:1, 'The Simpsons Movie' is longer and bigger than the average series episode to be surebut is it funnier? Well, not quite. That's a caveat I feel obliged to offer for those expecting this to be the laugh-riot sensation of all time. It isn't. Still, compared to most of the big screen comedies that have come our way this season, 'The Simpson Movie' is one heck of a funny and entertaining movie - provided you don't go into it expecting more than the movie itself can reasonably deliver.The plotting, which is normally pretty freeform and surrealistic to begin with, has been ratcheted up even further in that direction for the movie. The story has Homer causing a major environmental catastrophe in the town of Springfield when he thoughtlessly dumps a massive container of pig manure in the local lake, turning it into a sludgy toxic swamp. To deal with this emerging national threat, President Schwarzenegger has a huge glass dome placed over the city, trapping the understandably irate citizenry inside. There's no point in revealing anything more about the storyline except to say that it is up to Homer to save the day, which, of course, he does, in his own inimitable way.Fans of the series will be happy to know that 'The Simpsons Movie' effortlessly captures the manic energy, sophisticated satire and devil-may-care spirit that have been its hallmarks from the very beginning. Homer's good-natured bumbling, Marge's exasperated pragmatism, Lisa's unquenchable optimism, and, of course, Bart's fresh-faced mischievousness are all on full display in the movie (along with something else of Bart's that is very much on display as well). The other favorites who show up on screen include the perennial toddler, Maggie, Grampa Simpson, Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Millhouse, Krusty the Clown and others too numerous to mention.A team of well over a dozen writers - headed by series creators Matt Groening and James L. Brooks - has come up with some hilarious situations and one-liners, enough, in fact, to compensate for the very few ideas or jokes that flame out or misfire. The zinger-to-dud ratio is one of the best we've encountered in quite some time at the movies, though it's not as high, perhaps, as the best work in the series. As with most feature-length comedies, the concept does feel a little stretched at times and the humor itself runs a trifle thin. Still, with this much talent plugging away at the movie, it would be impossible for it to miss or disappoint its fans in any major way. And, of course, there's the instantly familiar and outstanding voice work from regulars Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria to get us into the spirit of the enterprise.The animators have chosen not to tamper too much with the look of the film for its big screen presentation. There may be a bit more elaborate movement in some of the shots, but, for the most part, this is the same uncluttered, two-dimensional Simpsonian world familiar to us from the series.Indeed, the defining philosophy of those who made the film seems to be 'Why mess with a sure thing?', an approach that can be both a strength and a weakness depending on how one looks at it. For unlike the 'South Park' movie, which used its jump to the big screen to expand the scope of its vision and carry the series to a new level, 'The Simpsons Movie' feels more like an extended version of a single episode, simply blown up to a more impressive size and length. Thus, those looking for this to be the best and greatest 'Simpson' episode ever may find themselves disappointed with what they find here. Ditto for those who expect it to provide something different from what they've already seen on TV. However, those who just want a few good laughs at the expense of everyone's favorite lovably dysfunctional adult and his wise guy progeny will have a rollicking good time at the movie.",7,1,5,31 July 2007
Draft Day," First and 10
","Hollywood's Mr. Baseball, aka Kevin Costner, walks off the diamond and onto the gridiron (or, more accurately, into pro football's corporate offices) in 'Draft Day,' Ivan Reitman's entertaining tribute to the wheeling-and-dealing that goes on behind the scenes at the NFL draft.Costner plays the fictional Sonny Wheeler, Jr., son of the equally fictitious Sonny Wheeler, Sr., who has recently died and in whose shadow Sonny perpetually toils. You see, Wheeler, Sr. was a legend at the Cleveland Browns franchise, and, in his two years as general manager for the team, his son seems to be having a little trouble living up to the old man's reputation. To further complicate Sonny's life, his 'down low' girlfriend, Ali (Jennifer Garner), who works as the lawyer responsible for making sure the team doesn't bust through the salary cap, has just announced that she is pregnant with the commitment-phobic Sonny's child. Amid all this personal turmoil, Sonny launches into full negotiator mode, making deals and forming alliances with other general managers in the league while working to assuage the concerns of the team's owner (Frank Langella), its coach (Dennis Leary), an assortment of high strung and disgruntled players (Tom Welling, Chadwick Boseman, Arian Foster) and even his own mother (Ellen Burstyn) who has views of her own that need to be taken into consideration before he can arrive at his final decision.Although it probably helps to have some familiarity with how the draft pick works in order to fully appreciate some of the finer points of the narrative, writers Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman do a good job clarifying the big picture even for the less sports-oriented members of the audience. The movie proceeds at a breakneck pace as the clock ticks down to the moment of truth for Sonny. Will he accept the Seattle Seahawks' offer of the #1 draft pick, Bo Callahan (Josh Pence), in exchange for the Browns' #1 first-round draft picks for the next three years, or will he reject the offer in favor of some less stellar but still promising players? 'Draft Day' is at its best when it's exploring the various and often contradictory interests - of players, coaches and owners, not to mention the millions at stake in salaries and corporate sponsorships - that those in Sonny's position must consider before rendering their final verdicts. Talk about pressure! The filmmakers establish a nice balance between the sports aspects of the tale and the personal moments between Sonny and Ali and Sonny and his mom, never allowing the latter to detract from the former. As a result, we care about the characters without losing our focus on the real reason we've come to this movie.Reitman has come up with an interesting split-screen technique that helps to weave together a story that takes place over a wide range of geographical locales simultaneously. What might have been a mere gimmick in less capable hands becomes an indispensable narrative device here.A few weeks back, while writing about '3 Days to Kill,' I lamented that Costner desperately needed to find some quality material worthy of his talents to work with, and he seems to have found just that in 'Draft Day.' Costner has a core of quiet stillness that lends a genuine gravitas to his performances. Because he can appear both confident and insecure in the same moment, he makes us want to root for the character he's playing. He's also blessed with a super supporting cast that includes, in addition to all the aforementioned, Terry Crews, Rosanna Arquette, Sam Elliot, and Sean Combs.'Draft Day' proves that not all the competitiveness and excitement of professional football takes place on the field.",7,21,33,21 April 2014
The Soloist," strong performances in a so-so film
","In 2005, the Los Angeles Times published a series of articles by reporter Steve Lopez profiling a classical music virtuoso he found living - and playing his two-string violin - on the streets of Skid Row. After spending many hours with his subject, Lopez learned that Nathaniel Ayers' promising career as a musician was cut tragically short in the early 1970s when he fell victim to schizophrenia - he began hearing voices that crowded out his ability to think clearly and function in the real world - while still a student at Julliard. Inspired both by the human interest potential of the story, as well as by a sincere desire to extend a helping hand to a fellow human being in need, Lopez touched an emotional chord in his readers, shining a spotlight on the very real problems of homelessness and mental illness, while, at the same time, turning Ayres into something of a household name.With selected passages from the articles serving as voice-over narration, 'The Soloist,' adapted by Susannah Grant, features Robert Downey Jr. as the well-meaning writer who, in the midst of his personal crusade, comes to question just how much good one human being can do for another when the object of those intentions is either already too far gone to be successfully reached or simply unwilling to accept any proffer of assistance from a caring stranger. Jamie Foxx plays Ayres, the mentally ill prodigy who speaks like Rain Man yet plays the cello like Rostropovich. Both actors are excellent in their roles, with Foxx, in particular, avoiding the temptation of overplaying his hand in a part that seems tailor-made to garner critical acclaim and award nominations.The performances are certainly the best things going for 'The Soloist,' for, without them, the movie might well have ended up choking on its own sanctimony and noble intentions. Joe Wright, who did much better by 'Atonement' a few years back, here tries to gussy things up with a plethora of fancy directorial touches - birds soaring to the music, endless helicopter shots of the city, laser light shows serving as visual correlatives to the classical pieces being played - but no amount of showiness can keep the drama from remaining frustratingly earthbound, pedestrian and plodding. Luckily, the screenplay avoids becoming as syrupy and sentimental as it clearly might have given the Humanity-of-Man nature of the material, and the story itself is interesting enough on its own to overcome the rather indifferent treatment it receives at the hands of the filmmakers. Moreover, the movie does bring out into the open the shamelessly overlooked plight of the homeless and mentally ill in our urban centers. For that reason alone, it serves a salutary purpose.",6,2,4,2 May 2009
Dodgeball," endearing slapstick comedy
","'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' provides just enough good-natured low brow humor to make up for the fact that the film is not always as funny as it intends to be.Vince Vaughn takes on the role of straight man as Peter La Fleur, the owner of a third rate gym called 'Average Joe's' that caters to the.umhow shall we say it? less athletically inclined, less single-mindedly health-conscious consumer. Pete's patrons are all 'losers' and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are. The problem is that, through poor business management, Peter has virtually bankrupted the establishment to the tune of $50,000 that needs to be paid off pronto if he is to maintain ownership of the place. Enter White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the self-made, egomaniacal owner of a top-of-the-line gym across the street who is determined to force Peter out of business and make it part of his own franchise. To raise the money, Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships. When Goodman gets wind of the plan, he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's less-than-average players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.Most of the humor in 'Dodgeball' is of the Three Stooges/hit-one-another-in-the-groin variety that works pretty well for the most part, even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile. Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another, with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a no-holds-barred display of manic energy. Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team. The other cast members are all entertaining as well, and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner, David Hasselhoff, Jason Bateman, Chuck Norris, and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short, but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film. But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy, wheelchair-bound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape. Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film.",6,10,19,16 August 2005
Rock Star," superficial but entertaining film
","So what happens when a person's dreams actually DO come true, especially when the context of that dream turns out to be superstardom in the celebrity driven culture of modern America?  Does that individual, in attaining the summit of fame and fortune, find true happiness and fulfillment there or does he come to realize that it is all mere ashes in the long run?These questions have formed the basis for any number of films in the past and `Rock Star' doesn't bring much new insight to the theme.  However, in style and spirit, this film by director Stephen Herek is just loopy enough to be entertaining.  Although writer John Stockwell provides a basically superficial - and in some ways even sanitized - survey of the rock star culture, at least we are spared some of the heavy-handed rebel angst that usually accompanies films on this subject.From the beginning, the film incorporates elements that go against the grain of the subject matter.  For instance, the main character, Chris Cole, is less a wannabe rock star than an obsessed devotee of his favorite rock band known as Steel Dragon.  Chris emulates the band's adored lead singer to such an extent that the people around him - including his own band members who spend most of their time covering Steel Dragon's tunes - begin to feel that Chris might actually be having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, that he may actually be coming to think that he IS his idol.  The screenplay also breaks out of the mold by having Chris's parents be supportive of his endeavors and by making Chris himself a rocker without a societal chip on his shoulder.  Chris simply loves rock music and the band that he feels has come to epitomize it for him.  Unlike in most of these stories, the lead character is not an ambitious, driven, trailblazing artist but rather a follower content to bask in another person's glory.Until fate one day intervenes in an astonishing way and Chris gets that rare chance to live out his ultimate life fantasy.  He receives a call from the leader of Steel Dragon who has heard Chris's renditions of their songs and offers him a job as replacement for the burnt out lead singer, Chris' idol. At this point the film lapses into more familiar territory, with Chris and his girlfriend taking the inevitable downward spiral from wide-eyed innocence to the hedonistic trap of unbridled sex, drugs, booze etc. - and all the interpersonal strain this places on once-solid relationships. Happily, `Rock Star,' although it shows all these conventional aspects, doesn't go overboard into total despair and misery as so many previous films on this topic have.  In fact, it is surprising just how upbeat the film remains even in its darkest moments.  Even though that adds to the superficial quality of the film, it also keeps it from becoming fashionably cynical and clichéd.Mark Wahlberg gives an energetic performance as Chris and Jennifer Aniston conveys a real transcendent sweetness as Emily, Chris' devoted girlfriend. One ends up not believing a minute of `Rock Star' (at least not after that fateful phone call arrives), but it has a nice fairytale quality nonetheless.",Null,1,3,18 February 2002
The Fighter," a knockout punch
","Based on a true story, David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' is a knockout sports drama filled with finely drawn characters and crackerjack performances. The movie netted two of its actors – Christian Bale and Melissa Leo – a pair of richly deserved Best Supporting Oscars for their efforts.In the role he was clearly born to play, Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, a welterweight boxer who, after quite a few years in the ring already, is still trying to make a name for himself as a fighter. Perhaps the greatest hindrances to Micky's success are his mother, Alice (Leo), and his older brother, Dicky (Bale), the former a hard-living, tough-talking broad who takes it upon herself to manage – and mismanage - her son's career, and the latter, a crack-addicted has-been pugilist himself whose one claim to fame is taking out Sugar Ray Leonard in a bout in 1978 (Leonard makes a brief appearance as himself in the film). Now Micky is beginning to question whether he wouldn't be better off just cutting the family ties altogether and taking charge of his own affairs, especially when a well-reputed professional trainer offers to take him on as a client. But how will that sit with a mother and a boatload of siblings who prize familial loyalty above all else? Set in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1993, 'The Fighter' brings its low-income, working-class milieu to vivid life. In addition to the thick Boston accents and mercilessly teased hair, 'The Fighter' features what is probably the strangest, least 'Hollywood' looking cast of secondary players I've ever seen in a mainstream movie. This is particularly the case with the women cast to play Micky and Dicky's seven unmarried sisters, all apparently still living at home, who serve as a kind of roving posse, eager to avenge any slights made against the family honor by outside forces, including Micky's highly opinionated new girlfriend, the tough-as-nails bartender Charlene (the superb Amy Adams), who isn't about to back down from this band of screeching white-trash banshees when it comes to doing what she thinks is best for Micky.So dazzled are we by the riveting, award-winning performances of Bale and Leo that Wahlberg's beautifully understated work as Micky could easily get lost in the shadows. But it is he who gives the movie its emotional center, turning Micky into a character whose fate and welfare we come to care deeply about. If nothing else, his subtle, self-effacing way of coping with all the craziness and drama taking place around him provides a necessary counterweight to the showier performances - and immediately puts us in his corner. It also helps that Micky is being torn in so many different directions at once, when all he really wants is to finally get a chance at a title bout. Jack McGee, the roly-poly fire chief from 'Rescue Me,' also scores as Micky's tirelessly supportive father, George.There's a definite toughness and a take-no-prisoners mentality to this clan, but also a closeness and a strangely admirable loyalty among its members that go a long way towards smoothing out some of those rougher edges. They're not necessarily people one would want to meet or have much to do with in real life, but as characters in a drama, they sure are fascinating to watch.",9,2,4,12 April 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Entertaining if occasionally implausible thriller
","'Law Abiding Citizen' starts out like a modern-day version of 'Death Wish,' spends a few moments aping the 'Saw' franchise, then settles in as a cat-and-mouse crime drama centered around the theme that the American legal system seems designed as much to thwart justice as to enact it.The movie stands firmly in the long tradition of wish-fulfillment fantasies in which the victim of a broken legal system - functioning as a stand-in for an equally frustrated and helpless audience - finally says enough is enough and takes matters into his own hands, even going outside the limits of the law, if that's what it takes, to achieve justice.As with the Charles Bronson character in 'Death Wish,' Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton witnesses his wife and daughter being brutally raped and murdered by a couple of armed intruders. When the worst of the perpetrators cops a plea and is back out on the streets after a mere three years behind bars, Clyde is forced to take matters into his own hands. But he isn't content merely to bring down the killers themselves but to systematically go after everyone in the legal system â€“ from strict-constructionist judges to hamstrung attorneys - who helped facilitate the injustice. That's where Nick Rice, well played by Jamie Foxx, comes in, the decent but by-the-book prosecutor who helped set up the deal and has now, along with everyone else involved with the case, become a prime target for Clyde's take-no-prisoners reign of terror and retribution.The one thing that distinguishes 'Law Abiding Citizen' from similar films in the genre is that it's not afraid to have a deeply troubled, possibly even psychotic, character at its core. For Clyde does not fit the mold of the typically lovable antihero. The audience is, in the early stages at least, asked to root him on as a conventional Angel of Retribution dispensing the justice that the court system saw fit to deny him, but so much of what he winds up doing steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics. It's this moral ambiguity that helps to mitigate some of the implausibility of Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which often goes for effect at the expense of credibility. Indeed the movie's insistence at making him a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent existential force of nature to be reckoned with takes the movie out of the realm of reality and cheapens some of what it is trying to do. And, in the process of reaching its climax, the movie takes a plot turn so ludicrous and credibility-defying that the whole thing pretty much crashes and burns at the end.That being said, Nick's interactions with Clyde are fun to watch and, thanks to taut direction by F. Gary Gray, there are some moments of genuine suspense scattered along the way. So if you can put your skepticism and critical-thinking skills on hold for the duration, you can have a pretty decent time with 'Law Abiding Citizen.'",7,24,36,17 May 2012
High Fidelity," nice background, weak foreground story
","Are modern movie romances stuck in a rut?  Even the best ones lately  and `High Fidelity' certainly fits into that category  seem to feature characters who find themselves mired in a kind of fashionable self-centered angst that has simply become too predictable and familiar to sustain much audience interest anymore.  Infidelity, the fear of commitment, the never-ending struggle to find the perfect balance between sex and love  certainly these issues exist in exelsis in real relationships and these movies merely reflect that reality.  Yet, how many times can one watch films built around these themes without eventually becoming as inured and jaded as the lost-souled characters who comprise their worlds?  Could it be that  after years of carbon copy retreads - the romantic film genre has simply played itself out?Foe my money, the modern romantic comedy reached its apotheosis way back in 1977 with Woody Allen's landmark masterpiece, `Annie Hall,' undoubtedly the funniest and most keenly observant study of a modern day relationship. Since that time, virtually every movie romance has borrowed heavily from that earlier film's style, theme and substance.  `High Fidelity' is no exception.  In this film, John Cusack delivers a high-energy performance as Rob Gordon, a 30-something Chicago record shop owner whose life seems to have come to a standstill.  Not only does he work in an environment guaranteed to keep him mired in the past  his shop sells vinyl records rather than CD's  but his most recent girlfriend has decided to walk out on him because of what she perceives to be his lack of ambition to move ahead in life.  Confronted with yet another failed relationship, Rob decides to go back and contact several earlier partners and discover why it is that he always seems to be left out in the cold.`High Fidelity' is at its most amusing and likeable when it concentrates on the milieu of the vinyl record shop and the minions who haunt it, and less interesting when it focuses on the romantic travails of its main character. Jack Black steals the film with his hilarious portrayal of Barry, a cocky music snob who would rather insult a customer whose taste he finds objectionable than make a profit by selling the said offender the execrable product for which he is asking.  Screenwriters D. V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg astutely zero in on this strange esoteric world where a person's innate value as a human being is determined by the kind of music he or she happens to like.  The scenarists and director Stephen Frears demonstrate a truly genuine affection for these socially backward losers who have convinced themselves that they alone hold the key to determining musical greatness and  by extension - the meaning of life itself.It is when the focus in `High Fidelity' moves from background to foreground that the film loses much of its uniqueness and passion.  Rob's romantic obsessions simply mirror those of far too many characters in recent similar romantic comedies.  How many more self-absorbed, whining, commitment-phobic romantic leads can we handle?  But `High Fidelity' borrows not merely its themes, but much of its style from `Annie Hall' as well.  Like Allen's character in that film, Rob often turns directly to the camera and addresses the audience with running commentary monologues that are never quite as witty or profound as the filmmakers undoubtedly intend them to be.  In another example of stylistic cribbing, Frears also occasionally interrupts the realistic flow of the action by intercutting fantasy sequences, one of which involves a guest appearance by none other than Bruce Springsteen himself (shades of Marshall McLuhan's cameo turn in `Annie Hall').Frears has assembled a youthful, attractive cast for the occasion including Lisa Bonet, Sara Gilbert, Lili Taylor and Natasha Gregson Wagner.  The fact that some of these performers have had very little screen time accorded them in the film obviously implies that they may have signed onto the project as a labor of love.  The same could probably be said for Joan Cusack, but really must she and her brother co-star in EVERY movie together?   I'm certainly not opposed to sibling devotion  but isn't it time they cut themselves loose from this rather strange tie that binds them?Like so many films, `High Fidelity' tends to concentrate on its majors when its minors are so much more interesting.  It is certainly a likeable enough film - but only when Jack Black is up-front and center stage does it ever really soar into comic delirium.",Null,0,1,24 September 2000
Up in the Air," perceptive comedy/drama about human relations
","Sometimes karma can be a real b***h. Take Ryan Bingham, who works for a company that specializes in firing other companies' employees. Yet, despite the harshness of what he's paid to do, Ryan genuinely loves his job and the confirmed-bachelor lifestyle it allows him to lead. He loves being away from home 270 days out of the year. He loves flying on planes - to the point where he's about to crack the magical 10 million-mile mark on his Frequent Flyer plan. He even loves the place he officially calls home: a sterile motel room in Omaha where he barely gets time to shower and shave and unpack his bags before heading off to another destination.The problem is that all these business trips are placing an onerous financial burden on the company. The solution the bigwigs have come up with is to simply remove the human-contact element from the firing process altogether and replace it with the impersonality of the dreaded teleconference. For Ryan, this means that his days of flying the friendly skies may well be numbered. Before that happens, however, Ryan is determined to make one last stand with his boss, agreeing to take Natalie Keener, the young woman who came up with the idea, on the road with him to demonstrate just how crucially important the 'personal-touch' can be when terminating an employee. Meanwhile, despite his avowals about how much he loves the bachelor life, a crack in his armor may be starting to show, for Ryan may in fact be falling for Alex, a 30-something fellow-traveler he meets in a bar one night and with whom he begins an initially 'casual,' typically no-strings-attached romance. But will it stay that way? 'Up in the Air' is the latest work by Jason Reitman, the director who gave us 'Thank You for Smoking' and 'Juno' in recent years. Like those earlier efforts, 'Up in the Air' is a subtle, thought-provoking comedy/drama that explores not only the complexities of romance and human relationships but the destructive effect rampant corporate downsizing has on the shell-shocked individuals who are its victims and on the fabric of society as a whole.Reitman is scrupulously evenhanded in his depiction of the protagonist. Ryan may not crave an ongoing relationship with that one 'special' individual, but he doesn't inflict his values on other people and doesn't expect everyone to agree with how he lives his life. For Ryan, living alone is simply a lifestyle choice that seems to be working for him. He isn't even particularly callous in the way he treats those he's in the process of lowering the employment-ending boom on. Ryan knows that someone has to do his job and it might as well be him. It certainly beats doing it in the new highly impersonal way Natalie has come up with. The cosmic question becomes is Ryan's eternal bachelor mindset truly endemic to his personality, or could he find true happiness with another person if he just gave it the old college try? Reitman's wryly humorous screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner and based on the book by Walter Kim) explores Ryan's relationship - one platonic, the other not - with two women: the brash but actually quite naïve Natalie who, despite her seeming emotional detachment, believes in happily-ever-after storybook endings and long-term marital bliss, and the more seasoned Alex who has few illusions about what life has to offer in either of those two regards. The movie hears out all sides on the issue without casting judgment and without settling for easy answers. For that very reason, the movie also earns points for refusing to cater to the audience's expectations for a stereotypical, copout ending.As Ryan, George Clooney really makes his rugged good looks and laid back charm work for him in this role, and Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga, as the two women in his life, match him every step of the way in their performances.Given the hard economic times in which we live, 'Up in the Air' could not be more topical in its treatment of unemployment and the devastating effect it has on the people who suffer the ravages of it. The movie may not blow you away as other social dramas do, but it will get you to thinking about your own life - and provide you with a few good laughs to lighten the load.",8,2,5,13 January 2010
Atonement," a rave review from someone who DIDN'T like the novel
","'Atonement' turns out to be a much better movie than it is a book. But before I explain what I mean by that, a little background on the story may be in order.Ian McEwan's novel - which spans eight decades, from the 1930's to the present day - centers around Briony Tallis, a precocious 13-year-old who lives with her family on a country estate in England. Briony is an imaginative child who revels in a world of fantasy and make-believe, a writer of stories and plays who is actually less equipped to interpret the realities of the adult world than she gives herself credit for. One unusually hot summer day in 1935, Briony witnesses a series of events involving her older sister, Cecilia, and the caretaker's son, Robbie, that her child's mind misinterprets in a way that leads to tragic consequences for all involved. Her choosing to act on what she believes to be true winds up echoing down the corridors of time, through World War II and beyond. As time passes and Briony grows to adulthood, she comes to see the error of her ways and spends the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for what she has done. The coup de grace is that, due to circumstances beyond her control, Briony is forced to achieve her redemption in the only way she knows how - as a writer.At the risk of offending devotees of the novel, I must confess to being somewhat less than enamored with a book that many seem to rank among their all-time favorites. For despite its sometimes impressive dreamlike quality, the novel is too contrived and self-conscious to make the reader anything more than a mere dispassionate observer of the events it is portraying. As a writer, McEwan has an undeniable flair for narrative voice and description, but it frequently comes at the expense of characterization and story. His plotting is often arbitrary and clumsy, and his dialogue, when indeed he deigns to use any, is almost always stilted and unconvincing (I have to admit to laughing and rolling my eyes when I was reading the crucial letter-swapping scene).Yet, something has gone terribly right with the material in its journey from the printed page to the silver screen (suffice it to say, I didn't roll my eyes this time around). Since film is a largely visual medium, screenwriter Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright are able to convey through images what it takes McEwan endless reams of paper to get across. Here, an idea can be suggested through a simple shrug of the shoulders, a meaningful turn of the head, a barely noticeable gesture or wave of the hand. And, indeed, the movie is rich in beautiful and unforgettable images that evoke a feeling, a time, a place, sometimes even an entire theme, all on their own. Even though the screenplay remains faithful to the three-act structure of the piece, that structure comes across as less fragmented, less arbitrary and less self-conscious than it does in the novel. Thanks to the seamless fluidity of Seamus McGarvey's stunning cinematography and the unifying tones of Dario Marianelli's brilliant musical score, everything in the film version of 'Atonement' feels perfectly integrated and all of a piece.Of the performers, only Keira Knightley is in any way problematic. She looks positively gorgeous as the seductive Cecilia, and there are moments when she achieves the proper mixture of tenderness and haughtiness essential to the character. But she has a tendency to spit out her lines in a much too rapid fashion and her tight-lipped poutiness (a problem, too, in 'Pride and Prejudice') eventually becomes annoying and distracting. As Robbie, James McAvoy proves again why he is one of his generation's most exciting screen talents, while young Saoirse Ronan is remarkably poignant and poised as the 13-year-old Briony. Ramola Garai and veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave do nicely as Briony in later stages of her life (although the ending, while moving, is a bit more reminiscent of 'Titanic' than it needs to be).Wright is often at his best when turning what could have been mere technical 'stunts' into integral pieces of the drama: a beautifully realized, five-and-a-half-minute long tracking shot of the carnage at Dunkirk, the effortless incorporation of a clicking typewriter into the musical score, a row of nurses marching in time to the rhythmic clacking. Through sight and sound, Wright creates a surrealistic, dreamlike tone, perfectly appropriate to the material at hand. What's amazing is that, even with all these stylistic flourishes, Wright never loses sight of the human drama at the story's core. In his direction, he displays an astonishing economy of means, moving the story along at an almost breakneck speed yet never allowing the movie to feel telescoped or rushed. Not only does his pacing not sacrifice the emotional resonance of the piece; it greatly enhances it.'Atonement' ends on a lyrical note of melancholic uplift that leaves audiences wrung out and emotionally exhausted, as Briony engages in her final and greatest act of storytelling creativity. Watching the movie 'Atonement' is nothing short of a rapturous experience.",10,3,6,14 January 2008
The Island," wildly uneven but with a great deal of potential
","Set in the year 2019, 'The Island' provides yet another dystopian view of the future, one in which mankind must grapple with ethical questions specifically related to how he will use the technology he's created. In this case, it has to do with human cloning and how far we are willing to go to prolong our own hitherto limited life spans - and at whose expense.Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two young people living in a hermetically sealed world after some sort of global 'contamination' has ostensibly rendered the majority of the outside world uninhabitable (all except an island paradise that the people living here can travel to if they are lucky enough to win it as a prize in a lottery). Recently, however, McGregor has come to question many of the 'truths' he sees in the world around him, wondering if there isn't some other, more sinister and diabolical explanation than the one he has been given by the powers-that-be, who monitor and run virtually every aspect of not only his life but the lives of those living and working alongside him.Watching 'The Island' is a bit like riding on a train that runs along smoothly for the most part, yet keeps jumping off the tracks at frequent and inconvenient intervals. You eventually arrive at where you're going, but there's an awful lot of frustration and delay in getting there. When the screenplay concentrates on the moral and ethical implications raised by its brave-new-world premise, the film is often incisive, thoughtful and compelling. Yet, as this is a Michael Bay film, the audience can't be allowed to become TOO thoughtful, so the filmmaker loads on one lame action scene after another to the point where the issues become buried under all the pyrotechnics. Every so often those issues manage to rise again to the surface only to be pushed back down by seemingly endless high speed car chases, earsplitting explosions and shattering glass that cascades in slow motion streams onto hero, villain and innocent bystander alike.McGregor and Johansson aren't given much to do in the way of acting in the film, but Steve Buscemi manages to create something of a genuine character in the few scenes he is given. The art direction and set design are highly impressive and the over-the-top action scenes are admittedly well mounted and executed, even though they wind up weakening the movie. Yet, just when you're about to give up on it, 'The Island' manages to climb back onto the rails and get you interested in it again. That's actually something of a step forward for Mr. Bay.",6,0,3,8 July 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Should Be Called 'Oh BrotherS, Where Art Thou?'
","`Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?'  is ostensibly based on Homer's `The Odyssey,' but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops? Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside, even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.Actually, this is one of their worst films, no doubt about it  slow, arch, disjointed and heavy-handed in both its plotting and its humor.  The original `Odyssey' was an epic tale filled with adventure, high drama and great themes involving issues of courage, pride, commitment and love.  `Oh Brother' is none of these.  It is, in fact, silly, cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney, as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside, they encounter a myriad of bizarre, eccentric characters, some derived loosely from `The Odyssey' and some not.  None of it really works, partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact, most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors, the strain never ceases to show.So are there any good things to be found in `Oh Brother'?  Well, the movie does look good, thanks to fine cinematography and art direction, which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's. And there is, of course, the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment. Perhaps, in the case of this particular Coen Brothers film, the title is inadvertently symbolic.",Null,6,11,20 August 2001
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," slow starter that eventually picks up speed
","'Talladega Nights' starts off rather badly but improves considerably as it goes along. In this affectionate and comical tribute to all things NASCAR, Will Ferrell plays a premiere racer who loses all his self-confidence when a hotshot driver from France (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) challenges his supremacy on the track.At first the humor is strictly strained slapstick, too tame to be genuinely satirical and too vulgar to be anything but lowbrow, but long about the halfway point, Farrell and director Adam McKay's screenplay suddenly hits the right combination of amiable quirkiness and sweet-natured sentiment and the movie cruises along to the finish line.More than anything else, the success of the film lies in its performances, which are uniformly endearing and high-spirited. Beyond Ferrell and Boren, there's a great deal of fun to be had from the likes of John C. Reilly, Michael Clark Duncan, Molly Shannon, Gary Cole, and Leslie Bibb, among others, all of whom slide into their roles with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of comic talent. They alone help to compensate for the excessive length of the film, its tendency towards attenuation, and the overall dearth of laughs in the early stages.",7,0,1,27 March 2007
Semi-Pro," 'Semi-Pro' is All-Bad
","'Semi-Pro' is an aggressively unfunny dumb-jock comedy that marks a possible low point in the careers of Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney (although the latter, lucky for her, is not really in the movie long enough to do her reputation permanent damage).It's the 1970's and the short-lived American Basketball Association (1967-1976) is getting ready to close its doors due to a lack of money and little interest on the part of the three major networks in televising its games. However, four of the league's top-ranking teams will remain intact and be absorbed into the more successful NBA. That means that the Tropics, the fictitious team from Flint, Michigan, will soon be disbanding, unless the players can get their act together and reverse their current losing streak. Ferrell plays Jackie Moon, who doubles as both the head coach and one of the key players on the Tropics. As such, it's his job to whip the players into shape if the team is to have any hope of becoming one of the chosen four.Here is a movie in which literally nothing works - not the concept, not the performances and certainly not the writing. Indeed, the makers of 'Semi-Pro' seem to think that merely throwing the decidedly doughy Ferrell into a basketball uniform and having him shooting hoops with a bunch of equally dweeby knuckleheads would be just too hilarious for words. It isn't. In fact, in this movie virtually every joke, pratfall and sight gag lands on the court with a resounding thud, despite the best efforts of its hapless cast. I guess the one lesson to be gleaned from all this is that funky fashions and quaint '70's references alone are not enough to carry a movie, especially when one is stuck with a script as devoid of taste, imagination and humor as the one Scot Armstrong has come up with here.And, of course, as appears to be the case with all the worst comedies, 'Semi-Pro' finds it necessary to end with an outtake blooper reel, on the bizarre assumption that if we didn't laugh at any of the bits that DID make it into the final product, then we will somehow fall on the floor in hysterics at all the ones that DIDN'T. Sorry, fellas, but I believe I gave my all by sitting through the actual movie to be still hanging around seeing what I missed.Dopey and depressing.",3,6,10,2 July 2008
Furious 7," One of the series' better outings
","Written by Chris Morgan and expertly directed by James Wan, 'Furious 7' will, of course, be forever remembered as the valedictory film for beloved star Paul Walker, who died tragically in a car crash in 2013. But this seventh in a series that began in 2001 is notable for other things as well.The movie picks up where the previous one left off, with the team back home after having just brought down a notorious baddie, Owen Shaw, and received a pardon for all their previous legal infractions as a reward. Trouble is Shaw's older brother is out for revenge so he heads to the States to pick off the team one-by-one.Under normal circumstances, Vin Diesel's wretched acting would be like a black hole in the center of the movie, sucking everything of quality into the void (and Michelle Rodriguez isn't much better). However, in the case of 'Furious 7' - as it was NOT in many of the previous outings - the other elements are so good that they can withstand the gravitational pressure and keep the movie from collapsing into itself. The challenge for a decade-and-a-half long series is to keep coming up with new and exciting stunts to maintain the freshness - and 'Furious 7' meets that challenge head-on. After all, they've done just about everything they possibly could with these cars on terra firma, so why not just drop them out of an airplane as prelude to one of the most spectacular and thrilling automotive chase sequences in movie history? Why not indeed? In terms of action scenes, that is certainly the high point. The second big set-piece - a chase through the streets of Los Angeles involving some sort of mega-drone or mini-spaceship and exploding skyscrapers (we're practically in 'Avengers' territory at this point) - is so high-tech and over-the-top that it makes us a little nostalgic for the series that began as a simple tale of a bunch of guys drag-racing just for the sheer hell of it. The 'Fast' franchise has always operated, to some extent, in the realm of fantasy, but, even in this CGI-crazed era in which we now live, movies can sometimes go just too far. And 'Furious 7' does at times.As usual, the action scenes are supplemented by smart-alecky dialogue (some of it quite funny, actually), gooey sentiment and endless corny homilies about the value of camaraderie and family. And, of course, the human body is forced to not only endure more punishment than a human body should but to then bounce back unscathed for yet another go- round.I must confess that I haven't always been the biggest fan of the 'F&F' movies, but 'Furious 7' strikes me as a fitting sendoff for the late Mr. Walker.And that pitch-perfect coda will have you weeping like a baby.",7,1,21,24 January 2016
