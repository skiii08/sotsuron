Hereditary," Best horror film to come along in some time
","The buzz/hype machine was up to 11 on this film... 'scariest thing I ever seen' etc. Not wanting to risk my hard won cash, I held off on the theater release.
I bit the bullet and gave it a whirl at home. I was not disappointed. Everyone turns in a stellar performance. Milly Shapiro didn't have much to do except say weird stuff, act as a slightly mentally disabled kid, and make that absolutely annoying sound. And she does it masterfully.The tense atmosphere of a fractured family just blends so well with the horror dynamic. And the directing? Exquisite. The camera movements were so precise as to be almost unnoticable, a la Coen Brothers. The scene trasitions were perfect, and the cinematography spot on.The writing excels too. The story does drag a bit but that is definitely part of the agaonizing suspense generated by the story and the characters. Charlie's death takes you by surprise, and as the whole mess further unravels you are drawn into the darkness and dysfuntionality. Fear, blame, guilt, arrogance and regret, the director just goes there, and then overwhelms you with the evil and twisted denouement. Special effects are used tastefully and masterfully; the scene where the mother floats past behind her son's back is truly unsettling. The lighting is very subtle as well and is used to maximal overall effect.A monumental horror film. I couldn't write anything further without repeating myself; please see it if your a horror film fan, just a great scary movie fantastically accomplished.",10,3,9,23 May 2019
Gravity," Floating Home
","Right out of the gate, let me say that there's really not much you can do with a story like this.Script? Unless you want your audience to ignore the zillion dollar effects, don't worry too much about it. Stranded in space? Find a way to get home, however you can. It's supposed to be one of the 'great' film premises and it always works.It works here. Bullock and Clooney do just what's needed, and Bullock's character takes center stage for most of the film. It was definitely worth watching, and yes a lot of it was definitely suspension of disbelief, but what is a film like this without those nick-of-the-moment scenes where disaster is averted.Bullock's desperation to get home definitely drives these moments nicely. The whole struggle of moving around properly with zero gravity is displayed nicely too. Clooney's devil-may-care fighter pilot attitude works well here.Twelve Years a Slave won best picture that year and this film is no competition for that masterpiece. The effects and cinematography were so superb that it really took the project to the top. It held my interest even if I had to wait through the slow parts.This film is not as bad as some say, and not spectacular either as some others say. Worth seeing for sure.",7,1,1,12 December 2019
Public Enemies," Disappointing
","There are so many things wrong with this film I won't list them, other reviewers have pointed them all out correctly.For such an important, topical concept the script that was wrung - or squeezed to death - out of it was shameful. There is a lot of historical back story that would have made this film really sizzle. Capone, prohibition, the bank crisis and depression, Hoover and his Boyfriend Tolson, jeez these producers were asleep at the switch.I want to rewrite it, fund it and re-do the whole thing. If even Depp can't save it, WITH Christian Bale, then it's sunk like the Titanic, ripped apart by the horrific cinematography, and thankfully in THAT movie DiCaprio took the part, unlike this dud to which he said no. Good move Lenny, and what's your agent's phone number by the way x-D",2,1,1,21 November 2015
Orphan," There's something about Hollywood...
","...that tells you when you see a trailer for a film like this, stay away - lol. I guess we did just that as we viewed it on DVD last night. Had I sprung for theater tickets for this film, I would have got my money's worth.As other reviewers have indicated, this film's plot device has been used before, Carrie, The Omen etc. Here is a fresh take on the 'evil child' story. The whole 'Esther has a secret' advertising was forgotten by your humble correspondent weeks ago, so I wasn't trying to figure out anything. It is obvious from Fuhrman's first appearance that there is indeed 'something about Esther'. Her delicate Slavic accent betrays her ominous presence and there is surely something decidedly 'mature for her her age' about her, as sister Abigail puts it.The deaf younger sister is played just as well by the talented Engineer, the fear in her expression coupled with the love she wants to feel with her 'sister' is unmistakable. I hope she has a long career because she should be something to watch.Furhmans performance is exquisite. Her acting is very subtle and very believable, every time she looks up from what she's doing you think boy, I wouldn't want that kid in my house. There's a hunger and a rage in her eyes that's just wonderful. One of the best such performances I've seen, and this young lady's future should be just as bright as Engineer's if not more so.The other actors are really incidental here. The anger shown by the son towards Esther is about as emotional as he gets; I thought the other parts were wooden and trite.Which brings me to the ending, and that whole we-think-she/he's-dead-but-they-jump-back-to-life thing ....its old, and the ending is 10 minutes longer than needed. The denouement was quick but abrupt, and not followed through, degrading into a chase scene type deal, replete with such tired devices as Esther popping out of the ice (after being submerged in freezing water for 2 minutes) and dragging the mother down....*yawn*.Other than that, I highly recommend this movie. Get it on DVD and you'll enjoy it. Not for kids, but adults will enjoy following the story which is VERY well written! Cinematography is so good you don't even notice it, no stupid camera tricks to distract you. The director correctly figured that Fuhrman's presence was quite enough to capture the audiences attention, and I give that girl 10 out of 10 for her part.",8,0,0,3 January 2010
Interstellar," A Frozen Cloud of Horse Poopy
","Dear God, what is this? I could not believe what I was seeing after all the positive reviews. I watched on Amazon video, and thank goodness for that because I would have demanded my money back at a theater.This 'film' is a naked excercise in making an IMAX film for the sake of screwing the public out of more money to... watch it on IMAX. I tell you, having experienced the format live, once you get past the 'gee whiz factor' of a ginormous screen in your face, it's just a movie. And to further insult my sensibilities it's likely the last IMAX movie to actually use the large format physical film. I'll bet that cost a fortune for three hours of inanity.I thought Nolan was a great director before this. He likely still is but this material is way out of his reach. We don't have any of the 'great' directors anymore in my opinion, but he's one of the very good ones. But when I heard organ music cues at certain points in this movie, I cringed at the Kubrick-ian references. Kubrick would have walked out of this 3 hour morass.The plot holes are akin to a piece of swiss cheese. Good acting is absolutely wasted with trite dialogue and scenery-chewing to the point of choking. Long speeches about love... and other stuff that was supposed to sound monumental and mind-blowing. Ugh. I kept thinking that Michael Caine's character's last lines as he died would be '...at least I don't have to look at that awful script anymore'. And as events in the film transpired, I was constantly saying 'Wait...what? Huh? How did the - I mean, where... which?' And of course there's the 'mysterious ending' that will keep amateur you-tubers in business for years explaining.As far as scientific accuracy, first let me say that I had a whole year of college physics, and have a dear friend who actaully had a master's degree in that subject and had studied quantum mechanics and relativity, and I do I have a conceptual understanding of the matter at hand. This movie really pushes the envelope in that department. All that time dilation stuff is not reconciled properly. Frozen clouds? The film makers went to great pains to point that out as the 'one thing' that wasn't accurate. Oh yeah? I could devote an entire review to that, and I won't.The sad part is that the special effects were 10 stars all the way. The oscar was well deserved. The sadder part is that I smell a sequel at some point. A huge disappontment, a waste of great acting talent, and another case of overblown Hollywood hype gone viral, but come home to roost in the bargain bin at the dollar store. Where it belongs.",1,4,7,26 August 2018
Knowing," How to ruin a great story with a lousy movie
","You're talking to a guy that owns 2 35mm Movie cameras and a sound rig whose best reason for not making a film is not having a worthwhile script. Perhaps we could say conversely that a good reason for not writing a script is not having a worthwhile film to make of it?The story premise here was great - young prophetic girl makes cryptic predictions encoded numerically and they get buried in a time capsule in 1959, to be unearthed 50 years later... oh, the possibilities!...which get unearthed and perused by a guy who teaches astrophysics at MIT, no stranger to numbers, he. Once this is accomplished, you can forget about this monstrosity of a film. Guessable? I pretty much guessed the ending about ten minutes into the film and if you saw 'Deep Impact' so will you. Apocalyptic predictions? Telescope? Astrophysics? Duuuuh. What first promises to be a suspenseful film quickly becomes formulaic and sophomoric.I gave it two more stars for special effects, and these are wonderful, if you can painfully endure the film. Cage looks like he stopped in the wrong studio that day, that's how miscast he is. The young actor who plays Caleb is wooden and unconvincing. The Abby/Lucinda girl was one of the best performers and had few lines. Some of the bit actors turned in better performances than the stars. I pity those young people who got cast in this film hoping for a break and ended up in this groaner of a movie.The whole premise of the 'Strangers' who pop in and out was ridiculous. Unfortunately these four (as in Horsemen? Double DUH) 'characters' are needed for the ending, which was welcome but entirely laughable. Once the predictions are unearthed, it seems the movie just borrows every cheap device they can, from 'DaVinci Code' to 'National Treasure' to 'The Matrix' with a bit of 'Deep Impact' and a dose of disaster movie mayhem. Even the special effects scenes get old, the train scene is way too long and obviously is extended to burn screen time. And like the train in the scene, this movie derails, jumps the tracks, and destructively skids out of control .The continuity is a mess, so many things are left hanging for too long, so long that by the time they're tied together you just don't care. There's a sudden quick cut (when cage takes the blackboard and puts it on the wall, towards the beginning) that I thought was going to be part of one of those 'jump cut' scenes but its not followed by any others and ends up looking like an editing mistake. Terrible!The cinematography is really good, what a shame! Some of these scenes were hard to shoot and came off well but were edited poorly.All in all, I left wondering if those last numbers Lucinda scratched in the wall were the Release date of this film and the number of casualties...which miraculously coincided with the number of cast. A real waste of time.",3,28,56,21 March 2009
The Hurt Locker," Best Picture?! You've got to be kidding me.
","Some really good films have been based on the war in Iraq, Desert Storm, and the whole so-called 'war on terrorism'. I cite, 'Jarhead', 'Courage Under Fire', 'Rules of Engagement', and 'Three Kings', all worthy entries and not an Oscar for any. This film was recommended to me so I got it. I was utterly amazed at what a bad film this was. The acting was shallow, the script was shallow, and I sat through 2 hours of this mess asking myself, 'so what is the point of this film?' We are treated to a reckless Sergeant whose job it is to defuse bombs, risking his life and his buddies' lives as well. They ride around Iraq like cops in green suits, defusing bombs and exchanging, I don't know, is that dialogue? There is no moral lesson, forget that 'war is a drug' stuff, that's been done before. I highly suspect the academy wanted to award a female director and well, here was their chance. It's all politics. This is a B movie at best, it bored the crap outta me. Pity someone didn't defuse THIS bomb. LOL, to concur with other reviewers, you kill off Pearce and Fiennes in a movie, well that's trouble right there. Boring and inane.",2,3,7,19 March 2011
Lincoln," I was really disappointed
","OK, first, I am an avid student of the Civil War though by no means a historian. No, I NEVER go to a movie expecting 'historical accuracy'. The film maker has to engage the audience, and side business and composite characters are the norm. And it works, see 'Glory' e.g. A very compelling tale told in a compelling way. Of course, I 'had to see' this movie, for the above reason and I heard about DDL's amazing meticulous portrayal of the 16th President. And Holbrook, Jones, Sally Field... wow! Well, I got my chance to see it last night. It seemed like I was waiting for the movie to start all the way through. What was the point? Anti slavery? Cohesion/dissolution of the Union? The questionable (and highly common) political tactics of the time? What was the point? There was none. Our 16th president was not so concerned with the well being of blacks in America, everyone who's studied it all knows that. He wanted Liberia to be a place to colonize them TO, away FROM the USA. But, you know, dramatic license etc.... OK, OK, I can live with that. DDL's performance left me dead flat. Oh it was as accurate a portrayal as you could get - his incessant jokes and stories, he really annoyed the pee out of Edwin Stanton, who thought it undignified. I don't know that Lincoln used the word 'ain't' except intentionally when he wanted to patently lapse into colloquialism. But Hollywood... you know. I expected more from Jones, and Fields, but Gordon-Levitt turned in one of the finest performances in the film. I can only say that specifically, I can't point to one complaint but instead feel that the film is flawed in so many ways. My gosh, the last time I heard this much speechifying in a movie like this was the hideous 'Gettysburg', a 90 minute docudrama that was extended to 4+ hours of inane drivel. I feel that the most engaging and yes, entertaining take on Lincoln was Waterston. It was even better that he had done Lincoln's voice in the super epic 'The Civil War'. I give two stars for effort. The script was terrible. Some of the plot devices were cute, but thats about 6 of the 150 interminable minutes of this movie. A real let down for me overall. I'm hanging up a picture of Spielberg in my bathroom tonight. ;-)",2,0,2,23 August 2015
Paranormal Activity," Oh no you DIDN'T!
","Well, going in to this movie I had pretty low expectations as I'd heard that a lot of people were disappointed.I was not. Mind you I was a big fan of Blair Witch Project, and a lot of folks didn't care for that. Here we have the mere power of suggestion, the shadow on the wall, the 'thing that goes bump in the night'. It works and it works to perfection here.Katie has been haunted by a demon since childhood - Micah, her new boyfriend, who she has recently moved in with, just found out. So Micah decides he's going to take charge of the situation. When the psychic they consult tells Micah that, whatever you do, DON'T p*ss this thing off by talking to it, what does Micah do? In good horror movie form ('Don't open that door!!!') he TAUNTS it. The feeling of 'Oh no you DIDN'T just say/do that' is wonderfully creepy and you just know this fool has opened up a can of worms. I mean, a Ouija board?! Weren't you listening to that guy, Micah?!?!? LOL Fun and scary, the movie ends with quite a bang, and that was the theatrical ending... I haven't seen the alternate ending but I hear it's even more disturbing. Highly recommended to purchase on DVD because you will want to see this more than once.",10,5,9,15 January 2010
Midsommar," A well acted, beautifully shot pile of trash
","I think critics were so impressed with Aster's masterpiece Hereditary that they tried, and succeded in talking this movie up to the point that you were expecting something fabulous here. You were, i expect, disappointed.Lush and beautifully shot, it falls on its face after the prologue sequences, but not after tempting you with good dialogue and well constructed interior shots. At which point this film slides down the toilet.You can see from the sets and costumery that major weirdness is at hand, and the strange attitude of Pelle towards the whole thing reinforces that. But i wanted to join in and p*ss on the ancestral tree when i saw there was no expositon. I felt as if the incest kid was writing the script, splashing paint on paper as Astor translated it into scenes.Somehow the critics found meaning in this movie; why i dont know. I hope astor's next film is better and more watchable. Skip this one!",4,3,7,2 February 2020
The Untouchables," 'You're muckin' with a G!!!'
","What fun. DeNiro as Capone, Sean Connery and Costner in his usual wooden persona.Historical accuracy takes the back seat in this drive-by ... but the action scenes are so well directed and subtly executed as is DePalma's way. A GREAT direction job, superb for a popcorn flick and elevates the film beyond that.Connery's performance is solid though I've read differently here. He won Best Supporting Actor - OK, well if the academy thinks so who am I to argue. The prolonged death scene is a bit too Hollywood for me but other than that he makes a great account of himself.Also a lot of criticism was heard about De Niro's performance - I say it was just as brilliant as Goodfellas. He is fantastic as fat, nasty Al Capone, very believable and well executed. He's a pro who's not afraid to take a supporting role.Great lines in this so-so script, as well. They showed the ethnic divisions in the mob vs. the cops vs the Feds very well. Capone was as war with the Irish factions in Chicago, but this wasn't shown. The scene where he beats the guy to death is unforgettable. The actual incident was much uglier and involved three people, not one.Andy Garcia milks his part for all its worth and makes a background character stand out so well, a true talent.Overall, a very watchable film and good fun for all. They really didn't use too much foul language, but it was 1987 after all. Highly recommended!",9,1,2,19 December 2015
The Last King of Scotland," Run, Forrest, Run!
","I said it years ago. Forrest Whittaker was bound to get an Oscar somewhere along the line. I never thought it would be for lead actor, because 'the part' wasn't coming his way.It came - and the rest was history. From Platoon, to the unbearable Fouth Angel and beyond, every part, every role was polished and precise. A true pro who got the big one. I love it.Macalvoy is also cast perfectly and plays out well as his character, and shows us it is much more multifaceted than we thought. Very nice work.The film itself has that low-budget feel, but as is the case it makes everyone work harder to make it shine. Six million dollars ain't what it used to be.Amazing acting and a great story from a great book. A must see for true Forrest fans and everyone.",10,0,1,1 January 2016
American Gangster," Spectacular
","When Denzel is on, he's ON. Throw in a supporting cast of - Russel Crowe, Josh Brolin and Cuba Gooding? You have to screw up a lot to let this one sink.But there's more - Ridley Scott's Oscsr-worthy direction. If there is anyone who knows how to keep a film moving its him. The continuity is seamless, like butter melting. Smooth transitions, no 'shakycam' - and mise-en-scene so subtle you don't notice it. Wow. Big kudos for Cinematography too.The story of heroin in Harlem is a dirty one, and the way Scott infuses horrible snapshots of the victims of this evil substance is just plain masterful. Not too much, not too little, just enough. The same is true for the more violent scenes. You KNOW they are coming, as when Lucas gets up, walks down the block and executes someone in broad daylight.Everyone down to the extras does a bang up job. One of the best recent films, don't miss it!",10,1,2,1 January 2016
Flight," Even Denzel can't carry the team alone
","I've watched it twice. I didn't know what to think the first time.Such an interesting premise: You have a dangerous job where you are responsible for people's lives and millions of dollars worth of equipment. You know that, as a piece of machinery, anything can ho wrong no matter how many times you check. Parts fail. People fail. Stuff just happens - whether its in an operating room or on a commercial jet.Here, its of course the latter. Yet the nagging question: Did the parts, the people or both fail? And here the answer is the parts. The part failure shown brought down two real life airliners with grievous loss of life and two trashed expensive airplanes. Yet here, Whip (Washington) shows us what pilots, sober or not, can do in an emergency. I loved the way he played the incident through, so totally on top of everything. I was brought to mind of Chesley Sullenberger's feat on the Hudson River in NY city, no heroics, no drama just fly the plane down as gently as you can. And Whip does it on dry land with only 6 deaths.Amazing? Yes, and he's hailed as a hero. But he knows he was lucky - as they say, you're okay until you run out of altitude, airspeed and ideas - and he knows he was drunk and high on cocaine too. So it's not as landing the plane was the miracle, the miracle was that in his condition he was able to think the problem through.This is all so deep, and a hard subject to cover in a film without being trite. But TRITE it becomes at several points. The addition of the female character, for example, who gets and stays clean, tells you right off that some sort of confession or redemption is scheduled. The addition of the John Goodman character really put spice in the film and I dare one of you to tell me that anyone but Goodman could have pulled this role off. He was just so slick, he slid in and out of the scenes and that's amazing considering how incongruous his character is. Perfection! And as it is clear that our hero is going to get off the hook, which he could have done easily - without ANY harm done to any protagonists - he instead gives us a steaming pile of Hollywood horse**** on a silver platter with a candle on it. The following scene in jail is gratuitous, and leaves us to wonder if a better ending would have been for Whip to say 'I don't know' - which I kept repeating out loud - and when he didn't I knew we were in for the typical studio ending. To heck with loose ends and continuity, right? The son? The Girl? Who what when where .... its not good when you walk away with those questions.And because of this tomfoolery, completely lost here is the exquisite direction, cinematography and editing. All you film students, this is an exercise in perspective and composition. Zemeckis has a Kubrick like sense of photography - and a great DP, like Kubrick had, didn't hurt. But watchable and yes, enjoyable as it was, it could have been better.",7,0,0,1 November 2015
The Proposal," Gibberish, Sandra how COULD you ...
","I tried to like this movie. I admire Sandra Bullock, she has contributed greatly to the art of TV and movie drama, as producer and actress. She excels at the former, and is mediocre to good as the latter.But this movie is a steaming pile of every tired Hollywood invention going. The acting is very good, but can't be saved by this awful script. You kept wondering when the story was going to advance, but ended up sitting through scene after scene of the 'we don't really like each other but we had to get married because (fill in plot device)'. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz nailed this routine in 'What Happens in Vegas', a hilarious movie,and the same actor in 'Just Married' with Brittany Murphy.Betty White, in her mid-80's, is the one shining light in this film as the grandmother. She dominated the funniest scene in the film. Likewise, the epilogue that runs alongside the final credits is great. Oscar Nunez as Ramone also has a pretty good scene... but that's it.Rent Ash's two films or better, buy them, if you like this type of comedy. No one can pull it off like him.",1,17,33,21 August 2009
