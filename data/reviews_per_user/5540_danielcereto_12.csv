Alien 3," The weakest one
","After two masterpieces like Alien and Aliens I am not sure why David Fincher's Alien was so different, freak and dark. Really far from previous two.
I think the risky script is not well developed even on the Director's cut version. This is by far the weakest one from Alien franchise. Lack of action, tension and characters development too makes this one expendable. Best of all the ending of an era.",5,1,1,5 May 2020
Alien: Resurrection," Amelie Resurrection
","After watching again Alien, Aliens, Alien3 and Alien Resurrection in a row my personal preference has changed. Now, I prefer Alien 3 over Resurrection. So, my personal ranking is Aliens, Alien, Alien3 and Resurrection.
I am not sure why today Alien Resurrection looks weird, FX looks cheap and the movie itself is a weird mixture of comic-tragic boring Alien story. Also, the ending is the weakest of all the movies. Give me a break.
On the other hand I still choose Alien and Aliens as my TOP 5 favorite movies of all time.",5,1,2,6 May 2020
Us," When children of the scissors meet the Purge
",The pretty good premise goes away really fast because of the lack of story and plot holes. This is one of the most overrated movies I have watched lately. A nonsense that includes people with scissors coming from sewerage doing a Purge of their Alter Egos. Pretty interesting right?,3,4,6,2 June 2019
The Irishman," Goodfellas 3.0
","I am a big fan of Martin Scorsese's movies. Goodfellas, is my favorite one. So, I was pretty excited about this one. After watching it I have mixed feelings. Not sure if the formula doesn't work at all, or I'm not the same person anymore.First, the acting is fantastic coming from veteran actors. The average here is around 75 years old. On the other hand, I think Deniro's choice was not appropriate. He can't even kick asses (grocery store scene). I think Pacino should have been the main star. What a great actor.Second, the movie's pace is extremely slow, like mostly Scorsese's movies. But what works in the 90's (Goodfellas) it does not work anymore.
Martin should not expect audience from 2019 can stay 3h 20 minutes without getting distracted. It's sad but it is what it is. Even me (a fan) I couldn't watch the whole movie without get a little bored because of the slow pace.Third, I really love the ambiance, and the execution. It is impressive. I got back for an instance to the 60's mobs world. Pretty real, not stupid Fx's. Also music and dressing is amazing too.To sum up, a good movie for fans, but a wasted opportunity to make a masterpiece again. I think next time, Martin should go and get some cast from Peaky Blinders, like Cillian Murphy, and create a great Goodfellas 3.0.",5,2,7,30 November 2019
Climax," Dancing with the stars
","If you decide to watch this movie please be ready for an intense movie. Don't think this is another Hollywood blockbuster and you'll be fine. The movie is a strange mix of visuals and music that works perfectly just adding just a simple storyline. Acting is great too. Overall 7/10.
I watched it with a home cinema THX and it was an incredible experience!",7,1,1,6 September 2019
It Follows," It follows
","A great scary little film. Far from perfection but the idea is simple but pretty well executed. It is an example of how to do a scary movie just with a low budget. Actors here are just correct but the music edition is superb with the 80's vibes.
So, overall a great little scary movie. Read about the ending if you want to know more.",8,2,2,6 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's most personal movie
","First, I didn't read read anything about the movie and I enjoyed it. It is quite original and different from all the others Tarantino's films.
Second, looks like Tarantino is doing whatever he wants here. I mean, no storyline, not a real plot, only some real facts and actors from the 60's mixed in a Hollywood 's parallel universe.
Lastly, this could be far better, but honestly it is quite interesting to watch something original coming from Quentin. I love the last 20 minutes from the movie. So, overall a great one again.
Not a masterpiece but close to. Thanks Quentin.",7,2,5,22 November 2019
Hotel Mumbai," Good thriller with some flaws
","I really like the movie. I do not understand the haters. Maybe it is not strictly based on the facts,
but the movie is pretty well done. Acting is great too. On the other hand some cheesy scenes and propaganda, but it is a Hollywood movie. Can't expect realism.",7,1,16,23 June 2019
Midsommar," Swedish meatballs and Ikea
","I know Swedish can do cheap furniture. Also, Ikea's meatballs are quite good. But what I didn't know about the most peaceful people ranked 1st in the world, is that they love drugs, they are crazy cannibals and eat pubic hairs inside Swedish pies.
This movie is quite bizarre and sometimes disgusting. Plot holes are huge and unveliable character's decisions. Not to talk about the ending. This movie is like Ikea furniture, cheap but not great. I don't buy it.",3,7,11,30 September 2019
It Chapter Two," Dumb CGI
","After watching the first 30 minutes and the cheap CGI festival I just turn off the movie.
Can Hollywood create a good movie with a good script and without these stupid CGI effects? Sorry, not for me.",3,2,3,3 December 2019
Prometheus," Prometheus extended version
","I just rewatched Prometheus after watching previously the four Alien movies and I enjoyed more than the first time. The reason is because the extended version of 2 hours 31 minutes it's far better that the theatrical cut. More answers are shown and overall the movie script is better. So, if you want to give it a second chance to this, go for it. You won't regret.",8,3,4,7 May 2020
Alien: Covenant," Alien Covenant
","Alien Covenant is a step under Prometheus because several reasons.
First an foremost the casting is weaker than it's precursor. The main character is unbelievable as an heroine and it's far from being tge new Sigourney Weaver. Even Doctor Shaw's from Prometheus did better.
Last, the script is a mess. A lot of answers not told and also characters were not full developed.
So, overall the weakest movie with close to Alien Resurrection. Maybe a bit better, but not what exactly a fan was waiting for.",6,1,1,8 May 2020
