Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worst 'film' i've seen for a long time.
","I am bewildered by the high score this film has received. I can only assume that half the voters are pre-pubescents for whom the sight of a guy with a 'funny' eastern European accent making endless vulgar comments is amusing. Worryingly though, the film is an 18 so i can only assume that half the voters have the mentality of a pre-pubescent. This film is not funny. There is nothing clever, or witty or inventive about the 'humour' in this extended TV sketch. Yes, admittedly i have managed a giggle or two when watching the TV incarnation of Borat. After 5 minutes of this feature-length offering however, i quickly realised how thin this joke was going to spread over an hour and a half. How long are you going to think 'I like sex. Is nice' is funny??? About twice is the answer. The plot is no more than a token gesture created as a vehicle for the various pasted-together scenes. The naked man-wrestling scene was just ridiculous. It was crude for the sake of being crude and any half-wit could've come up with the concept. Why would i want to pay to watch that??? I left the cinema feeling that the only thing i had taken from this film was the fact that it highlighted how religiously- brainwashed many Americans are and how despicable some of the people in the film were. Quite sad really considering this was supposed to be a comedy.I feel stupid for ever being talked into going to see this rubbish.",3,7,13,1 December 2006
Terminator Salvation," Oh deary me.
","What a silly, silly movie. I wouldn't say i'm disappointed as after reading many reviews prior to seeing the film, i had a good idea of what to expect. But i have to say that at no point were these expectations exceeded. Terminator Salvation is a typical modern-day Hollywood blockbuster; lots of slick action sequences and good-looking young actors with little or no plot to back it up. I find it bemusing that so much money can be spent producing a major film and yet so little be invested in a good screenplay writer! What the hell. The amount of times i shook my head and despaired at how stupid this plot is beggars belief. When i first heard a 4th installment of the Terminator franchise was being worked on - and having seen a few sequence shots - i applauded the spin on the chase-premise and eagerly anticipated a serious futuristic war film. Sadly, T4 is way too dumb, unrealistic and lacking in atmosphere to ever fulfill this. Please tell me someone else wondered how John Connor manages to get back to his feet after being slugged in the chest by a T-800, thrown distance into metal bulkheads etc etc without breaking almost all the bones in his body??? Jesus Christ. How can anyone write this into a script and not think people will question it??? And how come Marcus, albeit in pretty impressive fashion, kicks some human butt in an early scene (but still conventionally) and then later (after we've discovered he's in fact a cyborg) is seen throwing T-800's around??? Why didn't he just use his prosthetic arms to crush the humans earlier??? Why was he struggling with them and how come his punches didn't rip the jaws off of the rednecks he was chinning??? STUPID!! Nobody has even thought about it! OK we'll just forget that bit 'cause he looked human then, but now we know he's a machine he can throw other machines around which probably weigh a metric tonne or something. Idiots. And one more major complaint: i was just about buying all the action stuff in the first half hour until the 100ft super-terminator shows up and starts picking people up and firing laser bolts. Yeah, OK, so we're supposed to believe that in just 9 years time (genius of Skynet or not) we can conceive a machine of that engineering complexity??? McG obviously watched Transformers a few too many times. Ridiculous. Oh OK at times it's a fun ride but that's it, nothing more. It's just impossible not to compare the 3rd and 4th films to the 1st & 2nd and wonder if Hollywood is actually capable of producing a blockbuster with an intelligent f**king script. We're not impressed by shiny things blowing up anymore. Any film with some money behind it can do that. Think up something realistic and innovative before you continue to ruin classic stories again.6 out of 10 just for some decent action sequences and occasionally reasonable acting, and a bit of nostalgia thrown in.",6,1,2,12 June 2009
Cloverfield," Dozer-field
","Oh God, what a joke! This was a joke, right?No, sadly it wasn't. If it was, and the film-makers had fully-embraced it as a 'monster- spoof' then maybe the complete lack of any discernible, feasible and intelligent plot could be forgiven and we could just get on with laughing at it. They could of perhaps even have woven in some funny jokes and stuff. But no, no, this is for real. This is a real 'woooooh, scary' monster thriller, devastatingly and terrifyingly immersing you in the action through the ingenious (and completely original) decision to film it entirely on handy-cam.The plot begins at a............oh who cares anyway. Seriously, this excuse for a plot is beyond stupid and i can't even be bothered to go over all the gaping holes and logic failures that litter this rubbish. Just read any of the 1-star reviews on this site; they pretty much sum it up, if you're really interested.So here's my two stars. One for the feeble attempt to assemble some sort of plot to carry this tripe, together with the cast and their half-hearted acting (all forming one single, shiny star) and the second for the technically well-executed CGI effects.Right, i'm off to find that nuclear-resistant, reinforced-titanium poly-alloy, fission-powered, night-vision-enabled super-handy-cam, and give the makers of this film a bloody good thrashing with it until they realise that we don't want to know what the conclusion was and that making 'Cloverfield 2: They Have Found Us Again' would be a really, really monstrous idea.",2,0,3,13 October 2008
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Absolute garbage
","The Tarantino fanboys must be smoking acid-dipped doobies to give this bore-fest so many 10/10 reviews. Pointless, meandering, and incredibly self-indulgent. I really couldn't care less about how 'meta' this is; it's a film about films made for students of film (and QT himself) however the reality is that absolutely nothing of interest happens for at least 1.5hrs and i literally nearly fell asleep at one point. Tarantino seemingly believes his own hype these days and judging by the comments on here he can do no wrong. Well he just did by making one of the most soporific and disjointed pieces of crap I've ever been unfortunate enough to suffer. Have a word with yourself, Quentin.",3,11,16,15 September 2019
Casualties of War," Important moral dilemma
","Brian De Palma's Casualties of War is one-part Vietnam commentary, one-part moral dilemma. The film manages to illustrate the horrors of war with some visceral visual effects, and the same time also pose the crucial question; how would you react in the situation in which Eriksson finds himself? The setting largely plays second fiddle to the moral question posed - this is not a film about the politics of the Vietnam War - and it is around this that much of the film is centred. The isolated environment of a long-distance mission in a small squad raises, and accentuates, the issues of peer pressure and moral-abandonment perfectly. This is undoubtedly the film's strongest point and greatest message.Surprisingly, i found some of the performances and dialogue a little disappointing. The character of Sgt. Tony Meserve, played by Sean Penn, was particularly bemusing. Clearly intending to portray a kind of brilliant but sociopathic soldier, he came across more handicapped half-wit and it truly stretched my limits of believability to convince me that this man was put in charge of an infantry unit. A very disjointed performance by Penn indeed. Michael J Fox's character Eriksson, suffered a little from the sometimes overly-sentimental script which at times seemed thoroughly incongruous with the sobering environment and moody score. It's harsh to typecast Fox, but his virtues-of-steel persona didn't come off too well for me and i couldn't help but see his usual, jovial self lurking just beneath the facade.A heavy, but watchable war movie, handled with skill by De Palma but with a flawed screenplay and some lacklustre performances.6/10.",6,4,10,13 February 2008
Avatar," Absolutely zero substance
","I simply cannot believe how over-zealous the users of this site are. Actually i can. It was exactly the same for There Will be Blood and every other hyped film there has been recently. Some of the adjectives used to describe Avatar beggar belief: 'The Best Movie of All Time' 'A Masterpiece' 'Mesmorising, Spellbinding, Extraordinary!'. I really do wish i could agree. I was looking forward to this as much as most and i'm a huge fan of Cameron's previous work. Avatar, however, is a massive disappointment, and i'm convinced once the hype surrounding the technology and CGI dies down people will realise that. It really is a reflection of the times that people can be so suckered in by fancy visuals and things blowing up. Please, for a moment, look at the merits of this film, CGI aside, and you'll see that they are pretty much on par with a hundred previous sci-fi b-movies/TV-series. The story is completely derivative, the action unrealistic, the dialogue.....oh God, don't get me started. James Cameron has obviously been spending far too much time with George Lucas. The dialogue is atrocious and painfully clich√©d. There is no convincing character development at all. I can barely remember any of their names let alone have any sort of affinity with them. Sam Worthington is a waste of space. I don't know what this Hollywood fixation is with him, but he was terrible in Terminator Salvation and he is terrible in this. The cartoon, morally-vacant human 'baddies' are an insult to intelligence and unbelievable at every turn. The entire plot is 100% predictable. Of course we knew the humans weren't go to win. Of course not. Not with their space-travelling, cryo-genetic-using, high-tech weaponary-toting mentality. They didn't understand the forest, man. Please. This is almost as laughable as Return of the Jedi. And the lame efforts to instill some sort of sentimentality and moral message through the use of poorly-written pseudo-spiritual crap just made me cringe. I wasn't even that impressed with the character design. Cameron has basically taken Native American Indians and Antipodean Aborigines and turned them blue. They have similar attire, ride 'horses', shoot arrows etc etc. It was just all too familiar.Avatar may well be a technological breakthrough, and i look forward to others who take the technology on and remember to actually pair it with an original and compelling story, but for now though, this film is a bulging case of style over substance if ever there has been one.I miss Aliens. Now that was a convincing movie.4/10",4,182,310,21 December 2009
There Will Be Blood," Strange, bewildering and over-hyped
","People, please! The 18th greatest film of all-time? are you serious??! It seems to me that almost everyone has been sucked into the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' 'performance of the decade' which is, admittedly, at times captivating and menacing, but also at other times horribly over-acted (see the cringe-worthy baptism scene and pointless ending). If this is a film about one man's descent into mental illness and moral collapse, then director Paul Thomas Anderson has made a terrible hash of it. If not, then could someone please explain what the plot of this film is? It seems to me to be a disjointed assembly of loosely-connected events that do nothing to progress the story-telling process or enhance the viewer's association with the characters. And what about the characters? We have Day-Lewis' charming, ruthless and unstable Daniel Plainview, and......that's about it. The only other notable member of the 'supporting cast' was the corrupt preacher Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano. However other than serving as a frequent annoyance to Plainview - who inevitably dispatches of him - i failed to decipher the relevance of their relationship. Plainview's son, H.W. became a complete nonentity after his accident and no effort was made to develop or explain father and son's deteriorating relationship. In fact, no real effort was made to explain Plainview's personal deterioration either, leaving me with a total sense of disaffection with everyone and anyone in the film.There Will Be Blood is slow-paced, no doubt about that - the opening scenes are dialogue-less for about 30 minutes and i regularly found myself urging the next scene, desperately vying for the picture to burst into life. It never did, and ends with a gratuitous and meaningless clash between Plainview and Eli Sunday which left everyone i was with unsatisfied and confused - where had this masterpiece gone? did i just miss the film of the decade? No, because it never was and never will be.I'll concede, the film contains some meticulous set-detail, and the cinematography is beautifully precise. Even the score, which i believe some people have criticised, i found to be interesting and suspenseful. It's just that the suspense is never fulfilled, interest never ignited.In the end, There Will Be Blood and the hype surrounding it, comes crashing down like Plainview's first oil derrick.6/10",6,37,69,16 February 2008
