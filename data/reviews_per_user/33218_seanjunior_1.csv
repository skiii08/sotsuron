Requiem for a Dream," best film for 2000? give me a break
","superb acting. the movie caught my interest throughout. but to say that this could be the best film of 2000 is a little too much. seems to me like the movie was mainly directed at those who are thinking of experimenting with or are into drugs. i somehow keep feeling that those who gave it an 8.5 and above are/were probably into crack themselves and who are leading/ have led dreary lives, thus it's easier for them to relate to this movie.
on the whole, i think it's a great film. but it probably wouldn't win the oscar for best film considering the fact the movie's all dark, dreary and nothing more. it's a fine real-life depiction of what being on crack can be like, Period. there's nothing intellectual or uplifting about the movie that would make it a masterpiece/ an oscar winner.",Null,0,0,27 May 2001
