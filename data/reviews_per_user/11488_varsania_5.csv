Scarface," Amateurish, ragtag film. Nonsensical garbage.
","I thought this film would be alright. Looked good from the opening few scenes, then it became seriously flawed. Pacino's character is very comical, and it's whole depiction of the drug world is laughable. In the end it just became a farce, a real farce. The Three Stooges couldn't have played it better themselves. It gives the viewer the illusion that the drugs trade is run by a bunch of monkeys, who live in big palaces, garish decor, and have piles of coke on their desks!! And they shout their mouths off and take a hundred bullets without dropping.No, not a good film at all. Very amateurishly done, by a bunch of cowboys.",1,59,129,4 May 2002
U-571," Factually incorrect, totally implausible.
","!!!   Spoilers ahoy!!      This film does not do justice to the people who experienced WW2. It is typical hollywood trashy film. How the Americans could even think that they can pass an old clapped out US sub for a state of the art German U boat just by sticking a badge on it I do not know. It insults the intelligence of both the Americans and the Germans. Sending out a crew in that is surely condemning the crew to a watery grave.
Radar. When the disguised American sub approached the real U boat would it not appear on the radar? And would not radio contact follow? And therefore code words used by the German crew? ANd therefore would not the Americans be sussed out way before they actually got close enough to discuss the quality of French porn? This is war, and in war certain practices are followed. They crew are well drilled. And why was there not a Nazi salute in the entire film? The American crew ran the real German U boat like as if it were their own. I fail to understand how a German engineered boat would in any way be similar to and American one. Yet we are to belive that just by translating a few labels a foreign crew can run a sub, and not just run it but use it in battle? Very doubtful.The scene where the American soldier gets shot point blank by the Nazi, another example of stupidity. 1 bullet shot at point blank range and the victim is felled instantly. Shot dead. Not 4.I could go on but you get the drift. Other than that the film is watchable as the story is quite good.",Null,4,6,11 July 2003
The Usual Suspects," OK film, nothing more.
","This film is quite good, but not great. After seeing it on the big screen I have no desire to watch it again, and I certainly would not buy it. Watch it if you are extremely bored and have absolutely nothing to do.Pete Postlethwaite is top class as always though. A truly fine actor who shows his less talented co stars how it is done.",5,2,4,29 May 2001
Caddyshack," Top notch!! Top notch!!
","This film is pure magic. Poetry in motion picture. Outrageous gags, hilarious cast, I can only echo what so many have said before me. Simply too many funny scenes to mention. Bill Murray caddying for the Dalai Lama, can a more preposterous idea possibly ever be conceived? Add to that a wonderful soundtrack and you could see why this film is still lauded today. It makes a mockery of these supposed modern day flicks of mirth, they simply cannot touch the levels of humour that Caddyshack reaches. Everyone connected with this production should have gotten an Oscar.Top notch!!",10,2,4,18 June 2001
Kingpin," Big Bill rulez!!
","Superb film. A real piece of art. We all know who makes this film so there is no need to beat about the bush. Bill Murray is totally magnificent as usual. You put Bill Murray in a movie, any movie and you are guaranteed quality. He is talent. Naturally gifted, naturally funny, and also very intelligent. The man is King. I cannot praise him enough. No matter how hard I try.",10,2,5,23 May 2001
