Despicable Me 2," Clever, funny, delicious!!!!
","OMG!!! How funny a movie can be? Regardless of the answer, this one breaks the scale.... It is funniest movie I ever seem, the characters are impressive and the quality of special effects are stunning (special attention to the scene where the big rocket take them away of the castle, great perspective!!!) Probably, most of the people never noticed or don't pay attention, but how clever is that minions language!!! It is a mix of several terms of different languages which it is extremely well constructed and exceedingly funny. A person with knowledge/notions of 3 languages or more will have a great time trying to understand what the minions are talking. It gives authenticity to the movie and it is a great effort of the team responsible for the text in the movie to make it even more enjoyable, even if apparently people will never understand what they say.Well done and an amazing job!!!",10,1,1,9 August 2013
The Mist," Great King's Environment
","I really think that is very interesting when peoples that don't know the work of a great writer as Stephen King, give a bad vote to a excellent adaptation to big screen.It's clear that is the one of the best adaptations ever from a King's book. Who's don't like it, is because don't like King's books, and never must see a King's movies based.It's great!!! It's balanced!!! It's human!!! It's fantastic!!! Great director!!! The environment and the writing of King become images and a really complex emotional thriller...Congratulations, Mr Frank Darabont!!! Great work!!!",10,4,9,25 March 2008
A Quiet Place," Fantastic idea. Execution was a big shallow.
","I think it was a great idea, not sure if it's original, but it doesn't matter really. Great suspense, but the director and writers were unable to create a convincing outcome. The baby thing, really? No, that would be impossible. You can't control a baby. That was unnecessary. In general, although it was a great idea, the story had more holes than a Swiss cheese. A bit frustrating in the end, but entertaining at least.",6,0,1,1 August 2018
