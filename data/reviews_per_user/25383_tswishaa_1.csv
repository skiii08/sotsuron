It," big horror fan
","although this movie was composed well, i just wish Hollywood would learn that 1) only minimal special effects are needed for horror you do not have to go ham....2) this movie was way too long and lost excitement factor by the second half 3) this should be drama thriller category not horror wasn't not scary the clown just seems like a pervert hiding in the sewer i felt like i should call the law and order special victims unit rather then be scared a disappointment for the horror genre and I'm so harsh because i waited monthsssss for this movie maybe even a year...cut out extra scenes and lets get back to horror people real horror",4,16,31,9 September 2017
