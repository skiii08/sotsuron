Requiem for a Dream," How depressing
","I have watched this film once and will never ever watch it again, perhaps the single most depressing film ever made. I would of given it a higher mark as it is a 'good' film as it provokes an emotional response, however I would never wish anyone else to see the film as it isnt worth it.",7,2,4,4 February 2004
