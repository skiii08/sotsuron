The Blair Witch Project," Liked the movie, very much like The Last Broadcast, scared the %$%$# out of me!
","I just finished watching 'The Last Broadcast' on HBO which came out in 1998. Hmmmm, where have I seen this before.  Actually, Blair Witch was the scariest movie I've ever seen, my spine still tingles at the stick figure logo!  Maybe they stole the idea, but the plot, acting, and pretty much everything was much, much better.  I think it's one of those movies you either love or hate, but I think the people who didn't like it just don't want to admit it scared the heck out of them!  I highly recommend it, (and compare it to The Last Broadcast!)",Null,0,1,18 February 2001
