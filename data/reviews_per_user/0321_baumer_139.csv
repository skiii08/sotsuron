The Blair Witch Project," A tense and frightening film. Completely original.
","I think I am going to be the reviewer in here that is somewhat down the middle with my assessment of the film.  I have been reading reviews and comments about the film for about a month now, and most of the comments have been either a) it is the scariest film ever orat least since Halloween or b) it is absolute crap.  Well if I had to lean one way it would be towards a). But even though this film is scary, it honestly could have been the scariest film ever made if only for one small thing, and I'll get into that in a moment.As much as this film is a horror by definition, it is more of a psychological study of the human spirit.  This movie asks the question ' How much can a human being take before we lose it?'  And on that level The Blair Witch Project is perfect.  We see three people that start off with good intentions and ambitious spirits and then we watch them unravel as fear sets in.  And all throughout this film I kept asking myself how would I react if I was in the same situation?  And the answer that I came to was,probably the same way that these three did.  When you have human beings in what is seemingly a dire problem and an impossible location, how does that affect you?  Do you laugh about it?  Do you freak out on each other?  Do you look for blame?  Are you frightened?  The answer to those questions is 'Yes'. You do all of them.  The characters in this film are real people and what we see them go through is real.  And that is what makes this film as good as it is.  We feel that we are watching this happen to three people that we know because the film actually gives us time to understand these characters.  And that is good.  But what could have made the film a level above any horror film made before it is that we should of had more time at night when everything is happening and less time during the day when they are starting to lose their minds.  As I said, the way it is done is very good in it's execution, because we are watching realistic footage of how someone would be after five days of being lost in the wilderness with very little food, cold nights, and things going bump in the night.  But could you just for one second imagine how the film would of been if it concentrated more on things that go bump in the night than the psychological elements that it also gives us?  This would have been the personification of fear.  Having said that, make no mistake about it, this film is scary.  It is much more frightening than any film that has come out this decade.  And what makes it scary is the fear of not knowing.  No one knows what it is that they are hearing.  No one knows what it is that you see in that bundle of wood.  It's red and wet and looks like blood and enamel, but what exactly is it?  Not knowing what it is that is scaring these three people is terrifying.  I have been out of the theater for at least a half an hour now and my heart is still beating a little faster, it still hasn't recovered from all that this film put me through.  But as scary as it was, it could have had more night time stuff and less day time lead up to what happens at night.  The film established the fact that all the scary stuff happens when the sun sets, so why not give the audience what it came for?  And the only reason I am saying this is because it's not like the movie ran out of ideas, it's too smart for that, but it's just that they gave us ( the audience ) a chance to catch our breath.  And I like it when I can't breath from fear.  I like it when I feel as helpless and as frightened as the people in this movie.  And as much as I was, I wanted more.  I thirsted for more.To know all that this movie is, is to appreciate it.  The fact that they went out and concentrated on scaring us and not on seeing how many special effects they could fit into one scene is refreshing.  And it is wonderful. These guys know what the epitome of fear is.  They must be fans of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween.  It's just too bad that they couldn't keep us that scared for longer than they did.Blair Witch is a very scary film.  To say that it is a terrible film is to not understand the meaning of horror.  To say that you didn't enjoy the film is another story.  I admire this film for all that it is and all that it wanted to be and all that it came so close to being.  If only it didn't stray off course as little as it did, if only.....  Having said that, I really do like this film and it really did scare me.  You should see this, no matter what anyone says to you.  Give the guys a chance.  They had the courage and the talent to go out on a limb and make this happen, it should at least be rewarded for that.  And if you do want to see a scary film, you won't find one better in the last ten years.  And that is all that really matters. Because even though it could have been scarier, there is no film that I've seen in recent years that can hold a candle to it. 8.5/10",10,1,2,30 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," All of our primal fears are lived vicariously through this movie
","The Blair Witch Project is the personification of fear.  This is a film or rather an experience that knows what it is that scares the human soul.  As one reviewer so perfectly stated, this film brings back what it is that scared us as kids.  And what it is that scares us are things that are naturally frightful.  When you are five or six years old we are not naturally afraid of men with masks that stalk babysitters or men with hockey masks that haunt horny campers.  Those are things that are taught to us by the news or by watching enough scary movies.  But what we are afraid of, even though we don't know why, is the dark, strange noises in the middle of the night and our own subconscious.  We are afraid to go downstairs when the lights are off because we don't know what is waiting down there to get us. And the reason we are scared of these things is simply that it makes us think of death or extreme pain.  The Blair Witch Project preys on those fears.  And as long as it takes to get into those primal fears, the setup is worth the payoff.  What we witness is three people that could be budds that we went to school with.  They are not caked with makeup and set in the perfect light to make them Jennifer Love Hewitt or Joshua Jackson.  They are three people that are tired, unshaven, hungry, cold, deprived and scared out of their minds.  They are a microcosm of every single one of us put in the same situation.  I have never seen a film like this one before and only a handful of times have I felt close to what I did watching this film.  First there was Jaws, that made me afraid the water.  Halloween made me afraid of the night and Nightmare On Elm Street made me afraid to go to sleep.  There are a few others that made me feel similar to this, but no movie has ever made me feel exactly the way Blair Witch did.  In here you feel like what is happening is real.  8mm cameras can do that.  You are watching a home video and what you can't see scares the hell out of you.  We hear what they hear, we feel what they feel and we are prone to curl up in a ball and wait for the inevitable.  I have seen this movie twice now.  The first time I saw it for myself, the second time I saw it to watch the reactions of the people in the audience.  When the nights came and all the ruckus started, people ( audience ) curled up almost into fetal positions, they grabbed onto whatever arm was next to them and their breathing became a little heavier.  Male or female it didn't matter.  No matter if this film is fact or fiction, it attacks everything that makes us afraid and it exploits it like perhaps no other film has ever done or will ever do.  Now I have read the comments that dismiss this film as fluff and how it is not really scary, and that may be true for some people, but for the majority of the people that have seen this, it hits us with such force that it does cause you to keep the lights on at night.  This is ingenius film making and even though it is not exactly what people would consider on par with say Citizen Kane ( only on a technical level ) you will not find a film that manipulates our senses and our primarily our fear more than this one, and on that level, this is one of the best films ever made.  I can't say enough about this film.  It is a psychological trip through fear.  It makes us feel lost and it keeps us fearing that these people will never get out alive.  And it is true what people say: the last shot of this film will scare you more than any shot in the history of film.  That is high praise coming from me, I grew up on horror films.  You can take a shot of Michael Myers rising methodically in the background in the first Halloween, the opening death of Chrissie Watkins in Jaws, the dinner table scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the shower scene from Psycho, the boiler room scene in Nightmare On Elm Street, the scene where Hicks discovers the aliens in the ceiling from Aliens or even any one of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left ( that is some pretty select company ) and still they will not surpass the raw emotion and primal fear that you will feel in the last five minutes of this film.  Blair Witch is pure fear.  It should be seen by everyone at least once.  If I could meet any of the five major players in this film ( the three 'actors' and the two writer/directors ), I would thank them for showing me that someone hasn't forgotten how to make a scary film.  This is what fear should be.  Whoever makes the next 'Hollywood' horror film has giant shoes to fill. Good luck.",10,1,2,3 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," My final comment about Blair Witch
","Warning may be some spoilersOkay, by now I think many have seen the film and there seems to be quite the split about how great it is.  I for one loved this film.  I love that it was original ( and I say that knowing there are films out there like Cannibal Hollocaust and the Last Broadcast ), I love that it was documentary style, I love that it made you use your imagination and I loved the three actors in it. But I do have a few comments to make regarding the criticism.First off, the Blair Witch Project was a small film that like El Mariachi and Clerks was just hoping to get a video deal or perhaps a cable deal to recoup there budget.  So to say that this was film was over-hyped is a bit of a fallacy.  To me over hype is when a studio comes out and says a film that has been out for a few days ( take any Disney animated film ) is already a classic.  That is hype.  But when a film that no one really thought much of takes the film world by storm and it is us, the paying audience that gives it the kudos that it deserves, that is not hype, that is word of mouth.  So to say that this is a bad film because it was over hyped is just rubbish.  These two guys ( Sanchez and Myrick ) at the very least had an innovative idea and took what they remember as being scary from the classic horror films, and they combined it all into one scary-as-hell-play-with-your-mind-psychologically-tormenting-movie.  So it is not over hyped.Secondly) I can understand why some people don't like this film.  I know it is not for every taste.  But please stop and listen to yourselves when you do criticize it.  The majority of the people that don't like it say the same thing.  'Where's the witch?'  'The only thing scary about this is that I spent 10 bucks on it.'  ' Borrrrring.'  Well if that is how you feel, then that is how you feel, but the least you could do is try to elaborate why it is that you feel the way you do about this film.  And also try to realize that perhaps the reason you are not scared or at least tense in the film is not because it isn't well made, it is just probably that you don't fear the same things that some of the rest of us do.  This film relies solely on playing with people's minds, and it did a hell of a job with mine.Finally, I love this film.  I love everything about it.  I think it is the best film that I have seen this summer and I admire the two directors for doing what they did.  To make a film that concentrates on atmosphere and mind games instead of blood and gore is a true testament to how much they must love the genre.  Think of classic Carpenter and Hitchcock.  They did much of the same thing.  There was hardly any blood in the shower scene in Psycho and very little in Halloween.  Blair Witch also has but one scene with blood in it, and yet it is one of the most effective scenes in the film because you are shocked by it.To people that don't enjoy this film, I honestly have pity for you, and I do not mean that in a pretentious 'I'm better than you' kind of way.  I know we all have different tastes in horror films and that is okay, but if you could just feel the raw fear and experience that strange sensation when your heart races at the end of the film, or to actually go camping and stare into the darkness and wonder what that snapping twig is about ten feet away from you, you would really thank the guys for making this.  I love that this film could do that to me.  I love that it could get inside me like that.  And it's too bad that those of you that didn't feel that way, could, just for one moment.  That to me, is the power of film making.  To manipulate somone's emotions the way this film does is a treasure unto itself.Psycho had people in their generation always looking out of the shower. Jaws kept us out of the water.  Halloween kept us afraid of the night. Nightmare on Elm Street kept some of us from falling asleep.  Blair Witch will give you a paranoia about camping, for those of you that like the film that is.  My humble opinion, this is a 10/10.  When people ask me what the scariest horror films I've ever seen are, I will respond with Halloween, Jaws, Nightmare On Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Aliens, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left, Evil Dead, Amittyville Horror and the newest entry, The Blair Witch Project.  To me, and to many others, it is the epitome of fear.  And I love to be scared.",10,1,3,12 August 1999
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Can you say, Will Smith for best supporting actor this year?
","There are really only two reasons why you go to a movie.  One is to be entertained and the other is to be informed.  Sometimes being entertained is all we ask, as is the case of most summer movies.  Then at times we are lucky enough to be entertained and informed.  Films like Malcolm X, American History X, Saving Private Ryan are a few that come to mind.  Films like that dealt with important historical and social issues.  They opened my eyes to injustices of the past and the present and they did an excellent job of keeping me entertained in the process.  The Legend Of Bagger Vance on the other hand informed me in a different way.  It taught me a great deal about golf and some of it's history.  And it entertained me a great deal.  You see, for me, golf is now a great interest to me just as it is for a great many new fans.  Since Tiger Woods has transcended the sport and became iconoclastic, my interest in golf has multiplied exponentially.  Toss in a good Canadian prodigy named Mike Weir and I am now hooked on the sport.  I was even fortunate enough to see Tiger and Mike play at Glen Abbey this year where Mike had a difficult weekend and all Tiger did was win the triple crown for only the second time in the history of golf.  It was quite an event.
Golf is different than any sport, and that is because it is a gentleman's game.  There is a level of integrity and honesty to it.  You are responsible for keeping your own score and you are expected to uphold the rules of the game even when no one is there to govern you.  Could you imagine in hockey if you hooked a man from behind and the ref didn't see it, you then went up to him and said, ' look, I just took down Joe and I deserve two minutes in the box for that?'  Or if in football, you told the ref that you didn't really make the catch, that the ball touched the ground first?  It is unheard of.  But not in golf.  Not only is it your responsibility, it is your oath to do so, because if one wins the game of golf without integrity, then one is not a real man.  I realize how surreal that sounds, but it is so true.  Your victory would be tarnished and that would stay etched in your mind forever.  That is one of ( but certainly not the only ) the beauties of golf.  Such is one of the themes of this film.  Golf is the back drop and it deals with issues such as these but it is a film about much more.Critics have criticized the film for being too shallow and not containing enough substance, but I vehemently disagree.  You have to look for what this is about at times, but believe me it is there.  Will Smith plays Bagger Vance in by far his most in depth performance.  Smith is known more for his comedic roles and his propensity for box office success where as Matt Damon has had success box office wise as well, but not nearly the kind that Will has.  Yet he is known more for his great layered performances in films like Good Will Hunting and The Talented Mr. Ripley.  However, in Bagger Vance, Smith steals every scene he is in with Damon.  This is a performance that is worthy of an Oscar nod as best supporting actor thus far.  He is that good.Bagger Vance is a character that comes into Rannulph Junnah's ( Damon ) life just as he's entered into a golf tournament against the two best golfers of their era, Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones.  Junnah was once a revered golfer but then went to WWII and came back a scarred man.  He never regained his swing and now he flounders in a sea of confusion and drinks his life away. He is given this one chance at greatness again because of a young boy's belief in him.  The town is sponsoring a $10,000 dollar golf tournament in the middle of the Great Depression but it will only back it if one of their home grown talents will compete.  Hardy Greaves is a young boy of maybe 12, and he remembers when Junnah was the best golfer the south had ever known.  He tells the mayor and all the other town folk that he can get Junnah to play.  He doesn't disappoint.  He convinces Junnah that he can get his swing back again, with a little practise.  One night as Junnah is attempting in vain to regain his stroke, Bagger Vance comes walking into his life out what seems to be nowhere.  Somehow a conversation is started and Bagger Vance ends up being Junnah's caddy for the big match.  Now where did this man come from? How did he get here and why is here?  These questions are never answered but most people that I know and have talked to about the film think he is a guardian angel of sorts.  Was he sent here just so Junnah could regain his stroke?  Perhaps.  Maybe God really does love golf that much.  But maybe he was sent here not only to help Junnah with his game, but to help him with his life.  Golf is like the art of Zen to some people and in here it is spoken of in the same reverence.  If Junnah is to regain all that he once was, he is going to have to get rid of all his inner demons.  And sometimes inner demons are a bitch to ostracize.Bagger Vance is very laconic in his approach to things.  He only says what needs to be said and the rest has to be learned.  In all of the teachings about golf that are preached about in this film, the same can be said for life in general.  This film captured me and filled me with a sense of....life.  It did to me what American Beauty did in some ways.  It is one of the best films to come out this year and it is steeped with rich and wonderful performances.  This should go down in the annals of film as one of the best sports films ever made.  And of course Will Smith is wonderful.  I really think he will be looked upon differently in some circles after people see what he is capable of.But more importantly, this film taught me something about sport, golf in particular, but sports in general.  Even though Tiger has changed golf and there is a bit of swagger to it now with 5 million dollar purses and such, just take a minute sometime to take it all in.  Golf really is different than anything else.  In days when soccer fans are rabid enough to kill each other, hockey has people like Marty McSorley and one of the Niedermeyer boys head hunting with their sticks, football players celebrating voraciously and classlessly by slicing their throats with an imaginary knife, basketball players trash talking each other to the point of verboseness and the list can go on and on.  Fans of these sports can become rabid with their cataclysmic fanaticism and yet you watch the gallery in golf and you get a perspective of what it is all about.  When a golfer is about to take a shot, there is utter silence.  No one wants to disrespect any player, whether his name is Tiger Woods or a guy that is just hoping to qualify for Q-school. You have fans that will not touch a golfer's ball when it goes out of bounds, they all understand the integrity of the sport.  Then there are the players.  They play side by side and wish each other well.  They want to play the game to the best of their ability but not at the expense of someone's integrity.  Player's respect one another, that can not be said in any other sport, not on the same level as golf.  As Bagger Vance says in the film, 'Golf is a game that can never be won, only played.'  Words to live by. 9 out of 10.  This is one of the films to see this year.  Look for it to get some well deserved notirity in March.",Null,3,7,9 November 2000
Alien 3," a weak entry compared to Cameron's second
","David Finscher has since gone onto bigger things, especially his deeply dark film, Seven, and this being his directorial debut, he is given a little latitude.  Alien 3 is good.  It is not great but it does have some decent chills and it has a great ending that apparently sums up the series.The film is very dark and bleak and what I liked most about it was how Weaver seemed tired and beaten.  She is so tired of facing ' The Bitch ' and she conveys that wonderfully.  And even the alien seems tired of facing her. To really understand what is meant by all of this you have to watch it. It is not nearly as good as the second, but I believe it is better than the fourth.",6,4,6,22 June 1999
Gremlins," Unmatched originality
","' So the next time your refrigerator goes on the fritz, don't call a repairman.  You just never know, there might be a gremlin in the house. 'These are the words to end Gremlins.  And after the rollercoaster ride that the film has just put us through, they are the perfect way to end the film. These creatures are perhaps the funniest and most entertaining little ghouls I have ever seen.  They act like spoiled rotten little rich kids.  These gremlins could be human characters in books by Steven King.  They are not just mischeivious, they are down right mean, hilarious, awful, cruel and carefree.  Their idea of a good time is to spit up nasty loogies, flash people, swing from light fixtures, play poker, drink to annebriation, bite, claw, scratch and kill.  If you haven't seen this film, you have no idea what you are missing.  I think this is one of the most original films, on par with Star Wars in terms of originality.  Neither film has been imitated. You just can't do it.  Not only is this film entertaining and a little scary, but it is unbelievably funny.  And I think the hilarity stems from watching these varments act crazy.  They don't give a rat's ass about anything or anyone. They do what they please when they please and they are oblivious to the consequences of their actions.  There is one scene where they are attacking a Santa Clause and they are just hanging off him like he is a toy.  They are just terrorizing him.  They probably won't kill him, but they sure will scare the hell out of him.  They are also incredibly juvenile in their speech.  They seem to have a firm grasp of the English language but they speak like babies.  'Deagle, YUM YUM!'  or when they see Gizmo at one point, they whisper, 'Gizmo, Caca' Gremlins has one of the most amazing production teams assembled.  It was directed by Joe Dante, produced by the Amblin people ( Kennedy, Marshall and Spielberg ) and written by Chris Columbus.  No wonder this is a top notch production.  With people like this that have the propensity for success, I'm sure great pains were taken to get everything right.  And it shows.Gremlins is a film that I don't think can be imitated and that is because any attempt to make a film like this again and you would be accused of duplicating it.  So this may actually go down in history as one of the only films out there that doesn't have a clone.9 out of 10 One of the best film to come out of the 80's.  Watch for a funny line in Goonies when Chunk is calling the cops to report the Fratelli's and the cop says to him, 'Sure, sure, just like the time you called and told us about the little green monsters that were attacking you.'  Same production team and also Corey Feldman was in both films.  That is a great connection. 
This is just pure fun.",9,0,0,6 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The embodiment of entertainment
","Here we are nearing the end of the summer and by now people have already formed their own opinions of the film so what I have to say really may be inconsequential in deciding whether or not you like the film.  I happened to love it for all that it is, and all that people hated about this artform, I also loved.  I loved the CGI in this film, Jar Jar made me howl, the pod race was breathtaking, Darth Maul was perfect and the lightsabre battle at the end was right up there with the battle in Empire and Return.  Natalie Portman was a beautiful queen and Jake Lloyd played young Anakin wonderfully.  George Lucas directed with a frenzied energy and John Williams score was heartstopping.  It filled you with emotion and I could listen to that soundtrack with the lights off in my room any day or night.  The script was funny and it also had it's share of lessons and Jedi folklore.  The Jedi council was a great introduction into what Jedi's were like before ' A New Hope.'  Ewan McGregor was perfect as a young Obi Wan Kenobi, even nailing down his accent and dialect perfectly. Liam Neeson was perfectly subdued as the veteran Jedi Master and teacher. And the editting was sensational as it managed to paste together five simultaneous situations at then end and this is what kept you breathless. The Emperor story was also fun and it gave you a history as to where he came from.  I loved everything about this film.  There are not many films that come out that make you feel like you are back in the 80's when pure entertainment like Raiders and Rambo and Back To The Future graced our screens.  But The Phantom Menace does and it concentrates on entertaining the crowd for the full 120 minutes that it is on screen.  And this is one of the best movies to come out this summer ( I still hold Blair Witch as the pinnacle of all films this summer, TPM is a close second).  I think when people cut this film up it's because people want to hate it.  It is cool to be able to go to work and say ' I just didn't like it. '  After all, it sounds much more intellectual if you can go there and say that you enjoyed A Midnight Summer's Dream more than Star Wars.  And you know what?  It also makes you a liar.  Star Wars is pure entertainment.  It captures the child in every one of us and brings back to a time when we were kids again.  It is a movie that for two hours takes our minds off of deranged killers going into brokerage firms and shooting everyone, it takes us away from Columbine and away from headlines of animal beatings and mass genocide in Europe. These are things that we have to deal with in the real world, but in the theater when the lights go down and those words appear before us ' A long time ago in a galaxy far far away.... ' we just sit back and let our minds go and enjoy what is on screen.  Star Wars The Phantom Menace is a great film and it is a treasure to finally be able to watch this film after 16 years of purgatory.  And I am not disappointed in the film. It makes you yearn for the next one.  2002 seems like it is eons away.  But pre-production has already begun.  It will be here soon, just not soon enough.You know, there are films that I don't like that make tons of money ( The Whole Batman Series ) so maybe I speak with a forked tongue when I mention this, but folks, movies like Titanic and TPM don't make 600 and 400 million domestically because of hype and curiosity.  They do so because of strong word of mouth.  People actually enjoy it.  And isn't that what we ultimately want when we see a film?  Entertainment?  The Phantom Menace does that and it has you leaving the theater feeling that the 20 bucks you spent on a ticket and M&M's is worth it.  And that's all I ask for.",9,1,3,12 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A truly amazing beginning to the best film series ever made.
","To every one that has made criticisms about this movie whether it be about it stereotypes or it's racism or what have you, I just have one thing to say, lighten up. If someone has a Rastafarian accent or if another character has a big nose and owns slaves, does that mean that all of a sudden it's calculated and malicious racism?  Some people live their lives just to bring up garbage like this.  Are these people's lives so void of anything positive and fulfilling that they have to use the old racism angle to make themselves feel worthy and give their life some sort of meaning?If Jar Jar is a rebirth of Kunta Kente and Watoo is a greedy Jewish slave owner, then what is Greedo and Jabba?  Is Jabba an attack on all fat people saying that they are all lazy and have to be wheeled around and waited on hand and foot just to survive? Star Wars is fantasy, plain and simple.  George Lucas' world has a variety of interesting and diverse characters inhabiting the universe and if anything he dispells racism by having so many species living in harmony.Star Wars ' The Phantom Menace ' is a wonderfully entertaining film and it sets the stage for the next one and I loved it.  And if people wouldn't go out of their way to find ridiculous ways to shout ' racism ' they would see that this was a fantastic movie, well worth seeing 5 or six times.I love this movie.  And I love Jar Jar.  And in a world where now a days most movies are quite sub par, this is a refreshing throw back to what it used to be like when movies like Rambo and Raiders and Back To The Future and Ghostbusters and Star Wars used to grace our screens.  They are entertaining, and isn't that what we want when all is said and done?",9,1,3,9 June 1999
Ali," I still don't know anything....
","I remember when this film was being hyped and promoted.  The trailer seemed ubiquitous while perpetually appearing at the beginning of every film I had chosen to see in a span of perhaps a month of two.  The first couple of times the trailer played, I thought to myself that it didn't really look all that appealing.  In the next few weeks, I saw the same commercial and for some reason this time it was intriguing.  How that was possible, I wasn't quite sure.  But when I further examined the two trailers, I finally realized what was different.  It's amazing how music can affect you.  One trailer was filled with soft playing, gospel like music.  The next trailer assaulted our senses with hyped-up, outlandish hip-hop music.  You can guess which trailer had what music.  I mention this because it just goes to show you that when something is bad, it needs the marketing genius' that sell these products to us to discover a remedy instantly, hence the second trailer.  I am a firm believer that every movie should be given a chance, which is why I see films like Gosford Park, Tea With Musollini and Ali.  Every once in a while you discover diamonds in the ruff like Chocolat, more times than can be counted in one sitting, you get a film like Ali.  Sometimes a first impression is the correct one.The tag line for Ali advises us to forget everything we know about the man. Okay, I did that.  Now maybe it is just me, but if a tag line tells me to do that then there must be a reason for it.  Perhaps they are going to shock me with facts that have been uncovered that have never been made public. Oliver Stone is the master of that, Steven Spielberg can also lay claim to this theory.  But Michael Mann?  He has some work to do. 
I am still waiting for the big eye opener.  I have forgotten all that I know, now shock me.....Ali is almost lugubrious in it's presentation of Muhammed Ali, the man.  It takes a subject and a man that we all greatly admired and almost comically turns him into a caricature of his legend.  I can honestly tell you that I walked out of Ali A) not knowing anything more about the man than I originally thought I did and B) disliking him more for who he seemed to be. Ali always came across as a man who marched to the beat of his own drum.  A stoic, proud and principled man that made decisions based on what he thought was right.  After seeing this film, that couldn't seem further from the truth.  Will Smith's Ali appears to be puppet like as he gets swayed by Muslim beliefs and then betrayed by them only to be swayed once again.  And this is the legend that we all lionized?  What a sham!Besides the story of Ali, the man, the story of Ali, the film, is really quite hollow.  The script is practically infinitesimal and the more you watch and wait patiently to become enlightened with something, the more disappointed you are.  Like a previous reviewer stated, I also came to this film to see Ali run his mouth and to get in the ring.  Smith, while turning in a good performance, is denied greatness simply because the script doesn't give enough to work with.  I read somewhere that the film is supposed to be defined by Ali's ethereal, almost dream-like run through Africa.  Yet this run lasts for what seems like an eternity and when he is finished, I couldn't tell you what it is that he discovered about Africa or himself that he or we didn't already know.  Sly's run through Philadelphia just before his big fight with Apollo was probably what this film was trying to emulate. And it did a very poor job of that. This is a microcosm of what is wrong with the picture.  Too many intangible and uneven scenes and not enough insight and examination into one of the most famous men in the world.  Hey, if you want to see how many women Ali bedded in his lifetime, then by all means, go see Ali.  If you want to know why he became a Muslim or why his best friend, Drew Brown, turned to alcohol and drugs or how he spent all of his money or the amusing relationship Ali had with Howard Cosell or even more about the fight with George Foreman, then this is the wrong film for you.  Michael Mann really has a small resume for such an acclaimed and respected director.  He was lauded for his work on The Insider and he managed to pull off Heat, with Kilmer, DeNiro and Pacino.  I don't know the man personally and I am not saying he is a terrible director, but I just don't think he seems to grasp how to be poignant with his use of such highly regarded situations like Ali and the tobacco industries problem.  The Insider, I believe, was a troubled film mainly because of Mann's direction.  Perhaps his forte is gratuitous action and violence and perhaps he is not well suited to direct something that is supposed to be a great film like the one's he has done recently.  And who knows, maybe it is just me.  But Ali is quite a failure in my eyes.3 out of 10 --  Will Smith is good but beyond his impersonation of the man, there is really not much to like or be inspired with in this film. Most who have seen this have taken umbrage with it.  And calling this a classic film is more than just a little hyperbolic.  It is not even a well made film.",2,1,2,24 January 2002
The Ring," This is an old school horror film
","Let's just get right to the point. The Ring is the scariest horror film I have seen in 20 years. Horror has been enjoying a healthy revival since 1996 when Scream got everyone interested in horror again. That is a good thing. What isn't so good is some of the cheap crap that has come out since then. For every film like The Sixth Sense and Blair Witch, you have a plethora of other films that have no idea what true horror is really about. Too many film makers think the best thing to do with horror is make a rockin' hardcore soundtrack and give us buckets of blood because this disguises the fact that most of them can't pace a film or invoke true chills. Gore Verbinski's The Ring returns to the roots of horror and pays homage to the early greats like Halloween and Psycho but almost goes a step past the greats, not quite but almost.The Ring does something that only a handful of horror films have done, and that is it stays in your subconscious hours and days and weeks after you watch the film. Gore Verbinski and Ehren Krueger have combined to make a masterpiece of modern horror that goes beyond anything that has come out for the last twenty years. This film is that good. For a guy who grew up loving films like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, I have been yearning for a film like this. A film that not only is a great scary film but a film that is a pure kinetic experience, one that makes me look behind me at my silent television sitting in the corner of the room. Is Samara there? When my radio begins to go haywire and search for stations on its own, is that Samara? This film gets inside of you and stays there. But it eats away at you like the nightmares that Malcolm McDowell is forced to watch in A Clockwork Orange. It attacks your mind and berates your senses. Samara is one bad ass villain. The Ring is a masterpiece and as I have already stated, this is the best horror film to come out since 1984 when Freddy Krueger stalked us in our dreams. The Ring may have it's roots in Japanese horror, but it owes much of its pedigree to all horror greats of the past, whether they are American, Canadian, Japanese or Italian. There is a bit of it all in here and the results are kinetic.When I watch a horror film, I know it is effective when that chill comes over you. Not the kind that makes you want to put a jacket on but the kind that literally starts from the nape of the neck and goes down the beginning of your butt. It's the chill that attacks your body and tells you that you are now at the mercy of the film and nothing you see from here on out is going to be expected. That is how The Ring is. The Ring had me scared. It had me nervous and it had me thrilled. Having fear envelop you is one of the most primal emotions you can experience. The Ring is a primal movie.There are a myriad of reviews in here that will tell you how amazing this film is, you should listen to them. This is a year that has been blessed with brilliant horror. With superb efforts like Mothman Prophecies, Frailty and now The Ring, 2002 should be known as the best year for horror films since the early 80's. If you only see one horror film this year, please see The Ring. If you want to be scared, see The Ring. It is a guarantee that this film will frighten and maybe even traumatize you. If films like The Changeling, The Shining and Halloween are synonymous with horror to you, then add The Ring to your vernacular.Oh, and you will never look at your television set the same again.And one final note. There is one infamous scene in this film, near the end, and I'm sure we all know what it is, and this is one of those scenes that will stand the test of time as one of the great images in horror films. I know horror aficionadoes will recall scenes like Hitchcock's shower scene, the bouncing ball in The Changeling, Michael Myers rising in the background at the end of Halloween, the head spinning scene in Exorcist, Freddy's tongue coming out of phone in Nightmare on Elm Street and Jason's first kill wearing his hockey mask in Friday the 13th Part III just to name a few. But *****************big spoiler here if you have not scene the movie********** when Samara comes out of the T.V., that is one of the most indefeasible and primal scenes I have seen in any horror film. It shocked me and thrilled me all at once. It is an image that will never leave my mind and it is just one of a plethora of scenarios that makes the Ring such an absolute masterpiece.",10,1,2,27 October 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," There will never be another film like Raiders
","It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. ' Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. ' ( a battered and bloody Indy ) ' Truck? What truck?' ( and then later ) 'Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. 'Sola ) ' How? ' ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.'Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME",10,308,433,9 July 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of the best films ever made and experienced
","Everyone gets lost in nostalgia from time to time.  Many of us vividly recall the days when the most important thing you had to do that afternoon was find a place to stay cool or to make sure that all of your friends were willing to go on whatever adventure you wanted to embark on.  For me, those days were the years between 1980 and 1987.  At this time I was between the ages of 8 and 15.  This was a time when some of the greatest movies were ever made for a teenaged boy.  The genesis of film was started in my life with films like First Blood, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, The Goonies, Back To The Future and of course E.T.
Being that movies were such an intricate part of my young life and these experiences shaped me into the man that I am today, it is easy to recall with reverence the entire experience that went with those films.  E.T. is a rare film however, because it is an experience that just gets better with age.There was a theater in Windsor Ontario, where I spent my youth called the Vanity, located on Oullette Street, right near Wyandotte.  This one theater was the place to be when the blockbsuters arrived.  It was a one celled theater that managed to flourish in a time which pre-dated multi plexes with arcades and Pizza Hut's.When the sequel to Star Wars arrived, the Vanity proudly played it.  Same with Raiders and it's sequels and of course E.T.  E.T. was a film that me and my best friend Gary had to see because it was Spielberg.  Even though we were ten years old, we knew that Spielberg had given us great films like Jaws, Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not sure if it is normal at the age of ten but we rushed out to see E.T. because we knew who directed it.  What a phenom this tiny film turned out to be and what a life changing experience the whole film was.When you are ten and you see a movie with your best friend who watches the A-Team and Conan the Barbarian with you, you expect a certain reaction from him.  After all, this same friend enjoys playing football at lunch and enjoys inflicting pain in a barbaric pasttime called the 'The Tripping Game', therefore you don't expect a film to affect you and your macho friend the way E.T. did.  When you are ten, you go to the movies to see things like lightsabre duels and heroes with bullwhips being lowered into the Well of the Souls and maybe the occasional breast shot.  What you don't expect is a film to manipulate your emotional realm thh way E.T. did and still does. Most of my friends who saw E.T. bawled their eyes out at the age of ten. I, for some unexplainable reason did not.  I loved the film but it wouldn't be for another six years that I cried in my first film.  That was She's Having A Baby when Kate Bush sang Woman's Work and made me sob uncontrollably as I watched Kevin Bacon lose his unborn child.  Some things can't be explained.E.T. became one of my favourite films and I saw it again on its re-release in 1985, bought the poster, purchased the movie on VHS and told everyone who would listen that E.T. got robbed at the 82 Oscars when it lost every major category to (snicker snicker) Gandhi.  There have been some Oscar travesties but this ( along with Annie Hall defeating Star Wars and Cuckoo's Nest beating Jaws ) had to be up there as one of the most ridiculous snubs ever. I was peeved.  What a joke.  But all of the cranky and derelict academy members seethed with contempt and jealousy because they couldn't accept the fact that a man this young could really be this much of a genius.  In fact he made the rest of the folks in Hollywood look young compared to himself.As the years passed I became a film lover, a movie buff and I tried to see any and every film out there.  And I did.  It's not that E.T. became an after-thought, it's just that it became one of those films that just sat it my collection and wasn't utilized often enough.  When I made my revised top 25 list, E.T. would always hover around number 20.  That is not an indictment of the quality of E.T., it's just that my tastes became more garnered to horror films and the sheer brilliance of E.T. was stored in the catacombs of my mind.  That all changed on March 24th, 2002.  This is ironic because my wife and I had the whole day planned.  We were going to see E.T. at the theater and then come home and watch the 24 hour Oscar-a-thon.  And in a year when an inferior film like A Beautiful Mind takes top honours from the much more ambitious and deserving Lord of the Rings, it reminded me of 20 years ago.  I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.Seeing E.T. after a 17 year hiatus was nothing short of uplifting.  My excitement was gushing and when John Williams' ever recognizable score reverberated over the sound system, I was hooked and it felt like I was ten all over again.  I also noticed that the audience was an eclectic mix of young kids, 30 somethings like myself and the elderly.  All of us were there because we either wanted to experience it for the first time or because we wanted to feel what it was like that first time we saw it 20 years ago.I think I liked E.T. when I was ten but this time around I developed a deep level of respect for it.  E.T. is simply one of the finest films ever made and if you have not seen the film in the theater then you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything about this film is perfect, and there really aren't many films around I can say that about.  Even some of my personal favourites have moments of weakness but not E.T.  There has never really been another movie that has offered the experience that E.T. does.  And when I said that I didn't shed a tear while watching E.T., that has all changed. I think there were about five moments in E.T. that had me holding back the tears.  You can analyze the film, psychologically deconstruct it and tell me that the reason the film works so well is because of the feeling of loneliness and comradery and I will agree with you.  But I don't really care about that.  What it comes down to is that E.T. is a film that will touch you in a way that no other film before could do and no other film after it can.  1982 was a different time for film and it was a different time as a civilization.  And E.T. encompassed all of that.  If I had to make my revised top 25 list, E.T. would be number 2, right behind Jaws and ahead of JFK, Halloween, American Beauty and Raiders of the Lost Ark.If you have not seen E.T. at the theaters since 1985, please I urge you, go see it again.  It is a film experience that is indefeasible.  It is also a film that should be looked upon as a paradigm for which all movies should try to emulate.  There is a reason that films like E.T. and Star Wars and Raiders make the money they do.  And there is also a reason they stay firmly planted in our memories.  That is because they mean something and they stand for something.  Those are the qualities in film that transcend time and they transcend the generations.10 out of 10----What more can be said?",10,132,190,14 May 2002
Casablanca," I was impressed
","I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of older movies, classics or not. Most of them are poorly acted and have stories that are completely outdated and frankly I find them quite boring.  But this movie was quite entertaining and I can understand why audiences would go crazy for the film when it first came out.  Not bad, not bad at all.",8,0,3,22 June 1999
The Big Lebowski," Shut the **** up Donny!
","I have honestly never seen a film like the Big Lebowski before.  Just like I have never seen a film like Fargo before.  Both were done by the Coen brothers and both were funny and strange at the same time.  And both had roles in them for Steve Buscemi, who can make a good film great, a bad film good and a weird film watchable.I can't say I loved this film even though I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. But what I can say is that I really liked it.  John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are so funny in this film.  Goodman has issues.  That's for sure.  He has many issues that he is dealing with.  But instead of dealing with them like a scarred Vet usually does, he deals with them in anger but a funny anger if that is possible.  He lashes out at his friends especially Donny who just doesn't seem to say any of the right things when Goodman is around.Bridges is excellent as well.  His character really just wants to get through the day and bowl and not have anyone pee on his carpet.  But of course none of that is going to happen in the strange world that the Coen's have created.What is not so great about this film is all the dream sequences.  They are confusing and they don't hit the right note.  They feel more like a nuisance.But this is a film that should be experienced.  It is at least original and it is worth a few laughs.",9,1,2,24 June 1999
Unbreakable," Know one thing.....Shyamalan is a genius.
","Warning: does contain spoilers.As we all sat in theater and we saw the haunting image of Bruce Willis being told in an eerie and confused voice by a doctor that he was the sole survivor of a train wreck, and that he wasn't scarred or broken in any way, we were intrigued.  Then those magic words flash across the screen....FROM THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR OF SIXTH SENSE.  Now we are hooked.  Toss in Samuel L. Jackson playing the prophet, and now we have perhaps the most anticipated film of the year.  And yet the funniest thing about the whole thing is that no one really had a clue what the film was about.  All we knew is that Bruce had a secret.  So going into the film, we were really all just conformists hoping that this film was going to capture us the way Sixth Sense did.  Now I don't think that this film is for everyone, which seemss to be the general consensus from other reviewers in here, but for those that understand the film and for those that can appreciate it, you are in for a treat. 
From here on out, if you don't want to know what the film is about, then stop reading. Bruce Willis plays David Dunne, who, as the film opens is riding on that doomed train destined to crash.  We all know this from the trailers.  But as he is riding on that train, a pretty young woman asks if the seat is taken next to him and he says no.  As she sits down, he takes off his wedding ring and begins to flirt with her.  As we already know, somewhere along the way in the film, we are going to see that Willis may have some sort of gift that prevents him from injury, but that doesn't mean he is unbreakable in other facets of his life.  Somewhere along the way, he has lost contact with his family and he and his wife don't even hold hands as he is being released from the hospital.  Upon leaving the funeral for the passengers of the train wreck that he survived, he finds a note on his car from a place called LIMITED EDITION, and on it, it asks him how many days he has ever been sick in his life. This question intrigues him and since he can't remember himself, he goes to the one source that knows him better than he knows himself, his wife.  She can't ever remember him being sick.'Doesn't that strike you as odd?' he asks her.When David finally meets Elijah Price, we learn that Elijah has sought him out because Elijah is one of the most breakable men in the world.  His bones are easily broken and his cells react very poorly to disease and have a hard time fighting off even the common cold.  It seems that these two are the complete opposite.  Elijah tells David that he believes he is  'unbreakable' simply because Elijah is not.  If a man like Elijah exists, then there must be a man out there that is on the other side of the spectrum. 
The rest of the film moves along slowly, not in a bad way but slowly enough so that we have time to understand everyone involved.  Shyamalan cares about his characters and he does take them seriously.  He wants us to know them and understand them, so that when the big secret is unveiled to us, not only do we understand why the secret is the way it is, but we also understand how the movie was filmed and why it was done so in the way it was.  Get it? Well don't worry if you don't.  See it again and you will.I read a review about Unbreakable by the venerable Roger Ebert, and he praised the film but then criticized the ending saying that it felt like it was rushed, that more care was needed, so instead of giving it four stars he gave it three.  My response to that is this:I am not a lover or a connoisseur of the thing that Shyamalan is.  I will not reveal what that is, but saffice it to say that if you at least understand them, then you will see what the direction the film is heading in.  There are many hints and subtleties that you can begin to guess about half way through the film what is happening.  That is not to say that the secret is not shocking, because it is.  It's just that this time you can see it coming from a far.  And that is done through actions, camera shots, camera angles, the colouring of the film, the dialogue, and the costumes. This is a brilliant film that wants to emulate a passion that one man has for one particular thing in this world.  And when you open your film by telling your audience that the world of COMICS is bigger than any of us imagined, well that should give us a clue right there.  Make no mistake about it, this film is calculated from beginning to end.Unbreakable is one of the best films to come out this year and the great thing about is that it is simple but effective and Shyamalan may have just created a franchise for himself and Willis and Jackson.  Touchstone is probably counting the dollars as we speak.I do recommend that this film be viewed twice, not because the secret is as good as Sixth Sense was, but because it is a film worth viewing several times.  And yes, when you do give it a second viewing, you will understand it more and praise it more, and crave the next one.10 out of 10- Sheer brilliance.",10,21,35,24 November 2000
Fight Club," A sign of the times
","Warning: May contain some spoliers.I don't know if it is my generation that is more cynical or if it is just that I notice it more because I am part of my generation.  Were 20-somethings in the 1930's or the 1950's just as upset and had the same at-the-end-of-their-rope kind of attitude towards life and all that makes it go round?  I can't answer those questions because I am both too young to know and I also don't know enough about sociological histories of us as people to make an educated guess.  But I can guesstimate rather intelligently that there is a good chance that people weren't quite as cynical as my generation is because there wasn't as much to be bitter and cynical about.  I am not saying that people from past generations didn't have stresses and pressures but they certainly didn't have the same things to worry about that we do heading into the new millenium.  Credit card abuse and subsequent debt is out of control, banks are bigger and more powerful than they ever have been, the job market is paradoxically increasing and decreasing at a rapid rate, capitalism is still a great thought and concept for those that capitalize on it but it is cumbersome and burdensome for most others, computers are again paradoxically a blessing and then again they may be the anti-Christ.  The point is that there are so many new things to worry about now than there were when my parents were growing up.  And a movie like Fight Club in some subliminal and metaphoric ways address these issues quietly and then in other ways it is not quiet metaphors that grace the screen but loud in-your-face opinions and facts that bombard you and forces you to ask yourself some tough questions.  Movies like Fight Club don't come around too often and that is because not every movie or the people behind it have the intelligence and the audacity to ask such tough questions nor do they the smarts to make an entertaining movie to please the masses that may not want to see a deep film and nothing more.  Fight Club is one of the best films to come so far this year and even if it is perhaps 15 minutes too long, I would rather see a film that has too much to say than a film that has nothing to say at all.  Fight Club has a lot to say.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play two completely opposite characters that are some how attracted to each other, not in the sexual sense of course, but perhaps because they are such opposites, one lives vicariously through the other.  For those of you that have see this movie, you will know how true that statement really is, for those of you that haven't seen it, you have to view it for yourself to really comprehend how true that statement really is. Norton is a bit of a repressed, yet seemingly average society guy that just exists.  His world and his life don't really go any further than his office and his apartment and his only form of social engagement is through the television and through self help groups that he begins to attend.  He doesn't suffer through any of the symptoms that the groups suffer with but this is his way of expressing himself, his only way of letting go.  Pitt plays Tyler Durden, a recluse who prides himself on living hard and living fast and having fun with what he has and laughing at what he doesn't.  He is also incredibly charming, ridiculously smart and clever and he is in the best shape that I have seen a guy in that has been in the movies, think of Stallone in Rocky IV but slim him up some and you have Tyler Durden.  He also has sex for what seems to be hours at a time and always pleasures the lady that he is with.  Norton seems in awe of him and they form some sort of friendship, and that is how Fight Club starts.  One night after a few beers they begin to fight after Durden tells Norton to hit him.  So he does and they begin this nightly ritual and soon other people come to their underground hush-hush fisticuff display and they too are there to get their anger and frustrations out.  The rules of Fight Club are very strict, and I'm sure by now we have all heard that the first and second rule of Fight Club is to not talk about it. I, as a reviewer, and film lover, like that rule so I will not tell you anymore what the film is really about or what it encompasses and what direction that it goes in.  Just know that if you pay attention to what the film is saying, you will get a lot more out of it than a bunch of guys pounding each other to a pulp.  This film is very entertaining but moreso it is intelligence personified.  It has opinions about our life, our lifestyle, our obsessions, our vices and almost everything that defines the times that we live in.  I don't think I have really seen a film like this before and I applaud it for having the guts and the intelligence to challenge it's viewers to think.  Sure, there are a lot of bloody and gory scenes in here but they are not really any more shocking than some of the other films that are out there these days.  Too much has been made of that small part of the film when what should be told is how this film will make you feel as you leave the theater and how it will stay with you in the days and weeks to come.  American Beauty did that to me and even though these are two different films, they have similar things to say but they just took different roads to get to a similar point.  And both are two of my favourite films to come out this year.  I hope this film does get some recognition at Oscar time, it is that good.  Oh yeah, and it has a really neat secret, you thought Sixth Sense was clever in that way, wait until you see this one. It's even better, I think anyway.In a year that has given us a lot of great films ( Blair Witch, Arlington Road, Instinct, Sixth Sense, American Beauty, Three Kings, American Pie and The Matrix just to name a few ) this is one of the best and it will probably make a lot of critics top ten lists.  It has made mine so far and if the race for Oscar goes as it usually does then this film will get lost in the shuffle as most films that want to be remembered at Oscar time get released later in the year.  But no matter, this is still one of the best this year and if you have avoided this film because of what you have heard about the violence, then my advice is simple.  Ignore all that and go see it for what it has to say.  You will walk out of the theater with a new look on what you see around you.  But then again, do you want to do that or do you enjoy living in the bubble of naivete that this film claims we do?  Think about it.",8,0,1,11 November 1999
Citizen Kane," WHY?
","I'm 27 years old.  I first saw this film in first year film studies at Carleton University.  It was required viewing for the course.  I hated the film then.  I thought that maybe because I've had five years to grow and mature that I would give this film another chance and watch it for the third time in my lifetime.  Guess what?  My opinion has changed.  I hated it then and now I just dislike it quite a bit.  And the question that I have is why? Why is this film the masterpiece that people say it is?  Is it really because it revolutionized film back in the 40's?  Okay, so it invented the wipe and it had lots of different styles of lighting.  That may make it brilliant on a technical level, but come on people, you cannot tell me that this is not one of the most boring films ever made on the face of this planet or any other planet that has theaters to watch movies in.  How can you get excited about a film that creeps along like a snail moving across a highway in the middle of nowhere?  I really feel like Welles is taking all of you  for suckers.  Because I think he set out to make a boring film just to see if audiences would have an orgasm over it because of its technical brilliance.  I still think he is laughing.  I know I would be.There was really nothing to like in this film except for one thing.  I can honestly admit that Welles' acting will stand up well today.  He does play Kane with energy and he is believable.  Almost all older films have cardboard actors that speak to fast, have little emotion, overact or are just plain bad actors.  Kanes's second wife in the movie was so laughable that I eventually fast forwarded most of her lines in the film.  She whined and cried and moaned and she was boring.  You ever seen Aliens?  Remember Newt, the little girl that Ripley takes care of, well that is Dorothy Corningmore's character as a little girl.  What a joke.Citizen Kane has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes for six decades!!! Critics, well I can understand them liking this piece of garbage, they have to or they look like they are incompetent fools.  That is their job.  But the general public?  Are you people on a really bad acid trip?  I welcome any emails that would please try to explain to me the greatness in this film.  Please, contact me.  I really am dying to know.  Why is this a tragic film?  Why is this an American masterpiece?  I am begging for some insight, because I haven't heard anything or read anything that says how great it is. All I have read is a bunch of people conforming to popular opinion that this is THE MOVIE to see.I can name about 500 films that I have seen in my life time that are better than this and some of them I probably don't even like that much.  I would even go so far as to say that a really good Friday the 13th film is better than this joke of a film.Well, I guess diplomacy is not one of my strong points, but I really don't understand the beauty, importance, tragedy, wonder or any other compliment that has been bestowed on Citizen Kane.  It just doesn't do it for me. You want to watch a great film that has everything that this film apparently has?  Watch Jaws, JFK, Apocalypse Now, Aliens, Mississippi Burning.  That is just a handfull of films that are what I consider to be the best films ever made.  I don't think that this is on my list of worst films ever made anymore ( it used to be ), but it easily tops my list of most overhyped, ridiculous boring films to ever disgrace our screens.",5,3,9,17 August 1999
Shakespeare in Love," A rather boring uninteresting movie
","I guess I am just one of those people that will never understand the intrigue and fuss about Shakespeare.  I don't enjoy any of his work unless it is parodied in Porky's 2.  I found this movie to be well acted and well directed and it had good cinematography and a few laughs.  But that is like having a big juicy looking hamburger that looks just amazing.  It's dressed perfectly and has tomato and cheese and lettuce hanging over the side. But then when you bite into it, it tastes like cardboard.  That is what this film was like to me.  It just didn't have me interested in the characters. Judi Dench was well deserved of her Oscar ( I enjoyed her ) but the film was rather boring.",4,1,3,9 June 1999
Alien: Resurrection," What was a great series is now old like the Fridays.......
","I'll try to make this brief.  Alien was good because it set the tension up and then unleashed the terror.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made because James Cameron is brilliant, the supporting cast was spectacular and it was a terrifying experience.  Alien3 was okay because Ripley looked and sounded exhausted from facing the alien one too many times, and she dies with the monster.  Alien Resurection is just okay because there is nothing new to do here.  We have seen it all before and there is very little chance that the directors of 3 and 4 know how to create tension the way that Scott and Cameron did.  The film is tiresome.  Ripley isn't the frightened but tough heroine that she was before.  Now she is a terminator.  And that takes away from one of the elements that made the first and especially the second one so good.  In Aliens, Weaver had lines like,  'I hope you're right. Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew. ' Now I expect her to say ' I'll be back. '  It's just not the same.  And her bravado does not bode well for the picture here.  Having her this tough and emotionless would be like having Rambo as a wimp that begs the bad guys to stop before they torture him.  It just doesn't fit.Alien 4 is not a terrible film.  It is okay, but it does not have the feeling that a good Aliens film does.  And maybe that is asking too much of it because the first two were really incredible films.  But the series is tired and I really hope it is over.  The only way I would like to see another one is if Cameron directs.  And seeing as that is not going to happen, let this series come to end.  It's dead.  Ripley is dead.  The Alien is dead.  All the cool characters are dead.  May the series rest in peace. It's time to leave it alone.Alien series 1979-1997 R.I.P.",6,1,1,27 July 1999
Alien: Resurrection," The end of what was once a proud series
","I really hope this is the end of this series.  Alien was a good film with lots of atmosphere.  Aliens was one of the best films ever made and it was one of the few films that I can say actually made me frightened and nervous. Alien 3 was stylistic but annoying and Alien 4 displays nothing that made the first two great.  In the first and especially the second, Ripley was a scared but tough heroine that knew better than anyone what the Bitch was capable of.  In the second film she says things like ' I hope you're right because just one of things managed to wipe out my entire crew. '  Now she is a cyborg and she has no fear and that takes away one of the most rudimentary things that made the first two scary.  We could live vicariously through Ripley and her fear.  But in this one, it is just a bunch of idiots running around that we don't care about.  In Aliens we had Hudson ( is this going to be another bug hunt SIR? ) Hicks ( okay, we waste him, no offense ) Vasquez ( I just need to know one thing, where they are ) and even Apomb ( look into my eye! ).  These characters added an element to the film that Alien 4 could never hope to copy.  So what are we left with?  I'm not sure, but it is not a good product, that is for sure.  Even Winona Ryder can't do anything with the role that she was given.  So the series has worn out it's welcome.  It's time to put it to rest.  I have heard that there is talk of a fifth, are these going to go the way of the Rocky's?  I hope not because the first two were really superb films.  I really hope they end it now.  Please.  This is not a good film and I can't see how the next could be any better, unless Cameron directed..... nah, that would be too good to be true.",6,1,3,13 August 1999
Mississippi Burning," Where does hatred come from?
","Where?  Where does racism come from?  How can one race feel superior to another?  Are we born with it?  No.  Do we become it on our own?  Maybe?  Or is it perhaps that we are taught it?  There is a small scene in Mississippi Burning that is just as powerful as any Gene Hackman speech or any violent montage to gospel music that is in this film.  There is a rally at a park with the head of the KKK ( without his hood ) telling thousands of people that have gathered that he loves being white.  He loves the fact that Mississippi is segregated.  And in the crowd the camera pans across and shows three year old kids smiling and cheering as gleefully and loudly as their parent's are.  It is haunting.This film is bit like JFK in a way.  It is not an absolute recreation of the events that took place in 1964, but it is a film that tells a true story and then adds a bit of fiction to make it more interesting for a mass audience. For example, the case was not cracked by Mr. Anderson fooling around with Pell's wife.  But that is besides the point, the point being that this film is mesmerizing.  Everything from its direction, cinematography, acting, writing and music, it is the best film of 1988.  And having Rain Man take most of the major awards is really quite sad.  Because Mississippi Burning is much more ambitious, important and well done.  Rain Man is a very good film and I will even go as far as to say that Hoffman is the only one that deserved to win best actor just as much as Hackman did.  But 1988 was a bad year for the rest of the Oscars.  Anyway...I have been edgy before.  Boyz and the Hood did that to me, but this film makes me angry.  It makes me want to jump back into 1964 and try to do something to stop this.  The film is that strong at showing us how terrible and pointless racism is.  And in order to make this film work, there has to be strong elements in all areas.  But for me, what really made me feel the things that I did is the actors that played their roles.Hackman is brilliant.  He gives the performance of a lifetime and it is his anger that gives him his edge.  He sees things differently than Mr. Ward does and that sometimes makes them bump heads with each other.  But they ultimately have the same goal in mind.  Just different ways of achieving that goal.  Dafoe is great as well, but it is the supporting cast that really makes this film.  From Dourif to R. Lee Ermey to Stephen Tobolwolski, these characters are richly portrayed by the actors that play them.  There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.  He plays Frank, the nastiest, meanest, no conscience, negro hating person that I think I have ever seen on film.  I don't know where his anger comes from, but he is the kind of character that you can imagine had a violent father that drank too much and always told stories about how bad the black man was.  When Rooker is on screen you listen.  You pay attention to what he is saying and doing.  And my hatred of him was one of my favourite parts of the film.Mississippi Burning shows us how strange people are when it comes to racism. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do, they just know that they do.  And they are powerless to stop themselves.  What happened to the three civil rights workers was a disgrace and a tragedy. But not just because three boys were murdered, but because no one knows why they were murdered,besides racism that is.  Why did they have to die? Because they were a different colour of skin?  Because they were Jewish?  It really doesn't make any sense.Mississippi Burning is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is important and it is entertaining.  If you haven't seen it, do so just for the scene with Mr. Anderson and Deputy Pell at the barber shop.  That is worth the price of the rental alone.  But for a really important film that has something to say, this is one of the best.",10,148,191,18 July 1999
The 13th Warrior," a bunch of guys kill a bunch of other guys
","May contain spoilers:Where do I start?  Well, I liked the dog.  He had more character developement than any of the human characters.  I don't think I have ever felt so empty after leaving a movie with this much action.  I don't think I have ever wondered so much how a film like this got made.  Especially since the guys behind the scenes are really good movie guys.  John McTiernan is a great director ( Predator, Die Hard ) and when Andrew Vajna was partners with Mario Kassar, he used to put his name on some really good projects ( Rambo, Angel Heart, T2 ) but what anyone saw in this picture is actually beyond me.  And to invest 110 million dollars in it is an absolute joke.  I can't imagine the two page treatment for this film.  Because you could actually do it in less than a paragraph.  'A guy who can't fight gets thrown out of his land because he loves the kings wife.  Then for no particular reason he has to be the 13th warrior to fight a battle that has nothing to do with him or the other warriors.  He learns how to speak Nordic in about a week, he learns how to fight overnight and then we have about four really intense battles.  People die and some live and then the dog sits down and says a doggy prayer for the dead warrior.'That is it.  Honestly.  There is nothing more to this story.  Supposedly this guy has to join these other warriors because the 13th warrior has to be a man that is not from the north.  But why that is was never explained. There was no reason for his character.  No prophecy, no folklore, no religious purposes for him to be there.  He is just there so Banderas can be the attractive guy in the picture so ladies can swoon over him.  And you know a movie is bad when you start to critisize trivial things like how Banderas is the only one in the film that is well groomed, shaven and clean. The rest of the warriors look like warriors.  Banderas looks like he just stepped out of his trailer in every scene.  Then there was the scene when they were on the boat at the beginning and I said to myself 'If they have their horses after the journey on the boat is over, I'll laugh. '  And they did.  Watching 13 horses and 13 men get off this tiny boat was like watching clowns get out of a mini car at the circus.  Where did they all sleep? Where did they all stand?  Was there a basement?  Was there an extension to the boat that I wasn't aware of?  Were they in the spirit world?  Does God exist?  All very important questions, but no concrete answers.The action in this film was great.  The battles were bloody and violent but where was the story?  Where was the characterization?  To prove that it is possible to combine both of them wonderfully, check out Predator.  Seven guys, one beast, lots of action and great character developement.  This film has none of that ( except the action ).  You can see where this movie spent a hundred million dollars, but if it was that much why didn't they make a good story.  And don't pin this one on McTiernan, his direction was great. Pin this one strictly on Crighton.  The film is creditting both McTiernan and Crighton as directors.  It is rumoured that the test audiences didn't like it so they hired Crighton to do some extra scenes to spice it up.  Why? The problem is not the direction, it is the story itself.  Having Crighton come in and fix the directing is like having Ed Wood come in and write a few chapters in a book because people think a book needs some spicing up.  First you don't hire a writer with no experience behind the camera to direct a few scenes and secondly, when will people realize that Crighton is not as good a writer as people think.  Jurassic Park was a hit film because of Spielberg, not Crighton.  ER is not a success because of him either.  He no longer writes for the show and it is better than it ever was when he was there. This film is a disaster because of him.  There is no bleeping story.  NONE! You can't have a film with no story.  Everyone knows that.  And what picture exactly is it that Banderas was in that guarantees a picture that costs this much is going to have a huge opening weekend?  Nothing.  Again, Zorro was the story and Spielgerg.  That is the only film that has ever been somewhat of a hit with him in it.  But Anthony Hopkins was also in that film.  So why would you make a picture with Banderas as the star?  And then to top it off you invest 100 million dollars?  What a joke!  So this is my chance to talk to all producers and studio heads.  Please, if you need any advice on what to invest your money in, please contact me.  I can do just as bad a job as some of the clowns in Hollywood now, and at a fraction of the cost.The 13th Warrior is a really bad film.  If you like action then I guess you may enjoy this.  But that is doubtful.  Even Commando had more of a story and a better script than this piece of garbage.  This is the embodiment of p**s poor film making, again not on McTiernan's part, but on everyone from the guys that wrote it ( Crighton ) to the guys that made it a go picture to those that financed it.  You all deserve to lose money on this project. It's movies like this that make me strive for Hollywood myself.  Because I know that all I need is to get my foot in the door.  One hit, and then you have about five years leeway to make it or break it.  Hollywood allows that. It allows you to make garbage based on the fact that you once made a good film or had a good script or whatever.  This film proves that.  What has Crighton done lately to substantiate his stories getting made?  Nothing. What is the movie going to amount to?  Nothing.  And that is a promise.  If this movie succeeds to make even half of it's gross back ( about 55 million )in North America, I'll probably have a heart attack.",5,1,2,27 August 1999
Rocky V," A terrible way to end the series
","Stallone thought he had it all figured out.  His films were failing at the box office so he would go back to his bread and butter and write a sequel where he becomes Rocky from 1976.  He makes Rocky old and fragile.  He makes him broke.  He sends him back to the streets of Philadelphia.  He gives him the same clothes and even gives him his hat back.  The fans should love this.What a stupid idea!The problem with that notion is that Rocky grew into what he was.  He started out with humble beginnings and he worked his way up into super-stardom.  He got in better shape, he increased his wealth, he became the world champ.  You can't take all that back and have Rocky go back to what he once was.  It just doesn't work.  I want to see him in the ring and fight.  I want to see him take on all the larger than life people with eccentric personalities like Mr. T and Dolph.  But instead we have a squalid Rocky, an impoverished one that is merely a pastiche of what he once was. And that just doesn't work.  Once you build a character from scratch and make him larger that life, you cannot regress him and then have him fight in the streets.  He has to be in the ring.  He just has to be.I love the Rocky films.  They were inspirational and they were fun.  But this is a weak effort and it did not have his true fans in mind when he made this mess!4 out of 10",4,1,5,2 June 2000
Stripes," That's the fact Jack!
","Stripes is firmly planted in my vernacular as one of those films that helped shape me as a twelve year old boy. It is also one of those films that made me become the film lover that I am today. I know films like Star Wars and it's two sequels, First Blood and Rambo, Jaws and it's sequel, Halloween, Back To The Future, Ghostbusters, Raiders and it's sequels and Stripes ( there are many others but this review has to be under 1000 words )taught me the beauty of how a movie can make you feel. And Stripes was the first movie that me and my best friend at the time ( Gary ) ever memorized word for word. And I think that it is this movie that established Murray, Ramis and even guys like Candy and John Laroquette as comedians. It also has a small role for Bill Paxton in it somewhere. It was also a great stepping stone for the three amigos ( Murray, RAmis and Reitman ) to get funding for a bigger project like Ghostbusters. And if you were an executive at Columbia you would probably hand them a blank cheque for that project after seeing this film. Simply put this film is a classic in every sense of the word.Stripes tells the story of how John Winger and Russell Ziskey ( Murray and Ramis respectively ) are two losers in life. Winger is an inept cab driver that hates his job so much that he throws his keys off the city bridge one day while driving an annoying lady to the airport. Ziskey is a terrible English as a second language teacher. And he is so inept that he tries to get is class to sing songs during class as their lesson. ' I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still ' Ziskey sings, and his class responds ' da do da da da da da da da do da da da da, ' and the he congratulates them and dismisses them until next week.After Winger informs Ziskey that in the last three hours he has lost his job, his car, his apartment and his girlfriend, they decide to join the army. And then all hilarity breaks loose. It is here that we meet an assorted cast of hooligans and misfits that add to the enjoyment of the movie.You have Ox ( Candy ) as an overweight guy who thinks the army is a perfect place to lose weight for free. There is Francis Sawyer, but everyone calls him Psycho, as a nut that thinks he is in Vietnam or someplace. You also have Cruiser, who joined the army because his father and brother were in the army and also because he thought he should join before he got drafted. Then there is Elmo, who is played by a pre-Fast Times Judge Reinhold. He is a wasted jolly stoner who is jjst looking to get stoned. Why he is joining the army is a little perplexing, but really, who cares? He is fun to watch so little details like this are overlooked. And of course we have Sgt. Hulka played with absolute earnestness by the late great Warren Oates. Needless to say, it is an interesting bunch of characters.The film works for various reason, but mainly because Ramis and Dan Goldberg have written a hilarious script that puts the misfits through one twistedly funny situation after another. If only the army were this fun, everyone would want to enlist.The first half of the film works because of the basic training scenes. The second half works because the misfit recruits are assigned to protect a secret R.V. that the army has concocted. Winger and Ziskey of course can't stay bored for long and they take the R.V. out for a run to Austria to go pick up their girlfriends.Stripes is one of the funniest movies ever made and it should be checked out by younger people that were born after 1980. I was about 12 when I saw this and my dad laughed at this just as much as I did. And if all you have to go on for comedy is things like Waterboy and Big Daddy ( very funny movies in their own right ) you are missing some great older comedy. You should really check this out.",10,61,91,29 June 1999
12 Angry Men," What an excellent film!
","It seems as you grow older, you can appreciate older films more.  That does not mean that when I hit the age of 65 I will appreciate a film like Citizen Kane, but now that I am in my late 20's I have a desire to see some of the greats from years past.  Just five years ago I was too narrow minded to want to even try to appreciate older cinema and some of the screen greats.  But today I rented the 1957 classic, 12 ANGRY MEN and was not only pleasantly surprised, but I truly liked it and thought it to be quite a good film. 
What's quite fascinating is to see the change in political and social climates since the days of black and white film.  In this film, there were no black jury members, no women, and no swearing.  This was also, to be fair, probably the worst handled case in the history of trials next to the Warren Report.  Questions that today would be common place were avoided like the plague.  Evidence was not handled properly, very little effort was put forth by the defense to come up with a defense at all and witnesses were never thoroughly interrogated or cross examined to refute what can only be regarded as flimsy testimony.  But, not only was I not around in the 50's, I have no idea what the North American justice system was like back then, and perhaps that is what makes this film so interesting.  So I can only say that it is possible that a case could be handled this poorly, given its circumstances.  You would have to compare and dissect what society was like back then to get a true appreciation of what was and wasn't possible.  To talk about the film, yes it was very enjoyable.  It was a great film that unwound piece by piece all of the apparent infallible theories that pointed to the guilt of this kid.  The writer should be given a lot of credit for that.  But having said that, a film like this would never see the light of day with today's fickle audience that would rather see a film like Con Air than High Fidelity.  I am not critisizing today's audience for that, just pointing it out.  But the 40's and 50's were different.  Spielberg and Lucas and Don Simpson and Joel Silver were just little tykes then.  It was a different time.  A film that only talks and has no action was perhaps a possible sell back then with a cast like this.  Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda and Jack Warden must have been at the height of their popularity so that immediately leant credence and respect to the project.  But it wouldn't matter who did this film in today's age, it would not work.  Again, not a critisism, just an opinion.I think it is important to go back to the roots of cinema every once in a while to view some of it.  You come across gems like this and you learn to appreciate them.  12 ANGRY MEN is a fascinating film and it is one that serious lovers of film should watch every now and again to feel the aesthetic of film before special effects started to replace a good script and a good director.  Tarantino would appreciate something like this.  In his version of 12 ANGRY MEN, the 12 jurors would probably have names of colours and at the end they would all have grabbed Henry Fonda's knife and tried to kill each while uttering the F-Word in, but a film that prides itself on dialogue more than action is what he is all about.  This could be a pioneer of a Tarantino film project.12 ANGRY MEN is a great film and it is one that HENRY FONDA should have been proud of.  A wonderful experience!  And it is great to see some of his work, other than On GOLDEN POND.9 out of 10",9,0,1,22 May 2000
Hostel," A throw back to 70's style horror films
","I was born in the 70's. I began watching horror films at about the age of 8. Of course horror films are scary when you are that young, no matter what they are. But then I grew up and began watching those same films over again, and to an extent, they were still scary. Those were the films from the 70's and early 80's. Leatherface will always incite that incessant trepidation in me. How can he not? Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the all time greats and I don't really think another film can duplicate the raw intensity of that film. There were others of course, and anyone who knows me even slightly knows that Last House on the Left is what I consider to be the most disturbing film ever made. Horror films, the good ones that is, can affect you in ways that other films can't. They get inside you. Hostel does that. It is a nightmarish film that takes a grim look at the underbelly of society. There is no other way to put it. This film is scary because of what happens in it but it is even scarier because what happens could be true.Like any typical horror film, everything is great in the beginning. Josh and Paxton and their Icelandic nomad are in Europe seeking out all the best parties and the best women. They are in heaven at first as the women and drugs and parties are as abundant as they first heard. And then they meet another man their age who tells about a city in Slovakia where the women are better than you could imagine. Our three adventure seekers are off the Slovakia and upon entering the hostel, they meet two half naked women in their shared quarters. Clubs, drinking, drugs and sex ensues. This is paradise. What could be better? Up until now the pacing of the film is fast and furious. There is enough character development and eye candy to please those waiting for the horror. And the horror is never far off. The interesting thing about a film like this is that even though the naked women and the bongs and the festive atmosphere is abundant to the viewer, there is always that pernicious overtone, that feeling that something isn't quite right. You can attribute that to knowing what's coming up or to the fact that the marketing for this film, including the trailer is very effective. For me, I knew this happy atmosphere that the boys were a part of was going to end, and that scared me. One friend goes missing and then the plot gets twisted. He doesn't leave them a message as to where he's going, who he's with or an explanation as to why he left. The two boys are leery of this but decide to stay in the hostel one more night to have a bit more fun. Big mistake.By now the film had me intrigued. And when the torture scenes finally happen, although the gore wasn't as graphic as I expected, the situations that are presented and how everything transpires is enough to scare the hell out of you. What is bothersome is that these situations, while ostensibly fictional, are in fact completely realistic and utterly possible. Just like Last House on the Left had three would be regular people doing heinous things to two innocent teenage girls, this film is almost more macabre in the sense that it explores an element to the human psyche that enjoys the kill. It seeks the thrill of inflicting pain. The scariest thing about this is the notion there are people that are so sick, so depraved and so inhumane that they actually have to pay to inflict bodily harm to others. Far fetched? Hardly. Look at the news from any given city in the world and you'll see the heinous and disgusting things that people do to one another. This film is disturbing because it is a reflection of society, no an aberration. I'm not saying that the majority of people want to be able to pay to murder someone, but what I am saying is the realm of possibility is there. That in itself is about as scary as you can get.Eli Roth is imaginative. He is a visionary and he is adept at exploring the darker side of humanity. Cabin Fever was a great horror film, a little off the wall, but quite disturbing. Hostel is a work of art, it is as close to the 70's style of guts on the wall horror as you can get in today's horror climate. I was terrified watching the film and at the end by the end of the film, when you are screaming for revenge, Roth even gives you what you want. Hostel is a brilliant film. As much as I love movies like Scream and Sixth Sense, the true gusto of horror has also been omnipotent in recent months with films like Saw 2, Wolf Creek and High Tension. Hostel is better than the rest. It builds the tension and then boils to the point where the horror is almost too real. This is a very effective horror film and I look forward to the sequel.10/10 A truly terrifying masterpiece.",10,2,5,11 January 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A hell of a funny film, but with a message.
","When you have the reputation that Parker and Stone do, it is hard to get rid of the sterotypes that have been drawn around you.  You are forever stuck in the mold that has been bestowed upon you.  But perhaps sometimes when stigmas of that nature are forever embedded with your name and reputation, it actually gives them more leeway to make a statement that is political in nature.  As long as they disguise that statement(s) with all that made them popular in the first place, they can get away with it.  So now, if I said that beyond the non-stop vulgarity and infinite humour that this film contains, is a film that has an important message camouflaged in animation, would you believe me?  Would you care?First off, this is the most profanity laced film I have ever seen in my life, and that includes early Eddie Murphy efforts.  But the profanity in this film had me in stitches.  Honestly, that was almost not just a figure of speech either.  I laughed so hard that I almost banged my head on the on the person in front of me.  Remember how absorbed you were at the horror of war at the beginning of Private Ryan?  Well if you had to parallel the two and replace horror with humour, that is a safe comparison.  This film is so ******* funny and I really enjoyed it on that level.  I can honestly say that I haven't laughed so hard since Office Space.  The profanity goes a bit overboard at times but I think that was on purpose.  Some of the humour is a bit gross ( seeing Sadam's rubber propalactic was funny but a little sick at the same time ) but I think these guys wanted to see how far they could go. And they went very far and they dared the MPAA to censor them even more, and hey, I was very entertained.But on the political side, there are a lot of dicey issues that are covered here.  Censorship for one.  It's funny because we as Canadians and Americans have some of the same ideologies and one of them is free speech.  But if that is what we want, then we have to be willing to go all the way.  You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct.  Free speech means free speech.  Free to express your thoughts in an open forum.  This film tells us that free speech is free as long as you don't offend the masses.  It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue ( many of those films get an AA rating ) but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film.  That really is silly.The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.  It doesn't matter that perhaps some of the issues at hand are clouded and misunderstood, many  people stand behind their government to the very end. Kill em' all in the name of the Constitution.  There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues.  A particular scene with Bill Gates is funny.Parker and Stone have given the finger to the ratings system in America and I think people will like it.  They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie.  If the U.S. ever went to war with us, it would probably be over in a day or so.  So thanks for making us look at least competetive.  That was cool.It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here, because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater, but there is more to this movie than just humour.  To accomplish that and still be known as the guys who made fart jokes and the F word popular is quite a feat.  This film is there to enjoy but it is also there to ask some tough and interesting questions.  Enjoy the film, but listen to what it has to say.  That is, besides the F and S word, listen to what it wants to say.**** One last observation and that is, when I was in line for the film, a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me.  When they asked for South Park, the cashier asked if she was sure because there is a lot of profanity in the film.  The lady reassured her that it was fine.  Her daughter can listen and watch but knows not to repeat.  That is responsible parenting.  Teach your kids right from wrong and hope they turn out well. That's all you can do.  And I applaud that parent for doing so.  She may never know who I am but I will remember her for quite some time.  Maybe if more people were like that, there wouldn't be such a fuss about profanity. After all, they are just words.",7,172,202,2 July 1999
Batman Returns," This movie sucks! I mean really sucks!!
","I have really never seen a film that is worse than this.  There is one improbable situation after another and nothing is thought out to make any sense.  It looked to me like the makers of this film figured that they had a gold mine on their hands and because the first made a ton of money, they could make a quickie film that has no concern for detail, plot, characterization, direction, script, stunts or anything that makes a film entertaining.The film looks like it was filmed on a sound stage and you can tell because when it is supposed to be below zero outside, there is no mist coming from the breath of the people in the scene.  And that is only one small complaint.  The biggest one is that this film suffers from what I like to call the respected man is suddenly a bad guy syndrome.Batman is a respected, hard working, guardian angel in Gotham City.  He has been like that for a while now.  Suddenly a shady figure that is grotesque looking and walks like a Penguin enters the picture.  Within days of his arrival on the scene, not only has the penguin miraculously discredited Batman but he has managed to get the entire city against him.  He has been ostracized from public safety and this leaves the Penguin alone to do his diabolical plans.Is this the best they can come up with?  I mean, aren't writers smarter than that?  Can't they write a better way for the Penguin to do what he does? I really hate this movie.  With all that I am, I hate it.  But it made a ton of money because kids love this crap and for the rest of us that want to see a good film and hope to God that this film will be a welcome distraction for two hours of our summer, are not only disappointed, we are disgusted. Avoid this movie at all costs.",1,81,141,22 June 1999
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Let the summer begin!
","X-Men WolverineContains massive spoilersLet the summer begin. This is one hell of a ride and it certainly lives up to my expectations. Wolverine's story has always been an interesting one and this film, as it delves into all that we know about Logan and his Wolverine alter ego is simply fantastic. I am not a comic collector, so I knew absolutely nothing about Wolverine before seeing X-Men. Now here we are four movies later and he is easily one of the best heroes on screen.We start off in the Northwest Territories in the 1800's. A young Logan murders his own father, not knowing of course that he is. As he runs out of the house, his brother catches up to him and tells him that they must look out for each other. They both have gifts that can't be explained. So, he and Victor do what they do best. They fight in every single war known in American history. How they got to enlist in the American army is kind of confusing since they are both Canadian, but I guess that doesn't really matter. Soon, General Stryker comes calling after they have both been executed by firing squad. He wants to start up a special unit of mutants. He takes them to Nigeria to search for some kind of rock that can turn one into an indestructible being. But of course, to benefit from this rock, one must have regenerating healing capabilities. Since Logan is the only one who does, the task at hand is to get him to agree to it. To do this, the military sets him up. They kill his girlfriend, and then they promise him that they can help him avenge her death by making him strong enough to go after Victor, his brother, who killed her.Once he becomes Wolverine, the film really takes off. It was good up to this point, but it gets fantastic once he becomes the indestructible animal. He discovers that what was once wooden like claws that came out of his hands, are now razor sharp and steel that can cut metal. Although he knew he could take bullets, regenerate and basically recover much quicker than a normal human being, his abilities are now heightened. This government experiment has made him more of an animal than he once was.Soon he is on the hunt for his brother and this takes him to meet Gambit and all kinds of other mutants. The final showdown takes place on 'Mutant Island' and it does not disappoint.X-Men Origins Wolverine is action packed from start to finish. The ending is especially satisfying as Professor X makes an appearance and you get to see some of the young mutants who will eventually appear in the three X-Men films. I found the story to flow and I enjoyed the performances of Jackman and Live Schreiber immensely. Gavin Hood, who's only other Hollywood credit is Rendition with Reese Witherspoon and Jake Gyllenhal, does a masterful job keeping the action rolling, the fights exhilarating and the performances crisp and accurate. I don't know much about Mr. Hood, but I think he might get a lot more work after this film.Seeing as I do not know anything about the Wolverine lore or the story I went into this just looking for a good time and something to keep me entertained. If the X-Men loonies have something to complain about, it goes over my head. This is a perfect film to kick off the summer and if the rest of the summer films of 2009 are anything near as good as this, we'll be in for a great 4 months.9/10",9,22,47,21 April 2009
The Mummy," At least they tried to make an Indy clone
","One thing can be said for The Mummy, and that is that it is not boring. This film is obviously made in the tradition of Indiana Jones flicks and they at least made an entertaining movie.  But what it was not, is a good flick that would make me want to see it a second time.  Everything lacked by just a step or two.  The action and adventure was good but not great.  The story was fun but not superb.  You get the point.  If you have a chance to see this movie in a matinee don't hesitate to spend your five bucks, but don't expect much.",6,0,0,17 June 1999
The Others," Who are the others?
","Warning, may contain spoilers.Although I can't say that The Others is as good a haunted house film as The Changeling and even something like Amityville Horror II, it is still a very atmospheric, dark and well done film that most horror films only wish they could emulate.  This is a film that accentuates psychological terror and atmosphere over blood and machetes.  It also takes its time getting to the point but along the way you are treated to a film that wants you to figure out what is going on, literally behind closed doors.  I had heard from people that there is a great twist at the end of the film and that made me keep my horror senses open.  I really tried to figure out what the catch was, but about a third of the way into the film, I ceased trying to figure it out and I was just enjoying the film for all of it's artistic merit and style.  And what this film lacks in the area of genuine scares and chills, it more than makes up for in the aesthetic of the film and the make-up.  I recommend this film to anyone that is tired of all the Scream rip-offs and films that have no idea what the difference is between gore and raw primal fear.  I can, in a way, compare this film to a film like The Blair Witch Project.  It's not what you can see that frightens you, it's what you can't. We are always afraid of those sounds that go bump in the night. But not necessarily what makes them.  The Others never forgets that concept.When you make a film about a haunted house, the first thing you have to do is have a great setting and an ominous looking house.  The Others accomplishes that by having it take place in the 40's, just after the war, in England.  For some reason, English haunted houses just seem ripe with history and they create an atmosphere conducive to the chills and fears that haunted houses produce.  This house is no exception.  Nicole Kidman plays Grace and she and her two children live alone in this ominous house.  Her two children are both photosensitive, which means that if sunlight, or any strong light touches their skin, they could break out in massive hives and die.  This is a clever plot device because it means that the entire film has to be filmed with the lights off and only dim candles burning for light.  Other film makers would kill for a premise like this because it actually gives the director a legitimate reason for the lighting to be the way it is.  And lighting is one of the key components in any horror film.  As the plot moves along, we find out that Grace's daughter, Anne, seems to be able to see and talk to ghosts in the house.  Grace, being a devout religious believer, doesn't believe in ghosts and tells Anne that she is lying.  She also tells her that when you lie, you don't go to Heaven, you remain stuck somewhere in purgatory.  Harsh words to be telling a 12 year old no less.Suddenly, three servants come knocking on the door and tell Grace that they are there in response to the ad that she put in the paper (but what are their real motives for being there?).  Grace hires them and they go about their business of making sure the shutters are closed and all the drapes are shut.  It is also a strict rule that before one door is entered, the other has to be locked.  This presents some problems for the caretakers as there is some 50 doors in the house.The Others plods along and drops hints every once in a while to assist us in trying to figure out what is happening and what the so called secret is. But not enough to make it obvious.  The imbroglio just keeps getting stranger as the film prods forward.  Director Alejandro Amenabar has a keen eye for detail and he does a good job of keeping us interested.  Some eerie looking pictures show up and then are brought back later in the film and before you realize it, the conclusion is upon us.  And when the twist comes, you are almost glad that it ends the way it does.  This is similar to The Sixth Sense where you may want to see it again to see if you missed anything the first time around.  I have only seen it once, and although it is a good film, I don't planning on seeing it again.  I am satisfied that I picked up everything the first time around. And as I said at the beginning of the review, if you are more interested in a film like Urban Legend and I Still Know What You Did.... then perhaps this is not the film for you.  The payoff is worth the wait, but you have to be patient.8 out 0f 10-- Much more in the style of Sixth Sense than Friday the 13th. And as much as I enjoy the Friday films, I will take a film like this any day over a film like Halloween 10 or Nightmare on Elm Street 9.",8,0,0,15 August 2001
Orphan," The best horror film in the last 5 years
","The Orphan is the best horror film I have seen in years, perhaps since The Ring and Mothman Prophecies. It has a perfect blend of chills, scares, excellent direction, wonderful performances and a brilliant villain. I was nervous, anxious and angry all at different times in the film. Some might say that it is a little silly because all you would need is someone to blow the whistle on this little girl, but the screenplay is smart enough to give reasons why that just didn't happen.Isabelle Fuhrman plays Esther, and something just isn't quite right with her. Her looks, her obsession with her new father and her precocious behaviour just don't add up. Then you have Vera Fermiga, of The Departed fame. She is simply magnificent in this film and if the academy ever took horror films seriously, she would be a shoe in for a nomination for best actress this year. She and Fuhrman carry the film. She is strong, vulnerable and tough as nails in here. She gets to play the thankless role of someone who is looked at as a pariah of sorts due to her sordid past and when the trouble starts, no one believes her.Orphan will have you on the edge of your seat and covering your eyes literally. Juame Collet-Sara, who's only real credit is the excellent 2005 film House of Wax, has a keen eye for detail and he reminds me of Spielberg in here in some ways. I really hope his work is recognized and he gets more work. This was produced by Joel Silver and Leonardo DiCaprio.This is one of the best films of the year so far.9/10",9,3,7,25 July 2009
L.A. Confidential," Hard to follow, Basinger is not worthy of Best S.A, the three male leads are incredible, overall a pretty good film
","People say that this reminds them of Chinatown, I disagree.  I think it reminds me more of Tequila Sunrise.  Both have confusing plots, both are film noir in a way and both are richly acted and very well written.  What I enjoyed most about this was the excellent performances of Spacey, Pearce and Crowe.  All three carried out their roles superbly.  When Crowe( Bud White ) was mad ( which was quite a bit ) you could feel his anger.  It was written all over his face so that when he lashes out you understand why.  Spacey ( Vinsensse ) was a bit of a hotdog in the film but he slowly changes and eventually doesn't like what he sees in the mirror.  He also has one of the key scenes in the film when he discovers the main culprit.  When he utters the name of the man that supposedly killed Pearce's father, that gave me chills.  It was such a well written scene and carried out beautifully by Spacey.  I admired Pearce's character ( Ed Exley ).  He was not so much a political cronie as he did what he felt was right, all the time.  He had integrity and he never wanted to jeapordize that, for any reason.  That is why at the conclusion of the film I was left feeling strange when the denoument carried out the way it did.  Pearce shoots the bad guy as he walking away.  He didn't defend himself in the line of duty, but he killed a man that deserved to die.  This man was a cop killer, a murderer, a rapist and a man who thought he was above the law.  Does that make it right to shoot him?  I'm sure we all think so, but for Pearce to shoot him would have taken alot.  Asking moral questions the way the film did was one of its great strengths.As for the comparison with Titanic.  Titanic was a superb film that did everything right and deserved to win everything that it did.  These are completely different kinds of movies and Titanic got its just rewards. Just because a film moves a little slowly and has film noir written all over it, it does not mean that it is a better movie than a fantasy that touches your heart.  That was also a problem in 81 and 82 when the tables were turned and fantasy ( Raiders of the Lost Ark and ET) lost out to dramatics ( Chariots of Fire and Gandhi.  I am glad that the academy has learned to recognize movies like Titanic.  To me it was worthy of best picture and best director and the musical score in that film should have won as well.  Enough about that.What I can't understand for the life of me is how Basinger won Best Supporting Actress.  She had what, thirty seconds of screen time?  Her character was well played but I have seen her character a hundred times before.  So that irks me, almost as much as the fact that none of the males won an Oscar.  Spacey and Crowe each could have been up for best actor and Pearce could have been up for best actor or best supporting actor.  Hell, Cromwell could have been nominated as well.  All I know is someone should have won an acting award in this film besides Basinger.  That was a mercy award to me.I really did enjoy this film although I think it is over rated quite a bit. It had me interested and intrigued and it left me asking myself questions at the conclusion.  But I just don't think it is as great as everyone says it is.",8,0,0,24 August 1999
X-Men," i am looking forward to the sequel
","I know absolutely nothing about the X-Men.  I went with a guy who did and he was like a guide.  He explained things to me about the characters that I needed to know.  But after a while I began to realize that it was unneccessary for him to do so.  The film did a pretty good job of explaining it all to me.  And I was impressed.There was much left to be desired in this film but I think that was by design.  I wanted to know more about Professor X and Magnetto.  I wanted to know more about their friendship and their rivalry.  How did it start, how did it get to the point it's at now and so on.  But that is also a credit to the makers of the film because there is obviously enough material here to make a dozen films.What I enjoyed most about the film was that the bad guys were not really cut and dried bad.  There was no true villain.  I guess you could say that Magnetto's henchmen ( and henchwoman ) were more evil than not, but Magnetto was an interesting study.  This is a man who was in a Nazi death camp and he is being ostracized from society by humans that can't and won't accept another species as being better in some way than they are.  The subleties of racism are not subtle here.  There is a great line in the film when Magnetto says something to the affect of 'Humans are always afraid of what they can't understand.'  How true.  There is also a scene in here that shows humans experimenting on a mutant and that is similar to what we do to animals. Mutants are treated like lab rats but what one of the underlying subtleties of the film says is that everyone and everything should be treated equal. It is not up to us to play God and decide that just because someone or something is different than us that we should should arbitrarilly exterminate them.  This is a deep movie disguised as a slam bam summer flick.  I guess now I am just learning what comic book fans have known all along....X-Men is a great story, with many layers to it.My favourite character is Wolverine.  Not only is he Canadian, but he is a rogue and quite the bad ass.  He reminds me of a bit between a cross of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.  He is abrasive and cocky like Han and he hasn't quite learned how to control and utilize his ability quite yet, like Luke in Star Wars.  I would like to see him learn more about himself and his ability in the sequels to come.  In fact, I am looking forward to the sequels just so I can learn more about all of these characters.  My friend told me that there is a lot more to the X-Men than what we saw on screen and he said that Wolverine and Sabretooth hate each other and are always battling.  That is something I am looking forward to with great anticipation.  And of course, I want to know more about Magnetto and Professor X.  This series should be treated as if no one knew anything about the history of the comic books. If it does so, this could really be a James Bond type series where it spans 4 or 5 decades.I enjoyed this film.  As I left the theater I wasn't quite sure what to think.  It was good but it took me a while for it to sink in.  Once it did, I realized that this is a great film and the fact that it introduced the characters just enough to garner my interest is also a bonus.  I am now looking forward to perhaps 2002 to see the already greatly anticipated sequel.7.5 out of 10.... I have a feeling the next X-Men is going to be even better.  There is so much more that I want to know and learn about these characters and a sequel is almost a guarantee.  This is a great summer film and I look forward to seeing all of the characters back for the next one. And one word of advice to the writers....Give Toad more to say next time.  He was funny and he cracked me up with his childish like antics.",7,0,0,18 July 2000
The Terminator," Nice night for a walk.
","Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies ' Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again. '  That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One, this is the first film where 'I'll be back' was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film.",10,280,338,15 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," A wonderfully atmospheric film
","I have never seen some of the so-called classics that The Hammer films produced, nor have I seen many of the classic horror films that Lugosi and Lee and Price have made.  But from what I have read and heard, those films were very atmospheric and had many shots of murky graveyards, dark streets with only dimly lit lights and monsters that seemed unstoppable to the average human being.  And it may be true that it has been about 40 years since those kinds of films graced our screens, but I think Tim Burton has produced a film that is a throw back to those types of films.  I have never been a huge fan of Burton's work but I must say that this film is as atmospheric and entertaining as I could imagine it to be.What makes this film so well done is the fact that the time frame allows for many of the abnormal shots and situations.  The year is 1899 and this is before electricity and cars and automatic weapons.  This is a time when light is shed by candle, people get around on horses and the weapon of choice for most is still the sword.  Thus the possibilities are endless with what you can do.  Tim Burton wisely gives us much to marvel at.  The opening sequence that has one of the townfolk decapitated is so well done that you are almost afraid that the rest of the film can't possibly follow in the footsteps of the brilliant first ten minutes.  But it does and it does it consistently.  There are many scenes with dense fog and dark nights, and that is the real strength of the film.The film also contains some rather humorous parts with Depp, as Ichabod Crane, using his new scientific methods of detective work much to the awe and sometimes chagrin of the town folk.  In one rather funny scene, Crane arrives at the scene of a decapitated body.  He inspects it and as he does so, he knows the body has been moved.  'Have you moved the body?' he asks the confused man.  'Yes, I did.' he replies.  'You should never move the body at the scene of a murder.' Crane tells him angrily.  And then with a confused tone and bewildered eyes, the man responds, 'Why not?'  And then Crane pauses for a minute and then says hesitantly, 'Because, you just shouldn't.'  It is a perfect scene.  Crane is just discovering many of his scientific theories and he knows that you shouldn't do something but not really why.  His confusion is humorous to us, the audience and many other scenes are played for laughs in the same way.But let's face it, we didn't go to this film to be humoured, we went to be at least mildly frightened.  And I have to say that fright was not something that I experienced watching the film.  The headless horseman is a vicious villian and he is relentless in his pursuit of heads, but he is not really scary.  That is not to say that the film is poor because of this, it is just to say that scares are few and far between in the film.  The rest of the experience is a positive one and I honestly have to say that the decapitation scenes are a wonder.  I understand that they can do much with computer animation now, but the cut from live action to computer animation is so subtle that you cannot even remotely tell what is real and what is a CGI.  Similarily, if anyone remembers the first Friday the 13th film when Kevin Bacon dies, he gets a spear through the throat and they had to do that by cutting from one angle to the next and then put   a replica of his body under the covers.  As the spear came through the bedsprings and the mattress and into his throat it had the appearance that it was really going through his body when in reality his head was nowhere near the fake body.  They then added some coloured chocolate syrup to make it look real.  But you can tell that there was a deliberate cut in angles to complete the affect.  In Sleepy Hollow there is no change in camera angles, it really is quite impressive.Sleepy Hollow is a fun film, it is not great but it is worth the ten dollars that you will spend at the theater to watch it.  Christopher Walken is priceless as the Horseman and even though he has no spoken dialogue he is one of the more entertaining actors and charcters in the film.  Depp is good and so is Ricci.  Principal Ed Rooney is also quite good in his small role. And some of the British actors are perfect in creating the atmosphere that you need to pull a film off like this.  One in particular I think I recognize from Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, he was Duncan, the man who gets his eyes removed.  At least he looks like the same actor. 
All around, this is a good film and anyone who likes atmosphere will surely enjoy it.  It is also nice to see Francis Coppola in the producers chair again.7 out of 10",7,0,0,28 December 1999
Snatch," You'll get lost in this movie
","Movies like Pulp Fiction make you forget you are watching a film and make you feel as though you are seeing real, albeit strange, but nonetheless real characters at work.  Snatch does that as well.  Most of us have very different lives.  We all punch the clock, go to work, play with the dog, watch sports and whatever else it is that we do during our day.  But in Guy Ritchie's labrynthian like tail, no one is normal.  No one does things that the rest of us would do.  They are all bound by the Tarantinoesque laws of fiction.  And those laws dictate that if there is trouble to find, they find it and if there is a situation that calls for impropriety, it is here, in this film.Snatch is a lot of fun.  When you inhabit a world that shares it's space with guys like Bullet Tooth Tony, Doug The Head, One Punch Mickey, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris The Blade, Turkish, Brick Top and Cousin Avi, you can't help but to have fun.  The story is quite complicated and by the time you figure out exactly what is going on, a different angle to the story is introduced.  But in some way or another, every member of this story is involved in one way or another, with a diamond that has 84 carats to it. Frankie Four Fingers steals it, Boris the Blade wants it, so does cousin Avi as does does Bullet Tooth Tony.  Turkish gets messed up in it somehow and then so does BrickTop, which brings in One Punch Mickey.  Confused, you ain't seen nothing yet.  What it comes down to though is that you don't really have to know exactly who fits where in the story.  I stopped keeping track of everyones importance about a third of the way through the film.  I was having too much fun.  Once again we are treated to Benetio Del Toro's mastery of accents as this time he brandishes a Turkish/Russian/Arabian accent.  The man really is the best actor out there today.  Too bad he dies early in the film, I would have liked to see more of him. Then we are introduced to Brad Pitt and he has a 'whoknowswhatkindof' accent.  As they say in the film, it is not Irish, not English, just Pygmie.  Half the time you have no idea what he saying and the other half you are just barely making it out.  But he is incredibly humourous and when he is hard to understand is some of the best humour in the film.  Brad Pitt is one hell of an under rated actor but with films like this, he is sure to get a little recognition.Snatch is violent and it is mean but it does it so stylishly that it becomes fun.  I think this is a Pulp Fiction like clone.  It is not as good, nothing ever will be, but it is a worthy imitator.  Having fun at the movies is what being there is all about.  Snatch never forgets that. 9 out of 10- One of the films that will probably make my ten best at the end of 2001.",Null,0,0,25 January 2001
The Expendables," Just simply bad-ass!
","What happens when you have 8 (10 if you include the two cameos) big egos in a film? How do you give them all their moment to shine? The answer is, you let Stallone write and direct a film called the Expendables. I'm not sure anyone could have done the job on this film that Stallone did. In short, this is epic film making in that it gives the audience everything it could hope for and much, much more. Every real kick ass player in this film has their moment of glory. And to my surprise, Stallone allows the big boys to shine, even at his expense. It's as if Stallone knew that although he is the star of this movie, he is not a true to life tough guy. But surrounding him are a plethora of real life tough guys. And the most brilliant thing about the film and about Stallone, is that every brute in this film has his chance to show the world their skills.We've all seen the footage of Stallone and Austin going at it. But that isn't even the best fight in the film. There is a period in this movie where for perhaps 15 minutes, there is just non stop hand to hand combat. You have Li destroying men that seem to be twice his size. You have the incredibly charismatic Jason Statham showing off his hand to hand combat skills and one of the best scenes in the film shows Statham and Li double teaming one thug until they literally break his neck.Terry Crews shines in the last 30 minutes as he carries a very big gun that literally blows his victims to pieces. And in a true example of Stallone showing that he has no ego, there is a scene where Stallone's character, Barney Ross, wants to throw a bomb high into the air. Then Crews comes up behind him and Ross, who is the smaller man, asks Caesar to throw the bomb, which is a bit too heavy for him. It's small details like this that make the film such an orgasmic action films delight.You even have an epic battle between MMA and WWE legends at the end when Couture and Austin go at it mano-a-mano. And the results literally burn up the screen.The Expendables is also shockingly funny. Stallone and Dave Callahan wrote a great script with many funny one liners and witty observations.The best scene of course is the scene with Arnold, Bruce and Sly. In this three minute scene, you have some of the funniest stuff in the film. In it, Ross and Arnold's Trench are former Expendables team mates. In fact Trench used to be the leader of the team. But now he is a little older and a little out of shape. And Stallone milks this for all it's worth. The audience was in an orgasmic state of bliss at this point, and without ruining some of the best lines, just suffice to say that Stallone and Arnold do not miss a beat.The Expendables is what an action film should be. It is a lot of explosions, larger than life characters, hand to hand combat, incredibly bad-ass men, humour and a frenetic pace. Even when it slows down to get to know these men a bit, guys like Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren and Statham steal the show.This is better than Rambo, and in the pantheon of great Stallone films, this is one of the best.9.5/10 You got a problem with that?",10,4,19,13 August 2010
Scary Movie 2," The complete anti-thesis of what the first was all about
","Scary Movie was a brilliant, hilarious, and intelligent satire of scary movies.  It poked fun at Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Nightmare On Elm Street and so on, and it did it with compassion and care.  The writers really did their homework and thus we were presented with a film that not only was entertaining and funny, but it was smart and witty.  You could infinitely count the number of movie references in the film and and some of them were so subtle that it took you a moment or two to realize that they were making fun of whatever movie it was making fun of.  This cheap ersatz of a film, this charlatan, this sheep in wolves clothing is not only a terrible film, it does a terrible injustice to all that the first one stood for.  It angers me when films like this are made as irresponsibly as this one was because it suckered me into the theater based on memories of last year.  I actually put The Wayans and Kevin Williamson ( creator of the Scream franchise ) in the same category after Scary Movie.  Now, my perception of the Wayans is that they are all one hit wonders.Scary Movie 2 has one big problem, and that is they decided to make fun of movies that weren't as iconoclastic as the ones they made fun of in the first one.  When you are satirizing films like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, you alienate perhaps your core audience that didn't really like those movies all that much in the first place.  There were some clever references to Amityville Horror and The Exorcist at the beginning and those were the best jabs in the whole film, but what about the rest of this debacle?  Why do I want to watch The Haunting and Hollow Man all over again when I didn't enjoy it in the first place?  There are many horror fans out there and this film is not commensurate with the abilities that the Wayans showed in the first one.  There are only so many times you can get by with fart, puke, pee, poo and sex jokes before you enervate your audience.  I was enervated after the first fifteen minutes.  I kept waiting for it to get better.  But it never did.  For every reference I could pick out and comprehend, there were long, painful stretches of film when I just didn't understand what they were trying to say or do.  What was the point of Chris Elliot's character?  Was he an amalgamation of every creepy character that has ever appeared in a haunted house film?  Was he a pastiche of butlers or chambermaids from haunted house Hammer films?  What was he?  I have seen a lot of horror films in my day but never have I been privy to a more repulsive and useless character than him.  He just wasn't needed, and if he was, then how about giving him more to go on than just a small and deformed appendage?  To give a little credit, as I said, the beginning with James Woods and the Amityville/Exorcist scene was clever and there is one brilliant homage/satire that starts with the bouncing ball from The Changeling that turns into a wonderfully directed spinoff of the Nike basketball commercial. I was very impressed and entertained for those two minutes.  But then for that clever scene, there are dozens of others that go absolutely nowhere. There is another embarrassing scene with Tori Spelling spouting off sexual profanities to an invisible miscreant that has his way with her against a wall that is supposed to be a send up of A Nightmare On Elm Street when Tina is attacked by an invisible Freddy Krueger.  It is horribly done in here and there is no payoff.Back in the 10th century, the charlatan and the mounteback, two unsavory types, used to sell bogus panaceas, cure-alls, at bargain prices.  They called this their 'nostrum', meaning literally, 'our remedy.'  Well my nostrum for this foul-stenched excuse for a film is for the Wayans to put a little more effort into the writing and maybe cut down from seven writers to two.  This way ideas don't mesh and egos don't get bruised.  As it stands this is one of the worst films I have seen this year and seeing how good the first one was, they should be ashamed of this deplorable, egregious, vapid and totally unnecessary film that they have given to us.  And that is a shame.1.5 out of 10- The 1.5 being for the clever beginning and the Nike/Changeling send off.  The rest of the movie receives a 0.  Instead of making fun of films that are here today and forgotten tomorrow, why not take on the greats like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Cujo, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  There is plenty of great material out there, so why go after films that people disliked?  It doesn't make much sense.",2,1,2,7 July 2001
Final Destination 2," Better than the first
","I was stunned when I saw FINAL DESTINATION. It was a shocking and horrifically tense film that has images in that i had never seen before. A plane blew up right in front of your eyes, some lost their heads and death, in this case a noun, was after everyone, and it was unstoppable. It was a perfectly crafted horror film that I didn't think could be topped.I was wrong. Not only is FINAL DESTINATION 2 a scarier and more gory film, it is a better made film that it's predecessor. I commented that Final Destination had the scariest 15 minutes to open a film perhaps ever. And although that may still be true, the opening highway sequence is at least as scary. And it is also one of the best directed scenes in the history of film. You can put this up there with the truck chase in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the chase scene in BULLIT and the final lightsabre duel with Darth and Luke in RETURN OF THE JEDI. David R. ELLIS is a gifted director and perhaps that is why I enjoyed SNAKES ON A PLANE so much. He has an innate ability to milk a scene for everything it's worth and the opening 15 minutes of this film is the epitome of brilliance. It not only sets the tone for the rest of the film but by the time the last word is uttered in the scene, you're exhausted and exhilarated. I can't heap enough praise on this scene.After you get past the opening sequence of the film, what must be marveled at is the story. Critics will tell you that the best sequels are films that further the story, not just retell it like the way a film like Friday THE 13TH PART 2 does. Final Destination 2 has one of the wildest stories and best continuations of any film ever. Excluding EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and perhaps ROCKY II, you won't find a better continuation of a story than you will here. This film connects the events from the first to the characters in the second. They are literally running from death because they should have and would have been affected by the chain of events in the original had the passengers not gotten off the plane. J. Gruber and Eric Hess devised a well thought out and brilliantly complex story line for this one that will send a chill through you.And finally what must be mentioned is the creative deaths in the film. In today's horror climate where gore has made a successful comeback thanks to films like Saw and Final Destination, this one has some very strong and graphic images that will please all gore hounds. The special effects team and the CGI guys should be commended for their innovation. Watching someone get cut in two with wires is quite the thrill....as long as it's in the movies of course.Finally, Ali Larter appears in here as well and it's great to see her character survive from the first. She is wonderful in here as well.Final Destination 2 is a fantastic film and it surpasses the quality of the first. This is a great addition to the horror genre.8.5/10",8,0,0,23 April 2007
Alien," Not quite as good as Aliens, but still well done
","I think Aliens owes a lot of it's success to the original but it is a film that stands on it's own.  Alien, however is a very terrifying film, it just takes a little while to get there.  What is very good about the original is that the set design is really one of the stars of the film.  Everything is meticulously laid out before us and this adds to the element of fear that Alien is famous for.  I have to say that Aliens scared me more that almost any other film ever made and although I personally find Alien to be very good, (but just a step under Cameron's version and vision) it has to be said that this movie is very frightening and it is extremely well made.  There is quite a bit of tension in here and it stars Tom Skerrit, that alone makes it worth the price of a rental.  I think this is the perfect predecessor to Aliens.  You should see this before you watch the second one.  They complement each other perfectly.  And if you skipped the last two all together, you would have a true feel of what good film making is all about. Alien is a very frightening film.",9,0,1,27 July 1999
Battleship Potemkin," An interesting early film
","I am far from an expert on early films.  I can't tell you why certian shots that Eisenstein does here make them as brilliant as they are.  Yes, this is early film and it is quite interesting.  But for me to comment on the ' struggle ' and such is pure nonsense.  But what I can comment on is that I really admired how ' The Odessa Steps' sequence was very well done.  For the techniques that were employed in 1925, they really made this sequence one to remember.  As for the rest of the film, to be honest I find it interesting but that's as far as it goes.  I am too much a product of the 80's to truly appreciate it.  But I will acknowledge that it has some ground breaking shots and that makes it worth a look.",6,5,11,2 July 1999
Rocky II," The most memorable movie line in the history of cinema
","May contain some spoilers.Forget Gone With The Wind or any Arnold film with 'I'll be Back' in it, 'Yo Adrian....' is the king of all movie lines.  And it fits perfectly into the Rocky character.  What else would he say after he wins the title?Rocky 2 is a perfect follow up to Rocky.  And that can only be attributed to Stallone and Stallone alone.  Everyone else did their job perfectly but Stallone created this character, so why shouldn't he direct the next three films?  Here he makes Rocky 2 feel exactly like the original and I really believe that the only reason this film didn't get more critical acclaim is the same reason that Speilberg had trouble getting respect from the critics early in his career.  He is too young and wet behind the ears to be this good.  If Rocky deserved to win best picture in 76, then this certainly deserved to be out Kramer vs. Kramer for best picture.  But it wasn't even nominated, and that is a shame because this film is a perfect follow up to the first.Here Rocky is still the lovable, sweet but slow guy.  He has a little more money in his pocket but it is disappearing fast.  Add to his troubles that his wife is now pregnant and life isn't so great.  Apollo Creed is also practically coercing him into a rematch that could make him blind.  There is so much to like in this film and the highlight of it is obviously the final half hour, the match.  Have you ever cheered so much for a character to win a match?  Probably not.Rocky II is as good as Rocky and it is not just a repeat of the first movie. It takes the saga to the next step and does a great job of entertaining us in the process.  Stallone proved how smart of a man he is by making this film.  People thought he was a fluke when he took the world by storm in 76. But this film proved not only his versatility ( writer, director, actor, and boxing choreographer ) but his sheer ability to entertain.  There is still an innocence about this film even though it is a sequel.  And how many actors can lay claim to the fact that they are responsible for two franchises of movie characters?  I can think of one other than Stallone ( Harrison Ford ).  But with Rambo and Rocky, Stallone established his niche in Hollywood history.  This a great film.  And this has to be said, just once in a review.' Yo Adrian, I did it!! '  There I got it out of my system.",9,0,0,14 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This is the Star Wars we remember!
","May be some spoilers:When you are as excited to see a film as I was to see STAR WARS EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES, the result almost certainly never lives up to the hype.  Nothing could be further from the truth in this fifth installment of the beloved saga.  Episode II not only lives up to the hype, it far surpasses it.  I wasn't really in my theater going years in 1977, but this is what it must have been like to experience Star Wars for the first time. There is enough intrigue, action, betrayal, ostentatious whispers, lightsabre duals, romance, Yoda, Jedi's and Darth-bad guys all rolled into one pallette of synthetic brilliance to please anyone.  When I tell you that this film is the film that we have all been waiting for, you have no idea what you are in for until you actually see it for yourself.  You may have read every advance article, seen every interview and downloaded every still off the net that you could and still, nothing can prepare you for the experience you will witness when you see AOTC.  Take all that was innocent about the first, add all that was dark about Empire, mix in all that was summed in Jedi and multiply all that was beautifully choreographed in Menace and you will still not understand the scope of a film that Clones is and will be after the ninth or tenth time you see it.  I may change my mind upon further viewings of the film but as it stands right now, this is the best Star Wars film that is out there.  I am having trouble putting into words what I am feeling and what I have just witnessed.  Clones did something to me that very few films have managed to do....it made me cheer and holler and applaud the film at it's conclusion.  Attack of the Clones is the personification of entertainment.  This is how movies were meant to be seen. As much as I liked Spiderman, Clones will toy with it the way Count Dooku toyed with Anakin in this film.There is some even better news and that is that the film is not nearly as hokey and poorly acted as most sanctimonious critics will have you believe. What you have to understand is that this romance that develops between Anakin and Amidala is a romance that is blossoming between two teens.  They are going through many of the same growing pains that we all went through and just because one is a politician and the other a Jedi, does not mean that they are supposed to be wise in the ways of love.  I thought Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman were perfect in the film as forbidden lovers.  They are in a perpetual quandary and no matter what they do, they seem to be displeasing someone.  But they eventually can't resist their feelings for one another and ultimately their relationship bonds.  It was important to give plenty of credence and attention to this plot point because this is what ultimately drives Anakin to the dark side.  The first half of the film wisely lets the two young ones discover their love for one another.  There are people that will say that these scenes are slow and tedious but they set up the rest of the film and Episode III.  The first half also introduces us to some of the events that will create the cataclysms in the years to come.  Here we get to meet Jango Fett, father of Boba.  We also get to see the nascency of the Storm Trooper.  We are also prone to the Senator who talks with both sides of his mouth.  All of the wheels are set in motion for the last hour of the film which is what everyone is going to be talking about.  And what that last hour taught all of us in the theater is one thing.DON'T MESS WITH YODA!Yoda shows us all why he is the definitive Jedi master who takes umbrage with anyone who dare challenge his abilities.I'm sure by now most of you have heard of Yoda and Dooku's epic battle but to see it will do things to you that no movie can.  Yoda proves to Dooku that he is just as pedantic in the ways of the force as he is and he goes on to show him that no one messes with the Jedi master.  This is a lightsabre duel that will stay with you long after you have left the theater.  To watch him strike a ninja pose and then draw his lightsabre and battle Dooku tooth and nail was like no adrenaline rush I have been privy to without the aid of drugs.  I am that serious.  My seritonin levels sky-rocketed and the natural high I received from watching the final battle was just too good to be true. Yoda is the baddest Jedi of them all and there is only one battle that is left to be fought in the Star Wars saga and that is the battle between Darth Sidous and Yoda.  Episode III is going to be amazing and I can guarantee you many fans will be counting down the days with great anticipation.Attack of the Clones has in some ways left me speechless.  It has many similarities to Empire Strikes Back right down to the final shot of four of our heroes standing with their backs to us looking out a window pondering what will happen in the next segment of their lives.  I think Lucas is a genius and every nuance he created in the previous film was done so because it had a bearing on the present one.  Episode II is not just a movie, it is an experience.  This is the film to see this summer.10 out of 10.....I wish I could say more but I feel like I would be going around in circles.  This is just a film that must be experienced.

Forrest Gump," 1994 was a great year for movies, this is one of the best
","There are certain films that people should just enjoy.  Forrest Gump is one of them.  It makes you feel good.  It makes you feel happy and it makes you appreciate what excellent film making is all about.  Simply put, this movie is pretty much flawless and it is a movie for the ages.Pulp Fiction was deserving of best picture and so was Shawshank Redemption, but only one of these fine three films could have won that year.  It is like watching the two best hockey teams playing in the Stanley Cup Finals.  It is the seventh game and we are now in triple overtime and the score is tied at 2.  One team will win the cup, and not necessarily because they are better than the other, but because someone has to win.  That was the case in 1994. I loved Pulp, and I loved Shawshank, but I loved Gump too and when it won I cheered out loud.  Good for Robert Zemekis.What is so great about Forrest Gump is that it makes life a little more pure, a little more innocent.  Forrest never really quite understands what is going on around him and for that reason he lives life in the dark in some ways but in other ways, he sees so much more light than the rest of us. And his antics and the way he lives that life is an inspiration to the rest of us, or at least it should be.  And how can you not like the guy.  Is there a more likable character in the history of cinema?  I doubt it!Robert Zemekis took me completely by storm when I first saw this film. Back To The Future was a great film and he has always shown that he has a propensity for box office gold, but to make a picture that was not only phenomenally successful at the box office but is this sweet and fun and heart warming, was not what I expected from him.  Then again, he is a Spielberg cronie, so that must mean something.Zemekis is one of the strengths of this film, but the tour de force is really Hanks.  His adaptation of the character is remarkable.  He is ever so convincing and even though his work in Philedelphia was completely Oscar worthy, this is even a step above that.  I love him here and I will see anything that he is in from here on out.I love movies.  I love what they do to me.  I love that they can make me feel a plethora of emotions.  Even when I despise a film, I can still look back and say that if anything it made me feel something.  But Forrest Gump is a microcosm of why I like movies.  My world is little better after I watch this movie and for that I am so glad that this film was made.  And for the people that can't enjoy this movie, I certainly hope that in the years to come you can.  Because you just don't know what you're missing.",10,1,4,9 July 1999
The Bourne Ultimatum," The best film of 2007 and perhaps ever!
","For now I just want to say that this film has no business being this good. The quality in here is on par with other sequels like Terminator 2, Aliens, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and so on. Paul Greengrass has to be one of the best directors in the world right now. Where as The Bourne Identity and Supremacy were good, this is in a league of it's own.'This is Jason Bourne, the toughest target that you have ever tracked. ' The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further into the Bourne story and Bourne/David Webb doesn't like who he is or what he has become or what he has done. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting to the story to the lighting, everything is perfect.The film starts out with a frenetic pace as Bourne is running from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They aren't his target. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well.The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is one of the best third installments to a movie ever. And this might make my top 25 movies of all time.10/10",10,2,6,4 August 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," Good movie
","Sometimes I think my age is a hinderance when it comes to enjoying films aimed at people that are about 10 years younger than me.  And then I think that maybe it isn't my age but my memories of films that I grew up liking. And if I have to be honest about the films that I enjoyed, I remember older people thinking the same things that I think of most teen films today: they are good  but nothing great.  I remember films like Fast Times and Mischief and Secret Admirer and Porky's.  They were funny and they looked at high school with a more sexual themed story.  And maybe that is what is missing in films today.  I'm not saying that T&A makes a movie better, but it sure makes it more realistic and funny.  Because when it comes down to it, high school is a time when most people find out how amazing sex is.  It is the first time they start to discover their bodies and it is the first time they actually make a concerted effort to get laid.  That is what made films from the early 80's entertaining and it is the lack of that edge that makes movies like this one and every other film that comes out ( except American Pie, that is a true 80's film and it may as well have been directed by Bob Clark and produced by Amy Heckerling )in the late 90's a little disappointing.This is a good movie, but it is hollow.  I don't remember this as being all that high school was about.  This certainly has elements of high school, but it is missing something.  I do recommend this film because it is good, so much better than Never Been Kissed, but if you are in your late 20's and yearn for silly films like Fraternity Vacation and Wild Life ( have a maple bob brotha, they're fresh ), then you will be disappointed.  But if you are under the age of 20 and have no idea who Jeff Spicolli is, then this is your cup of tea.  I am unfortunately in the former group.  So I will say treat yourself and go see American Pie.",7,0,0,7 July 1999
Fargo," Even though it's serious, it's just so darn funny!
","This is a strange film.  Most of the time, when it comes to films that are reality based, I get tired of them real fast.  Take a film like Affliction. That film was about an alcoholic father and the abuse of his sons.  It got real old real fast because there was just too much reality in there.  And it didn't manage to mesh the reality with even a modicum of entertainment. Fargo is different.  This is a very serious film with a whole slew of funny moments.  I don't think I have laughed this hard in a film when people weren't doing anything particularly funny.  But when a guy with a shovel in his hand tells you than there are clouds coming in over the horizon, and you find that gut-splittingly funny, then you are in for a special film.  Fargo is that film.But besides the hilarity, what makes this film work is the breakthrough performance of William H. Macy.  Macy plays Jerry Lundergard the only way he should be played.  Lundergard is a troubled man.  He is in some financial difficulty and he has rich relatives that wouldn't give him any money for any reason.  They don't particularly like him.  Lundergard is a normal man. He comes from a small town and he ends up hatching a big scheme to get the money.  He will have his wife kidnapped and then set up a ransom for her that will go to him.  His wife won't be harmed and then he can pay off his financial debt.  So he hires a couple of idiots, violent idiots, but idiots nonetheless.  Of course this being a crime movie, and a Coen crime movie at that, everything is going to go wrong.  And it does.Macy captures the true feel of what it would be like to be in Lundergard's position.  He is nervous.  He is nervous because he is so inept at crime that he hasn't even bothered to get the kidnappers phone numbers and he tried to supply them with a car by smudging some numbers when sending in a fax to GM.  In one of the best scenes in the film, what starts out as a friendly meeting between Marge, the police detective, and Jerry turns into disaster for Jerry.  He can't even lie well enough to a police officer who really isn't questioning him about the crime, just the possibility that the crooks stole a car from his lot.  Now I'm no expert in kidnapping, but wouldn't it have been better for him to just say that he had a car stolen from the lot?  But he can't even figure that out properly.Marge is played by Academy Award winner Frances McDormand.  She is from the small town of Fargo, she is pregnant and she has trouble starting her car in the morning.  But she is also a gifted police officer.  Upon investigating the scene of the first crime, she figures it out with common sense and logic.  ' I don't think I agree with some of your police work there...' she tells the other officer that seems to have it all backwards.  When she gets to the big city, the first thing she does is look for a buffet, then she goes onto trying to solve a crime.  She still has her priorities straight.The two kidnappers are played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.  Buscemi is Showalter and Stormare is Grimsrud and they couldn't be more opposite. Buscemi is 'funny looking' and a nervous, talkative fellow while Stormare is a quiet, almost dumb looking dork.  But they are ruthlessly violent and quick to pull the trigger.  Buscemi provides the film with some of the bigger laughs as his character is always described as being funny looking by the locals.The Coens have made some movies that were considered good, although not my taste ( Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink ) but Fargo is a step above most other films.  It is smarter than any film should be and it is honest and deceptively funny.  If something is supposed to go wrong then it does.  In most films, when a crime is committed, the only reason it is solved and the good guys win is because that is the way scripts are written.  The good guys have to win because that is the formula for a film.  But in Fargo, everything that happens does so because there are reasons for it and reasons given for it.  If Marge is going to figure out the crime, she does so because she has done her homework and found out where the bad guys are. The script doesn't let her down.Fargo was one of the best films to come out of 1996 and it sure as hell was much better than English Patient.  I don't think we are meant to figure out the academy though.  One year it gives out best picture to a worthy film like Titanic and overlooks unworthy opponents like L.A. Confidential and then other years it gives best picture to crap like Shakespeare In Love and English Patient overlooking films like Saving Private Ryan and Fargo. Fargo is one of the most original films ever made and it is a perfect one to watch when you are tired of the formula that Hollywood releases time and time again.10 out of 10",10,1,3,26 June 2000
Predator," one of the best action films ever made
","Predator is a unique film.  It combines elements of Rambo and Commando with Aliens.  To combine a story that has an elite team of testosterone laden heroes with a scary story of an unseen force that hunts you in the jungle is ingenious.  And it has to be mentioned here that what really makes this film work is the casting.  Arnold is great but I really enjoyed the other six commandos.  They all had their own personalities and I would have to say that my favourite one is Billy.  He is played by Sonny Landham ( a Joel Silver favourite ) with a perfect amalgamation of fear and knowledge.  He seems to be the only one that knows that something is following them in the jungle.  And he has one of the best lines in the film.  When Poncho asks him to reveal what it is that he seems to be keeping from everyone, he says, ' I'm scared, ' Poncho replies, ' Bull****, you ain't afraid of no man. '  To that he says, ' There's something out there, and it ain't no man.  We're all gonna die.'  That is quite a chilling moment in the film. 
By now we all know what the story is about so I won't recount what that is, but I will tell you what else is great about the film.  First we can start with the direction.  John McTiernan proved himself a worthy director and I would say that it was this film that got him the Die Hard reins.  He has a great pace and a smart attention for detail.  He tells the story at a quick pace but he doesn't reveal all the secrets at once.  He lets the story unfold right before our eyes.  And by the time Dutch is ready to do battle mano a beast, we are ready for Arnold to kick some serious ass.  The jungle setting is perfectly filmed as well.  We can feel the heat and sense the persperation dripping from the characters.  The deaths are very well done as well.  Everything from distant screams to someone losing an arm is done perfectly.  And that is a compliment not only to McTiernan, but to the writers ( Jim and John Thomas, who would have thought they would end up writing the terrible Wild Wild West? ).  The lines they give the commandos are funny and contain much macho linguistics, and that is what we want out of a film like this.  Predator is an action fans dream.  It doesn't really slow down to get cute or philosophical, this is pure unadulterated action.  So if that is your game then you can't go wrong with this film.  This is one of the best action films to come out of the 80's.",10,0,1,20 August 1999
Notting Hill," Nads, this one's for you!
","There is something almost surreal about a good movie.  If you like it, it can make your day, put you in a good mood or perhaps brighten your spirits for a time being.  But if it's really good, not only does it become a part of your life, but it almost becomes folk lore between you and your friends. Raiders of the Lost Ark was like that and although I'm not saying that Notting Hill will have legs the same way that Raiders does, it certainly is a movie that I and one of my very good friends named Nadia, won't soon forget.  Because I think in a way, although we were good friends before this film came out, Notting Hill added another level to it.  It gave us something that we could both quote, and then subsequently laugh at the same memories from the film.  And that is what makes film the great medium that it is. It can bring people together with a simple laugh or a tear that one shared together.  Notting Hill is definitely in the laughter category.  And for that we can completely thank the little known Welsh actor named Ryhes Ifans, who plays Spike.  Back to him in a few minutes.Notting Hill is the story of a simple man that leads an unspectacular life. Suddenly one day Anna Scott, the biggest film star in the world walks into his bookstore and changes his life forever.  They develop a relationship and from there we explore how they work together as a couple and the complexities that a major star must face if they choose to lead a normal life.The romance in this film is really one of its great strengths.  Hugh Grant comes off wonderfully as the man who can't get Anna Scott out of his head. He is the perfect mumbling man and that adds to his authenticity as a human. Think of Paul Reiser and even Woody Allen.  They often play similar characters and their believability is also one of their strengths.  And in here it is Grant's normalacy that gets some of the bigger laughs ( not the biggest though, that is reserved for Spike ).  Take for instance his scene in Anna's hotel when he is interviewing the cast and crew for her lastest film.  He does not realize at first that he is supposed to be a journalist and his questions reflect his ignorance towards the whole Hollywood scene.  It plays beautifully and it does a great job of playing with our funny bone. The assorted cast of friends that he interacts with also make for some great laughs.  But having said all that, let me just say that if Notting Hill was a story about a guy who falls for the most famous actress in the world and it stuck to that story line with no real attempt at humour in it, it would be a fine film.  But Notting Hill has one ace up it's sleeve and that is the character named Spike, which incidentally has kept Nadia and me laughing our butts off for months ( right Nads, not bad not bad! )Spike, as played by  Ryhes Ifans is electric.  Every scene he is in is a scene steeler.  He upstages everyone including Roberts.  By now I'm sure we have all seen the commercial when Spike goes out to greet the media and he flexes for the cameras.  That is funny in itself.  But what we don't see is his reaction to his stupidity when he comes inside.  He doesn't realize that he just made a fool of himself and frankly he doesn't care.  He looks in the mirror and admires his 'tight firm buttocks, nice choice of briefs because chicks dig the grey,'and he thinks his stomach is nice and toned.  If you really haven't seen this film you have to do so just to appreciate this scene and the rest of Spike's antics.  He really is hilarious.As I've said, this film is one of those films that you can stand around and quote with your friends from work, but it is also a great love story and the final scenes are happy ones.  And for all those reasons I say this film is great entertainment and it is worth seeing at least twice.And don't forget about Spike.  If he can start a friendship, think of what he can do to people that just want to laugh.' It's a vicious circle. '",9,0,0,5 July 1999
American Pie," Incredibly humourous and an honest look at trying to get laid in highschool.
","American Pie is the funniest movie that I have seen in about five years. Something About Mary had me laughing, Big Daddy had me holding my sides, and South Park had me shocked but humoured.  American Pie is heads and shoulders above any of these films.  What makes this film so funny is not only its attempt to humour us, but its honesty in every scene.  And that honesty can bring us back to what it was like to be there.  So whether you lost it ten years ago, yesterday of even five minutes ago, you can relate to the feelings that this movie has.It is three weeks before the prom and four friends have made a pact to get laid before the end of prom.  The four friends consist of a guy who has been dating a girl for quite a while but hasn't gotten past third base.  Another is a shy guy that has problems doing his ' business ' at school because of cleanliness issues.  A third is portrayed at first as the quintessential jock that just wants to use his athletic prowess to meet the ladies.  And finally we have Jim.  Jim is the guy that you see in the commercials.  He is so sexually inept that when he tries to talk to a girl, he shies away before any words will leave his mouth.  And when he has a naked girl in his room, he ' blows it ' twice, before he can get the prize.The most interesting situation was how the jock ' OZ ' grew in this movie. He started off as a typical jock.  Then he meets a girl that he really likes.  And suddenly he doesn't just want to have sex, he really cares about her and at the end when we see them together, it makes you feel warm.  It is their relationship that makes you remember what it was like to really like someone for the first time.There are many other delicate and poignant scenes in the film concerning love.  Kevin and Vickey's relationship is a tricky one because they both really like each other but she is not sure if she wants to take that last step.  This causes some friction in the relationship, but when it is resolved, it is written so convincingly that you are happy for them.This film combines some true intelligence and romance with a wickedly funny look at the complexities of sex.  And nothing is sacred here.  They explore female and male oral sex.  They talk in depth about orgasms and of course masturbation is a big topic in this film.  And that makes it side splittingly funny and incredibly witty.  American Pie really is a miracle. It was written by Adam Herz and this is his first film.  And judging by his ear for dialogue and character, he will be around for quite some time.The one performance that I wanted to call attention to was Chris Klein as Oz.  I wasn't sure where I had seen him before so I looked him up in the IMDb.  And he was in Election.  And he was great in that film too.  But here he is honest and sincere in his performance and he lends credence to his character.  He is very good in American Pie and I believe he will go on to do bigger things in Hollywood.So if what you are looking for is one hilarious film and you like Something About Mary (tripled) kind of humour, then this is your movie.  If you don't like that kind of film, don't even bother to see this film.  But you are missing a true treasure.  Thsi film reminds me a bit of a combination between The Breakfast Club and Fast Times.  So check it out.  You will laugh and you will cheer when you walk out of theater.  The only bad thing about this film is that it ended.One final thought is that you should really beware of the chicks in band that play the flute.  ( Wickedly funny!! )Wonderful movie!",9,0,0,6 July 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the 20 best films ever made!
","Well, it has been three years since the Lord of the Rings graced our screens.  And in those three years, our film landscape has literally been dominated by the series.  There have been other films of importance, but nothing that can truly compare with the scope and the sheer grandiose manner in which LOTR has inundated us with.  Simply put, there has not been more of a domination of films since Star Wars and its original sequels hogged grosses and headlines from 1977-1983.  I am an avid and eager contributor to imdb and I love to write reviews but have purposely not said anything about the three LOTR films because I wanted to wait until I had seen all three of them before commenting on them.  Now that I have seen all three, let me begin with FOTR.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a thing of beauty. This is a film that is nearly perfect in every way.  Beginning with the characters, this film takes us on a labyrinthine journey through middle earth and part of the fun is meeting everyone that is going to play a part in the story down the road.  I think the EE on DVD is an even better film than the theatrical version and if you have a chance to see it, even though it is 4 hours long, do yourself a favour and do so.  There is much more explained than what you see in the theatrical version.FOTR introduces us to the hobbits, to Gandalf the wizard and his adversary Sauruman and ultimately to the great eye, Sauron.  Also along the journey to Mordor are Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn and the three other hobbits, Samwies, Merry and Pippin.The one element of FOTR that struck me is that it is a film about discovery. The journey begins here and it is that much more fun to see the genesis of the story and the genesis of the characters.  In each of the three films, each character grows a bit at a time.  In FOTR, we get to see the start of this journey.  Frodo is just a scared hobbit thrust into a great deed here. In ROTK he grows into an honourable and stoic character, but in here, he is scared and feels alone, even with his fellowship of nine.Perhaps one of the main reasons that makes this film so much better than the last two, in my opinion, is that it perfectly blends action and character into a beautiful narrative and it makes you feel for the characters you are watching.  Gandalf's fate in this film is a heartwrenching scene and Boromir's is even tougher to get through.  I shed a few tears at the end of this film.FOTR should have won a plethora of Oscars in 2001 and it is a shame that it lost to A Beautiful Mind.  I think that in 10 years, no one will remember this as Ron Howard's film that took the Oscar.  But FOTR will be remembered as one of the best films of the last 20 years.  There is a bit of everything in the film and for those that crave excellence in film, they need look no further than Fellowship of the Ring.  I have it at number 9 on my all time list and that is saying something.  This is truly a remarkable film.  I have always thought that the books were just okay stories but to see what Jackson and his team of writers has managed to do, is truly remarkable.  In the book, the best part of the story was the meeting of the Fellowship.  This was at the council of Elrond and it is also one of the best scenes in the film.  This is where we get to meet Boromir and Legolas and Gimli.  In the book, I remember the council scene being close to 100 pages in length. Much of it was just talk and in the film, Jackson has managed to keep much of the intrigue with scenes like this, but condensing them to fit into a 3 hour film.  This is just one of the nuances of the film that make it such a fine piece of film making.While I still believe that Star Wars is the best fantasy series ever filmed, at least Lord of the Rings is a voice for today's generation and they have a film that they can relate to and call their own so that in 30 years from now the next great fantasy epic is unleashed, the debate can rage all over again, which is the best of all time?FOTR is one of the best films of all time.10/10",10,0,2,13 January 2004
Cast Away," The last act makes this a disappointment
","I remember the day I was going to see this film what I was thinking to myself.  I was driving to wherever, and I began to wonder how Hanks was going to get rescued.  It would probably be by a plane going overhead or he was going to make an attempt to sail off the island in some crude contraption of a boat and then be rescued by some ocean tanker that transports cars from Tokyo to Nova Scotia.  I then began to think of what expression I would have if I was the extra in the film that had the thankless non speaking role of the guy that sees Hanks first.  Would my eyes bulge from their forehead?  Would I look like I had just seen a ghost? Would I just stare in awe as the tiny boat floated by and was dwarfed by the tanker that I was on?  Would I be smoking a cigarette and it would just stick to my bottom lip as my mouth became agape?  These are all tough choices to make for an extra with such a vital role in the film.  Which one of these reactions actually happened in the film?  Well if you have seen the film, you know exactly what happened and if you haven't then you'll just have to read a little further to find out.  But just saffice it to say that it is issues like this one that made the film a 7 for me and not the 9.5 that it should have been.  And that is a shame.Cast Away is a very good film, it's just that it could have been one of the best if only they would have put a little more care into it.  Even though the film is a good 2 and half hours, it deserved to be three.  When you go to great pains to have a story of this magnitude then why can you not close the deal and make the last act just as good as the middle one? 
What is good about the film is the first act and what is even better is the second one.  We are introduced to Hanks as a guy that lives and dies by his watch.  He is always timing everything and he is so busy that he has to schedule in his girlfriend for New Year's.  It is a promise, he guarantees her that he will be home for this festive time of year.  So far Hanks's character, while a little intricate and obsessive, seems like many of us. We all live by the clock in one way or another.  It's just that he is a little more serious about it.  But in these times that we live in, we are all bound by deadlines, we are all aware of the time and we are all a little obsessive about our jobs at one time or another.  So again, we can relate to his character quite well.  Of course that all changes when the plane that he is on crashes in the middle of the ocean somewhere.  Hanks uses a raft to drift for days and he comes up on a deserted, almost uncharted island in the middle of nowhere.  It is here that the strength of the film is presented. And this is the most amazing thing about the film.  We are not only entertained with Hanks on an island by himself, but we want more.  We are captivated.  At least I was.  The film moves slowly at times when he is here but it also captures the feeling of isolation, loneliness, despair, hope and a plethora of other feelings in between.  Hanks does an incredible job of conveying these emotions inspite of the fact that he is the only thing on screen.  He has no one to talk to so he finds an inanimate object and gives it life.  It's name is Wilson, a volleyball that has washed up on shore that Hanks breathes life into.  Wilson becomes a great character and when it is in danger at times, it frightened me and saddened me that it was.  I have not experienced an array of emotions the way I did when he was on the island.  And as much as I wanted to see Hanks get off the island, I was completely engulfed in his time there.  When he eventually did get off, I craved for him to be back on that tiny island, with Wilson, his coconuts, his caves, his fire and all else that was there.  Up until his rescue ( and you knew that was inevitable, from the trailers ), this was easily one of the five best films of the year.  But what it did once he got rescued was very weak and very poor.  There was so much more that they could have done. There never was that reaction shot of the guy on the ocean liner that first sees him.  There was never really any reaction to him getting rescued.  It just happened.  I wanted to see everyone's faces and expressions when this man that has been lost for 4 years come home.  But not once did we get that. And that is what I meant when I said that this films should have been 3 hours long, hell it could have been 3 and a half, that would have given us closure and maybe a little more honesty.  As it stands, it is a good film, but with the combined talents of Zemekis and Hanks, it could have been so much more.  And that makes it disappointing.7 out of 10- Still a good film and a fantastic journey, but it lacked once he got off the island.  However, Hanks should be nominated for best actor and if he wins, there should be no complaints.  It is an incredible performance.  This film is worth seeing but it also worth noting that there are quite a few better films out there so far this year.",7,1,2,8 January 2001
Armageddon," Do they give out Oscars for fun movies?
","May be spoilersI think people become delusional after they have seen a film one to many times. How this film rates a 5.8 on the IMDb is beyond me. Armageddon was probably the best summer film in 98 and it holds that lofty opinion in my mind because it was as entertaining as they come. Jerry Bruckheimer has been making hits since the 80's when he gave us Beverly Hills Cop and he just keeps churning them out. When an asteroid is about to hit Earth, NASA calls on the best deep core drilling team in the world. This is comprised of Harry Stamper, Bear, Rockhound, AJ, Max and Chick and a few others that die early in the film. But what we have here is a colorful assortment of characters. But what these colorful assortment of characters bring to the table is perhaps what makes this film a few notches better than many other films that are similar to it, either with an asteroid plot or as a disaster film. Armageddon is head and shoulders above similar offerings like Deep Impact and the much inferior Canadian film, Last Night.I think the writers of this film deserve much of the credit for writing some very emotionally galvanized scenes that range from global despair, young love, family love, love lost that may rekindle and plenty of humour. Much of the humour is provided by two actors that have really come into their own since doing this film. Those actors are Steve Buscemi and Michael Clarke Duncan. Buscemi was quite famous before this film but his impeccable timing and perfect delivery of lines like, 'Yea, I've seen this one. Isn't this when the coyote sat his ass down in the ACME rocket and chased the coyote? No really, isn't it? Because it didn't turn out too good for the coyote.' And 'Isn't it nice to know that if the space program fails, you'll always have a job at Helga's house of pain?' And Bear is played perfectly by Duncan. His best scenes are when he shows his vulnerability. Duncan is a massive man, about 6'5 and over 300 pounds so when you see him crying and asking for hugs, it accomplishes perfectly what the writers and director were aiming for. There are many seemingly flawless scenes in this film and sandwiched somewhere in between the humour and the action are some very powerful scenes with Harry and his daughter Grace and even with Chick and his former wife and son that doesn't know him. Bruckheimer and Bay wisely included a wide palette of emotions to keep everyone interested and it worked as Armageddon grossed about 500 million dollars on a world wide scale.Armageddon is a perfect summer film and it is one worth owning. Every once in a while throw the film into your VCR or DVD player and sit back and be entertained. There are few films that are better at pure entertainment. This is a grand movie on the scale of a Titanic. It is not quite as good as the sinking ship saga but it is certainly not as bad as many asinine critics will have you believe. There is enough action to please those from the Raiders of the Lost school, enough comedy to accommodate those from the Beverly Hills Cop school and enough romance and tear jerking situations to please those from the Pretty Woman school. There is really very little wrong with this film and if you haven't seen it, you have no idea what you are missing.9.5 out of 10-- The best summer film of 98!",10,3,5,16 August 2001
The Village," Almost as bad as Lady in the Water
","There have been a plethora of opinions espoused about The Village. Some positive, some negative, and some very ambivalent. There are those that love this film and others call it the antithesis to what made Shyamalan famous revered by critics and film lovers. The difficulty in reviewing a film like The Village is that there is an incredibly fine line between reviewing the film in terms of how well it was made and reviewing the film in terms of how utterly contemptible it is towards it's target audience. The first question you have to ask yourself is if this is a well-made film? Sure, it is competently made, it is well acted and it is scored nicely. If you look at it that way, then The Village is a well-made film. But if what you are looking for in a film is something more sophisticated and shrewd from a man like Shyamalan, then The Village is an abomination. It is nothing but a charlatan that when viewing the film I thought I mistakenly heard Shyamalan was the man behind this film. To cut to the chase, this is one of the worst films of 2004 only being surpassed thus far by the universally accepted fetidness of Catwoman. The Village in some ways is worse than Catwoman because it tricks you into believing that you are about to see one movie when you are really in store for another. The Village goes into new depths of purgatory from a marketing standpoint. When filmmakers and studios can lie to you about what you are to see, then we have reached a new low in the art and business of film. I didn't go into Alien vs. Predator expecting to see a story about aristocracy of Old England and I didn't go into The Village expecting to see nothing but a nostrum of monumental proportions. While Catwoman is a poorly made film by a man with one name, The Village is almost worse because Shyamalan is synonymous with the pinnacle of the craft. Regrettably, The Village is nowhere near brilliant. Sadly, it's almost at the other end of the axis. The Village is terrible.The Village begins with the townsfolk attending a funeral of one of the young boys of The Village. He was seven years old and by the engraving on his gravestone, we can see that the film takes place in the very late 1800's. The Villagers are a very simple and peaceful people and they keep to themselves. They refute any outside influence and have chosen to live in seclusion. This seems to work for them and the nearest town is miles away. They farm, they dance, and they live in a harmonious concord . But of course there is one problem; the uneasy truce they have with the entities in the woods. There has been an ostensible truce between the villagers and the entities in the woods for years and their kinds do not mix. The villagers stay out of the woods and the entities stay out of the village. There are certain precautions that must be taken by the villagers that include a watchtower that is occupied at night and the color red must never be seen by the entities in the woods as it apparently attracts and angers the woodsmen. Harmony is omnipotent in the village until suddenly animals are found skinned and when one of the villagers has gone into the woods. The village's remuneration for their pretentious and defying act is a midnight visit by the beasts. Everyone runs for cover and this is the one and only moment of laconic tension. By this point in the film, it has crawled along at a snail's pace and we are ripe for some Carpenteresque type of tension. When this finally transpires, we think that the film is ready to take us into the realm of ambiguity that consistently graces Shyamalan's films. But what transpires next is a mendaciously misleading series of events that can do nothing to disguise the machination that Shyamalan set out with in the first place. We thought were walking into a horror film that would make the hair stand on the back of your neck, the way Sixth Sense did and the way that Signs did sporadically. But what we get instead is nothing but a quack job that cons us out of our money. Shyamalan is synonymous with 'twist endings'. To borrow a line from Spiderman, that is his gift to us and also his curse. With great power comes great responsibility and Night has abused that power. He might have had noble intentions when he wrote this film as many have discussed the symbolism of the red flags and bad colors and the implied danger inherent in this film, and if that is what you enjoy, a subliminal film that lectures us and works as a parable, then by all means, pay your ten bucks and go see this film. But if you were hoping to be enthralled by an ostensible master of modern suspense and horror, then you are going to be disappointed. Shyamalan has given us nothing but an amateurish picture so engrossed in sanctimonious and implied admonitions that he forgot to make the film entertaining and suspenseful. The Village is one of the most absurd films loaded with esoterica and it is ultimately a colossal failure. The 'twist' in the film produced gales of laughter from the theater I was in and it carried over as the audience left the theater. For a sheer waste of money, see The Village. For a film that had such pedigree to it, it is one of the all time disappointments. The Village takes several steps back for a man of Shyamalan's stature and reputation. Let's hope the next M. Night Shyamalan film is better than the last two because his statute of limitations on creating disappointing films just dropped significantly.3/10",3,1,4,25 June 2008
American Psycho," One sick, twisted, hilarious, interesting, brilliant movie!
","Warning, may contain some small spoilers:If anyone remembers the 80's the way I do, it goes something like this.....If you can graduate from a prestigious university in Canada or the U.S. you immediately will have a plethora of job offers thrown at you in which many of them will pay you large sums of money.  There could be some in the new computer field, it could be a brokerage firm or it could be just plain and simply, big business.It was cool, not just cool but imperative to wear the lateset fashions by Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein.  The fitness craze was launched by Olivia Newton John, Arnold Schwartzenegger and Stallone.  Words like diaretics and emphetimines were launched into our vernacular.  We blasted our pecs, did our backs and spent countless hours doing sit-ups.  BMer's and Jags and 'Vettes were the sought after cars and a man was judged by his wallet. Greed was good according to Gordon Gekko.  Life was great.  But it couldn't last and it didn't.  And now here we are recovering from ( economically speaking ) the disasterous 90's.  And we are reminded of it all again in this smart sadistic but brilliant satire of greed and lust in the 80's. Maybe the book was about a guy that just simply killed because he was psychotic, but the film is cynical look at what we all strived to be in the 80's and perhaps what we all still want to be in the new millenium.  I have never seen a film like American Psycho before and I really don't anticipate on seeing one like it again.  If you don't like this film it is maybe because you don't understand it.  Maybe that isn't fair since I hated Magnolia and those that praise it say the same thing to me, but I do feel that way in this case.Patrick Bateman is a 27 year old yuppie that has it all at some synthetic job in some synthetic building on Wall Street.  He takes pride in everything that he does.  Everything from his outer appearance to the look of his business cards.  Everything is a trophy to him and to the cronies that inhabit his world.  In one of the best scenes done in any film that I can remember, when Bateman is dragging a dead body to his car, with a train line of blood stains left behind by the body, one of his friends that he sees him on the streets says in ghastly shock as he is loading the body bag into the car, ' Oh my gosh!  Where did you get that designer bag? '  That note, but not that note alone, but that note can be a microcosm for what the film is all about.  People see what they want to see and this time in our history was perhaps the worst for it.  The characters in this movie, while important in their own worlds, are merely just another face in the crowd that no one seems to really care about.  Paul Allen may as well be a bum in an alley, that is how much fuss is created when he disappears.  This is a world that can drive people mad just because someone elses business card has the perception of being nicer than the other guys.  It is synthetic, un-noteworthy things that drive men nuts in this film, and especially the main character in this film.Christian Bale is Patrick Bateman.  At first I couldn't understand why the actor chose to play the character the way he was, but fifteen minutes later you do understand.  This performance is one that should not be forgotten. He looks great on the outside but to paraphrase a line that he uses in the film ' I have all the traits of a normal human being, but there simply is nothing going on upstairs. '' Today I just had to kill a lot of people! 'American Psycho is a sick, twisted, hilarious and brilliant film.  It is original and it will make you think long after you have left the theater. And as a bonus too, there is no clear conclusion to the film.  You can interpret it two ways.  Both ways make sense to me and maybe they are both right.  I really don't care what the book was trying to do or say, this film has it's own way of saying it.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  If anything, it will challenge your thinking, and that is always a positive thing in a film.  But other than that, it is a damn fine film and one of the best films so far in this young millenium!9 out of 10",Null,1,1,18 April 2000
Knowing," An emotional shot to the gut. Some of the most shocking moments put on film
","CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS...PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.Best film of the year so far.To say this film is an emotional shot to the gut is an understatement. I sat frozen, literally, with chills (literally) running up and down my spine at least 5 times in this film. The disasters are real, they are devastating and they are scary. What this film has to say is scary. I think there was more to the screenplay but for time constraints, they had to leave some out. I'm not sure if this film affected me because I have a lot of the same problems that John (Nic Cage) does in the film, or if because I don't think that we are all just random particles, but here with a deadline to life, a finite one, or if the movie just affected me because it was harrowing and the finality of it just blew me away, sorry for the pun.What separates this film from many or all other disaster films, is that in others of this ilk, there is a solution. Drill a hole in a giant meteor and we are all saved. Kill one of two meteors and we are mostly saved. Walk from Philadelphia to New York in three hours during a blizzard and we are saved. Armageddon this is not. The ideas in this film are different and they are ballsy. People get engulfed in flames. Mothers die while their kids are kidnapped. The Earth is scorched and incinerated. Kids are taken from their parents. Animals are shown burning up, people crash in an aircraft and they burn in front of your eyes. There are so many against the Hollywood protocol scenes in this film that I am shocked that the studio talking heads allowed some of the plot to take place.Nic Cage is a fantastic actor when he has the right role and this is a perfect role for him. He has the unbelievable task of trying to figure out what he can do to save himself and his child and possibly the rest of the world. And this takes wide eyes, looks of disbelief and reaction of pure and unabashed terror and horror. He accomplishes this beautifully. The shot in the trailer with the plane coming down, and his reaction, is what got me into the theater. What you don't see is his reaction after the plane crash. He is on the precipice of insanity, hopelessness and bewilderment. He is a scientist, so how can a list of numbers from 50 years ago predict the future. It kind of goes against everything he is taught and now teaches. This is perhaps his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas.Knowing might not be for everyone, but for me, this is the best film of the year so far. Alex Proyas has blown me away with his touch and the script writers have made an uncompromising and unflinching film about The Apocalypse. There are those who will say that the ending ruins it for them. But if you look at the ending as one possible Adam and Eve type scenario, then the ending is the most thought provoking part of the film. For those who don't like it or get it (I know how pretentious this looks when someone writes this, but for once, it is actually true) you should see it again. There are all kinds of questions raised when watching the film and there are even more to think about once you begin the drive home. This is not a simple film or one that will leave you quickly and quietly. And for those who complain about the ending, try to look at it without a jaded eye. The ending is perhaps the most intriguing part of the film. Adam and Eve. Genesis. The beginning of life all over again.Knowing is the best film of this short year so far and it will make my top 10 for the year.9.5/10",9,31,62,20 March 2009
American Beauty," This is the one movie that will change your life.
","I guess I am like many of the viewers in here when I say that I am having trouble putting into words how I feel about this film, because to be quite honest, no amount of praise can really make anyone understand what this movie will do to you. You can read all the glowing reviews and believe all the hype about this small, wonderfully moving movie that is making people fall in love with film all over again, but there is truly nothing that you can say or hear that will justify what this movie is all about. I really believe that this is one film that has more to say than almost any film that I can think of and it has more to give than you can possibly imagine. When I walked out of the theater I was smiling for hours and when I went to work I told all of my cronies that this is a film that will change your life. Not only is this the best film of the year, but this could really be the best movie ever made. And to consider a film to be on that level is tough for me because I believe the two best films ever made are ( in order ) Jaws and JFK. But I will seriously have to reconsider that order now that I have seen American Beauty. And now here lies the problem, how do I put into words the feelings that I feel after seeing this film? Look closer..... those are interesting words. To be quite honest I'm not sure exactly what they mean here, but I have my own theories. But if you think about life and the people that are in yours and the situations that you are in every day, and if you had to look a little closer at those, then you may realize that nothing is as it seems. And perhaps that is one of the central issues here. Are the strong and confident really as robust as they appear? Are the successful and popular really as happy as they look? Is anyone really as they seem, not just in this movie but in real life. Because I think Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lester Burnham is really what life should be all about. I think that of everyone in the film, he goes on the greatest journey into self awareness. He is the one that not only does the most growing but also loses and gains the most by the end of the film. But the one thing that he is at the end, is undeniably happy, there is no taking that away from him. But what made him wake up and learn to be happy? Perhaps for many people the answer will vary, but to me, I think he let go. That's all. He let go of all the crap that everyone worries about. And he let go because he realized how futile it is to worry. Think about it, if you worry about losing your job or if your spouse is cheating on you, does it help? Does it do any good for you? No, of course not. The situation will play itself out no matter how much you worry. So why do it? Spacey learns how to relax and not sweat the little things. He goes a little too far with it and ultimately it costs him, but along the way he learned how to live. He learns that life is a gift and one that should be taken advantage of while you're here. Perhaps this review sounds like mumbo-jumbo to those that haven't seen the film, but I can guarantee that the people that have seen this know exactly what I'm getting at. American Beauty has to be seen to be appreciated.As little faith as I have in the academy when it comes to Oscar time, you can't ignore this film. I am going to have to concur with an earlier reviewer that said that this should be nominated for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Best Script, Editing and Cinematography. This film is so rich with amazing performances and it is not just from Spacey. But it has to be said here and now; if Kevin Spacey does not win Best Actor this year then the academy is delirious with a bad acid trip. Spacey's interpretation of Lester Burnham is so astute, so captivating, so humorous and so hauntingly real that no matter what age, sex or colour you are, you will see a bit of him in you. Lester Burnham is a microcosm of what we feel and eventually want to be. American Beauty is the best film to come out this year and without a doubt in the top ten films for all time. See this film, please see it. No matter what you read about this film, nothing can ruin it for you because there is so much in the film that someone could not tell you enough. It is a rare film that will get inside you and not leave for quite some time. It has been three days since I've seen this film and it still makes me smile. There is nothing more I can say about this movie except, go see it, you'll be glad you did. 10/10",10,0,0,26 September 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best sequels ever made.
","James Cameron is a God.  He has to be.  There are so few directors that can make films the way he can.  In fact I would go out on a limb here and say that besides Spielberg ( who himself is a God ) no one can make films the way he can.  Terminator was a great film.  But T2 is really heads and shoulders above it.  Sequels don't usually surpass the original, but this one sure did.T2 explores so many of the same issues as the first one but it goes deeper into them.  It gives us more visuals of what a desolate future would be like after a nuclear war.  And it gives more reason to be pessimistic towards our own species.  ' We're not going to make it, are we? ' John asks the Terminator.  ' It's in your nature to desroy yourselves. '  How chilling is that?  And how true?  As a sci-fi/action movie, this is one of the best. But this could also be taken on the same level as a horror film.  Just an incredibly expensive and well made horror film.What an idea to add to the first films paranoia by not just having Arnold come back to play a good Terminator, but to have the seemingly invincible T-1000 become the enemy added a whole new dimension to the film.This film has a bigger budget and it had higher expectations but it did not cease from being dark and intelligent enough to make us think.  It also has some great humour.  And Arnold doesn't disappoint, he utter the famous line ' I'll be back! 'T2 is a movie miracle.  It is so well made and enteraining while having a message that it is quite simply one of the best films ever made.  I love what James Cameron does when he is behind a camera and I loved this movie. It is a true work of art.  And one hell of an entertaining film.",10,4,5,2 July 1999
Apocalypse Now," Visually stunning, easily Coppola's best
","First of all let's get my beef out of the way.  I know this is a really stupid reason to give a movie only 9.5 out of ten instead of the 10 that it deserves, but Marlon Brando bugs me.  In this movie, he was on screen for no more than fifteen minutes.  He was paid an exhorbitant amount of money and he was nothing but a problem on the set.  He was constantly too high to do his lines by heart, he was so fat and out of shape that Coppola had to do his scenes in a different shade of light just to make him look plausible as a soldier.  His attitude alone put the film over-budget and behind schedule and that bothers me.  When one person thinks he is bigger than the collective whole, it takes away from the experience of watching the film. It was impossible for me to watch Brando on screen and not cringe.  He was a disgrace to acting and to his profession and I am glad that he is no longer around Hollywood.  Having said all that, I will now get to what is good about Apocalypse Now.  And that is everything else.This is certainly one of the best films ever made and it is so because of how dark it is and how realistic it feels.  Martin Sheen is so brilliant that it is scary.  And of course who can forget Robert Duval's performance. But what makes this film over the top and the classic that it is, is Coppola's attention to detail.  The helicopters flying in the background, the explosions over the horizon, the unseen enemy lurking imminently in the darkness.  This is the first war movie that I had seen that made me think I knew what the horrors of war were really about.  With everything this movie stands for, it is a shame that it lost best director that year and it is really a tragedy that Kramer vs. Kramer beat it out for best picture. What a terrific film.",9,0,0,22 June 1999
Disturbia," Shia LeBeouf has arrived!
","Here we are in the middle of April, traditionally a dumping ground by studios as they try to make a little extra money before May and the summer bullies suck up all the dollars. Usually the films that come out last a few weeks and then hope for a nice bump once they hit the DVD market. This is Dreamworks foray into the April sweepstakes as they wait just a few more weeks for Shrek the Third to gobble up every single dollar available. Usually April films are weak entries, and while Disturbia is not going to be remembered as one of the greats, it certainly cannot be said that this is a studio dump. Quality wise, cast wise and direction wise, this is a well done thriller with two very attractive leads gracing our screens.Disturbia is an homage to the Hitchcock film Rear Window, but done for the 14-25 year old age group. Shia LaBouf plays Kale, an angry teenager who has recently lost his dad in a car accident and his anger boils over one day when his Spanish teacher asks him what his dad would think of his insubordination? Kale understandably punches him in the mouth which results in his 90 days of house arrest. His mother, played by Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss), has also cut him off from his X-Box and even cut his TV chord so he is literally left out of the loop. His internet subscription is still good and he has begun to voyeuristic-ally spy on all of his neighbours. He learns of the adultery that goes on across the street, how often people mow the lawn and other small things to alleviate the tedium of his nonexistent life.And then she moves in. The 'she' in this case is the hot girl next door. Her name is Ashley, and played by neophyte Sarah Roemer, she about the hottest thing to hit the screen since Elisha Cuthbert in The Girl Next Door. She swims, she sunbathes and she just looks hot in every pose, every stance and everything she does. Soon, his infatuation gets him caught and she shows up at his door, soaking wet, like The Girl Next Door. From here they develop a friendship that soon escalates into a romance. And soon, they are staking out the quiet and strange neighbour, Mr. Turner, played very well by David Morse. The kids think he might be responsible for the disappearances of some local girls and all the signs point to him.The strength of the film is the young actors. Besides LaBouf and Roemer, you have Aaron Yoo, who plays Kale's best friend, Ronnie. He is the comic relief for the film as his antics, while somewhat questionable at times, also keeps th audience laughing most of the time. And there is a real chemistry between all three of them. The suspense in the film builds nicely as we watch as some more girls disappear and all the signs point to Turner. The problem is, like Hitchcock's Rear Window, no one believes him, especially since he is under house arrest. His credibility is non existent.Where the film lacks is in the probability and believability department. I just don't buy the fact that all of this could be happening in suburbia America and no one else would notice that the guy is killing people across the street. There are so many signs pointing to Turner being the killer and even when one of the boys goes missing, no one believes him. In real life, not movie life, the cops would at least search the house for a missing kid. Mothers wouldn't dismiss their son's claims that the man across the street is really the boogie man. Even if your son is under house arrest, his complaints would at least be investigated. Also, the killer is a man who has been killing for what seems to be years, and now all of a sudden starts killing his neighbours? I don't buy that either. This is a meticulous man who has planned everything out flawlessly and now he decides that the best thing to do is kill 4 people who live across the street from him. That wouldn't draw attention to you at all? That complaint aside, Disturbia works because it is suspenseful enough, it has likable characters and the direction by D.J. Caruso is very sharp, quick and he creates a palpable tension. This will never be a classic, but it is a very passable entry into the pg-13 horror genre.7/10",7,1,5,20 April 2007
The Patriot," Mel, swords, bloodshed and those damn English!
","Films about war are always full of inacuracies.  They have to be.  When you have a hero with the face of Mel Gibson or perhaps Sylvester Stallone ( when he was big )or whomever, you are vying for box office dollars in a crowded market.  So you are appealing to the masses, and in this case, the masses are Americans and the timing is the Independence Day weekend.  Does it really matter how accurate this film is?  Does it really matter if it shows the Americans as nothing but brave patriots that are only interested in becoming independent?  Does it really matter if most of the English in this film are nothing more than blood-thirsty mongers that want to burn, and plague everything in their path?  Of course not.  And I could really care less either.  This is the summer season and in the summer, in the big picture, all I ask to be is entertained.  I am not here for a history lesson nor do I care if this is nothing more than a xenophobic account of what may or may not have really happened to my neighbours to the south.  I want to sit in the theater and suck back a Coke, devour some M&M's and be entertained.  And so far, with average efforts like Shaft, MI2, Shanghai Noon and abyssmal ones like Battlefield Earth, the market and the fans, people like me, are ready to enjoy some ass kicking, and some entertaining ass kicking.  Mel Gibson and Roland Emmerich provide that here.The Patriot is a simple enough story about a great war hero from the years past that has hung up his musket and sword and wants to raise a family.  He has done some heinous things in the past that he is obviously not proud of and he has a terrible and imminent fear that his sins are going to come back to haunt him.  The United States has decided to go to war with England for it's freedom and it's independence.  But William.... I mean Benjamin wants no part of it.  His oldest son, Gabriel, (in an amazing performance by Heath Ledger from 10 Things I Hate About You) is eager to join the battle.  Soon after, he returns home with battle wounds and Benjamin is tending to both countries wounded on the porch of his house.  It is then that Col. William Tavington comes along, and for reasons unknown, except that he is a sadist, decides to take Gabriel hostage and then hang him, kill all of the American wounded, burn down Ben's house and then he kills one of his younger sons. Quite a guy this Tavington is.  This, of course, gets Benjamin into the war. And it is this next scene that is one of the best battle scenes I have ever seen.  Benjamin and two of his young sons attack and kill the men that are taking Gabriel hostage.  The battle is great because the men that are being hunted and killed are not cartoon characters that pop out of nowhere only to die.  They are young, scared, boys, following orders and are just on the wrong side of the war.  You see the fear, the anguish and the sheer horror on their face as they are about to die patriotically.The rest of the film has a few minor sub-plots of love and other boring stuff that only serves as a purpose so that when someone's wife or girlfriend dies, it gives the men a chance to seek vengence.  But the real highlight of the film is the battles.  They are bloody and brutal and I enjoyed them immensely.  When a cannonball is launched and it takes off legs and heads, it gives you the proper perspective of war.  It is just enough to remind us that as much as we are enjoying this 'film', these events really did take place and just like Saving Private Ryan, they were brutal and final.  This is not like Commando, when Arnold mows down 95 men with an M-16 and they drop like flies.  This is violent, nasty and bloody.The Patriot may be liked by Americans because it is about their fight for independence.  It may be liked by them because it shows how they fought for what they have.  It be liked by them because it shows how proud they are of what they had and what it took to get it.  I like it because it is fun, entertaining and it is a great summer flick. That's all.  Nothing more and nothing less.  I'm very glad this film was made because here we are, now heading into July 1st, Canada Day, and so far this summer, we have had one amazing film (Gladiator), one truly hilarious film (Road Trip), two moderately funny films (Me Myself and Irene, Big Mommas House) and a slew of okay films (take your pick).  The Patriot won't top Gladiator as the best of the bunch so far, but at least it can be mentioned in the same breath.8 out of 10",8,2,5,30 June 2000
Silver Linings Playbook," Thugs in perpetuity
","Pat is a man who has just been released from a mental institution after serving 8 months on a plea bargain. He was committed because after he came home early from work one day, heard his wedding song playing and found his wife banging the history teacher in the shower. In a momentary lapse of judgement and an obvious crime of passion, Pat nearly beat the guy to death. Upon getting out of the institution, his main goal is to rebuild his relationship with his wife, who now has a restraining order on him.Enter in Tiffany, who is a recent widow. Her husband got hit by a car after going to Victoria's Secret to buy lingerie for his wife in hopes of spicing up their sex life, which Tiffany had turned off after 3 years of marriage.Then you have Pat Sr. and Dolores, Pat's parents. Pat Sr. has lost his pension because of the financial crash and now runs a bookie business and his wife supports him for doing so. Pat feels that his son is a good luck charm and wants him to stay close during Eagles games as his presence helps the Eagles win.Then you have Pat's friend who has made big money because of the financial crash by flipping houses. But with the this new found wealth he feels stressed, restricted and ready to bash things at any given moment.There are other bit characters in the film as well and when you throw all this into the blender and you have one of the best films of the year.Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro give outstanding performances and I believe all three will get Oscar nominations this year. All three of them simply own these roles. But more than just the incredible acting, this is an incredibly emotionally engaging story. In here you have two very damaged people who find ways to help each other. And even though Pat might seem to be a loose cannon, if you look at the people around him, they are no different. I have always believed that humans walk a fine line between sanity and insanity. There's a Tragically Hip song called Thugs that says, 'Everyone's got their breaking point, for me it's spiders, for you it's me.' Profound in that I believe this to be true. We do all have our breaking points. For Pat, walking in on his wife and seeing another man performing with his mouth on her private parts in the shower, while his wedding song was playing, was enough to push him over the edge. And if that is what it takes to send you over that precipice, how do you recover? This movie explores that journey, and it's not an easy one. Pat doesn't get better over night, or after 8 months or even after spending a few months with Tiffany. It's hard work, but eventually, the human spirit will find ways to mend itself.I have a friend who gained 150 pounds in a matter of about 18 months. He used to be model good looking. And then something or rather several things tested his mettle. And he lost. For 8 years he kept the 325 pounds on, he drank, he smoked and he was lazy. And then one day he just woke up and decided he'd had enough and he lost the 150 pounds and stopped smoking and drinking and now he's back to his old self. It's like Pat in this film. He has to work at it. The human psyche is fragile and sometimes it needs to reboot. This film is that journey to reboot.In a way, this film reminds me of Perks of Being a Wallflower....but for a different age group. Both are in my top three of the year. One is about discovering who you are at a young age and the journey that ensues. The other is discovering who you are at an older age, and the journey that ensues to make yourself better. Both are brilliant and poignant and brought a lump to my throat.Silver Linings also brought a tear to my eye. It's truly a remarkable film.One final note. There is some criticism from a vocal minority who say it goes typically predictable or cliché at the end and I disagree with this completely. It is the opposite of cliché. This is a film about a journey and to have them not end up together would be a travesty. Their courtship and ultimate pairing was part of the journey to make them whole again. That is not cliché, that is just brilliant writing.10/10",10,2,10,28 November 2012
Rocky IV," Forget the politics and this is one of the most entertaining films ever made
","In 1976, a phenom was born.  By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later, after three Rocky films, in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles, it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75% of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor, try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match, some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end, just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed, with all due respect to Raging Bull. 
Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films, he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  Rocky IV is different than Rocky, there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one, it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's 'There's No Easy Way Out'  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video, I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like, I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells ' he's cut, he's cut! '  the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian, American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.  If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! 
When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.  ' Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!'",Null,169,212,22 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Weird and original does not make for a great film
","This is one film that has me completely torn.  On the one hand there is so much to admire about Being John Malkovich.  The film is rich with great performances, it is directed very well by a new comer, it is a wonderfully original idea and seeing John Malcovich have the guts to portray himself, or to parody himself is quite amazing.  But on the other hand there is much to critisize about this movie.  It is slow, it doesn't really have a point and the only metaphors that I can get from the film are not clear or really that mind blowing, and the last half an hour of the film is plain and simply-----bad.  I really think that this is the type of film that cannot fail critically, critics are too afraid to tell it like it is when it comes to an 'arty' film like this one.  It is safe and obvious to critisize a film like Armageddon or Bone Collector but admitting that you didn't really enjoy a film such as this is tricky as a critic because you may look foolish to your cronies so naturally all of them come out and tell you how wonderful and amazing and great and ya da ya da ya da this film is.  But the one thing that I noticed when I read all of the reviews before I saw the film is that not one review really told me why this film is all that they say it is, and that is because it isn't.  As I said, there is much to 'admire' about Being John Malkovich, just not a lot to like.  But I will tell you what is good before I tell you what isn't.The performances are incredible.  John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Katherine Keener and John Malkovich turn in stellar portrayals of who they are. Cusack is the eccentric puppeteer that can't seem to get a break in life, Diaz is his repressed wife that perhaps only a few years ago would have been not just smart but down right gorgeous.  Now she doesn't care about herself, only her animals that she cares for which includes a repressed monkey.  She goes through one of the biggest awakenings.  Keener plays Maxine, a sexy bitch that Cusack falls in lust for and then love.  She is a bit of an enigma yet she is very self assured.  And of course Malkovich plays a version of himself, perhaps a version that we, the public think he is.  All four of these performances are rich and deeply layered.  The story is also good in the sense that it is different than anything I have seen.  It is fresh and nice at times to see a movie that is different than anything you have seen before.  This is one of those movies, and I enjoyed it for that reason.  But that is where my praise ends.  That is all that I can really say is good about the film.  While the film has it's moments of comedy and of interesting observations about life ( the big one being not to live vicariously through someone else or you may lose your identity ) it just didn't keep me interested or entertained for the majority of the film and especially for the last half hour.  And for me to really enjoy a film and to think it is worth recommending to others, there has to be something to keep my interest.  This film just moves along and seems to go nowhere.  It doesn't have anything really great to say and it doesn't really take you anywhere.  As I said, sure it is different, but that does not make it good. I do have a feeling that this film is going to get a rediculous amount of mention at Oscar time, but that is not fair.  There are at least five films that I think are worthy of Oscar mention before this one, and other bound to be great films haven't even come out yet ( The Green Mile just to name one ).I think perhaps this is a film that should be seen once because maybe what I get or didn't get out of it is completely different than what someone else will.  After all there are many positive reviews in this very forum and perhaps that is saying something, but I personally don't like the film all that much and I think there are many films at the theater that are worth your time more than this one is.  If you see it, don't say you haven't been warned.  This is one film that I think the general public is wrong about and the longer it stays out, the more people will have a chance to see it and then people will realize that weird and original does make it great.  It deserves kudos for being like that but not praise.  There is a difference.",6,83,150,14 November 1999
Aliens," James Cameron and Bill Paxton at their finest
","There are really good movies and then there's that select few that change your life.  For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that.  By viewing a movie you see life in a different light.  Aliens also did that to me.  I didn't think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more.  The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.Sigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.Paul Reiser is perfect as Burke,the slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives.  Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop, the cyborg with a heart.  Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn ( another Cameron favourite )is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice.  But the show stopper in this flick ( just as he always is in any movie that he is in ) is Bill Paxton.Paxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1, True Lies, Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic.  Here, his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with.  His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior.  He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can't hide his fear.  When he finds out that they won't be rescued for at least seventeen days, his response is ' Hey man, we're not going to survive 17 hours man!  Those things are going to come in here and they're going to get us and..... ' ( Ripley ) This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training.

The Fast and the Furious," There's something about Vin
","Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life 'a quarter of a mile at a time.'  Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?  8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!",8,95,123,25 June 2001
The Exorcist," I almost feel ashamed for not liking this film
","There is a very frustrating scene from Jaws 2 where Brody walks into the selectsmen's meeting carrying the photograph that the two divers took as they were being eaten.  Brody sees the outline of the mouth and the eye. And he should know what a shark looks like.  But when he passes it around, Harry saysSeaweed?' Verna Fields says, 'it's under water isn't it?  That's why it's so dark?'  They can't see something that is so obviously and that is bothersome.  That is how I feel about my reaction to the Exorcist. Everyone has told me how frightening it is and how it is a psychological trip.  And I know the reaction that audiences had towards it in the 70's. But as much as I try, I just can't see it.  It is not a scary movie and it is not even an enjoyable one, and I would even go so far as to say that it is not even a good movie.First off, there are so many parts of this film that have nothing to do with what the film is about.  The first hour is nothing.  It really has no relevance to the rest of the film.  And for the life of me I really can't understand what the beginning is about.  Why do we need the background of the Exorcist in Iraq?  What does that have to do with the film and how does it further the plot?  I don't get it.Secondly, this is a very poorly editted film.  There were times that I cringed at some of the editting.  It was such a blatant cut that you felt like you could see the editors crazy gluing the film together.  And I am not saying that to be cruel, I really mean that.Thirdly, and this is the big one, what is so scary about this film? Really, all Regan did was get her face scarred a bit, vomit a lot, yell out obsenities and blugeon herself with a cross.  Now that is interesting in the fact that this must have sent a shock wave through the religious community because you are not supposed to say or do anything bad towards the church. But in terms of scares or chills?  No way, they just weren't there.  I can admire a film like Halloween and Blair Witch for being innovative enough to scare us but no this film.  Frankly, I was bored.  I really was.  There were times that I wanted to turn this off and watch the baseball game, and we all know how boring baseball is on the tube.  But this film moved at a snails pace.  And if they would have cut it down by about thirty minutes, it may have been better.The other element that I can't get past is the fact that this was the devil himself.  Okay, let's just say it is.  Why does it allow himself to be tied down?  Why does it jump at water that isn't holy?  Why does it possess a girl when it can come onto this Earth in human form if it wanted to.  When Lucifer was kicked out of Heaven, he was abolished because of greed and a lust for power.  So for an angel to be that despised must have been considered dangerous and powerful.  If that is so, then why all the scenes of Satan being dominated by humans?  Are you saying that the best he could come up with is making a girl puke, levitate, and throw a few things around the room?  That sounds more like he was just having a bad day because he couldn't get his own way.  That doesn't sound like the personification of evil.  You want to see real evil, watch DeNiro in Angel Heart.The Exorcist is a film that has it's place in history and I can admire it for that.  And to be honest I almost feel like someone that doesn't like The Blair Witch Project.  I can't understand why people can't like that film, that is true fear for me.  So when I say that this film is really not that good, I can understand why people may think I'm ignorant, but when you compare this to A Nightmare On Elm Street or Halloween, can you honestly say that this has more to offer?  And if you can say that, well, I just don't see it.",6,24,49,25 August 1999
Pearl Harbor," A grand epic of a movie
","I can't help but to scoff at people that criticize films like this.  You don't have to look far to find them either.  They all have reputable names like Ebert, Travers, Siegel and some home grown synthetic wannabees like Pevere and Braun ( man she is numb ).  These people come off as silly, vacuous, desperate to sell papers, grasping at straws kind of morons that no one really takes heed to or even listens to but are employed and well paid because of the car wreck scenario.  You know, you just have to stare as you are driving by....Same thing.  I read people like Braun, Pevere and Ebert because I just want to see what assinine comment they are going to make about the film next.  There are very few things in this life that are apodictic, but reading a slew of bad, ostentatious reviews ( that are sometimes well written, but ostentatious and wrong nonetheless )by the aformentioned is now becoming one of them.  For people like Liz Braun, it is just accepted that she is a little caustic and shows no real knowledge of film but what disappoints me is how people like Ebert, people who I at one time respected are now so deteriorated in their opinion that they can't tell the difference between what is a well made film and what is just flat out entertaining.  Pearl Harbor is a marvellous amalgamation of both.  It is incredibly well made and it is entertainment at it's finest.  By the time this film has finished it's domestic run, it will probably end with close to 200 million and you can add another 200 or 300 million in foreign receipts. The film has to be doing something right.  I don't know many people ( not paid critics that seem to have a personal vendetta against Jerry Bruckheimer ) that have not enjoyed this film.  I happened to love it.I think by now everyone knows that this is a film that is based on a historical event and it is surrounded by a love story.  And you can probably guess what is going to happen to the main characters about ten minutes into the film.  But that doesn't matter.  What does matter is the execution. What you have here is a film that takes time to develop a love story and then it surrounds it by the imminency of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  This effectively keeps you interested and a little tense about the film.  You know the attack is going to be devastating, we have all read the history books, but what you can't be prepared for is how well it is done. Michael Bay showed his flair for the absurd when he did Armageddon.  He also showed that he was a visionary icon when he did the same film.  Bad Boys was also very well done, in particular some of the chase scenes involving Will and Martin.  But this is a film unlike many others hat I have seen.  The battle scenes are realistic and scary.  The airplanes coming in what looked to be just feet from the ground was nothing short of brilliant.  Michael Bay has some kind of eye for detail and some kind of balls for attempting some of the stunts and shots that he did.  The effort that must have went into every shot in this film is tantamount to it's success.  The audience that I saw this film with was in awe, just as I was at the battle scenes.  You had the feeling that you were there.  There was so much going on at one time that it must have taken the efforts of four or five directors to keep everything in synch.  I don't really have much more to say about the film except to say that it epitomizes what the summer film is all about.  It is big, brash, grandiose and loud.  What more do you want?  When you have nothing but captious critics committing deserate acts of temerity when they critisize films like this, it sometimes makes you want to see these films even more.  You should see this film.  It is a fantastic piece of work and one that will entertain you and enlighten you over three hours.  Judge for yourself.  Don't be led astray by someone that sees 3 films a day and has developed a sense of mendacious storytelling and has become a cynic.  This is a great film!  9 out of 10- Highly, highly recommended.",9,0,2,4 June 2001
The Usual Suspects," A movie that completely takes you by surprise
","' Keaton always said, I don't believe in God but he scares me.  Well I believe in God and the only thing that frightens me is Kaizer Sauze. ' Verbal KintSo is one the coolest lines in the movie.  And it is a line that sums up how this movie is great at playing with your mind and your emotions and takes you on a journey from point A to point B, then C and then Z and all points in between.As the story goes 5 cons are brought together suspiciously in a line up and are eventually thrust into a crime spree together.  But what happens later after their apparent one job is completed, puts all of their lives in danger.  They may have been hired by the mythical ' Kaizer Sauze ' ( who strikes fear in mens hearts just by the mere mention of his name ) to complete one further job where, if they succeed, will be free to divide up 91 million dollars in drug money.  Quite the tempting proposition.  But the story is just one of the elements that make this film work.The men chosen to play the roles of Keaton ( Byrne ) Hockney ( Pollack ) Fenster ( Del Torro ) McManus ( Baldwin ) and Verbal Kint ( Spacey ) were probably done so because they were not major Hollywood players.  Even Kevin Spacey at this time was a B actor at best.  This was before his academy award and before Seven.  And the budget for this film was not that large. But what the casting did by having these actors play the roles of these five men was create excellent characters that are now so familiar to us that I don't believe anyone could have played the roles better.  The energy and charisma that they have together is amazing and watching certain jarring sessions between men is like watching Shakespeare ( if you're into that sort of thing. )Of course the most brilliant thing about the film is how it is summed up at the end and if you do figure it out before they tell you everything, hats off to you.  But my guess is that you won't and that makes the movie so much fun.  This is a near perfect film and it is worth watching many times.",10,1,2,16 June 1999
Gone with the Wind," The most annoying character in the history of film!
","I gave this film an 8 when I voted for it.  But that was a difficult decision for me.  Do I rate the film based on what it is worth in the scope of film or do I rate it based on what the film accomplished in it's day and age?  Because this film is still quite cardboard when it comes to acting and as some other people noted in here, this is really just a four hour episode of The Young and the Restless.  But then I also had to realize how the film made me feel.  And I did get through all 3 hours and 52 minutes of it, and that is an accomplishment in itself.  The first time I saw Citizen Kane, I fell asleep, the second time I saw Citizen Kane I wanted to smash the T.V. But Gone With The Wind is quite good, for this day and age or for the 30's or 40's.  I generally don't like older classic films because I just find that they are too one dimensional.  They don't have an edge to them and they are very synthetic.  Gone With The Wind does fall into that category in some ways, but in other ways it is brilliant.To think that this film is 61 years old is quite remarkable.  It must have been quite the achievement back in the day.  The colour in this film was amazing as well as the cinematography, the landscape, the fire and yes even some of the acting.  I found Clark Gable to be fascinating to watch and I realized the the film was much more enjoyable when he was in the picture. That is not to say that Vivien Leigh was not good, she was, but I just found Rhett Butler's character to be very charming, engaging and suave.  I also liked his carefree attitude.  He always bounced back from whatever was troubling him and he never let Scarlett get him down, until the very end.Scarlett on the other hand was the most annoying character I have ever seen in any film.  Vivien Leigh played her brilliantly and if that is what the script called for, a winy bitch that has no idea what life is really about, then Leigh nailed it perfectly.  But I must say that she got to me after a while.  When she constantly opted for Ashley instead of other men even after her and Melanie became good friends, I wanted her to die.  I was hoping the Yankees would capture her and torture her.  She was spoiled and nasty and people say that she went on some journey to discover who she was and such but she was the same at the end as she was in the beginning.  And that is why the famous line, 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn' is so appropriate.  Someone finally told her off and it was about time.  She had been handed everything to her ( except Ashley ) and she didn't appreciate any of it.  I do think this was one of the great performances of the era.Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel were also great.  Melanie was the backbone of the film and Mammie was just a joy to watch.  She made me laugh and I think she is one of the few characters from the old films that would still sound real and genuine today.  Both were a pleasure to watch.GWTW has it's place in history and I guess it deserves it.  Still I don't think this is one of the best films ever made although it is entertaining. I can only imagine how this must have delighted audiences back in the 30's and 40's though.I really didn't want to see this film for the longest time.  I have been disappointed with some of the other so called classics and I was not looking forward to sitting through another, especially at 4 hours in length.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It captivated me and kept me entertained and that is what is missing from many of the 30's 40's and 50's films, entertainment. Gone With The Wind doesn't disappoint.8 out of 10.  A fine effort and a very enjoyable film.",8,1,2,14 June 2000
Saving Private Ryan," I will never forget this film
","I, like many young people had a grandfather that was in the war.  I know he faced death many times but I don't know how many times or any of the details of his ordeal in WWII.  He wouldn't ever talk about them, not even to my mother or her sister.  Sometimes I could never understand that, but now I do.  If this is really what it was like to be a soldier, no matter what war you are fighting, then it must be an incredibly difficult ordeal to drudge up memories that are this disturbing, this vivid and this real.  I have never been to war and I hope to God that I never have to experience war, but after seeing this movie I believe I can tell you at least what it may have been like.  This movie is that vivid and that honest.The first half an hour of this film is some of the most amazing direction I have seen in any film in my entire life.  I have even read that Spielberg toned it down some.  That is hard to believe knowing what is up there on screen.This film is brilliant in every capacity.  The direction is so clear and crisp that you feel like you know these men when the film is over.  You feel like you understand the war a little better than you did before.  The acting is terrific.  And not just Hanks and Damon, but everyone from Sizemore to Ribisi to the grunt that gets his guts blown out ( take your pick as to who that is. )I can't believe a film like Shakespeare in Love, a film that could have been an after school special, was chosen as best picture.  Best picture?  Over this?  How is that possible?  If you haven't seen this ( and there aren't many of you out there ) please do yourself a favour, see it tonight.  It is such an amazing film and it is one that I will never forget.A final note:  Even though my grandfather has been gone for about 8 years now, I salute him and every other guy that put it on the line and did so because they believed in what they were doing.  I have a new understanding and appreciation for people like my grandfather.  And that a film could make me feel that way is something special in itself.",10,0,0,25 June 1999
The Pianist," A haunting film, one that you won't forget
","I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a 'film' like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10",Null,496,562,27 March 2003
It Follows," A shockingly brilliant horror movie
","Bar none, this is the best horror film I've seen in 10 years. This is a film that will get inside you and it won't let go, however if you are looking for gore, look elsewhere. This review will contain some heavy spoilers.Right from the opening scene, I was drawn in. There is an obvious 80's theme to this but we know it's modern times because one of the characters has what looks to be a data device. This review will be spoiler heavy so if you don't want to know the nuts and bolts, skip over it. The plot is a simple one. There is some kind of malevolent force that follows you around. The way you contract and eliminate this threat is by having sex. Somehow by having unprotected sex, you get it, and then, as the title says it follows you around. Only you can see this thing though. So every person who might look a little strange to you could be the force that is out to get you. And it creates paranoia because you don't know what's real and what isn't. This is an incredibly effective plot device in the film. As it is explained to J, after she gets it from her new boyfriend, this force can be anyone. It walks slow so you can buy yourself time by outrunning it or driving away but like the Terminator, it will not stop ever until you are dead. The first 15 minutes has J having sex with her boyfriend, it's a nice experience that they share, and then as she is leaning over the backseat rambling on about whatever it is you ramble on about after sex, her boyfriend comes up behind her and puts a cloth with chloroform on it, around her mouth. She wakes up tied to a chair and he tells her what it is that's coming after her. He apologizes to her and explains that all she has to do is have sex with someone else and she's rid of it. But, if the thing that follows her manages to kill the person she passed it on to, then it will start after her again. So no one is safe, ever. The cast are not really well known but J, as played by Maika Monroe, has been in some films but she's just not a name. That's going to change after this film. Not only is she strikingly beautiful, she absolutely nails the character. She's unabashedly terrified all throughout the film and when she's scared, you are scared for her. The rest of the cast is very good as well and there's a nice love triangle as one of her long time friends has loved her probably since they were kids, but he's not quite her type and this creates a lot of tension. He's willing to sleep with her and take the malevolent from her, that's how much he feels for her. The look of the film is second to none as this was filmed entirely in Michigan and much of it in Detroit, where you see the poverty, the run down buildings, the old houses, the beat up 30 year old cars. The look of the film is basically a secondary character. It adds to the palette and creates tension. There's something more sinister about seeing an old 70's TV with rabbit ears and all the off, vomit inducing colours from the 80's carpet and wallpaper and such. And then there's the soundtrack. I think the composer paid homage to about 8-10 horror themes. While not ripping them off, you can easily hear, Manfredini, Bernstein, Carpenter, Hermann and even some very obvious nods to something like Knowing where the soundtrack was overbearing but effective. I am simply in love with the music that was used here.When you combine all of this together, you get one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Horror has had some good entries in the last decade imo but nothing can top this. It's frightening, tense, creates a lot of panic and leaves you guessing in almost every scene. Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has created one of the most terrifying and original horror films. I won't rank it right now because it's still so fresh but I am simply in love with this film. I honestly wanted to go right back into the theater to see it again.It's also unapologetically rated R. There's lots of nudity, it's terrifying and if you were to bring kids to this, I think it would seriously have a chance to mess with their minds. IMO, horror was truly born in the 70's. I'm aware of Hitchcock's contribution to the genre, but the horror that I love was from the 70/80's. This is almost a love letter to the films of those decades. But in some ways, it does it better. It Follows might end up being the best film of the year.As for the ending that some complain about. It's the perfect way to end the film. There is no other way to end it. This thing cannot be stopped. It just can't. So to have it look like a somewhat happy ending was cool.....until you see that no matter what they do, they will never get rid of it. The ending was terrific.Every time I finish the review I just feel like going back and adding more. I can't say enough about it. This is about as original as it gets and that is a rare thing in today's cinema.10/10",10,74,155,13 April 2015
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Okay, now let's all take a deep breath and relax
","After reading reviews about this film and seeing comments on TV and so on, you would think that this was not only the best film in the world but the most unique film you will ever see.  RELAX!I went into this film expecting to be blown away and maybe, just maybe that was my problem, but people please, come on!  This was a fun film.  It was intriguing and it was well choreographed but the best film of the year?  You have got to be kidding me.  Jackie Chan films are like this and so were all the after school-channel-twenty-chop-socki shows that I watched when I was a kid.  I think I have a hard time understanding the discrimination between what is art and what is fun...because this is fun to me, nothing more.Perhaps this film gets some of its praise because it is directed by Ang Lee. He has made some other films that critics have drooled over that were actually just okay films.  See The Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility, they were critical darlings but just average films.  I am not saying that this is a bad film, quite the contrary.  But it is not in the same realm as Traffic and Gladiator as best films of the year.What is to like about the film is the martial arts.  I love watching that one warrior that has been trained better than any other who just seems to be invincible.  Here, that is Chow Yun Fat.  He is one of the last of a dying breed of warrior that gets his training from an ancient religion.  You have to go to a mountain to receive this training and it takes all of your life to master it.  You are then something like a Jedi once you have mastered this.  Of course there are those out there that are vengeful and they want to steal the secrets and swords and such and this launches the journey that the movie takes us on.  The journey is to recover a stolen sword. 
There is nothing wrong with this film.  As a matter a fact, I like it very much.  But it bothers me when judgments are clouded by films like this this one and yet a similar film can be passed off as fluff or entertainment.  Why the prejudism?  Why is one film better than another?  So my advice is simple.  Go to this film, see it and enjoy, but please don't be looking for another Gone With The Wind.  That is the critics job to tell you that.  But be your own judge. 8 out of 10- a great film and fun to watch, but don't believe the hype!",8,0,0,25 January 2001
JFK," An alternative to the Warren Report
","No one is saying that this film is exactly what happened on Nov. 22nd 1963. Nobody is saying that this is the solution to the great mystery, but what Stone is saying is that this is one possible alternative to one of the grossest lies ever told to the American people and the rest of the world. People that attack this film and dismiss it for being propoganda are missing the point.  If this is propoganda, then what the hell is the Warren Report that says that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone?  A comic strip?Forget politics for just one second and just look at the beauty of this film.  Because that is one thing that is lost in all the politics of this film, we forget what a truly incredible work of art this is.  You will never find a film that is better acted, better photographed, better directed or edited than this.  You can't.  This film is perfection on every level that is film.  Now you can believe what you want to believe, but what you can't deny is how the film makes you feel.  And for me, it made me mad that a crime like this could be committed.  Is there really anyone out there that really thinks that LHO could really fire off three shots that quickly, 5.6 seconds with the acuracy that he did?  Does anyone not find it strange that the final head shot caused his head to go back and to the left, not down and to the right ( which would happen if he was shot from the book depository )? We all know the inconsistencies with the case that are quite factual, the ones that are not embellished by Stone.  Kennedy's brain did disappear, the limo was ordered clean so that evidence was impossible to come by.  The parade route was changed, the protective bubble was removed, a proper sweep of the area was not conducted.  People's testimonies were altered on FBI reports, David Ferry lied to Garrison, the Warren report was run by guys that Kennedy had once fired, suspicious deaths of people that testified in the Warren Report happened frequently, and the magic bullet theory is impossible.  Seven wounds, one bullet, that is quite impossible.  So if you take into account all that is irrefutable about the case and the movie, why do so many people get mad when an alternative theory is presented.  Surely no one really buys into the Warren Report.  Do they?  How about Oswald being shot by David Ferry?  Too many strange things surrounding this case for it to be closed as easily as it was.  So now Stone comes along and has a different theory, a brave one, and people critisize him for it.  Well at least he and Garrison were willing to look in other corners for the truth. Someone had to try.To talk of the film in parts is futile because there is not one part of this film that lacks.  The ensemble cast from Costner as Garrison, to John Candy as Dino, to Joe Pesci as a overly hyper David Ferry to Kevin Bacon as a Willy O' Keefe who thinks that Mr. Garrison is a good looking man, down to Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack Lemon, Walter Mathau, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldman, every performance in here is remarkable.  They make you feel like you know these characters.  What Oliver Stone has done here is make one of the greatest if not the greatest motion picture I have ever seen.  I still believe that Jaws is the best ever, but JFK is a close second.  Except for it's politics, this film is not open for discussion in terms of how good a MOVIE it is.  Strictly on a film level, the film is flawless.Finally, there is one shot in this film that I think is the greatest shot ever in the history of the movies.  At the very end of Garrison's speech, he says the words ' It's up to you.'  And as he does, the camera gets level with his eyes, so that he is now speaking with every person that watched this film.  And it is up to us to make the decision.  Are we going to swallow all that we have been fed by the government over the years, or are we going to accept the fact that there is more to the story that what the Warren Report says there is?  Maybe not Stone's version, but something.  At least give Stone credit, he is the only one really brave enough to tackle something like this and live to tell about it.  I'd love to see more films like this that question our government.  Because they make you think.  And that is always a good thing.Oliver Stone has made an incredible film and it is one that should be watched at least once by everyone, especially by young people that don't know much about the case or the assassination.  I was 19 when this film came out.  I saw it and it changed my life.  It made me open my eyes to lies and deceit that our government is capable of doing.  And that is not reserved to the American government, it could be the Canadian, Australian, German whatever.  It is important to question the official version of what is fed to us.  And if you dig a little deeper, you will see there is always an alternative to what they want you to believe.  This film opened my eyes to that.  And I am a better person because of it.",10,3,16,21 July 1999
Schindler's List," I will never forget this film
","Human beings are the only species that kills for sport and hunts for pleasure.  We may be the only species ( next to a cat ) that takes joy in killing and torturing another person or animal.  Why God gave us the capacity to experience these heinous emotions and desires is beyond me. But for whatever reason, we do have them, and the Holocaust is one of the darkest periods in our existence as human beings.  There certainly are other dark times but this one is the most talked about and famous.  And before I saw this film, I knew the Holocaust was horrible, but when you can put visuals to the words, it gives you a whole new appreciation and understanding of what is one disgusting display of inhumanity towards a people.  And from a man that gave us films like Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, many may have not expected to see a masterpiece like this. But no one should ever be surprised at what Spielberg can accompish.Schindler's List gives you the horror right in your mind.  It paints pictures in front of you and you cringe with every stroke of cinematic genius that is presented before you.  I felt sad and disgusted to watch the horrors before me.  It made me sick to see that humans could be so cruel. Do we not have any compassion towards the living?  Apparently not.  And this film shows that, along with Mississippi Burning, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and even pictures like Boyz N The Hood, we are a sad creation and one that whoever is the supreme ruler of us has got to be angry at the way we turned out.This is one of the most important films ever made and it also one of the most disturbing.  I walked out of the theater and when we drove home there was four of us ) not one word was uttered for at least a half an hour.  It was like it took us that long to process what we had just witnessed.  When the converstion did start, it went deep into the night and early into the morning.  It will provoke that kind of reaction from most everybody.As important and as brilliant of a film as this is ( I rate it a ten out of ten ) I only saw it once at the theater and then only through the most persistant of begging, once more on video four years later.  It disturbed me too much.  The images were too real for me and it gave me nightmares for a few days later.  What Spielberg has done here is not only make an important film, he has taken a subject that causes so many people pain and he has opened it up for the rest of us to understand.  And for that, no Oscar can ever repay him for his contribution to society.  I know I am a changed person because of this film.  And to me, Saving Private Ryan could have almost been an unofficial sequel to Schindler's List.  They both have opened my eyes to the horrors that mankind has caused.Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are proof that Speilberg is the king of Hollywood.  I sincerely hope he makes an Indy 4, but I hope he continues to make films that make us think.  Because he is damn good at those ones too.",10,9,13,5 July 1999
Meet Joe Black," A powerful movie about not taking life for granted
","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that.",9,377,428,12 July 1999
Casualties of War," Brian DePalma's best
","May contain small spoilers:Someone once wrote, 'War is hell.'  And that is true.  When a war is finished one side is declared winner and the other one has to pay war reparations.  But really, there is never a winner in war.  Life is lost, land is destroyed and crimes are committed.  And I think that is the real issue in this film.  If a crime is committed in the battle field, does one deserve to get punished for it?  I have never been to war and I thank God for that, but I still think my opinion is a valid one.  No one deserves to be brutalized ( I understand death on the battlefield is acceptable) or violated during war.  That means anyone from a POW to an innocent civilian. Watching this film made me look at us as human beings and ask the question that I have asked so many times.  What's wrong with us?  What is it that makes people behave the way we do towards each other or towards other living things?  It is a question that I think is impossible to get an answer for. Watching this film is hard because it takes a dark and evil subject and puts it right before our eyes.  Reading about it would be bad enough, but to see it right before our eyes on 35 mm film is raw.  And it is an experience that I will never forget.What is bad about this film is the opening ten minutes and the final five. That is when we see Erickson in the present.  It is a completely different film and these scenes have no business in the film itself.  But if you discard fifteen minutes of film, what you are left with is one of the grittiest, most realistic and frustrating films to watch.  What we see is six soldiers that are in the battle field.  They kidnap a village girl because they are angry and frustrated with the war.  She has nothing to do with it and the only crime she has committed is that she is a Vietnemese girl.  Two of the soldiers are adament about the kidnapping and only one of them is dead set against it and actually shows remorse and resistance. The leader is Meserve, played with ferociousness by Sean Penn.  I believed his portrayal so much that I really have a hard time watching him as the fun loving Spicolli in Fasttimes now.  He plays Meserve with anger, bitterness and spite.  He is angry, at what?  Who knows.  The war, the situation, the surroundings.  Probably all of that.  But his anger goes much deeper than that.  I think he is just angry for being born and he is taking it out on the world, and this one unfortunate village girl happens to be his scratching post.The rape scenes are especially hard to watch.  They are on par with any of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left, and her death is just as disturbing as the ones in LHOTL and 8mm.  Her death was meaningless and it could have been avoided.  And when she died, I felt terrible.  I felt ashamed that as a member of the human species one of my own kind could do this to another human.To make this film work you have to have good performances.  Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox are great.  As I said Penn is so realistic that he bothers me now.  Fox has a tricky role because you not only have to empathize with his character but he has to go through a wide array of emotions.  Penn is just angry, Fox is all over the map.  And he does an incredible job.  Also good in her role is the girl who played the Vietnemese girl.  DePalma let her write all her own dialogue and it is appropriate that she is not subtitled. None of her attackers would know what she is saying, so why should we? Besides, someone getting raped is a hard enough scene to watch in any launguage.It's really too bad that the first and last parts of the film weren't handled better because this could have been one of the best films ever made. I still do hold it high on my list as one of the best war films ever made though.  But I have to warn you, Saving Private Ryan is tough to watch because of its gritty realism on the battlefield.  This one is just as hard to watch because we can put a face to the person that is getting violated. This should be a film that everyone sees once.  Not so much because it is about war but because it is about how human beings are really a sick species, this film and incidents like it prove that.  And that is sad.",8,2,4,23 August 1999
Evil Dead," Gory, grotesque and will leave you exhausted. The ballsiest horror film in quite some time
","Evil Dead is perhaps the riskiest, ballsiest, most gory horror film I've seen since the 80's. Once the book is opened and the demon stuff begins, it's an exercise is the grotesque. For the 60 minutes or so that this takes place, it left me exhausted watching it. One character in here, the one who stupidly reads the book after he knows he is not supposed to, goes through more pain than any horror movie character I have ever seen with the exception of perhaps some of the rapists in the new version of I Spit On Your Grave. But that's debatable. Anything and everything that can happen to this guy, does. In short, he gets messed up real bad.The movie is not perfect as it is hampered by some really bad acting in some parts and by some really annoying characters in others. But horror movies are known for this so if you can get past really egregious performances in some spots, then you'll be fine. It's a small complaint really, but it does take away from the overall rating. Another point I have to bring up that bothered me a bit is that the Ash character ends up being a woman and maybe because to me ASH is ASH, he is a man, then I would have liked it better if David would have lost his arm and becomes the hero. That was one of the cool things about the original is that it didn't follow conventional rules. Women are always the hero in horror films. But in Evil Dead, Ash was. I wasn't comfortable with the change in this one. And finally, even with a bigger budget, the tree rape scene in this one wasn't nearly as good as the original.But those complaints aside, the movie was everything they said it would be. It made the audience jump a few times and the humour was also there like in the original.The good in the film is everything else. Shotguns, hammers, nail guns, knives, glass, syringes and fire is all used to mess people up. I remember reading that in the original the cleanup on the set every night was a nightmare because of all of the goop they used for the blood. I can't imagine being a cleanup member on this set. There was gallons of blood used here and sometimes it looked more like molasses mixed with chocolate syrup mixed with red dye. It was pretty disgusting at times. I also enjoyed how duct tape was the answer to everything in the film. If you have a hole in you the size of China, just use duct, it'll fix you right up.As mentioned, once the book is open, the pace the film plays at leaves you exhausted. It doesn't slow down in the least and every other scene someone is cutting their own arm off or getting attacked with a nail gun or getting violated by nature. It's a truly terrifying film.To sum it up, I enjoyed it but not on the same level as the original. And there's nothing wrong with that as the original is one of the all time great horror films. But if you are in the mood for a bloodbath where blood literally spews on screen, this is the film for you. It does not disappoint.7.5/10",8,10,54,6 April 2013
The Evil Dead," The ultimate in terror
","It's the early 80's, what do you expect?  This is a scary scary film.  And I think I know why films now a days can't hold a candle to films like Halloween and Evil Dead.  And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original.  That is the bottom line.  Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today, especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories.  They do someone elses work.  But not Evil Dead.  This was Raimi's baby from the outset.  When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns.  They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget.  Halloween was made for $150,000 and Evil Dead for $50 000.  So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so.  Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew.  And that was, how to create atmosphere using the camera.  And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that.  There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin.  Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing.  This shows the cabin as being menacing.  It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin.  And that we are in for a hell of a ride.Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more.  Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel.  We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things.  And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there.  What a brilliant concept.  A book that is evil.  I have often wondered about such books.  We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.  But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language, and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say, well they won't be around much longer.The Evil Dead is a miracle.  It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be.  If you want to truly experience a frightening experience, rent this film, it knows what it wants to say.  And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid.  Be very afraid.  You may never look at the forest the same again.",10,230,303,10 July 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Horrible in every way
","Kill Bill is a fraud. Terrible, terrible movie! SPOILERSSpoilers within this post. Enter at your own risk!I just got back from the noon showing of Kill Bill in which the theatre was half full (for a noon showing, that is huge. The theatre is one of the bigger ones at the Queensway in Toronto, so it will do well this weekend). What I witnessed in that 100 minutes in the theatre can only be described as Tarantino's flipping of the bird to all of us as he looks in the mirror and congratulates himself on being the smartest man in the world. Straight up, Kill Bill is one of the biggest disappointments I have seen in my life. After masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and other greats like True Romance, you would think that Kill Bill would live up to those lofty expectations bestowed upon it by virtue and name recognition alone. But not only has Tarantino told us all to **** off, he he has done it while laughing in our faces.Kill Bill has all of Tarantino's quirky and weird trademarks in it. And it contains strange techniques that at first you think is simply an homage to a film genre. But in reality, what QT did here was get too cute and at the expense of artistic integrity. What we are left with is more Matrix style garbage, a 10 minute anime introduction to Lucy Lui's character, black and white photography for no reason and the bleeping out of the bride's name just because he can. All of this is looked at as being brilliant by the critics and those in similar circles because Tarantino has a free pass right now. His films have enamoured critics for 10 years now and this one is no different even though it is a shadow of the opulence that we are used to from him. To sum it up, this film is all style and has no substance. The style is there, but for what purpose? Why does he choose to do the things that he does? Is it just because he can? Or is it because he thinks he is so much more clever than the rest of us? You guys thought Matrix Reloaded was pretentious, this film might as well be the Architect meets Socrates meets Locke, meets Rouseau meets Japanese smart guy meets Marx. That is how it comes across. Pretentious doesn't even begin to describe it. There is even a blatant rip off of the burly brawl in this film right down to beings jumping up a flight of steps to come and meet the heroine.I knew I was in trouble five minutes into the film when it just didn't feel right. You know how in Pulp you just knew you were in for something special? You just felt it with the dialogue, the acting, the soundtrack and everything that encompassed the film. Well Kill Bill has the opposite feel to it. None of that magic is present and it is just a bunch of people getting sliced and diced and maimed. There is no snappy dialogue and that is what QT is good at. Tarantino is a lyrical genius and he abandons that here and goes Wachowski Brothers on us and it just doesn't work.I despised this film with every fibre of my body. Shame on you QT. Shame on you for starting to believe everything that was said about you.1/10",1,5,10,1 October 2012
From Dusk Till Dawn," Is there a better actor than George Clooney?
","Okay, first of all let me just make this very clear.  I have never watched one single episode of ER in my life ( honest ).  So what I am about to say has nothing to do with some ridiculous love for the show.  Having said that, let me tell you that George Clooney makes this film the classic that it is. It is a great fi, because of Tarantino's writing and Rodriguez' style and it has a fun story and the other actors are really good in it.  But there is just something about Clooney that makes every scene that he's in believable. His interpretation of Seth Gecko is so amazing and so believable.  Take for instance the scene in the bar when he is teaching Kate how to slam a shooter.  He downs his own and then slams his glass down three times on the table.  It is tiny subtleties like this that make his interpretation of his character so real.  Every scene that he is in is a lesson in acting.  He can take any dialogue, whether it is bad or good and hit just the right note. Take for instance the film A Thin Red Line.  Now that was a really really really bad movie.  But when he was on screen for 30 seconds, it made me forget that it was a bad movie and I was  absorbed by what his character was saying.  Now that is power.Someday Clooney is going to win an Oscar and when he does people will look back at his career and say ' You  know what?  He was really good in that weird Tarantino film. '  And I'll say I told you so.This film is a lot of fun and it has a lot of twists and turns and plus Tom Savini is in the film and that is worth seeing as well.  But for a clinic in acting and a great character he has to work with, see this film, you will be so happy you did.",8,1,2,28 June 1999
Paranormal Activity," A film that leaves you exhausted, drained and scared of strange noises
","For a film that has been around since 2007, been searching for a distributor, made with a budget that wouldn't even cover the cost of cigars smoked by Jack Nicholson on a major film, was blown up from WOM by REGULAR PEOPLE, stars nobody and made by nobody, it doesn't get much better than this. This is a celebration of horror that I grew up with. This had just as much effect on me as some of the classics that I hold so dear.I think this is what horror is all about. If you watch Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and some of the other greats, it is very similar to this film. There is very little blood, very little violence. It is all imagined. You never do see the girl go through the meat hook in TCM. You never really see Myers do anything incredibly overt to many people in Halloween. But you see shadows, you hear breathing, you see a flicker of a candle, you hear a dog bark, you see a giant man in face of skin and you see the surroundings he lives in. Blair Witch Project did the same thing. The mind can mess with you and Paranormal Activity epitomizes that. Paranormal Activity is the story about a somewhat cocky man named Micah and his live in girlfriend Katie. Katie, in her own words, has been somewhat haunted her entire life by some kind of malevolent spirit. The couple decides to videotape themselves while the sleep to see if they can find out what it is that goes bump in the night. Micah doesn't really believe in demons or ghosts or spirits, and he is more interested in playing with a ouija board and getting some 'cool' things on tape. What he is in for is ultimately something he never could have foreseen.The couple invites a psychic over to the house to see if he can pick up any negative energy or provide them with any answers. In the best part of the first half hour of the film, the psychic tells them that demons are not to be messed with and that he can feel a presence in the house. Soon after he leaves, the real trouble starts.Once they begin recording the strange activities while the sleep, loud, invasive noises seem to be an every evening occurrence. And then soon there after, Katie begins to feel the presence of the demon. The middle of the film is a frightening and chilling experience, the last ten minutes will have you cowering with fear.I personally can't stand films like 1999's The Haunting, or any of the other myriad of inferior pg-13 horror films that have been made ever since the recrudescence of horror with Scream. Film makers started to realize again that there is a huge market for horror and if you do it right (low budget, moderate scares) you can make a profit. But if you do it wrong (big budget, buckets of special effects and potty mouthed unlikable characters who all grew up in a module) it becomes one of the terrible films of your life.SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW.Paranormal Activity is a stroke of genius because it doesn't have the budget to show you a demon, not in the demonic literal sense. But it does have the brilliance to use what it has to its advantage. We're all afraid of what goes bump in the night. We're all afraid of what we don't know and can't understand. And we're all afraid of the worlds that are mysteries to us. By using possession, demonology and lots of bumps in the night, this film has managed to scare the yoyos out of many, many people. I don't agree that this film has 10 minutes of tension or 10 minutes of scares. I'll agree that the last 10 minutes of the film is some of the scariest scenes ever filmed, but the buildup to the ending is just as well done. I guess some people (and there's nothing wrong with this, just different things that scare different people) aren't bothered by what the mind does to you. some people need more of a visual stimulus. It's kind of like phone sex. Sometimes all you need is words and a vivid imagination and it's almost as good as the real thing.Paranormal Activity has stayed with me long after I have left the theatre. This film has proved to me and other horror lovers and non horror lovers that you can make a scary film. I love the movie, love everything about it. Horror has blessed me with another surreal experience and for that I am grateful.10/10",10,3,9,20 October 2009
Mission: Impossible II," the last half an hour is great
","Marketing is like magic.  It really is.  This film was marketed to look like it was action packed from beginning to end.  Kudos to the marketing guys for doing so.  They have to be considered similar to a David Copperfield. Copperfield can give you the illusion that something is there or something isn't.  The trailers for this film do the same.  We are led to believe that MI2 is going to be your typical summer action flick with explosions, car chases, mano-a-mano fight sequences and anything else that will increase your pulse.They lied.The trailer also promises you that John Woo is here to replace a stagnant Brian De Palma in the director's chair.  It also screams to us that it is not going to be like the first one.  It is going to be better.HAH!  What a load of crap!First let's talk about John Woo.  This man has a visual style that is matched by no one.  His propensity to direct a good action film is not challenged in today's Hollywood.  But this is also a man that is in love with the slow motion button on his camera.  We usually see slow motion in everything from people eating a sandwich to reading Shakespeare to yawning as the sun passes overhead.  It is overkill and although I can admit that he is a great artist with a broad stroke in action sequences I also have to say he does not know how to create tension in other areas of his work not involving action.  It also has to be said that I think he is in love with Thandie Newton.  Okay, sure she is beautiful.  But I do not need a close up of her in every shot.  After a while it gets incredibly cumbersome and it tries to dehort you from the inequities of the rest of the film by having her face take up the entire 60 foot screen.  I can understand doing it at first, but come on, 20, 30 times in the film?  It becomes cataclysmic and tiresome.The first film was verbose and silly in some ways, but this one is void of any real action until the final thirty minutes and the director and his camera are in love with the female star.  If Woo likees her that much why not just show her naked once, get it out of the way and then move on.  How many shots, how much film was wasted trying to get her in the perfect light with just the right amount of hair hanging in her face and so on and so on? Too many.But back to the crux of my complaint.  There was very little action here and that is funny.  The final 30 minutes of the film is some of the best action probably ever filmed.  The motorcycle chase was breath taking, the fight scene was tense and exhilirating and the break in by Cruise into the fortress where Sean is negotiating his deal left me awestruck.  That is where Woo excelled in the film.  But what of the first 90 minutes?MI2 has a great climax to the film but that is all it has going for it.  I am actually giving it a 6 out of 10 because of it's style and energy at the end.  But frankly I was bored with the rest of the movie.  If as much energy was put into the entirety of the film as went into the end, and into showing how beautiful the female lead was, then this would have been a great film, as it stands, it is a mediocre one.Prediction:  MI3 in 2004",6,0,1,26 May 2000
Black Hawk Down," This is why the rest of the world will never understand the U.S.

Vietnam was an event that the majority of Americans didn't care about and it took the U.S. years to commit themselves to WWII.  But now when you watch films made by Americans all you get to see is events that surround these times that are told through their eyes.  And I guess that only makes sense when you are spending millions of dollars making the film and more millions marketing it.  I mean, who would want to see a film where another country either does more than the U.S. does or at least helps them out?  You can look at one of the great AMERICAN War films like Saving Private Ryan for example and poke holes in the entire beginning of the film ( were the Americans really the only ones on the beaches of Normandy?)  But Hollywood can make jingoism like this and sell it to their patriots because this is what everyone wants to see.  Rocky Balboa is not only spoke of with reverence as a character, he symbolizes the great American struggle, the good guy vs. the bad guy, the underdog vs. the favourite, David vs. Goliath. Black Hawk Down is a film that I'm sure has many accuracies to them, but you can't tell me that this is the whole story.  We only get to hear things from an American point of view.  That is always how it is.  And that is fine, again, is any true patriotic, flag waving American going to want to see a film where the Americans aren't the heroes?  Even though they are the big bad Americans, for some reason it is prudent for film makers to present them as the underdogs, the Davids, the Rockys.  Now think about it, how funny is that?I mention this in utter futility because I am Canadian and I realize I will never understand the true spirit of what it is like to be American so this film perhaps is not really made for me.  But when people comment that a film like this is unflinching in it's realism because it shows us how the government betrayed it's soldiers and this is why so many died that day. Well here's a news flash for all of you.  That theory has been going around for years and this is the not the first film to suggest that.  But when it is mentioned in popcorn movies like Rambo, people just brush it off like it is just good entertainment.  But mention it in Black Hawk Down and it all of a  sudden becomes some hidden dogmatic like piece of information that we have never heard before ( let the soldiers do what they do best and all is right with the world, but once the politicians get involved, it is FUBAR). Does this sound familiar?  I think Chuck Norris even had that theory in Missing In Action. I do not really want to say to much more about this film.  It served it's purpose, especially in the wake of 911.  But it is films like this that upset the rest of the world at times because although this is an accurate depiction of what happened on the streets of Somalia, it is not a true depiction of why the U.S. was there and this is a microcosm of how sometimes the U.S. sticks it's nose into everyone elses business and how sometimes it can go wrong.  But as one of the characters in Mississppi Burning said 'Your in Mississippi now, the rest of the world don't mean s**t'.'  I'm sure that is how most Americans feel about the rest of the world. 
America and American's need something to feel patriotic about and this is the perfect climate to stir up those feelings of patriotism and it let's the rest of the world know that you really are the home of the brave.  I just don't know if this film is all that it is hyped to be.Ridley Scott is a masterful director and he has made a good film, but, I guess me not being American, I just have a few more questions. Look at the positive reviews on this page and look at the not so positive reviews.  Most of the reviews that praise this film are from Americans.  Most that are like mine, are from people that don't live in the U.S. and will never understand what it is like to be American.  That is not a good thing nor a bad thing, it is just what it is.6 out of 10",6,1,1,6 February 2002
For Love of the Game," A good baseball movie, a subpar romance
","Baseball always seems to be a little more mystical than the other American sports, a little more religious than football, hockey and basketball, to Americans that is.  A great baseball player is referred to almost religiously.  Pitchers are like Moses, and comparisons to them pitching a great game are often spoke of in the same way that religion speaks of parting the red sea.  For Love of the Game is like that.  There are so many 'heroes are us' comments about making the sun shine one more time on some guys's storied career and blah blah blah, that it made me want to puke.  But then again, baseball and even sports in general, makes me want to puke sometimes.  Overpaid crybabies that go on the injured list because of a hangnail or a stiff eyelash are not what I would call role models.  Having said that, For Love of the Game was an enjoyable film and I was actually rooting for Costner's character ( his name is Chapel, see what I mean about the God complex baseball has? ) to pitch his no hitter even though I knew at the beginning of the film that he probably would.  But what I didn't enjoy was the romance between the two players.  Kelly Preston is a hottie and I really enjoyed her in her teen roles like Secret Admirer and Mischief, and even in her sexy adult roles like Twins and Jerry Maguire.  But I did not enjoy her in here as she was an annoying, indecisive, winy crybaby.  Let me see here, what is not to like about a guy that seems to be totally head over heals in love with you, is ridiculously rich and gets along with your daughter?  Nothing, and that was the problem with the film.  I didn't buy the dilemma that she seemed to concoct for herself.  The baseball part was hokey but fun but the romance was forced and silly.  This is one film that I'm glad that I saw before it left the theater but I will never be inspired to watch again.  I do give it a 7/10 and I also recommend that if you decide to see this it should be in the theater, it works better that way, but if you miss it, don't worry too much about it, there are better films out there.",5,1,3,10 October 1999
The Insider," Michael Mann makes this slow moving film even worse
","Oliver Stone's film 'U-turn' was a pretty good film, when it was just that, a film.  When it became director heavy it really lacked.  What I mean by that is the technique of film became more important that than the integrity of the story.  Stone used so many silly and pretenscious shots that it took away from the experience of the movie.  That is the same with Michael Mann's The Insider.The Insider is an interesting film about an interesting topic. I'm not sure if I would invest more than 70 million dollars into it, but it is an interesting topic.  The story and the two great lead actors are the strength of the film.  But what is almost an abomination is the work done by Michael Mann.  Sometimes a film has such strength in it's script that it can survive on that alone.  Think of work by Tarantino or Kevin Smith.  They usually have material that is strong enough that you don't need a lot of camera work or an infinite number of camera movements to capture the essence of a scene. The Insider is directed like a it is made by a guy that is fresh out of film school and wants to use every technique he ever learned and that means using 25 different angles for one scene in a room.  The Insider has more close-ups and over the shoulder two shots that I can recall any movie having in quite some time.  And that became boring and cumbersome after about 15 minutes.  Whatever point was trying to be made had been done in overdrive. Close up of Crowe and his kids= he loves his kids and their life and safefy is at stake.  Close up of Crowe= he is in imminent danger.  Close up of Crowe and his wife= they are in danger and they are on shaky ground.  Close up of Pacino=  I don't know what, it could mean anything, maybe Mann is obsessed with close ups of actors.  But they were not needed in this film. I got tired of them, I didn't need to see every pore on Pacino's face, every wrinkle on Crowes forehead, every hurt expression on Crowe's wifes face magnified twenty times.  Movies have directors so that they have direction but that does not mean that I need or want to know that they are there behind the screen and off to the right of what is happening on screen.  I've always thought that a film works better when the presence of a director is not felt.  When you can look at a screen and feel like you are peering into someone else's conversation, then that is the best kind of film making. Spielberg is a master of it, Tarantino and Smith are as well and even a guy like Robert Zemekis is wonderful at doing that.  But Michael Mann seems as though he is unsure of himself as a director of films that are laden with dialogue so he compensates his ineptitude by using every shot he possibly can.  This is the biggest problem with the film, but it is not the only problem.  As interesting as the film is, in subject matter that is, it is really quite boring and slow.  There were many times that I groaned silently and wanted the film to end.  But it just kept going.  And I also felt that as good as Pacino was, he wasn't allowed to act, he was always just waiting in the background to do or say something.  The times when he was allowed to show emotion were the best parts of the film.  There is a scene in the office of 60 Minutes when Pacino is allowed to explode after his character has been told that his story is not going to air.  Here he blows and tells them how foolish they are and how much of a corporate puppet they have become and I will bet good money that when Pacino is nominated for an Oscar, when they show the clip that showcases his talents for the Oscar at the ceremony, it will be this piece that they show.  He really excells for about five minutes in this one scene.  But that's all there is, really.  The rest of the film he just sort of waits in the shadows to do anything memorable.  I don't know how you make a film like this better, with the subject matter and all, but I know one way to do it is to let Pacino loose and another way would be to get a better director.  I mean let's face it, no matter how good your subject matter is, if it is something that you can make into an A&E Special, perhaps it shouldn't be on the big screen for 150 mintues.  Overall this is an unsatisfying movie and one that I don't really think redeems itself.  I had seen Dogma the day before this, and as I stood in line, freezing on a blistery Saturday afternoon in Toronto, waiting for the Pokemon kids to get their tickets in front of me for their beloved film, I commented to the cashier that I was probably the only one seeing something else besides Pokemon.  He told me that I was probably right, except Dogma was selling out as well.  I wish I had gone to see that again.  It too was quite long ( about 2 hours in length ) but it was funny and enjoyable along with being interesting.  The Insider and Michael Mann should take lessons from Dogma and Kevin Smith.",6,0,1,15 November 1999
The Dark Knight," Will be remembered as one of the best films of our time
","If there is anyone who is an anti-Batman fan, it would be me. While I thought Batman Begins was one of the best of 2005, I did not care all that much for the first four Batman films. I actually despised Batman Returns to the point that it is entrenched firmly on my top 50 worst films of all time. With that in mind, I began hearing all of the accolades this film was getting before it's release. How Heath Ledger had turned in a performance of a lifetime. How this was being called the Godfather of Comic Book films. How this film was being lauded as one of the best films in the last ten years and so on. By now, you've heard them all. And to be honest, I resented that and I believed that it was simply the scope of Heath's death that was causing this love fest with The Dark Knight. Never have I been so glad to be wrong. Not only is this film the best film I have seen since American Beauty, it is one that moved me and reminded me why I fell in love with the art of film in the first place. Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger and everyone involved should be proud that this film transcends comic book films, and it transcends the summer popcorn genre. It is a larger than life experience and it is one of the best films ever made, in my opinion.As we all remember, the end of Batman Begins we were shown a new villain named the Joker that had been leaving his card at the scene of his crimes. This takes place shortly after that with the Joker and his henchmen robbing a bank that holds mob money. He steals a cool 68 million dollars in a well executed and highly improbable robbery. Soon he is crashing a mob meeting and introduces himself quite effectively with a disappearing pencil trick that gets everyone's attention. His thought process is that he knows the mob no longer has the respect they once did, and that is because of the Batman. He offers his services, to kill the Batman, but with a hefty price. When his prediction comes true later in the film, that the mobsters are not safe from Batman, they realize they do need him. Meanwhile, a new DA named Harvey Dent is keen on cleaning up the city in any way possible. When he realizes that Batman is actually good for the city, Bruce Wayne takes a liking to him and decides that Harvey will be his white knight. This may actually allow Bruce to live a normal life. But of course nothing goes as planned and when tragedy strikes Harvey and his loved one, all hell breaks loose in Gotham City and the Joker becomes more and more unstoppable. Soon of course we are headed down the inevitable mano a mano confrontation between Batman and The Joker, but in a way that has never been done before.The Dark Knight explores socio-political issues usually reserved for a Michael Mann film. Take one exchange between the Joker and Batman, on paper it sounds good, but to see it on screen is mesmerizing: 'Don't talk like one of them. You're not, even if you'd like to be. They need you right now. But when they don't, they'll cast you out...LIKE A LEPER. See their morals, their code...it's a bad joke...dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show ya, when the chips are down, these civilized people will EAT each other.' Batman and The Joker are separated by a fine line. But that line is often crossed in the film and when the Joker puts Batman to the test, I think they switch personalities. The film works because it has iconic characters and wonderful performances no doubt, but it also works brilliantly because it treats the audience like they are smart and perceptive. Spiderman 3 this is not.It has to be mentioned of course that Heath Ledger gives a performance that has no equal. When I think of some of the great performances in film, I think of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, Val Kilmer in Tombstone, Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, just to name a few. They have nothing on Heath. He is The Joker. You won't recognize him, you won't know that it is an actor, you will believe that there is a man named the Joker that is on screen and someone captured him on film. There is not a finer performance I can think of and if anyone wins best supporting actor this year besides him, it is their duty to thank the academy and then decline the award and give it to Heath. He is that good. The Joker is mesmerizing.The Dark Knight is a film for a generation of film lovers that has been begging for a better comic book film. This is that film. Even if you are not a big fan of these type of movies, it will win you over.10/10",10,9,20,1 August 2008
Grindhouse," Another Tarantino ego trip
","Films like Pulp Fiction are one of a kind, literally. No one can duplicate the success of Pulp Fiction. Many have tried, none have succeeded. The problem with this is that Quentin Taratnino made such an auspiciously brilliant debut with Reservoir Dogs and then Pulp Fiction, that he would have a very difficult time matching the brilliance of those two films. But who would have thought he would drop so far down on the directing evolutionary chain? Jackie Brown was just okay, but Kill Bill and now his Death Proof segment of Grindhouse is so embarrassingly bad that I think Tarantino has officially lost what made him such an ingénue. This is a sad statement as no one, with the exception of maybe Spielberg, exploded onto the scene the way Taratino did. But I'm not sure if anyone has burned out the way he has either. His films are gimmicks now. They are not really true movies, but rather they rely on cheap ideas that try to show us what a genius Tarantino is. He perpetually tries to show us how much of a film geek he is and while making films that only he could love, he forgets that most of us don't give a you-know-what about how much he knows about film. All we want is a movie that we can embrace. A movie that has a story, not just a bunch of uninteresting characters sitting around calling each other bitches and then spouting off more inside Hollywood stuff that Tarantino must of had a ball with writing and then chuckling to himself as he writes things in his scripts that only he would understand. This isn't a film for Quentin, it should be made for all of us. And it's not. And this is where he has failed. I know many many people adored Kill Bill. I'm not one of the loonies that did. It was more of an ego fest from Quentin. A subliminal flipping of the bird to all of us. Quentin makes movies for himself, not for us. And if this continues, he won't be working for much longer. He got away with it in Kill Bill because the movie was split in two. If it was one film, people would have walked out of it also.Grindhouse, as everyone knows now, is two films made in the tradition of old 70's films that apparently had little quality to them. They were just violent films with little or no film expertise exhibited by the director. In this homage to those crappy films, you have Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez making two films in the same vein. Robert's film is pretty decent as we are treated to zombies coming to kill people and then you have the gorgeous Rose McGowan getting a machine gun for a leg. This episode is at least blatantly tongue in cheek. It has a likable cast that includes Michael Biehn and Jeff Fahey. This zombie flick is action packed and humorous. And as much as I'd like to go on praising this portion of the film, it's hard to remember the good things after you watch Deathproof. The film has two great scenes. Both of them involve Kurt Russell trying to kill people with his car. But once you get past that, what you are left with is a rip off of Reservoir Dogs and more inept dialogue that goes on for 20 minutes at a time and the conversation adds up to a big fat nothing. I could really care less about Pete Townsend leaving the Who to join some silly sounding band. Or how Daryl Hannah's stand in screwed one of the girls love interest. None of the dialogue fits in this movie the way it did in Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. It's sound for the sake of sound.I get the feeling watching Quentin's recent films that he really doesn't give a damn about what his fans want. He makes films to amuse himself. And good for him I guess. If you can get paid insane amounts of money to basically go to a playground and play tag on the jungle jim all day long, then you have the perfect life. But if you are here to make movies that people want you to make, and you end up disappointing them because of your ego, then every criticism bestowed upon you is deserved. And don't be surprised if he starts to lose some of the support he has in Hollywood right now? You think two crappy films in a row can't do you in? Check out M. Night Shyamalan who also stopped making movies for an audience but more for himself. Check to see what his next movie has for a budget and how short of a leash he is on. QT could be heading down the same path to nowhere.Grindhouse is a massive failure because Quentin's ego is about the size of Texas now. And as the cook says in Planet Terror, 'best damn one in Texas,' you can apply that same idiom for Quentin, but with a slight variation.'Biggest ego in Hollywood!' One of the biggest disappointments of the year, maybe of all time.3/10 Planet Terror- 6/10 Death Proof- 2/10",3,54,82,21 April 2007
Mission: Impossible," Cruise: With An Attitude
","Warning: may contain spoilersPeople say that if you can go into Mission Impossible and try to ignore the plot, then the film is fun to watch.  And although I can agree that the film is a little laden with what can only be attested to as the banalities of scriptwriting, I have to admit that if you watch this film perhaps for a second or third time, the plot isn't just more clear, it is quite well done. So when the second Mission Impossible was unleashed to us, the makers promised a somewhat diametric film from the first.  And that is not always a good thing because I believe this one to be superior to the sequel.  Am I going to tell you the exact plot of the film to make it transparently clear for you?  No, of course not, I don't think that is possible.  I am still confused by some of the film but just suffice to say that where I was once apathetic to the film, I am now in appreciation of it.  This is a great action film that has a heavy but interesting story to go with it.  If you can listen and decifer what is being said, I think you can have fun with it.The crux of the story is that Ethan Hunt has to prove to his superiors that he is innocent of extortion, cajolery and all those other terrible sounding international espionge words.  It seems that IMF, the network that he works for, thinks that his parents have received an unjust amount of money in their bank account.  His father has gone bankrupt and all of a sudden a large sum of money has appeared in his account.  Cruise has to clear his name without the help of agency but he can still enlist the help of some rogue agents that are willing to help him.  This is where some really great casting comes into play when Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are recruited for the job.  That is only part of the story.  The rest of the story involves the confusing stuff.  Who is the bad guy, who lives, who dies, what is on the disc, who wants the disc, why is the Bible involved and so on and so on. Do I have the answers for all of this?  No, of course not.  But I can tell you that from the opening sequence in the film it is at least fun and entertaining if not a little confusing.Mission Impossible is a pastiche of James Bond films, James Cameron films and perhaps even films like French Connection and Bullit.  But that does not mean that it doesn't have a style of it's own.  One of the most breath-taking and intensely filmed scenes is the one in the agency.  We have all seen this one in the commercials and if we remember anything from Mission Impossible, it is this one sequence.  This is a tour de force in directing and Brian DePalma should accept many kudos for his work here.  I am generally not a huge fan of his but this film is done with Hitchcockian ambiance in some ways.  And this one scene is coup de maitre of the film.Mission Impossible is loaded with great stunts, an admittedly confusing but compelling story and a buffed up Cruise doing what he does best....pleasing the audience.  If you toss in Ving Rhames with his one liners and his unmistakably Marcellus Wallace manerisms, Cruise's funny yet serious diatribes like 'You have never seen me angry Kitteridge.' and enough spy stuff to please any fan of the Bond genre, then what you have is a pretty good movie.  At the very least you can say that there is nothing remotely prosaic about the film.  This is an action packed story with lots of espionage, double crossing and plenty of missions that seem impossible.This review will self destruct in 5 seconds......7 out of 10",7,1,2,26 May 2000
Life Is Beautiful," The best foreign language film I have ever seen.
","I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies.  Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing.  So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people.  Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life.  Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan.  The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke.  It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film.  He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night.  There is that much raw energy in this film.  There really is.  For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible.  And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen.  When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell.  He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film.  Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars.  He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.",9,202,332,25 June 1999
The Hurricane," One of the most emotional films I've ever seen
","There are few actors that can do what Denzel does.  That is, actually become the character that he plays.  It doesn't matter if it is a fictional character or if it is a real character.  From guys like Walter Hubbard and his character in The Bone Collector to Malcolm X and now Rubin Hurruicane Carter, Denzel Washington has something that only the greats have, and that is charisma.  I honestly can't think of a better actor in the business today and I mean that with all due respect to people like DeNiro and Pacino.  But before this film I didn't know anything about Rubin Hurricane Carter or the people that helped him out.  Now, thanks to this incredible film by Norman Jewison and because of Denzel Washington, I feel like I know the man and feel for what he went through.  There are so few films that I let get inside of me.  I mean where they can manipulate your emotions to the point where you feel like you just ran a marathon upon leaving the theater.  That is how I felt.  I was emotionally drained after seeing this film.  The Hurricane is not an easy film to watch. It will send you through the wringer and it will make you want to cry in many areas.  This is the story of a man that has spent almost all of his life behind bars because of racism and because of hate.  It is stories like this that show you how sick and twisted our world is. 
Mississippi Burning was a film with racism as it's main theme.  It showed how rampant and authoritative it was back it the 60's.  It was directed by an Englishman ( Alan Parker ) as The Hurricane was directed by a Canadian. Two bleak times in American history and their stories were told by foreign directors.  Maybe it easier for foreigners to see what it wrong with the U.S. in some ways.  This is an incredible story of injustice, love, hate, persistency and the true spirit of five people.  Rubin Hurricane Carter, Lesra, the young man that gave Rubin hope and the three Canadians that diligently fought for his innocence.  It is a film that moved me almost unlike any film has before. When Rubin was granted his freedom, I wanted to hug the person next to me. I was so happy for him and I felt like I was watching the real trial.  The film became real to me.  And that is something that as I said before, not many films have done to me.  And I do want to thank Norman Jewison for making this incredible film.  After seeing this movie you can be sure I am going to go back and watch other films of his that I have not seen before. He is a great director and although I have said in many reviews this year that American Beauty is the best film of the year, for the first time since seeing that mind blowing film, I can now finally say that if The Hurricane beats it out as best picture, I would not be disappointed.  It is that powerful of a film.  If you have been deterred from seeing this film because you have heard people say that it drags or it is a little slow in parts, please don't listen to them.  This film is about two and a half hours long because it has a lot to say.  And it never drags at all.  This is a powerful movie and the length should never keep you from a good film.  This, believe me, is a great film and it is one that should be seen.10 out of 10---  A True Masterpiece",10,0,1,25 January 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino is a lyrical genius
","I consider myself to be a film buff, a lover of the cinema, maybe even an addict.  I will see a film because it is a film.  For example, I knew I was going to hate the Virgin Suicides and I saw it anyway.  I have heard nothing positive of Battlefield Earth and I am heading there after this review is completed.  And on this logic alone I rented Reservoir Dogs for the first time in 1993.  I had heard of a new man on the scene that apparently was the talk of Hollywood.  I had also heard that there were some pretty interesting actors in the film and I had heard that Harvey Keitel was the one responsible for getting the film started.  So I was intrigued to see what the fuss was over this film.  However, the first time I saw it I was rather impartial to it.  It's not that I didn't like it but I just thought it to be okay.  I didn't really get what all the fuss was about but I did have a hard time watching the torture scene.  So I put Reservoir Dogs away in my mind until Pulp Fiction came out.  Because by the time Pulp Fiction came out Tarantino had penned the story for a brilliant True Romance and for Natural Born Killers and he had a few hysterical cameos in films like Sleep With Me where he attacked famous films like Top Gun and what they really meant.After I was swept away with Pulp Fiction, I went back and watched Reservoir Dogs again and this time I saw something that I didn't or couldn't see before.  I can't really put my finger on what it is or why it is that I didn't see it's brilliance before but I just didn't.  But Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the best movies ever by a new comer.  Forget how it is directed because it's direction is fine, but what Reservoir Dogs has that is sheer brilliance is an ear for dialogue.  There is not one character in this film that doesn't have at least one insightful thing to say.  Even Tarantino gives himself some great dialogue with his take on Madonna's Like A Virgin, or his displeasure with his given name by Joe ( 'Mr. Brown sounds too much like Mr. Shit!).There are certain films that perhaps should be mandatory viewing at film school, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs should be two of them.  This is one of those films that if perhaps you didn't quite like or understand the first time around, you should see again.  It hits you like an epiphany the second time.  In Tarantino's world, people are never one dimensional.  They have things to say whether it is about tipping or the name of an actress, or the rants of Nice Guy Eddie talking about them having places all over of the place.  I would love to see Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino get together and write a film.  It would probably be the funniest yet most serious film that has ever been made and it would certainly be one of the most entertaining.Reservoir Dogs is a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of and you can always catch something that you never caught the last time.  This is truly one of the finest films ever made and if you haven't seen it in quite some time, do yourself a favour and rent it.  It is one of a kind.10 out of 10",10,5,12,15 May 2000
Rocky," A great movie that proves dreams come true
","What can be said about Rocky that hasn't already been said.  It is uplifing, well made, well directed, well acted, well scored and well, it is ' well ' everything.  This is the movie that started one of the greatest heroes and greatest careers in the history of Hollywood.  And it proves that in life and on the screen if you want something bad enough, you have to go out and take it, because no one is going to give it to you.  To tell you what this film is about and then give a small critique is rather pointless.  We all know about Rocky.  And my review is not going to do anything to enhance your like or dislike of the film.  By now, you either like the character or you don't.  You like Stallone or you don't.  So judge for yourself if this film is good or not.  I personally think it is great.  But for me this was much more than a film.  This is much more than a metaphor about life.  To me, this is a Bible for anyone who has a dream.Stallone put his life on the line to get this movie made.  He believed in himself and he believed in what he had to say.  He was offered a huge amount of money to sell the film and let someone else play Rocky.  He held out and told them that he wanted the title role and even though at the time his wife was pregnant, they had very little money and he was hanging by a thread, he took that stand.  And the rest is history.  Could you imagine anyone else in that role now?  Does anyone really fit the mold that Stallone made for us? No.  And this film inspires me to be more than I am.  It inspires the dreamer in all of us to go for what we want and damn the consequences.  If I ever meet Stallone one day, I will personally thank him for making this film.  It changed my life forever and gave me hope to make my dream come true.  Rocky didn't stop until his dream came true and neither did Stallone. Why should I?  Why should anyone?",10,1,1,7 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A great beginning, a hollow end
","Sex can sometimes make us do really strange things.  You see it all the time.  You are at a nightclub, there, surrounding you are 100's of scantily clad beautiful women.  And you may be 25 years old and you have had sex 100's of times in your life time but the sight of those women make you act like you have never seen a breast before.  Never experienced the raw energy of lust, even though you may be dating a beautiful woman.  And then sometimes the question arises.  Should I?  Could I?  Is it all worth it? Tough questions.  Love is usually described as the one thing in this life that can make a strong man weak and a rich man poor.  But if that is true about love, then what can be said about sex?  Because there are times when sex can be more powerful than love.Eyes Wide Shut has a great time exploring that very notion.  It examines what the physical pleasures of the naked body can have on people, not just married people, but people in general.  It looks at what happens when one is tempted.  And it also shows what it is that some people think but rarely ever express.  And when it is expressed in here, a man's jealousy almost destroys not only his marriage, but his life.  And on that psychological level, EWS is a brilliant film.  The first third of the film was mesmerizing.  The dialogue and scenes were so perfect that you could feel yourself remembering situations that were simialr to the ones in the film.
Nicole Kidman plays Alice.  Cruise plays Bill.  They are a married couple and they seem fairly comfortable in their marriage.  But then one night after a huge party where they were both propositioned for sex by other people, they get a little high and Alice begins quizzing Bill about just how far he wanted to go with the two women that were hitting on him at the party.  It is here that the film hits its best notes.  The dialogue is perfect.  You can see how Alice is playing with Bill's words, twisting them and throwing them back in his face.  And then just when it seems that Bill has said the right words to alleviate the tension, Alice reveals that there was a time a year back when she felt that she wanted to have an affair, just a one nighter, but an affair none the less, with some naval officer that was staying in the same hotel as they were.  She graphically tells her husband how she was thinking of the other man while they were making love that afternoon.  And I felt for Bill.  Just as any man would feel for another man in that same spot.  Then in the next 24 hours Bill goes on this labryinthian odyssey.  He refuses sex a few times from willing women and then he gets into some secret orgy and probably almost loses his life.  Now the movie starts getting clouded and grainy.  It is still enjoyable to a certain degree but it is getting kind of weird.  By the time the third act gets going and Cruise and Sydney Pollack do their thing, it is still interesting. But that is where the movie stops being a great film.  Because when Bill and Alice have their talk at the end, I wanted more.  I wanted to feel more . I wanted Bill to not only tell Alice everything but to show her and tell her how much she hurt him.  But he doesn't.  The only emotion he shows is sadness, but not at what his wife has done to him but because of what he has witnessed.  It is so unfortunate that the film wasn't concluded with more energy because EWS has many things to say but just no way of ending them. It just sort of leaves the viewer hanging.I loved the way this film looked.  It made me feel like I was watching The Shining or A Clockwork Orange.  It had that 70's feel to it.  And as I have said, it was a good film, with so much energy and lots of insight to sex and infidelity and love and lust, but it just left me hollow at the end.  And that is a shame, because it was so bright, so ambitious, so witty and so sexy.  But the end just feels not so bright, not so ambitious, a little dull but still sexy.  It is worth seeing.",8,0,2,19 July 1999
Pulp Fiction," Take 'im down to the kennel and sick the dogs on and we'll find out what he knows!
","Warning: does contain spoilers.Before I go into how great this film is, I have to first tell you something that I know everyone thinks but so few have commented on, and that is the performance of Ving Rhames.  For those of you that have seen this film, you all know what I am going to say is the gospel, for those of you that haven't, if you ever see a film for a singular performance, see two films. One is Tombstone because of Val Kilmer and the other is Pulp Fiction for Rhames.  His portrayal of Marcellus Wallace is one of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures.  His mannerisms, his dialect, his virility, his coolness and his ruthlessness all should have given him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, even over Samuel Jackson.  Just think back to some of this lines, some of his actions and some of his facial expressions.  This is the epitome of greatness and if I could pick 5 performances in the history of film that are the embodiment of powerful interpretations and believability, this would easily be up there. Just look at the scene when Jules talks to him after the Marvin problem. Jules is freaking out and Wallace calmly responds ' I'm on the m*****f***a, go back inside and chill them niggas out, I'm sending in tha Wolf. '  As he delivers the line he is serenely sitting in his backyard with his cool shades covering his malicious eyes and he is wiping his mouth with an expensive hanky.  His delivery is perfect and when you listen to him you don't think this is a ruthless killer, he is just a guy next door with a very nice house.  And what makes it even better is that they are two gangsters talking about alleviating the Bonnie situation before she gets home.  These are two bad ass criminals that are in the business of killing people and they are attempting to save a man's marriage by removing a dead body from the garage.  That is just dripping with contradictions, but it works because of the writing and because of the delivery, mostly by Rhames. Another scene that demonstrates his grasp of his character is the rape scene.  When he finally gets around to his comeuppance against ' Billy Boy ', he spits out his dialogue with such venom that while you are cheering his triumph, you are actually worried for Zed and his soon-to-be-living-his-shortass-life-in-agonizing-pain-rapist situation.  And then when he talks to Butch, he is fair and thankful for Butch's assistance but cannot forget how Butch betrayed him.  ' Oh that what now.  I'll tell you what now.  There is no me and you.  You leave town tonight and when you be gone you stay gone.  You lost all your L.A. privledges. '  Ving Rhames is my favourite part of the film ( besides the ridiculously intelligent and original script ) and quoting him is now a daily regimen at work with my other friends that like the film.  I think Tarantino is so smart for casting Rhames in this role and what it makes it that much better is knowing that Rhames is one of the most humble men in Hollywood, remember when he gave back his Emmy to Jack Lemmon as he tearfully said that he hadn't paid enough dues yet and Lemmon was one of his idols?  The man can do no wrong in my eyes.  He is one of a kind.As for the rest of Pulp Fiction, this is a film that will often be imitated but never duplicated.  That is an old cliche but it is so true in this case. It is completely original and without a doubt, what makes it so original and so great is simply the writing.  What other film can have gangsters talking about foot massages and the importance of them just before they are about to perform a hit.  What other film can describe in great detail what a pilot for a film is and then talk about a man that fell through a four story window and develop a speech impediment, all before entering into a room to ramble on about the Bible and how tasty the burgers are before executing them with extreme prejudice.  There is a simple and definitive answer to that question, no film.  Pulp fiction takes violence and surrounds it with every day conversations with people that seem to be in a different world yet they jump through some strange porthole and into ours by discussing things like blueberry muffins, how good coffee is, cleaning a blood smeared car with domesticated products that are located under Jimmy's sink, oral pleasure, speaking Bora Bora, getting day jobs as opposed to robbing banks, being cool like Fonzie and five dollar milkshakes.  How and where Tarantino thought of this script is beyond me, all I know is that my film life and even my life is richer now that I have seen Pulp Fiction.  I can understand why this film was passed over at the Oscars for Forrest Gump, but in most people's opinion this was the best film of 1994.  I loved Gump and Shawshank Redemption but I also loved Pulp Fiction and if it would have won Best Picture that year I would have been just as happy.  Pulp Fiction is one of the best films ever made and it will be remembered into the new millennium and my bet is that when film people are talking about the best films of the last 200 years ( when it is about to turn 2100 ) Pulp Fiction is going to be one of them mentioned.  When you can have Christopher Walken talk with a straight face about hiding a watch in a place that was not meant to store medal, have Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth talk seriously about robbing a restaurant, have Travolta and Jackson talk about walking the Earth like Kane in Kung Fu, have Eric Stoltz shout at his wife to find his little black medical book before he gives a shot to an O.D-ing Uma Thurman, have Harvey Keitel appear in a full tuxedo at 8:00 AM and then appear on the scene to 'solve problems' have Tarantino appear himself as a guy that knows the difference between gourmet coffee and the crappy stuff his wife buys, have Bruce Willis decide what weapon he is going to use to stop the bad guys, have Ving Rhames talk about having a guy pop out of a bowl of rice and 'pop a cap' in someone's ass if he shows up in Indo-China and have it all make sense, well you have something special.  Pulp Fiction isn't a movie, it is an experience, it is a gift to true film fans.  This may not be for everyone as some people forget this is a film and they think it is a documentary on life and they get offended because it is not about love and honesty and morals and all that other crap that exists in some Hollywood films.  This is a film that takes all that you have ever known about film and bludgeons it to death with a pen and paper.  It redefines what is acceptable and what is off beat and all it asks you to do is enjoy this film for 2 and a half hours. I did, immensely, and I think most people will, and have.  If you really have not seen this, then you are robbing yourself of one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of film.  This is easily one of the best films ever made.  How anyone can disagree is beyond my understanding and I can't see how you can truly call yourself a film fan if you can't see the brilliance of this film.",10,1,2,15 November 1999
The Da Vinci Code," One of the most entertaining films of 2006
","As theology goes, I find many of the religious zealots who overreact to anything and everything that says something slightly disparaging about what they believe in, to be people of extremely questionable character. Think of Brittany Spears with her head shaved and you get a picture of what some of the loonies are like when movies of this ilk are released. The same contingent lost their minds when Kevin Smith did Dogma. I will never understand this mindset as this film is fiction, most of it anyway. But when you protest and march and try to shut films down because they tell a different side to what you believe in, you show more of your insecurities than your conviction.I preface the review with this little digression because I will never understand how a film can evoke so much emotion when the book was released under the fictional section at your local Chapters. I didn't get the memo that said it was non fiction. Now, do I believe that much of what the book subscribes to could be true? Absolutely! And at the very least, it is an alternate to what the Bible tells you. Kind of like watching Oliver Stone's JFK. I'm sure not all of it is true, but it is certainly a substitute to the Warren Commission and what they reported.Ron Howard's The DaVinci Code is quite faithful to Dan Brown's novel. It is not quite as frenetic as the book, and not quite as in depth, but it does a fairly adequate job of retelling the story for a world wide audience. As the story goes, Leonardo DaVinci ostensibly has a secret that is revealed cryptically in his paintings. It is an age old secret that is guarded by a very select few. It is a secret so shocking and so nefarious that it could change the way people see religion, the church and all that it encompasses. This is a secret that has been guarded for centuries by groups like the Masons, and presumably the Illuminati, which is rumoured to include powerful names like Newton, Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The story goes all the way back to the 11th century when it is told that a massive treasure was discovered by a village priest who kept it secret enough and then suddenly fell into power. Many men lost their lives trying to protect the treasure. Now what this treasure is, no one really knows. But it subscribes to the theory that there is a secret society that controls the banks, finance, governments and every other powerful faction in the world. If this secret were to get out, it could devastate the balance of world power.This is where our story begins. Tom Hanks plays Dr. Rober Langdon who is in France giving a lecture when he is picked up by the police so they can use his expertise in understanding a recent murder that took place in a museum. When he arrives, he sees that it is his friend Jacques Sauniere, who is a world renowned expert on the Holy Grail. Initially Langdon thinks he is there to provide any information he can to help out. But he is actually the prime suspect in the murder. When he eventually meets Saunierre's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, they embark on an adventure to clear Langdon of the charges that he is innocent of, and along the way we discover names like The Priory of the Sion, the Merovingian (remember the name from the Matrix Relaoded) and the Last Supper. All of these names are connected somehow and once it is all revealed, it is one of the most interesting twists in any film. Since most of us have read the book, the twist is no longer shocking, but it does rank up there with the Sixth Sense for pure shock value.Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have created a fine film, in spite of what some have said. It moves at a breakneck pace, is blessed with likable actors like Hanks and Ian McKellen and Amelie's Audrey Tautou, and if you like religious obscurities and nebulous mythology, then this film should please you. If, however, you are a zealot who marches against freedom of expression, lay down your 5 bucks at the video store and rent it. When no one is around to see that you are actually enjoying a piece of fiction, you might even crack a smile. And there's nothing wrong with that.The DaVinci Code is a well made film and one of the best of 2006. It is certainly one of the most entertaining of last year. And if you are interested to see where Brown got some of his ideas, buy the book the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, the 1980's best seller that spawned the controversy.9/10",9,1,3,22 February 2007
Titanic," Easily the best film of 97 and a classic that will stand the test of time
","Warning: may be some small spoilers.I have always been a James Cameron fan. He is really one of the only directors I can say that has never made a bad film. Even his Piranha 2 was humorous and a fine effort coming from such a young director with a small budget. He has made, from what I can recall, two masterpieces (Aliens and Terminator 2) a genre pioneer (Terminator) and one of the best action movies to come out in the 90's ( True Lies ) and an ambitious touching film ( The Abyss ). But now he has outdone himself with Titanic. I don't think there has ever been a film that has taken me through such a wide array of emotions as this one. And that is all attributed to Cameron. He wrote, produced and directed this film. And it is one of the best films ever made.We all know the story of Titanic. A great ship sets sail for the U.S. from the U.K. and along the way it sinks and many people lost their lives in the Atlantic somewhere near Newfoundland. So there is no need to retell those events documentary style. A Night To Remember is there for that purpose. So what Cameron's Titanic does is tells the tale of fictitious characters blended in with real ones amidst the real events of the sinking. And it not only makes the film entertaining, it shows the sheer horror of what happened that night and makes you more sympathetic to the characters because you spend three hours with them. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.To start with, the actors are perfect. Not just DiCaprio and Winslet, but everyone from Zane and Bates right down to Paxton as the present day treasure hunter. But it is Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that are the true stars here as it the two of them that have to carry the load and make us care about them. And we do. We can feel them falling in love. We can feel the helpless emotions that Jack feels when he is trying to tell Rose that he loves her the day of the sinking. It is their relationship that is a great strength of the film.Next, what has to be mentioned is the score by James Horner. Very few times has a motion picture had a score that symbolized the sheer hopelessness and tragedy that is on screen. But here Horner has a perfect and somber piece of music that will bring tears to your eyes, especially when lives and love are lost.Also, the whole scope of the film is one of tragedy. It is a tragic love story, a tragic story of refugees trying to make a better life for themselves and have it all end abruptly with a giant piece of ice. It is a sad look at bureaucracy and wealth and how it can manipulate and control many things.But most importantly, this is a love story and an inspirational tearjerker. Rose and Jack fall fast and hard and it doesn't matter that they are from different worlds. Love sees no boundaries. If it is there, nothing can stop it. Not even death.Titanic is perfect in every sense. And as a guy, it is my duty not to cry in movies. I know how ridiculously old fashioned that sounds but it is true. We just aren't supposed to. But I left my testosterone at the door and when I finally let go, I found myself brought to tears as the scenes of children clinging for life in the frigid waters would be enough to bring the strongest man to tears. Cameron has manipulated us to perfection here and even if you find the romance to be embellished (which I don't) to watch this film and know that this happened, is a sad and disturbing reality. Few films have ever done this to me. Few have ever made me feel such a connection to the characters. Titanic does, and by the end of the film, you feel like you know the people of Titanic like they were your long lost relatives. And one final note: I can't understand how anyone could not enjoy the film, that's just me. But I know that what moves some does nothing for others. But the backlash towards this film is not necessary. Not every film has to be Ramboesque. Not every film has to be filled with explosions. I am not opposed to those films, I actually love many of them, but I am also prone to well written stories, whether they are love stories or not. Those who criticize this film need to realize that there is a market for this. The gross for this film and the demographics it appealed to confirm that.As for the comment made earlier about those of us that enjoyed it being teens and have never seen a film before 1990, well I am 27, my brother is 24, my mom is 50 something and my grandmother is in her 80's. And we all loved it. So keep that in mind. And a film does not gross 2 BILLION dollars by having only teens see it.This is as good as a film gets!One final note. The SE DVD finally came out and it was worth the wait. The transfer is beautiful and if you are like me and love DVD's so you can access the special features, then this disc is for you. The commentary alone by Cameron makes the disc worth spending your money on. Cameron doesn't do a lot of commentaries, but the ones he does are perhaps the most insightful commentaries out there. Titanic, he outdoes himself. I really recommend everyone who loves this film to get the SE DVD and just sti back for 3 hours and listen to what he has to say.",10,4,8,12 August 1999
Rocky III," one of the most entertaining films ever made
","The Rocky films are excellent.  And as much as I like the drama of the first two I have to admit that I love the sheer exhiliration of part 3 and 4.  I love this film.Mr. T. is a bad-ass villain.  When you move on from the original story and take away all that Apollo Creed was to Rocky, you have to present the audience with more danger than  the other films had.  And early on you learn to hate Clubber Lang simply for the fact that he wants to take away what Rocky has.  If you can create hatred for a character even though he is not a bad man, that is good writing.  Clubber Lang is the embodiment of hate even though what he represents is will, determination, an insatiable desire for fame and greatness and to win the heavyweight boxing title.  How do you hate a character like that?  Well for one, you make him grunt and spit his words out like venom.  You make him snarl and use words like 'sucka' and phrases like ' pity the foo'.  And you have to give Mr. T. credit for portraying the role as well as he did.Rocky III is as high on the entertainment scale as you can go and the only film that supercedes it in terms of wanting the underdog to win at all costs, is Rocky IV.  This is a great film!",9,0,1,16 August 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," One mind blowing sequel!!
","THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!There is no way to sum up this film in one sentence or less. Even one paragraph or less is futile because there is so much happening. This is a review that is going to be filled with spoilers so if you have not seen the film and do not want to know anything about it, please stop right here. Having said that, I'm not even sure if the spoilers given in this review are really truly spoilers because you have to see the film to even have a modicum of understanding of what is being talked about.
Matrix Reloaded takes place perhaps 6 months after The Matrix ended. Neo is now basically Superman and Morpheus is quite sure that the war is going to end shortly, it has been prophecized that way. But there are more questions than answers in this film and that is perhaps what is making everyone so angry. When you have a film that offers you a cornucopia of a story and a myriad of possibilities, this is what you are going to get. Yes it is confusing and yes it doesn't end in the most opportune time. But that is by design and if you pay enough attention to the film, you will realize that it couldn't get any better than it is. Let me explain. The plot of the film centers around the usual suspects and their fight to save Zion, the last human city. Neo is waiting to hear from the Oracle about what he should do next and Morpheus is waiting for Neo to tell him what he knows. Zion is preparing for battle with the machines and then there is agent Smith, who is no longer an agent, but a rogue program and one that has no allegiance. He wants power and nothing but power and will do anything and everything to get it. He is not an agent and he is not with the resistance. He stands alone. And somehow he has managed to copy himself and get into the real world. There is much more to Agent Smith than meets the eye and I am sure that his fate and his purpose will be summed up in Revolutions. All you need to know here is that he is not quite as deadly as he was in the first one but in some sense, he is more deadly than ever before.
What Reloaded does marvelously is tell a story and then flips it around and confuses you every chance it gets. I know that does not necessarily sound like a recipe for entertainment but if you give it a chance and let it all sink in, it may not all make sense but it begins to come together.
MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT!!!!!!! The most important part of the film is when Neo meets the 'architect.' The architect is the man responsible for the creation of the Matrix and he is also the man responsible for simultaneously confusing the hell out of us and enlightening us. Everything he says is meaningful and concurrently mind blowing. It really will take you two or three viewings to understand what he is saying and if you want some help with this passage, my recommendation is chat with other Matrix fans, they may have some of the answers.
Reloaded on it's own is a great film, but when you watch it coupled with The Matrix and then anticipate what may happen in Revolutions, you realize that not only is this a pedantic, intelligent film, but it's beauty is all in the story. And the crux of this film and of the ideologies behind it is that we are all struggling to stay alive. We are all better people when we love and that love will either save us or destroy us if used in the wrong way. There are of course many subliminal overtones about religon and sects of religion like Catholicism, Budhism and even Taoism but love is the universal emotion that sees no race, religion or sect. It is the all powerful emotion that encompasses everyone and everything and it is love that will save or destroy the people of Zion. Neo and all of his unearthly powers is nothing if not for his love for Trinity and for her love for him. It is not just another scene in the film when beautiful women want or need to feel that love that eminates from Trinity and Neo, it means something. Everybody needs love and for some it is their doom and others it is their salvation.
Reloaded does have some amazing fight scenes and some that look too much like a video game. I will agree that the Wachowski's tried to do too much but I would much rather a film and those behind it try to push the envelope than sit back rehash what has already been done. Having said that, if you go into Reloaded just for the fighting and SPFX, you will be pleased. If however you are intrigued by the philosophy and ideology of The Matrix, then you will be blown away. This is a film that has enough story for two stories and that is why there is another sequel due out in November.
Matrix Reloaded is an amazing film and one that gets better with each trip to the cinema. I enjoyed it immensely the first time I saw it but after subsequent viewings, I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing like it. This is the best that summer has to offer and when you are finished watching this film, go back home and enjoy The Matrix. You just may have it all figured out without even realizing it. And finally, this film, this experience is about choice. Everyone has that ability to make a choice. Or so it seems. In Reloaded, choice is what will win them this war or it will be their undoing. See for yourself.
9.5 out of 10- The best film of the year thus far and a true cinematic experience. November 7th cannot come soon enough! _________________ All of our questions will be answered on Nov. 5th 2003! Prepare for the Revolution!!!",9,0,0,25 May 2003
The Departed," Oh what a tangled web we weave.
","Martin Scorcese might be the only man in Hollywood who really doesn't have a misfire. I really can't think of any films he has done that weren't creative, ambitious, well acted and intriguing. With the exception of maybe Spielberg, there is no one his equal. This is just my opinion of course, but when you can say that you have done Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Aviator and now the Departed, who can really disagree? If it wasn't for the sheer perfection of Goodfellas, I think this would be his best film. The performances, the script and of course the direction are perfection personified. I think this is the best film of the year and this should finally be Scrocese's year to take best director.The Departed has Matt Damon playing Colin Sullivan, a young Irish boy who grows up in a Boston neighbourhood that is 'run' by the local Irish mob. One day while eating at the local diner, he meets Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, and like a young Henry Hill in Goodfellas, he begins to do some work for the man. We then skip ahead perhaps 20 years later and now young Colin Sullivan is one of Frank's boys. He enters into police college where his intentions are to get into the police force to keep an eye on things for Frank.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan and he grew up in the mob's shadow. His father ran in those circles and so did his uncle Jackie. Both were respected men and Frank especially has a soft spot for both of them, who have since departed. Billy wants nothing to do with the life so he too enters into police college. Once he graduates, he is pretty much coerced into going under cover to infiltrate the mob. His background and connections are obviously of great value to the Boston police. The two men who recruit Billy are Dignam and Queenan, and they are played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, and again, in my opinion, they both give the best performances of their career. I know Sheen has been around forever, and he was amazing in films like Apocalyse Now, but he is just outstanding here. And then there is Wahlberg who really should win the best supporting actor this year. He is a scene stealer. He has scenes with every actor in the film and he is the best part of any scene he is in. In one scene, another cop , who just messed up an assignment, asks him who the hell he is. Wahlberg responds, 'I'm the guy doing his job, you must be the other guy!' He is flawless in the film.The strength of the film is the action no doubt, but the script by William Monahan is multi-layered, labyrinth of a film. It is complex, and rich in character. Every few minutes there is another twist revealed. People that you thought were 'good guys' or 'bad guys' get painted with a shade of gray. Scorcese has a wide palette to stroke the canvas with and here he is Picasso at work. I truly can't find a flaw in the film and the 151 minutes fly by. The denouement is both shocking by Hollywood standards and because it is, it is also refreshing. I don't know of another film that can end like this one did and still find a way to please it's audience.The Departed is a miracle really. It has one of the best casts of the year, it is directed by a Hollywood legend and it is flawless. If Marty doesn't win this year, then you have to subscribe to the conspiracy theory. Babel is a joke, Iwo Jima is a very good film but this has to be the year of the Marty. This is both similar yet different to any other film that Marty has done. It feels a little like Goodfellas, but at the same time, it carves out it's own niche. I also think this is one of the best casts put together, and it is a treat to watch them work under the master. ***One final note*** It's great to see Marty get his Oscar. A very worthy win for both the film and the director.10/10",10,4,8,19 February 2007
Psycho," The grand daddy of them all
","I love horror films. I have reviewed all the Fridays, all the Jaws', most of the Halloweens and a few of the Nightmares. Halloween and Jaws are, to me, the two best horror films ever made. And even though I don't think Psycho is on par with some of the best horror films ever to grace our screens, you have to give credit where credit is due. Psycho is a pioneer for horror films and it is because of Psycho that we have films like Halloween and Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and directors like Hooper and Carpenter and Craven. I was born 12 years after Psycho was made and I really didn't get into film until at least another 10 years after that, but I can tell you that Psycho must have shocked and revolutionized film. Could you imagine a film maker so bold as to tell theater owners that they are not to permit anyone into the theater after it starts? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill the main character half way through the film? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill someone so graphically in the shower? Sure you can imagine all that. It's 1999. This film is almost 40 years old. But imagine what it did to audiences in 1960. It must have shocked the hell out of everyone back then. Psycho is a film like no other.There have been films that have done it better than Psycho but none of them can say they were the first. Psycho is a great film and it is enjoyable, unlike other older films like Citizen Kane that are only listed as great because they were the first to do something but has nothing redeemable about it. Psycho is a creepy film and it gave birth to a genre and I am thankful for it because my favourite horror film has Psycho to thank for it's inspiration. Halloween uses the camera the same way Psycho did and Carpenter is a carbon copy of Hitchcock for this one film. The two films even share a common name and character, Sam Loomis. There really isn't anything else that I want to say about the film, there are more than 100 reviews in here and many of them are by people that know a hell a lot more about the film than I do, but I just wanted to say how thankful I am that a movie like Psycho came along and paved the way for future films like The Evil Dead and Last House On The Left and such. This may be the first twisted horror film of it's kind and that is worth mentioning.If you want to know how horror has revolutionized and evolved to the way it is today, you can look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant masterpiece, PSYCHO.",9,1,5,27 December 1999
Rosemary's Baby," A very scary film
","God and Satan make for great subjects for horror films.  The reason for that is because we know so little about either of them.  Sure we have what the Bible says, but that is all just theory.  If the Bible is real, I don't believe that God would truly tell us, one of his creations, how powerful he is and I certainly don't think he would tell us how powerful his arch enemy, Satan, is. So when we see movies about Michael Myers and Jason and Freddy, sometimes the later sequels try to explain their superiority with Satanic possession.  After all, what other reason would there be for these beings to be so evil?  That is what makes Rosemary's Baby so frightening.  The fear of the unknown.  To be possessed by the devil is scary, to be impregnated by the devil is dire.Mia Farrow is great in this film, Cassavettes is very good as well but it is Gordon that is the epitome of fear.  She hits every note perfectly and her smile gives me the creeps.  And say nothing of Polanski.  This film came out before TCM.  And it really shows his love of the camera because he uses it like it was his best friend here.  His filming of the dream sequence and the rape was as good as any scene filmed before the early 80's.  And this was a true crystal ball into how good Texas Chainsaw was going to be.Rosemary's Baby is what horror movies are all about.  It has great atmosphere, haunting lighting and a very spooky score.  And on one final side note, I think there is one movie character that comes to mind when I think of what the devil could have looked like as a man.  If you have never seen the film Angel Heart, check it out.  DeNiro's turn as Louise Cypher is priceless and he almost seems like it was him that was the one who was haunting everyone in Rosemary's Baby.A great film.  Much better than most 90's horror.",7,7,17,9 July 1999
Wedding Crashers," The funniest film of the year!
","THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!! There was a period during the late 80's to early 90's when there was a very tangible dry spell for horror films. Then Scream exploded onto the scene and horror films have enjoyed a very healthy recrudescence for the last ten years. I feel the same can be said for comedies. While there certainly have been some very funny ones in the last ten years ( Something About Mary, American Pie, Zoolander ) for the most part, everything feels like it is has been recycled ad nausea. But then you get something refreshing and original like The Wedding Crashers and it restores your faith in Hollywood.People say that there are eleven stories that Hollywood tells over and over again, in various forms of course with a few idiosyncrasies to give them an original feel. The Usual Suspects in the twelfth story and Wedding Crashers is the thirteenth. This is a romantic comedy for sure and it is rather silly in some areas, but if you want to just laugh out loud and have a lot of fun, then this is about as sure fire a hit that Hollywood has produced in quite sometime.What makes the film so enjoyable is the writing of course, but to pull it off, you need the right cast. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson and a surprisingly complete performance by Rachael McAdams make this film a treat and a hoot to experience.I have to admit that part of my zeal for the film has to do with the fact that Vince Vaughn's character, Jeremy Grey, is an extension of his character Trent Walker from Swingers. Vaughn made a name for himself in the indie hit of 1996 as the motor mouthed, quick thinking, loyal best friend of Mike Peters. His performance as the eccentric playboy is what put him on the Hollywood radar and it was his performance in Swingers that got him a role in Jurassic Park II. Jeremy is Trent all grows up. It's what he would have become. I'm sure this was by design and it works to perfection. This is Vaughn's movie. Owen Wilson is very nice as well and he gets top billing and the bigger paycheck, but make no mistake about it, this is Vaughn's vehicle start to finish.As funny as the film is and as sublime a performance as Vaughn gives, the other part of the film that works to perfection is the romance between Wilson and McAdams. There is a sweetness to it and that works because McAdams is so fresh and exciting to watch on screen. She has a definitive presence and when she is on screen you care about her. She was like that in The Notebook and also in Red Eye. She is one of the bright new stars of Hollywood and I look forward to anything else she does.Wedding Crashers is about as laugh out loud funny as you are going to get and even though it might go on for about 10 minutes too long, those 10 minutes have the cameo that we were all waiting for and that justifies the length.In the last few years, films like Zoolander, Meet The Parents, Old School, Anchorman, Starsky and Hutch and Dodgeball have pretty much been the funniest films of their respective years. Wedding Crashers adds to the Frat Pack's legacy and doe not disappoint.9/10",9,2,3,15 September 2005
There Will Be Blood," There will be boredom
","I have seen some very bad films, most of them horror or 'movies' that are spoofs of other films. I thought Meet The Spartans was the worst movie I have ever seen, and even though it is, because it is not a film in a true sense of the word, I have to go ahead and say that There Will Be Blood is perhaps worse than it. Because this is a real film, with a real theme and real actors and a director and so on, TWBB should be in the category of one of the worst films ever made.Reading through some of the glowing reviews here, you'd think this film reinvented the wheel. They praise the acting, the directing, the cinematography. While I'll agree that Daniel Day Lewis was quite good, it does not make up for the rest of this turd. I'm still waiting for something to happen. I know there was something about a bowling alley and milkshakes, but other than that, I'm still waiting for blood. Keep waiting.Literally, I could not wait for this to end. My wife and I were looking at one another in the theater throwing our hands up in amazement every 30 minutes or so (2 1/2 hr. film) when the film's plot still hadn't gone anywhere. There's some stabs at religion, oil tycoons and imposters, but when you keep waiting for the plot to pick up and looking at your watch every few minutes, the film is in trouble.All this film can boast about is Daniel Day Lewis. He is a fantastic actor, but his over acted and misguided interpretation of this maniac is good but not enough to carry the film. This has to be one of the most misleading titles in the history of film. I remember snickers when sitting through the trailer of Blood For Chocolate. What the hell did that mean? But at least There Will Be Blood whets your appetite. I'm here for blood. Where is it? A drop...anything? Sadly, no.I sometimes think the masses are sheep. How else do explain the insane IMDb rating for this film. Powerful? Brilliant? Classic? This sounds like something to describe Titanic or the Godfather, not this charlatan of a film. If you suffer from insomnia, watch this, it is a definite cure.3/10",3,5,10,11 September 2008
Man on Fire," A powerful film with powerful performances
","This comment does contain spoilers!!There are few actors that have an intangible to them. That innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma, panache and swagger. It's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great. I think George Clooney has it and so does Jack Nicholson. You can look at Clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good-bye to Andy Garcia in Ocean's 11 when they just utter each other's name disdainfully. 'Terry.' 'Danny.' You can pick any number of Jack's performances dating as far back as Five Easy Pieces in the diner to A Few Good Men and his court room interrogation scene. These guys just have it. You can add Denzel Washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does. If you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in The Siege to his impressive tribute to Malcolm X in Spike Lee's film of the same name, you can see that there is no finer an actor working today. I don't mention all of this to insinuate that Man On Fire is perfect just because of Denzel's work, but he is definitely the cog of the production. I was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw, emotional and incendiary all at the same time.Washington plays Creasy a former spy or CIA agent or one of those covert government operatives. He has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led. He has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man. His friend and perhaps mentor, played very reservedly by Christopher Walken, is living in Mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich. Apparently the kidnapping business in Mexico is so vibrant that these paid former S.E.A.L.s and such can do very well while providing a needed service. Creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty. Marc Anthony is fine as Samuel, Radha Mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife Lisa and Dakota Fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as Pita. I don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of Pita is nothing short of Oscar worthy. The film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between Pita and Creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role, perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly. But Fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role.It is the relationship between Pita and Creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema. Together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them. Tony Scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better. I am interested to see how his next film, Domino, turns out. I think Scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one, his name will surely be elevated to icon status.The story has Creasy really taking to Pita, and vis-ca versa. There is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although Pita loves her dad, he is not around much. He is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family. Soon, Creasy is taking Pita to her swimming competition. He is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear 'Creasy'. It's not just a friendship between them, it is more of a kinship, and a deep parental love seems to be present. The film changes gears when Pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and Creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her. This is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion. And this is where Denzel becomes a tour de force. Like I said earlier, I have seen Denzel give some outstanding performances in films like Crimson Tide and Training Day, but never have I seen him like this. He is a man possessed and with the possibility of Pita being dead, he becomes a literal man on fire. It rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance. Denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for Pita's violation. This all vigilante justice as the Mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind. Also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance. I have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily. They inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die. But not in this film. Writer Brian Helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful. The perpetrators here feel Creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes. There is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice. He needs information and someone loses a finger. He wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things. There is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film.Man on Fire is one the five best films of 2004. Now that it is out on DVD, my recommendation is to get the SE. It is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks. 10/10",10,3,7,19 September 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The second best movie of 1975
","Cuckoo's Nest is a great film, there is no doubt about that.  But unfortunately this film swept everything that year at the Oscars and Jaws was left out in the cold.  Now Jaws is the film that I consider to be the best film ever made and because of it I used to have a personal chip on my shoulder about Cuckoo's Nest.  I could never understand why a film like this one was so much more heralded than Jaws.  But now that I am little older I can appreciate the fact that the Academy is really quite political and there was no way that a 27 year old director was going to beat out Milos Forman for best picture and best director.  But that aside, I have to admit that ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one fantastic film.  I just had to get that out of the way first.Jack gives, what I think, is his best performance ever in film.  Here he a driven, tenacious and determined man.  I can only think of two other characters in film that exhibit qualities like Randal McMurphy, and those are Rambo and Indy.  But seeing as McMurphy is more real and more believable, that honour has to go to him.  Cuckoo's Nest is an inspirational film and if there is one line that will always be remembered in this film, it is the line, ' Well at least I tried, ***dammit!'  That is the epitome of what the film and the character are all about.  Sure there is the underlying theme of the common man against evil society but I like it better to think of it just as a film about one mans struggle to rise to the occassion and conquer some very stacked odds.What is also great about the film is to see some actors early in their career.  Brad Dourif, Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd all have roles in the film and they have all gone on to have extensive careers in the Game. 
There really isn't much more I can add to what Cuckoo's Nest is all about, I'm sure you have seen and read it all before.  All I can say is that is an inspirational movie about not giving up and standing up for what you believe is right.  And it is done extremely well.  It is not as good as Jaws ( nothing is ) but that is not a fault of it's own.  Milos Forman is no Steven Spielberg but that is another story and this film...... ah hell, why don't we just leave it at that.  It's a great film and Jack is at his best. That's all you really need to know.9 out of 10",8,1,3,22 May 2000
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorcese's best film
","This is not just the best film of the year, it is unquestionably one of the best films I've ever seen. Every scene, every shot, every performance is about as good as it gets. Standing out of course are DiCaprio and Hill. Hill transforms himself in this film but DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career. He jumped head first into the role and there isn't one moment that you are watching this where you feel like you are watching Leonardo DiCaprio. What you are seeing on screen is Jordan Belfort. He is brave, brilliant and fearless. Snort coke off a hookers breasts? No problem. Blow coke into a hookers ass? He does that. Give rousing speeches that compel me, the viewer, want to work for him? It's in here. Dance, get naked, party, crawl around like a baby, cry, show vulnerability, it's all in here. It is one of, if not the best performance in a film I have ever seen. DiCaprio is good in everything I have seen him in, but he has taken the extra step here. He knows Jordan Belfort. There is a scene where he crawls around on the floor for 10 minutes in a drug induced paralysis and it will go down as not only the scene of the year (along with the ejaculation discussion in This is the End) but one of the most messed up but brilliant scenes in film history. When DiCaprio first came on the scene, his talent was easily seen. Then he did Titanic and became a heart-throb to teenage girls. But he's never just let loose like this. Scorcese did it with Pesci and Liotta in Goodfellas and he has done in Wolf with DiCaprio. He holds nothing back and just goes for it all. DiCaprio worked on getting this made for 6 years. It has paid off handsomely for him. You can tell he dove into this role and just let whatever inhibitions he had, check themselves at the door. Once the cameras rolled and he had to do all the crazy stuff that was required of him, he just did it. The film is memorable for many reasons but none more than his fearless performance. In my opinion, this is one of the best performances in any film.This is the Goodfellas of the 2000's. It's created from the same palette that made Goodfellas. It's long but never boring and it's so entertaining and funny and exhilarating that I hope the 4 hour cut we have heard about does find it's way to the DVD. I'm not sure yet if this is better than Scorcese's opus, Goodfellas, but it is certainly on par with it. I don't know if the academy is going to be progressive enough to reward this film with what it deserves, but in time, regardless of the awards, it will be remembered as one of the great films in the annals of film history. It has to be said that the movie makes you kind of envious of the lifestyle these guys lead. Their life is a party. They make 22 million dollars in three hours and then spend the next 12 hours snorting coke, swallowing quaaludes, banging the hottest strippers and hookers around, flying in private jets and spending 2 million dollars on bachelor parties. Their life is a fairy tale and it makes you a little sad that after you leave the theatre you have to go back to your 9-5 existence. This world is full of excess and debauchery but damn it looks like fun.IMO, this is the best film of the year and it has the best performance of the year and it's not even close. I understand this will not be a film for everyone's liking but it is undeniably hilarious, expertly directed, crisply edited and beautifully acted. And Margot Robbie is insanely sexy, insanely sexy.10/10",10,4,16,27 December 2013
Scream 2," Furthers the series nicely, but.....
","Warning, may contain some spoilers.The problem with most horror films now a days is that they are vacuous. There is a notion from a great many aspiring film makers that they can break into the business the same way that perhaps Carpenter and Moustapha Akkad did.  Carpenter, as we all know, made the legendary Halloween and Moustapha Akkad financed it for him.  That film broke all sorts of barriers and not only was it a good film, but it scared people.  In the early 90's, you had an apathetic audience without a modicum of desire to see horror films.  The genre had run its course with so many ersatz so called horror films, that no one gave any credit to even the good ones that were released.  But that all changed in 1996 when Wes Craven was smart enough to take a brilliant script by Kevin Williamson and turn it into something that all horror fans and movie fans could appreciate.  Scream became something of a legend.  This was a film that ostracized all of the banal efforts from the last decade and justified the horror film once again.  This was a film that respected the greats from the past like Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th.  It gave a rebirth to a stale genre and made it fresh.  I, for one was thrilled with Scream and even though there are now a slew of inferior horror films launched into mainstream, every once in a while you get films like Blair Witch, Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes and Final Destination.  These films make it easier to stomach all of the Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summers and so on.  Scream 2 carries on the story from Scream and it sets us up for the final installment.Is Scream 2 any good?  Your damn right it is.  But it is not quite as good as Scream is.  But that is okay.  Halloween 2 was great but not as good as the first and the only Nightmare that was nearly as good as the first was the last one.  So as sequels go, this is a very fine one. 
Sydney is now attending college with her pal Randy.  She is hoping that all the fuss from her Woodsborough days are over but there is now a film being released that is based on the murders ( and in a great tongue in cheek moment, Tori Spelling plays Sid in the movie Stab ).  So there is now media attention once again hurled her way.  Then at a local screening of Stab, two of Sid's college cronies are murdered thus lending credibility to theory that it is starting all over again.  Soon Gale shows up and then Dewey. Gale shows her face for the media attention and Dewey is there to protect her.  So we now have all the major principals in place. 
Soon, people begin to die and we now have a full fledged psychopathic killer on the loose again with an ominous sounding voice.  As Randy alludes to almost coyly, too coyly for it not to mean something, Scream 2 doesn't really solve anything.  Sure it is revealed that the killer happens to be Billy Loomis' mom and she has her own reasons for wanting Sid dead, but just as in Empire Strikes Back, there is always room for more story.  The ending of this film offered a conclusion, but there just seems to be something still lurking beneath the surface.  And this is where I have my theories. Bear with me here.Randy says that Empire wasn't really a true sequel, that it was a planned part of a trilogy and that is obviously true of Scream.  Kevin Williamson may have started out with just a really neat idea about a horror film that parodies other horror films, but by the time he reached the second film, he knew there was enough material here to make three films, and in my mind, it will be four.  You see, I don't think the killer is really caught.  In Scream it was Stu and Billy, in this one it is Mrs. Loomis and in the third one it is, anyway, you get the picture.  But at the end of Scream 3, there is that feel to it that tells you that something further could happen.  Even at the end of Friday the 13th, the final chapter, Tommy's eyes are all bugged out and the producers were basically telling you that this was not the last installment.  And in Scream 2, I think there are real clues as to who the real killer is.  When Randy is killed, we almost all but forget his conversation with Dewey about them both possibly being suspects.  Because with him gone, he is obviously not a suspect anymore, but why not Dewey?  Especially in this film, he is always around when the killings happen, and as he said about Derek when he was slashed on the wrist, he himself always just happens to get hurt but not fatally.  There are also shots of him in this film and in the first one wearing the same type of boots that the killer does.  To me, just like in Star Wars, there has to be a fourth one.  The script is all but jumping out at us and how many films have just stopped after making 4 films? Scream could make history by doing so.  There are just way to many possibilities and none of the doors have been shut on Dewey being the killer.  Anyway, back to the film itself.  It does a nice job of furthering the story and Randy and his film class have some nice moments when they discuss movies and their sequels.  This film also does a nice job of famous cameos.  Joshua Jackson, Rebecca Gayhart, Portia DeRossi and Sara Michelle Gellar have small but fun roles in the film.  Actually the cast is well assembled in the film.Overall, Scream 2 is not quite as good as Scream but that would have been impossible anyway.  It is however, a good film and it does plenty to set up Scream 3.  This is a good second installment to the famous trilogy. 
8 out 10- Looking forward to the 4th one, if they can get the principals to come back....",7,0,0,13 November 2000
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," I killed a man with a trident!
","Will Ferrel has one of the strangest brands of comedy. He isn't traditionally funny the way Eddie Murphy or Russell Peters are. I don't know if he would be good in stand up. But put him in a movie where he can be self deprecating, self loathsome, and just flat out bombastic, and there is no equal. Anchorman--The Legend of Ron Burgundy is his Beveryly Hills Cop, his Something About Mary, his Stripes. You won't find a funnier, albeit stupid, but nonetheless funny film anywhere. And the thing about this film is that the gags and the jokes just never stop. They are perpetually launched at us, every frame, every sentence, every word is meant to make us laugh. I haven't laughed this much in a film since perhaps Zoolander.Will Ferrel plays Ron Burgundy, one of the dimmest, most arrogant people in the business. He actually thinks he is important, that he matters. And he has good reason to think that as he is treated like a celebrity everywhere he goes. Women fall over him, men want to hang out with him and even his co-workers lionize him. He is part of a news team that works for a San Diego news station. The other members of his team are sports caster Champ Kind, who thinks he's even more of a ladies man than Burgundy does. Paul Rudd plays Brian Fantana and he is perhaps the normal one on the team but does enough zany things to prove he belongs. And the diamond in the rough, and perhaps one of the funniest characters ever created on film is played by a pre 40 Year Old Virgin Steve Carrel. He plays Brick Tamland and to say he is a moron is an insult to the intelligence of morons. He follows the crew, imitates them, and acts completely stupid almost all of the time. To quote him to prove how funny his character is, for anyone who has not seen the film, would seem futile. But for those of is who have seen it, who can forget his 'I love lamp'...or 'Loud noises'...or 'I killed a man with a trident'. He makes Zoolander look like Socrates.The plot? Well the male dominated business of T.V. news is about to get a shock when Veronica Corningstone, a very sexy female broadcaster gets to become a co-host with Burgundy. The plot is fine, but the movie is really just one skit after another and I'm wondering if any of this movie was really scripted. To me, the way it looks, the director just gave the cast Carte Blanche to do what they want. And it works. Take for example perhaps the funniest scene ever filmed.The news team meets up in a back alley with other news teams, all cameos by the Frat pack, and they rumble, in the style of West Side Story. But in this segment, people get set on fire, arms are chopped off, tridents appear and so on. The hilarity just never ends.Anchorman might not be for everyone. I hated it the first time I saw it. But it does grow on you and Steve Carrell is just hysterical. I highly recommend this film and especially the DVD with all the extras. You have to see Ron Burgundy's auditon for ESPN. Classic!! Also, watch for the cameo by Jack Black.8.5/10",9,0,2,18 April 2007
The Green Mile," One of Stephen King's best adapted books
","The Green Mile joins Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, Stand By Me, Misery, The Dead Zone and (in my opinion) TV movies The Langoliers and The Stand as one of the best adaptations by King.  And taking a look at some of the directors that made these films, you will see a pattern.  Now I have no idea who directed The Langoliers or The Stand but I can certainly tell you that the likes of David Cronenberg, Rob Reiner, Stanley Kubrick and Frank Darabont are responsible for the other films mentioned above.  It takes good directors that have great vision to bring to life Stephen King's world.  And now with Darabont directing this one you can add it to the list of superbly adapted King tales.  As a book, the Green Mile was vivid and touching and awe inspiring, and to be honest, I wasn't sure how the film was going to turn out when I heard it was going to be made.  Even though I have great admiration for Tom Hanks and Darabont, that alone did not make me overly enthusiastic about the movie. But to be completely honest, when I found out that John Coffey was going to be played by Michael Duncan Clarke, my mood soon changed.  Clarke is one of only two men that I could envision playing the pivitol role in the film ( the other being Tiny Lister ).  But Clarke takes the role of John Coffey and breathes life into him.  He gives him an identity and he is so likable and believable that the movie works because of him.  His interpretation of John Coffey is exactly like I imagined him when I read the Green Mile some six months ago.  The rest of the cast is great but it is Clarke that shines the brightest and that is quite the compliment seeing as some of his co-stars are Tom Hanks, the under rated David Morse and even bit roles by Graham Greene, Gary Sinise and a hilarious cameo by Harry Dean Stanton as Old Toot Toot are great performances.  It is actually quite intersting to see Harry Dean Stanton in here because one of the death row guards is named Dean Stanton, I wonder if King wrote that character in homage of the great actor?There is so much to like about The Green Mile and it is a film that should be seen by everyone at least once.  It is entertaining, comedic and inspiring all rolled into one film.  It is one of the best films of the year but again, as I have said in every positive film review so far this year after American Beauty came out, it is good but it pales in comparison to AB. It will probably garner some well deserved Oscar nominations but I don't think it should win any of them except for best supporting actor, and even then I think Clarke will be in tough against Wes Bentley, if he gets a nod.The Green Mile is a great experience and it is not only a great film from an artistic standpoint but on an entertainment level it is terrific as well.8 1/2 out of 10",9,0,1,27 December 1999
Jaws," The best film ever made.
","I saw this film when I was about 8 years old.  And what I remember most about it, is thinking that I had found the most frightening film that I had ever seen.  When I asked my parents if there really was a Jaws and they reassured me there wasn't, I still thought they were lying ( and they were, he does exist, I'm sure of it ).  To this day, almost 20 years later, I am still frightened to go swimming.  I have been to the Caribbean twice in my life.  Once to the Bahamas with my high school graduating class and once to Acapulco for March Break.  Neither time did my classmates or friends venture into the water because of me.  ' Did yo know that most shark attacks happen in three feet of water of less? ' I asked them.  Needless to say the hotel pool was well utilized on both trips.Jaws is perfect on every level of film making.  It has incredibly well developed characters, so well that we feel their fears and their bravado when we are supposed to.  The direction is some of the best I have ever seen.  We are but marionettes in Spielberg's fingers.  When he wants us to feel, he pulls our strings and masterfully we feel scared or horrified or even amused.  A perfect example of this is the killing of the Kinter kid, the second death of the movie.The scene starts off shortly after Chrissie Watkins is killed.  There are people playing on the beach and in the water.  Brody ( the police chief ) is sitting tentatively watching things intently.  He hears screams from a young girl.  But of course they are playful screams.  Then we see a man playing fetch the stick with his dog.  Finally we meet Alex Kinter.  He goes out on his raft into the water.  Then we see the shots from under water.  It's as if something is approaching.  We're really not sure if we are being teased here or not.  But then we see a stick floating in the water and the man calling out for his dog.  But he is not there.  Then we see more kids splashing and then we cut to a shot approaching the Kinter boy on his raft from under water.  And the music.  And then...... well, we all know what happens.  Now that is a director masterfully manipulating us.Jaws stands up to and surpasses any film these days that is considered brilliant and it surpasses anything that came before it.  This film should have cleaned up at the Oscars.  After all, what film is remembered more? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ( a very good film ) or Jaws?  The answer is quite clear.",10,40,69,26 June 1999
Hancock," Hilarious, kick-ass and awesome
","Here's an original superhero movie not based on a comic book, previous material or a remake of another superhero movie. This is just the story of a man with super strength, flying capabilities and seemingly invincibility. Yet there's a twist. He is not disguised, he doesn't pretend to be something that he's not and as much as he wants to help out, his drunken, unkind ways of dealing with the public cause people to dislike him instead of lionize him. In short, Hancock is the antithesis to every other superhero out there. This is part of the charm of the film.Admittedly, there is two very distinct parts of the film. You have the comedic first half and the dramatic second half. I did like the first half better but the second half is almost as good and Smith and Theron do some of their best work ever.I think the reason this is getting negative feedback is because the first half is so good that when it changes gears, people don't expect it to do a paradigm switch so quickly. But there was only so much you could do in the first 45 minutes and they do it beautifully. After all, one of the complaints of Superman is that he is Superman. What can really harm him? Where as Batman or Spiderman, at least they are fallible. So in Hancock, we need to believe there is a kryptonite for him, or else he too would end up being an impervious to pain, two dimensional character. In the film, not only is his krytonite introduced beautifully, but he is also an alcoholic and an unpleasant person. I don't think anyone ever thought of doing a superhero like this. I don't think you can count Superman III, seeing as it is a sequel. This is an original idea, and it is one that is executed with passion and fun.The best parts of the film are watching Hancock trying to reform himself. He has to remind himself to tell mortals that they are doing a good job. The first scene after he is out of prison is breathtaking. It has comedic brilliance, action and it is written perfectly. Not only is he here to save the bank from being blown up and robbed, he is here to repair his public persona. There is a real confliction with him and he is doing his best (like Terminator in T-2) to help out, but not hurt anyone in the process.I enjoyed Hancock immensely and I hope this is the beginning of a new franchise for Simth.9/10",9,1,4,7 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas' masterpiece!!
","Star Wars Return of the Sith is one of those rare movies that is not just a film, it's not just a story, but it is an experience. It's sometimes hard to put into words what these films mean to me and many others. They represent my youth, my passion and everything that I love about film. They take you away to that galaxy far far away, a long time ago. This is nothing short of perfection and not just in ways that are visual, or emotional. This is the epitome of perfection in every sense of the word. It ties everything together, it furthers the story and bridges the gap between the old trilogy and the new one. As Star Wars fans, we have always wanted to know what it is that turned Anakin Skywalker from the promising young jedi into the most evil man in the universe. You meet this cloaked figure in black in ANH and are right away struck by his anger, his power and his pain. There must be pain behind someone who can destroy planets, kill at will and torture for convenience. Where did that pain come from, and what drives him to his insatiable desire for absolute power? All of your questions are answered here. You can see once and for all that Vader/Anakin is one of the most tortured souls in the universe. Knowing that you are powerful, knowing that you have a gift that some just can't appreciate and many don't trust, that can be painful. Seeing what you can see, knowing things ahead of time but yet are seemingly powerless to do anything about it. Darth Vader was born out of pain. He was born not out of a lust for power, but out of the need to save the one he loved. Darth Vader's power comes from hatred, sure, but the genesis of his transformation to the dark side was sealed when he wanted to save the one he loved.The acting is very well done, especially from Hayden Christnesen and Ian McDiarmid. The dialogue in the film, perhaps in the love scenes is still a little sappy, bit it is just right enough to understand Anakin's descent into the darkside. And this is where the film exceeds all expectations. The path to the dark side is a treacherous one, and Anakin tries to fight it, valiantly, but comes up very short. To say he is seduced by the dark side is like saying Rambo was a good soldier, it is an understatement. And his descent ion into the dark corner known as the dark side of the force is final, it is unfortunate and it is frightening. You can see him fighting it every step of the way, but like Luke in Jedi, wanting to strike down the emperor with his sabre, it is futile. There is just too much that the dark side can offer him, too much that the dark side can trust him with and too much that the dark side can become. Being a jedi is altruistic, being a Sith Lord is all about what is best for you, and only you. Anakin's slow but perpetual descent to the dark side in SITH is the best part of the film. He resists it for as long as he can until one fateful moment when he helps Palpatine out of certain death. And once he crossed that shady area, once he killed without a purpose other than what serves him and only him, he was lost and had now turned to the dark side. The rest was inevitable.Which brings us to the last half hour of the film. I can't describe the intensity and the brilliance of the film. . By this time Anakin has now fully turned. He is not the master just yet, but he is clearly a better raw jedi than Obi Wan, but as Darth says to Luke in Empire, he is not a jedi yet. Their epic battle amongst flowing lava and red rocks is beautiful to see. The tragedy of watching it is another thing. And then to finally see what happens to Anakin is tragic. More intense yet, is to see how Obi Wan handles it, is actually quite shocking. This is one of the most emotional times in the film. Anakin did it to himself, but to see his fate, no matter how evil of a person you are, you wouldn't wish that on anyone.To put together three or four story lines at once and captivate the audience at every turn is not easy. But not only does Lucas do it, he exceeds. If there was one word to describe this film, it is masterpiece. Empire is still the best of the series, but to rank the others, you'd have to put this one second...only slightly ahead of ANH. This is everything I had hoped for and more. It bridges the gap and makes you want to go home and watch ANH which I did when I arrived home from the theater. For all of the SW nuts that were disappointed with the two new ones, this is George's vindication. This is his opera, this is his opus to SW fans. He has done it, and he has exceeded far beyond my expectations. To see the six films in the chronological order is a thing of beauty. To remember them for what they stand for is enlightening. SW has changed my life, and even if it doesn't quite do that for some, it is at least is as entertaining as they come.10/10",10,3,17,19 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Stephen King's best adapted movie
","Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",10,749,904,13 July 1999
Scream," And a genre is born.
","' I want you to go down to the McKenzies house and call the police. ' Laurie Strode, from Halloween, Casey's mom, from Scream.As I have said in my various reviews of horror flicks, I grew up loving horror movies. Everything from the great ones like Halloween, Nightmare 1 and the early Fridays, to even the stupid quirky flicks like The Prey or Sleepaway Camp. There is just something sinister yet fun about an unseen force that tries to kill you for no apparent reason except that you are on his turf. I think Kevin Williamson watched the same films as I did and similarly appreciated them. Because what he has done here is write a film that is an homage to all the great horror films of the last 25 years. He treats all of us fans to great memories of films of years past and he assumes that he has an intelligent audience. There are so many horror movie references here that even I don't quite get all of them, and believe me I have seen a lot of horror films. But not only is the script entertaining, funny and witty, the film is scary. Not as scary as some of the films that it tries to pay homage to, but that's okay. Because you will have so much fun trying to pick out references to your faves that the scare factor is just a bonus. One of the most brilliant parts in the movie is when Randy pauses Halloween and explains the rules of surviving a horror movie if you are a character in it. Not only is it funny, but it so honest and sharp that when you listen to what he says, you realize that he is so right. And that is one of the great pleasures of the film.I admire a film like this. It is not afraid to take chances and it tries to give all of us former teens that made the genre so popular in the 80's, something to enjoy. I'm not saying that if you are under the age of 25 you cannot enjoy this, but believe me you can enjoy it a whole lot more if you are about 25-30. Because it is us who rented those films way back when. And to understand the references and the homages to films like Halloween ( 1978 ) the original Nightmare (84), the Friday's (80-84) you have to appreciate the films for what they are. And what they were and what they did was entertain and scare the hell out of us 15 and 16 year olds. And to remember that feeling by watching this film is reward enough to me. But then to have the film be so well done is an added bonus.Wes Craven is the perfect director for this film. I wonder is Williamson ever pitched this to Cunningham or Miner or Carpenter before going to Craven? I guess I am glad that he didn't because I think Craven adds some nice touches to the film. The cast is also brilliant. We all know the major one's involved here but I want to call attention to Mathew Lilliard. His portrayal of Stu is so amazing. He honestly should of received a nomination for best supporting actor. He took his character and added his own twist to him. And because of his tiny idiosyncrasies, he adds so much to the film. A subtle use of the tongue, the facade of hurt just by one of his expressions, a triumphant thrust of the arms, his laugh. They are all forever imprinted in my head as a great character study.This film started a whole genre on it's own, made a name for Lilliard and most everyone else involved, revitalized Craven's career, made Williamson a millionaire, made horror movies popular again and gave me hours of viewing enjoyment. Not just from this one and its sequel, but it made me go back and watch all the older films that I liked so much.You should do the same. And try to rediscover what was so fun about horror movie from the 70's and 80's. I have figured it out on a personal level, but have you figured it out on your own level? That is what makes horror films so much fun. Because they mean something different to everyone. Actually that is what makes film in general so profound.",10,0,0,14 July 1999
Halloween," The personification of fear
","I have just recently been through a stage where I wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday's so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don't. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett, ' I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. ' That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn't. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn't. But it's astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won't let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don't know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven's final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?And just to follow up after seeing Zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.",10,382,452,28 July 1999
Vanilla Sky," Without a shadow of a doubt, the best film of 2001
","Warning: Does contain spoilers.Open Your EyesIf you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it.  You have to see this film.  I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film.  That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now.If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well.  His name was Mr. Krisak. To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on.  If we didn't like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it.  Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time.  This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds.  I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix.  Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak.  But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him.  But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real.  Show me how you can tell that you are real.  This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine.  Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real.  After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.'What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?'What if you were someone else's dream?  What a messed up question that is. This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers.  How possible could it seem back then?  But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream.Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas.  But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to.  In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.
Open your Eyes.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines.  He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them.  Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz.  David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship.  This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life.  And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. 
Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee.  Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends.  This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film.  Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again.  And that is ' the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter.'  He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.At David's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress.  This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another.  And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia.  To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another.  There is no hanky panky.  The next day, as David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials.That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception.  We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze.  There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life.  This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there.Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret.  Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze.  Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters.  And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through.  I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand.  To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film.  All of the ersatz so called 'Best Pictures of the year' have been good but nothing spectacular.  They lack substance.  A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven.  Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it.  I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it.  This is what film making is supposed to be like.  This is what a film is supposed to do to you.  It is supposed to make you feel something.  Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces.  This one isn't.10 out of 10  The best film of the year.  I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor.  Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame.  This is one film that should not be missed.  And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question.  Can you prove you are real?  Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement?  This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers.  And I'm sure that is just fine with him.Open Your Eyes",10,0,1,23 January 2002
Any Given Sunday," Get rid of the MTV editing and you have one of the best films of the year.
","Love or hate Oliver Stone for his beliefs and the way he films them ( Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the 4th of July, JFK, Nixon) you have to say one thing about the man; he is a brilliant artist/director.  What Oliver Stone sees, we see, what Oliver Stone feels, we can at least feel most of it.  JFK is one of the best films ever made and a lot of that has to be attributed to his work/vision.  It is a unique film and not just because of what it stands for but because how it was made.  There were certain scenes in that film where you couldn't tell what was 35 or 16mm filmstock and what was archived footage.  That authenticity, that care and devotion into that film made it ( in my opinion ) one of the 3 best films ever made ( Jaws and American Beauty sandwiching it on my list of best films ever).  While Any Given Sunday is not one of the best films ever made it is certainly one of the best that has come out this year.  Oliver Stone has done to professional football ( and perhaps all major North American sports ) what he did to politics and the government in JFK and Platoon.  He has dissected it and exposed it for what it really is.  As football fans, all we see is the gloss, the glamour, the spotlights, the charity devoted athletes, the replays, the larger than life personalities and great athleticism.  What we don't see, even though we know about it in dark corners is what Stone has shown us here, in this excellent film.I read a few articles about this film and one of them said that Stone spent five years researching this movie to get it right and be true to what he is saying.  And if you look at what and who is involved here and what is not involved here, then you have to believe that what he is saying has some merit to it.You have the participation of some of the games past greats like L.T. and Jim Brown and some of the games future greats like Ricky Williams that participated in the filming of the movie and they swear by what Stone has filmed.  They concur with the fact that corruption, drug abuse, womanizing, commercialism, greed and selfishness is just a euphanism for what football is all about.  Then you also have the non participation and non co-operation of the NFL when it came to using football names and even their logo.  To me that says that they don't want to be associated with this film because it is slanderous to what they want you to believe.  But look closely and listen even closer and everything that you see in here may be closer to the truth than what you thought.What Any Given Sunday has is a great cast and one hell of a lead.  Al Pacino could read the phonebook and make it interesting somehow.  His portrayal of Tony D'Amato is so compelling and so honest that I really felt as though I knew this man.  There are so many tiny moments of grace for him in this role but the best that I have seen him in quite sometime was when he gave one particular speech to his team just before their potential last game of the season.  He was trying to preach that you have to win as a team and lose as a team.  He was preaching team unity and telling everyone that it is time to get rid of individualism that exists in the locker room.  It is a speech that starts out humbly enough but steamrolls into what Oscars are made of. I wanted to suit up and play for him after that speech.  I suspect that Al Pacino will get an Oscar nomination for his role in The Insider but this is the film that he deserves it for.  I still don't think there is a better performance this year than Kevin Spacey in American Beauty but this is definitely a distant second.  In this film he is Tony D'Amato.The rest of the cast is also quite impressive and I have to say that casting Cameron Diaz in the second biggest role in the film was risky. But she shows that she is more than just a pretty face in Hollywood.  There were many scenes where she bantered with Pacino for pages and pages of script and she comes across beautifully.  Jamie Foxx is also excellent in the film. There is one small role that I wanted to mention because even though Lauren Holly has a brief appearance as Dennis Quaid's wife, she steals many scenes that she is in.  There is one particular scene where she tells Cap ( Quaid ) that he is not ready to retire, that he is the bleepin quarterback for the Miami Sharks and that she won't listen to this crap from him right now.  I seriously wanted to leap through the screen and slap her and the rest of the theater felt the same way.  Her character is just as selfish as any of the others in the film and she should be recognized for doing it so well.The one thing that is glaringly wrong with the film is some of the smashmouth editting.  There are times when the cuts are so fast and furious that you have a hard time seeing what is going on during the games.  This would have been better if the game was shown with more clarity and precision.  The MTV generation doesn't have to dictate editting techniques in an Oliver Stone film.  That is the only complaint that I have with the film but unfortunately it is a big one and it does detract from the overall aesthetic of it.  When the story is told and we are allowed to get involved with it completely then it is a great film.  However when it becomes a showcase for quick cuts to rock and roll music and the occasional gangsta rap, it becomes annoying.  I really wish the editting wasn't so dominant because the film would have been so much better.Any Given Sunday is a great film and it is one that should be seen by everyone that has a mild interest in sports.  There is much to be learned from it and most importantly it is one hell of an entertaining film.8 out of 10",8,0,0,26 December 1999
Mother!," A horrible piece of you know what
","So this is an allegory of the Bible? And this is the reason I'm supposed to sit through a film that makes no sense, has horrible characters and symbolism that is in your face ridiculous?UH NO.I'm not sure why a film with nothing but symbolism is supposed to be something I enjoy. I hated this film. Hated it with all of my being. If you enjoy films that just want you to figure out WTF the director means by having an army of idiots destroy a house and then eat a baby, then by all means, see this film. It'll make you feel really smart for figuring it all out. As for me, this is not how I want to spend my $20.00.1/10 because Jlaw is really good in it.",1,21,36,17 September 2017
Tombstone," You gonna do something, or just stand there and bleed?
","To say this movie is entertaining is to say that Popcorn is sold at the movies. It is a no brainer. Tombstone is one of the best movies ever made from an entertainment standpoint and it is by far the best western ever made, and that includes films like Cool Hand Luke and Stagecoach.I also have to concur with the opinion that Kilmer steals the show and he should have at least been nominated in 93 for best supporting actor. Tommy Lee Jones was brilliant as Girard in The Fugitive but Kilmer was equally as brilliant in this film.This film may not be a completely accurate re-creation of the famous story with the Clantons and the OK Corral and such, but it is so much fun that accuracy doesn't really matter. What does matter is that you are mesmerized by Doc and even guys like Ike, Curly Bill and even small roles such as Billy. But to me the two most interesting characters in the film was the relationship between Doc and Ringo. They truly hate each other but have a mutual respect for each other and you just know that there will be a showdown between these two gunslingers. And when they do play for blood, we realize that not only is Doc ' your Huckleberry ' but Ringo ' ain't no daisy. He ain't no daisy. There is so much fun in this movie.The script is unbelievable and some of the lines in this film will be quoted for generations to come, with the bulk of the hilarity and brilliance coming from Doc.On a scale of 1-10, this film easily gets a ten. And if you want to see one of the best casts ever assembled, you have come to the right place.To sum it up, I'll leave you with this ' You tell em' the law is comin. You tell em' I'm comin' and hell's comin' with me. HELL'S comin with me! '",10,0,0,27 April 2007
Identity," I wanted so much more, this can't be it.
","Very few times have I been more excited to see a film than I was to see Identity.  With the healthy revival of the horror genre in the last few years, film makers have been doing it right more times than I can remember since the early 80's.  I think The Ring has set the bar so high for so many films that now writers are trying to do the next great thing to scare the hell out of you.  And every film has a shocking twist to it now a days as well.  Think back to films like The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and a few others and it seems that everyone is now trying to give us the next great twisted film.  Whatever works I guess.  The only danger of that mentality is that when you market a film like the way Identity was marketed, you better make sure that your twist pays off and doesn't make the audience feel cheated.  I read Roger Ebert's review of The Usual Suspects and one of the reasons why he didn't like the film all too well is because he felt that the twist was so truculent, so brash and so unexpected that he felt cheated.  There was no way that he could figure it out and he felt that the creators of the film didn't play fair with it's audience.  While I do not agree with that assessment of The Usual Suspects, I do understand what he was complaining about because that is how I felt here.  The twist is so unexpected, so convoluted and so unfair that when it did happen, I looked at my wife and said, 'What the hell...are you serious?'  And from that point on ( and there was still about 15 minutes left in the film), I just couldn't enjoy what I was watching.  I just couldn't buy into what they were asking me to accept.  Without giving away the film, a good comparison perhaps is to say that if you were told that your two best friends were in a fist fight and you had to stop them from hurting each other, but then found out that it was all spurious expose, would you really fear for their safety or would you watch with a crooked grin on your face?Identity is a film that is blessed with a plethora of excellent horror film elements.  You have ten strangers that all seem to have some sort of connection.  It is a dark and stormy night and the small area in Nevada that they are in is going through a torrential storm.  It is flooding the roads so that everyone has to take refuge at a dingy looking Batesesque looking motel.  The film starts out beautifully with a terrible car accident that may have been triggered by one of the other patrons when she lost some of her luggage on the road which caused the flat tire and this caused the accident.  Everyone seems to be meeting by suspiciously conspicuous circumstances.  What they all have in common and why they are all here is the million dollar question.   Soon everyone is settled into the rooms but other eerie events just keep popping up all over the place.  And then finally someone dies.  And in a most heinous of ways.  She has her head cut off and placed in a dryer. Pretty gruesome stuff.  But what is the significance of everyone being here and why can't they get out?  It is almost like they have been brought here by some mystical force and it is keeping them here.  Radios don't work, cars won't start, the storm is flooding everything except the motel and to make matters worse, there is a psychotic prisoner chained to the bathroom wall in one of the rooms.  Add to the story that they all share the same birthday, some strange names and the you now have one seriously confusing film.  And that is where the films stops being suspenceful and confusing and it heads into the absurd.There are enough red herrings introduced in the film as well to throw you off of the real deal but some of those red herrings would have made a more compelling story than they one that the writer's want us to believe.  But what does keep the film flowing is the actors.  With a film blessed with a cast that includes Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta and John Cusack, there is never a dull moment.  Cusack carries the film and every second he is on screen he makes you listen.  He has come such a long way from his days in films like Sixteen Candles and The Sure Thing.  I have never seen him better than he is here.But ultimately what transpires in the last half hour of the film is what put me off.  That is not to say that it will put a typical viewer off the film off, it probably won't.  I have talked to many people that saw the film and loved it.  They liked the twist, they liked the outcome and they liked how it all played out.  I can't really tell you why I didn't care for it, but I just didn't.  And this is coming from a guy that loved the twist in Fight Club, Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.  Go figure.  Maybe I didn't feel cheated in those films the way I felt cheated here.6.5 out of 10Maybe the best thing to do is just judge for yourself.",6,10,18,1 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," A very creepy film.
","What's going on here?  The summer of 99 has produced 2 very intensely creepy films.  First Blair Witch takes us all by storm and now the Sixth Sense does the same thing.  What we have here is a film that does all the things that a 'horror' film should do.  It uses shadows, it has talk of the dead and the undead and it even uses other things like atmosphere and music to produce a very good scary film, and one that will have you buzzing about the ending.Young Cole can hear and see dead people and it is up to Dr. Malcolm to help him out.  The story itself is interesting and how it is carried out is even better.  But I have to say that I think this is a film that should be seen twice to figure everything out and to understand all that it is.  Because when you leave the theater you will question many aspects of the film.  You will wonder if it is legitimate in it's approach and honest and realistic with what the end of the film has wants us to believe.  But when I walked home and had a chance to examine it, I realized how truthful it is, and that makes it even more brilliant.  And in a way this film reminds me of a 1987 film called Angel Heart.  Both films concentrate on foreshadowing and they also play with our intellect.  When I first saw Angel Heart, I knew that it was good, but when I began to watch it more often on video, I realized that Angel Heart was a film that had more to it in every shot.  Every single time the camera rolled, there was always a subliminal meaning behind the ersatz one that was in front of us.  And that is what I think Sixth Sense does so well.  You wonder at first why Malcolm can't get into his basement, and then when you leave the theater and think about the film, you realize how much it all made sense.  This is a film that manipulates our psyche and plays with our ethos.  But it has a great time doing so.  I highly recommend this film, especially if you want to be frightened.  There are about five or six really good moments in the film that make your heart stop.  And on that level the film is terrific.  But as a film, not a genre piece, this is top notch and dare I say that Cole may be remembered at Oscar time.  Go see this film!",9,0,0,9 August 1999
Final Destination," Reminiscent of early Hooper, Craven and Carpenter
","Horror has to be one of the hardest genres to master.  People think horror is simple because many of the horror films that they think of are films from the 80's that seem to have low production costs and a non existent cast. But look again at some of the good horror from the last 40 years and you will see that fine tuning the craft of horror is just as difficult as any other and that when you have a good horror film, they are some of the best films ever made.  Personally, I place Jaws and Halloween on my top ten list of best FILMS ever made.  Even look at films like SIXTH SENSE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, EVIL DEAD and Hitchcock's PSYCHO and you will see not just good horror films, but good films.  You can add FINAL DESTINATION to that list of films.  There is enough chills and scenes of true terror to make you jump and to satisfy any serious horror buffs craving an increase in pulse.To start off, the film has what has to be some of the best (and scariest ) fifteen minutes to open a film.  It involves a dream sequence that tells Devon Sawa that something terrible is going to happen.  He dreams of an airplane crash.  But not only does he dream of the crash itself, he dreams of details.  The camera manipulates us into feeling what he feels as it circles frantically around his room and then it gives us the details of impending doom which is imminently lurking in the shadows.  Then in real time, he tries to tell everyone that the plane is going to crash and he gets kicked off the flight just before it takes off.  And then, in one of the best scenes in horror film history, we watch as the plane, visible from the window, blows up.You know a film has achieved it's perogative in scaring you when you have seen that particular scene in the trailers and it still scares you.  That is powerful film making and James Wong should be commended for his awesome vision.  Wong worked on some small movies like TRICK OR TREAT in the 80's and he is an X-FILES veteran.  But here he shows us that he has the same vision that made some of the greats from the past so stylistic.  I know I am heaping a load of praise on the film and the director when I mention names like TEXAS, HALLOWEEN, and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, but it is well deserved praise.Final Destination doesn't have a true killer, not a tangible one anyway. There is no man with a hockey mask, or a dream figure with long finger knives that attack the kids in this film.  But what we get are subtle shots of unstoppable signs of death.  Winds gust up, shadows envelop the walls, the camera plays with us to make us think or in some cases lets us know that death is imminent.  An unforeseen deity? spirit? demon? is approaching and there is nothing that anyone can do to stop it.  The casting is quite interesting as well.  Devon Sawa plays the main character and he is a wise choice even after his disasterous IDLE HANDS, but it is the supporting cast that is best part of the casting director. 
Kerr Smith sheds his sensitive gay persona from DAWSON'S CREEK and here plays a tough guy/jerk.  And he plays it quite well.  Stifler, from AMERICAN PIE, suffers the worst death in the film and although he is good, he is basically just another character.  I would have liked to see him play more of a role, the producers of Road Trip got it right when they basically gave him the same role as the one he played in American Pie.  But I guess this is a horror movie and that is of little consequence to the film.  Ali Larter from VARSITY BLUES fame ( and a stint on Dawson's Creek ) is the one that shines here the most.  Another reviewer in here noted that she was one of the best young actresses of her generation and although that is lofty praise, I have to concur.  She carries the film when Sawa is absent and I expect to see great things from her in the future.Final Destination is one of the scarier films to come out in the last 40 years.  And yes I am serious.  This is one that is definitely worth checking out.  And for any of you horror buffs out there that haven't seen it ( and this is especially for you M.A. Rogers from New York, who is as big a horror movie buff as I am and I enjoy your reviews in the IMDb immensely ) really should get the time to see this.  It is well worth your time.9 out of 10",Null,1,2,26 May 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Come to Freddy...
","There really are, when you come to think of it, not that many films that are truly frightening. The kind of film that gets under your skin and eats away at you. The kind of film that stays with you days ( and nights ) after you see it. There certainly aren't any that come to mind from the 90's. But along with films like Aliens the first Halloween, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left and the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the first Nightmare is terrifying. And that is owed all to Wes Craven. The sequels of this film are really trash and that is because Robert Shaye may be a good business man but he certainly does not know how to see to it that The Nightmare series stayed it's course and kept viewers on the edge of their seat. The sequels became more comedic than scary and even though Freddy had a personality in the first one, he was still more diabolical and evil than he was funny. More Lon Chaney than Jerry Lewis. But the first one has every element in it to keep you scared beyond belief.This film is iconic in many ways. There are those that say it is dated. I beg to differ on that point. This is a film that transcends generations and expertly amalgamates gore and tension. When you think of all of the so called horror films that have come out in the last year or so, many of them try to enthrall us with buckets of blood and special effects, but they forget that with a horror film, you must have an element of fear with it. Nightmare on Elm Street captures that better than most, and is on a level with the all time greats.Fred Krueger, as we all know, was a child molester who was hunted down by the local Elm Street parents after he beat a court systems on a technicality. They trapped him in his basement and lit his house on fire and then watched him burn. Somehow he comes back and haunts their children's dreams and murders them while they sleep. This sets up the premise of the film and it is stated on the SE DVD that Craven got the idea for this film while reading a story in an Asian newspaper about kids dying in their sleep and telling their parents that they knew something bad was going to happen to them in their dreams. It is an interesting concept and because it is done to perfection here, it has now become one of the cornerstones of American horror.Wes Craven has been revitalized as a master of modern horror with his very commerically successful Scream series, and as much as I love Scream, it is horror lite when comparing it to his efforts like NOES, LHOTL and The Hills Have Eyes. Those films, and Nightmare in particular, revolutionized ther horror genre. Nightmare on Elm Street is his best film and if you forget how truly scary the film is after viewing all of the inferior comedic sequels (with the exception of the last) view this one. Freddy is a horror icon and he has achieved that status because he is the true definition of fear.10/10 One of the 10 best horror films ever! Come to Freddy!!",10,6,7,21 June 1999
The Truman Show," Look closer and this film may be about you
","First off I have to say that I really believe that the majority of people that didn't like this were people that were expecting Ace Ventura to pop up on screen.  Like all of a sudden Jim Carrey's face was going to explode with laughter and he was going to break into fits of absurdity the way he did when he talked with his butt.  And if that is the hang up you have with this film, then I pity you because there is so much to this film that it could make you look at things a little closer.The Truman Show is what seems to be the story of a man that has lived a make believe life.  We all know what it is about and if you don't then this review is not the best one for you, skip down in the IMDb and there are many great reviews about what Turman is in the narrative sense.  I want to touch on something else and it is something that I hope other people can see as well.The Truman Show can be a metaphor for anyone's life, especially us that dwell in wealth of the Western Culture.  Because the one question arises in this movie that doesn't let go of you is a scary one, and that is ' What is real? '  I'm not talking in the literal sense the way Truman has it.  His life is not real in the sense that he is there for everyone to view and take pleasure from.  But when I ask ' What is real? ' I mean what in our life is real?  I'm sure that you can get a myriad of responces to that question but after seeing this movie it makes me question every single one of the answers that I can come up with.  The Truman Show asks you to open your eyes and look around you.  Is what you see pleasing?  Do you have the white picket fence, the two car garage, the double income family, the kids that are going to make you proud and go to college, good friends, a few pets, an okay boss, a sense of security, a faithful spouse, a nice car, money in the retirement fund and so on.  Well do you?  If you do, is it possible to fathom that it could all be a sherade, that it is all a mirage?  That white picket fence could get destroyed by a tornado or vandals, your two car garage could get destroyed by a fire, your double income family could be reduced to nothing if one of you is caught cheating or there are budget cutbacks and someone loses a job or becomes expendable, the kids may not want to go to college, they may get pregnant or make someone pregnant and want to work in a hardware store for the rest of their life, your friends may not like you very much and just put on an act for propriety sake, in fact one of those friends may be sleeping with your wife or husband, your pet may get run over by a car, your boss may despise you, the stockmarket could crash and all of your sense of security with it, your nice car is just a machine to get you places and the retirement fund could be gone tomorrow, you never know.  The whole point to this is that The Truman Show wants us to look a little closer at what it is that is important to us.  It shows and tells us in a round about way that we have become strange and demented when we prioritize the things in our life the way we do.  And in a way, every character in the Truman Show could be us.  How many of us want control the way Ed Harris has control?  How many of us are the loving wife ( or husband ) who is happy on the outside and stark raving mad and downright miserbable on the inside? How many of us want to tell the world that something is wrong with it the way Truman's one and only true love wanted to tell him?  How many of us are the consumate actor when we need to be just like Truman's best friend?  And how many of us are Truman, a guy that knows something is wrong with his/her life but has no idea what or how to fix it?  I think we are all like these people sometimes.  And that is what makes The Truman Show as brilliant as it is, because it is twisted but so is life.  If you haven't seen this film I strongly recommend that you do, and if possible watch it back to back with American Beauty.  Both have a lot to say about society in general, they go about it in different ways but it is essentially the same message. 
' It's never to late to start over. 'This is a great film and one that should be seen to be appreciated.  It is a gem and deep down it wants us to look  closer.  Sorry to steal that catch phrase from American Beauty, but it applies here just as well.  Life is what you make of it, it just takes a little work.",9,0,0,29 September 1999
The Matrix," A movie that makes you question reality
","I'll be honest here, I had no interest in seeing The Matrix.  It was my opinion that this was going to be a convoluted mumble jumble film.  I had pre-conceived notions going into the film and I tried hard to stick with them.  It is a strange thing really, because I try to like a film more than dislike, but I had such ( at the time ) an anti computer film attitude.  I have always thought that computer films were the same.  But I am happy to say that I was so wrong.  Man was I wrong.First let's get the comparisons out of the way.  The 13th Floor and The Matrix have similar themes, but that is where the similarity stops.  I don't think the makers makers of either film copied each other.  After all, with this subject matter, there is enough to easily make two different films. Both films are excellent in their own right and as I said when I reviewed The 13th Floor, the only reason that The Matrix did better business is because it was marketed better.  And don't forget they seemed to copy a previous film that came out earlier called Dark City.Keanu Reeves plays Neo.  In his other life, he is a computer hacker with a seemingly normal job.  But he has inner demons.  There is a part of him that believes something is wrong with the world.  And then finally one day, he is given an ultimatum by a stranger.  He can learn all the secrets that he believes are out there or he can stay in his drab life and never know the truth.  What do you think he does?  Hmmm.He is taken into a world by a bunch of renegade freedom fighters led by Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus.  And this is where I think the strength of the film lies.  It is here that we learn what the Matrix is. And of course I don't think anyone reviewing this film is going to give away what that is, but just saffice it to say that it will stay with you for a while, especially if you are like me and occassionally question reality every now and then.The true strength of this film is not just Reeves, but Fishburne.  I remember seeing Fishburne in a little known film called Deep Cover.  I thought he was outstanding in that film and I was convinced that was his best work.  That is until the Matrix came out.  Here, he has a similar job as Michael Biehn had in the original Terminator.  It was his job to explain to us, the audience, what was going on and how it was all possible.  And a script like this is a delicate thing to handle.  There is so much information that it would be easy for another writer and another director ( fortunately they are the same here ) to give us a condensed version of what is in the film.  But they are brave enough and have confidence in their material to tell it the way it should be told.  And for that I am so thankful because it is really an intelligent story.So much has been made of the visuals in this film and I guess I would be remiss if I didn't at least comment on them here as well.  They are outstanding.  You will never see better stunts in any movie.  The choreography is so perfect it really is like watching a perfectly executed martial arts routine.  It flows so well that it makes you feel like you are there experiencing what is happening.  I don't think I will ever forget some of the fight scenes in this film.  They are sheer brilliance.But mostly what is enjoyable about The Matrix is the questions that it asks and how it answers them.  What is the Matrix?  Well, well I'm not going to give it away.  As I said it is one of the parts of the movie that will keep you intrigued and will astonish you at the same time.  This is a very good film and it's visionary outbursts are worth the price of a rental alone. But it has a great story to it as well and that should be enough for anyone to want to see it.",10,0,0,2 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," And so it begins
","I thought we had all seen Star Wars. Turns out we haven't. My fiancée had never seen any of the series until she saw the Phantom Menace. So I rented the first three and sat down one fateful Saturday afternoon and watched them in succession. As always, another one was captivated and lured into the legend that starts out with those spinetingling words, ' A long time ago in a galxy far far far away.... 'It doesn't matter if you are six or 36, Star Wars and it's sequels and prequels will hypnotize you, and even if you have seen the films 100's of times, it is always great to go back and pay homage to the film that entertained us and captured our imaginations. And even though this film is now more than 20 years old, it is still easy to marvel at the technology and Lucas' impressive vision. I remember hearing that George took this to many studios before 20th Century and they emphatically denied him any funds to make this film. But then someone at 20th Century told him that they liked what he did with American Graffiti and they told him to do it. Could you imagine what the guys at the other studios must have been saying to themselves after Star Wars went on to not only break box office records, but shatter them? Perhaps some execs lost their jobs for passing over Star Wars for the latest Al Pacino movie, but they shouldn't have. Star Wars was a gamble. It has far off worlds, another language(s), Wookies, the force, a man dressed in all black that moves things with his mind, princesses, old wizards, androids, farmers, space stations, bars with singing puppets, space cowboys, bad guys with British accents, landspeeders, tie fighters, X-Wing fighters, lightsabres and so on. Who in their right mind would want to gamble on this when in the previous six years of the decade the biggest films were that of a killer shark, a ruthless family of Italian mobsters and a boxer with a speech impediment that goes all the way? Star Wars clearly didn't fall into the category of box office gold. But then something unbelievable happened.Other films have gone onto gross more money than Star Wars ( E.T. Jurassic Park, Titanic ) but I don't think any other film has ever done to an audience or to a society what the Legend that is Star Wars and it's sequels has done. And that is taken something that is a motion picture and turn it into something almost tangible, something that has a life of it's own. And it just makes it even more fun to look back on the films from 20 some years ago now that the second batch of films is in full bloom. We can now ask questions like, How does Anakin go from that darling little boy to the evil and mechanical monster that he is? How does Yoda end up in the Degabah System? What happened to all the other Jedi Masters? Why does Obi Wan end up on Tatooine? Why why why and how? Many answers are awaiting us in the coming episodes. But we can all look back to 1977 and a young man named George Lucas that had a vision, an epiphany perhaps, and we can thank the movie Gods that Star Wars was born. This is one of the true defining moments in motion picture history.Star Wars- 10 out of 10. Can you give it any less?",10,0,1,15 May 2000
The Thin Red Line," An unbelievable mess. One of the worst movies ever ( honest )
","This is the epitome of Hollywood losing site of it's audience. I'm not sure in what war teenagers began reciting poetry, but apparently in this one, it is all they do. And when there is more in here about Caviezel losing his girlfriend to infidelity than there is people losing their lives, I think you are trouble. This amazing cast is completely wasted as they sleepwalk through dialogue written for an esoteric group of moviegoers, because it sure wasn't made for the general public. This is closer to being one of the worst films of the year, perhaps of all time, than it is to being one of the best.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Chilling, the best of the bunch so far!
","Empire is a soap opera.  It is a season finale that leaves you hanging for three years until the next one comes out ( fortunately for us that was 19 years ago and they are all out on video now ). And it is one of those movies that does something wonderful, it makes you feel something.  It grabs a hold of your emotions and twists your insides like a pretzel.  I rented this movie last night because just recently my own copy of it was stolen.  And let me tell you, the film still left me exhilarated, exhausted, full of hope, excited and yearning to watch Return of the Jedi so I can see how Han gets rescued and I so badly wanted to see Luke and Darth square off in that final battle.  But the one thing that this movie does perhaps like no movie has ever done is makes your heart stop.' No Luke, I am your father. 'We have all heard that line a thousand times before and we have all seen Empire a thousand more times, but no matter how old you are ( I'm in my late 20's ) and no matter how many times you hear it, it still sends chills through you.The Star Wars saga is pure magic and Empire is the best of the bunch.  I can't say enough about this film and of the whole series.  A New Hope, Empire, Return, and Phantom Menace are what movie making is all about and these movies do what films should do.  They take you to another place and they entertain you.  And there is no better film to do that than Empire.

The Breakfast Club," John Hughes could make a movie in a phone booth.
","If Spielberg was the king of fantasy in the 80's then John Hughes was the quintessential teen movie director.  He usually writes his own material and that combination of writing and directing has kept us entertained for the better part of 20 years.  He hears things that most other people can't and he conveys his message with the clarity of a bell ringing.  Breakfast Club is one of those movies.With an all star young cast, they lend instant credibility to the characters that they play.  My fave character because of his honesty is Bender.  He is the only character that seems to have a beef with everyone and when he picks on the person, he holds nothing back.  This movie is one of the best teen flicks to come out in the eighties.  Along with Fast Times, Sixteen Candles, The Sure Thing, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Say Anything, this movie gives an honest look at what it was like growing up and attending high school in the eighties.  This is a must see.",10,0,1,18 June 1999
Gladiator," What film making is all about! Let the summer sweeps begin!
","I love the summer season for movies.  Some of the best films have been released in the summer.  Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Rambo, Jaws, films that pack a punch.  Films that are high on octane and short on melodramatic self importance like the Virgin Suicides.  Chalk Gladiator up as one of the great summer films that has been thrust upon us.  This film has it all, action, gore, bravado, amazing battle sequences, wonderful choreography and a rising star.  Russell Crowe has played his share of different roles but it is this one that is probably going to make him a household name.  Here he is buffed and muscular and visibly toned down from Oscar nominated role in The Insider.To review this film is really pointless.  To criticize it is even more useless.  If you go into this film the way many sometimes over rated-self important critics do and expect another Spartacus, is just plain stupid. Spartacus is a movie unto itself.  I don't think Gladiator wants to be Spartacus, I think it just wants to entertain.  And guess what?  It does that with flare.  There is enough action in here to please those of us that are from the Raiders of the Lost Ark school.  And dare I say it, but this film is better than Braveheart.  I can honestly say that my heart was pounding the entire time I was sitting in the theater.  Some of the battle scenes were what I would consider some of the best ever filmed.  I have to say that the opening battle was not my favourite as Scott opted for way too many close ups where he should have let the action speak for itself.  But that is the only complaint.  Every battle was epic, every attempted mutiny was thrilling and every sneering, wining, sniveling sound that Joaquin Phoenix uttered made me want to get in the ring with him.  I can't believe this is the same guy that was masturbating a lot in Parenthood.  What a resume he has for himself.Gladiator is the first real summer blockbuster in this young season.  And judging by the audience reaction to it and judging by how good it is, it should go on to be one of the big guns from this summer.  I think at this point we are all tired of all the utter excretement that has been forced down our throats so far in this year, we are ready for a film like Gladiator.  This is a film that is worth seeing two or three times.  It is that good and that much fun.Again, it is useless to tell you what is good or bad about the film.  If you like action and violence and men beating each other until death, and ancient battles and names like Caesar and Rome and shades of Hamlet and such, and if you like to watch men get attacked by tigers and slice other people's bellies open and chop off heads and other parts of the body, then this is the film for you.  If that sounds rather barbaric and disgusting, well, there is always copies of Remains of the Day and Endless Love at the video store.  9.5 out of 10",10,0,0,10 May 2000
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Strap in, hold on and get ready to be blown away!
","Transformers 3 is a miracle. It has everything you could hope for in a summer film. There were times when I wanted to stand up and cheer (I did sit and cheer or clap twice in the film) and there were times when my voice box wouldn't work so my shocked and awe functions were relegated to my eyes bulging like I was on Ecstasy and my mouth was agape like I was lining up to have someone throw an M&M in my mouth. There were times when I laughed when no one else did (Sam's interview with Malkovich and when just a few notes of Sweet Emotion played, just like it did in Armageddon). There were times that I laughed when everyone else did (the two New York mini robots doing pretty much anything got me and the audience all giddy). And then there were times when I just sat back, glasses on, blinding light from the screen, crisp and precise sound emanating from the 100 or so speakers, and just took it all in, and thought to myself, 'this is why I love movies'. This is why I go to the theater. My favourite films take me to another world. A world of infinite possibilities.When I watched Terminator 2, I believed that liquid metal was real. I was convinced that it could take the shape of a Vasquez from Aliens and stab a man while he was drinking a carton of milk.In Jurassic Park, I was in that park with the kids and with Malcolm and with the lawyer and the director of Ghandi. Tyrannosaurus Rex was real and so were the raptors before they started playing basketball in Toronto.In Armageddon, I knew that Bay really went to a giant asteroid and shot on location. He really did take Bruce and Ben and William with him. It had to be real because the worlds that they inhabit felt real.And that's not even mentioning some of the big guys like Star Wars and LOTR and Matrix and many others. The worlds that can be created take you places. They remind you that with a little imagination, a lot of hard work and a letting a little bit of the kid in you come out, you can creates anything. Bay's Transformers 3 is a brilliant and worthy addition to these worlds. There isn't one frame of this film that feels fake. There's not one shot that wasn't laboriously coddled over. It's truly a remarkable film and even though I'm not a huge proponent of 3D, here it absolutely works. The base jumping scene will go down, imo, as one of the all time most amazing scenes ever filmed. It's just remarkable that Bay could do what he did.The film has a very fresh story which is also a bit surprising as it kind of rehashes the story from part two. But when you can get Kennedy, the moon landing, Cheronobyl, the destruction of downtown Chicago, the middle east problems and a plethora of other issues all rolled into one film, it just feels fresh.My favourite part of Transformers, even more the mind blowing spectacle of watching them transform, is Sam Witwicky. His character is essential to the film and he is the glue that holds it all together. The first 15 minutes or so is all exposition. They go to the moon and discover the crashed Transformer there and it is a very well done beginning. But when Sam finally gets on screen you feel a sense of relief. His mannerisms, his idiosyncratic ways and his entire ethos is what makes the Transformer films so much fun from the human side. Here, he has grown up. He is disgruntled as he feels he should have some cushy, well paying government job seeing as he saved the world twice. But he is unemployed and looking for work. His new girlfriend is hot, obviously, but she is a nice addition to the film. Her story arc could not have been done with Mykala as his girlfriend, so it was written well. Cameos by John Malkovich and Ken Jeong are played strictly for laughs and they do it well, especially Jeong who's a short and sneaky man working in Malkovich's company. He had some of the best early laughs.Adding to the mix is newcomer Frances McDormand. She plays a caricature of a bitchy CIA agent who is way too full of herself but really hasn't a clue what she is doing. This part is not played for laughs as she insults Sam and Optimus at every chance she gets. It's also nice to see that Coen's alumni McDormand, Malkovich and John Turturro are all in this film. They even share some screen time together (not all three together).Without getting into the story, to avoid spoilers, just suffice to say that everything you want and expect from a Transformers film is here and many of the things people complained about in the second one are not. Gone are the Transformer balls, leg humping and the supposed racial stereotypes of the twins. Replacing that is more subdued and well placed humour. Even the sheer emotion is magnified in the film as the last 30-45 minutes will leave you breathless and exhausted. And the only spoiler I will mention is my favourite line of the film is when Rosie tells Megatron that he will be used like he is the Sentinel's bitch.Transformers 3 is a like a ride at the amusement park. It can leave you breathless, queasy and exhausted. But you know that once you get off you just feel like going back on again.9/10",9,9,20,29 June 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The greatest third installment of a series ever
","Thanks to the Godfather and Rocky movies, sequels became a part of our vernacular in the 70's.  If there was a sequel before these two franchises, I can't remember them.  And since sequels have meant pretty much big bucks at the box office, many times they are pale imitations to the original.   To name a few movie franchises that have now gone on to do at least three films, you have the Rocky's, Godfather, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Aliens, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Rambo, Superman, Scream, Child's Play, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  These are just a few of the film franchises that have gone on to do at least three films.  And I can guarantee you that no film series can boast that their third offering is almost as good as their first.  It just doesn't happen.  It is hard to duplicate the energy and originality of the first one that came out.  But the Indy movies are different.  First of all they are created by two of the best in the business and they star one of the greatest actors to ever live.  And what you get when you have two creative genius behind the scenes is a series that tries so hard to please and a series that doesn't rehash the story that made the first one work.  You get a story that furthers the trials and tribulations of the hero Indiana Jones, and you get a film that keeps giving you insights into his life.  In the first, we meet Indiana Jones, the daring archeologist that risks life and limb to recover artifacts for his museum.  You also meet Marion Ravenwood, a long lost love, Marcus Brody, his mentor and boss and Sola, one of best friends from Cairo and Belloq ( or according to Sola, Bellosh ).  Temple of Doom takes us back in time and introduces us to Short Round. And finally we have Last Crusade.  Here we meet Indiana Jones as a teenager.  We are introduced to the folklore that is Indiana Jones.  We see how his fear of snakes started, how he was introduced to his bullwhip and his fedora and even how he got that famous scar on his chin.  And in the casting coup of the century, we meet his dad played by Sean Connery.  We are also treated to some familiar faces as Brody and Sola return.  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the best second sequel ever made.  This could have been the beginning to a series if we didn't already know about Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It is that much fun and so filled with richness.The only complaint that I have about this film is what they did with Marcus Brody.  In Raiders, he tells Indy that if he were five years younger he would have gone after the Ark himself.  He was a warrior and one who probably went on many adventures in the style that Indy did.  But in this one they forgot all about that adventurous side to him and instead they went for comic relief at his expense.  Any true Indy fan will tell you that he should have been able to handle himself when he bumped into Sola.  He should have been everything that Indy told Ilsa and Donovan that he was when they found out that Brody had the map.  But aside from this small discrepency, the film is flawless and one of the most entertaining films ever made.  And even though the talent involved here dictates that it should be perfect, keep in mind that making a sequel is never easy.  You now have devoted fans that are going to judge you with every written word, every swing of the whip and every new character introduced.  Last Crusade succeeds where most others fail and that is perhaps because the makers and star of this film ( Steven, George, Frank and Harrison ) care about Indiana Jones.  They want him to be the same as he was in Raiders and Temple.  I saw this film 12 times at the theatre when it came out.  I was fortunate enough to know an usher at The London Mews back in 1989 and he let me stay for the second and third showing of the day ( and night ) free of charge. This was a time when movies were events, they were and still are larger than life to me.  I get excited when I see a good one and I get anxious when a movie like this comes out.  I sincerely hope they get around to making a fourth one because as excited as I was to see Star Wars Episode 1, that excitement will pale in comparison to when I am sitting in the theater one day and I am waiting to see the new Tom Hanks movie ( whatever that may be at the time ) and that John Williams music invades the speakers and tells me that there is a new Indy movie that is going to be released on Victoria Day Weekend ( here in Canada that is).  I will count the days down until it comes out.  The Indy movies are what movies are all about.  They are a micorcosm of entertainment and as close to a religious experience, filmwise, as you can come.  Raiders was a great beginning, Temple furthered the story wonderfully and Crusade summed it up beautifully.  My life is richer because Indiana Jones is a part of it, and I know I am not the only one that feels that way. Gary, if you ever read this review, buddy, this one is for you.  Long live Indiana Jones!!",10,1,2,28 December 1999
Goodfellas," Scorsese's best
","Goodfellas makes you feel like you are watching guys that you know or knew. To this day, I have a friend that still talks like Jimmy Two Times. He always says things like 'Nice Nice' and that was just a background piece in Goodfellas. But that is the point, all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales. It all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like. And with all due kudos to The Godfather, but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way Goodfellas does.To say that Joe Pesci is the best part of this film would be to discredit the rest of the cast, but at the same time, you have to mention him in some way. His portrayal of Tommy is haunting. Here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog, the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him. Of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling Tommy to screw himself after he shot him in the leg. You would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent, but Tommy is always looking for the diss. He is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down. Even at the beginning when he is getting on Henri in the now famous ' You're a funny guy ' scene. He is kidding with Henri but deep down inside he is angry with him, you can see it and feel it. Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year.The story and script by Pileggi is sheer inside brilliance. You can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside. They ring so true and they get into your blood. From scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when Henri, Jimmy and Tommy have Billy Bats in the trunk but they stop off at Tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such. They also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk, but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car. And the scene where Tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then Jimmy gets mad at him, not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight. There are so many tiny observations in Goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has. And it is a film that stays with you for years to come. I think this is Scorcese's best film and although I understand and accept why the academy awarded Dances With Wolves the accolades it did, if this film would have swept the Oscars that year, no one would have been surprised. It is a landmark film and I think it is one of the best films ever made. And again, taking no credit away from Coppolla's Godfather epics, but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level. It goes one step beyond what Coppolla gave us, and for that Goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made.",10,79,141,16 September 1999
Jurassic Park," Quite a good film
","I remember when this film was being mentioned for the summer sweeps.  It was said that it was going to be like Jaws on land.  Well that is unfair to put that kind of pressure on it.  After all, nothing can really compete with Jaws when it comes to summer time terror.  But having said that, Jurassic Park is a good movie with quite a few tense scenes in it.  But what Jurassic Park lacks, and what would have made it a better film is something that I think we all would have liked to see.Dinosaurs are amazing creatures.  Being that it is the year 2000, we all know what they look like now.  But picture this back in 1993.  No one had seen a dinosaur on film.  Not a good one anyway.  There were a few old television shows where really fake and synthetic looking T-Rex's would chase down it's human prey, but that doesn't really count.  The world had never been exposed to Spielberg's vision and therefore, we had never really experienced what a dinosaur looked like for real.  But if you remember what Dern's and Golddblum's reactions were when they first saw the Brontosaurus' roaming in the field, that is probably what we all felt.  A complete and utter sense of awe.  Here is a species of animal that has been extinct for about 65 million years and we are getting to witness it for the first time on the big screen.  I just wish we had more time and more shots of these magnificent beasts roaming the earth.  I wish we had more time to just watch what they do, how they move, how they interact.  I realize this isn't a National Geographic show about dinosaurs, it is big budgetted Hollywood summer film that has to contain action, suspense and humour, but it just would have been nice to see them in all their glory for just a little longer than what we did.  I guess seven years later it really doesn't matter how I feel seeing as there have been countless other films with dinosaurs in them and Jurassic Park went onto become the biggest movie ever until James Cameron came along and decided to sink some ship.  But at the time it was a legitimate gripe.As for the rest of the film, it is an enjoyable romp through the jungle.  It has enough scares and suspense to keep everyone happy.  It also boasts of a very impressive cast.  Newman and Jules have substantial roles in it as well as Dern, Neil and Goldblum.  I am not really going to say much else about it.  After all, it has probably already been said.  It's not that I didn't enjoy the film because I did, it's just that I think they could have done more with it.7.5 out of 10Jurassic Park 3 should be interesting, especially now since Spielberg has traded in his director's hat for just a producing one.",Null,0,1,26 May 2000
High Fidelity," One the most intelligent and funny looks at dating against a backdrop of music
","Warning: does contain spoilersWomen, do you ever wonder why a man just can't seem to settle down?  Do you ever cringe and shudder when you realize how vacilating men seem to be, and not just a few of them but all of them?  Here you are, this beautiful, intelligent career orientated women and you are full of verve and love.  And you think you've found the right guy and things are great.  But then suddenly, apathy comes knocking on your door and now it seems that you have lost your man.  Ever experience that or know how that feels?  Well, so does this film.Has anyone out there ever known someone that seems to be obsessesd with either the world of music or the world of film.  I mean the kind of guy where he can tell you not only the name of a song from 1979 but who it was made for or what the flip side of that single was?  Or a guy that can list his record collection in chronological order that they were bought?  Well this film does know guys like this because they exist here, in this small record store in Chicago.High Fidelity is one of the most original films to come out of Hollywood in quite some time.  It combines the backdrop of music and the foreground of dating and both worlds are hilariously dissected and an honest attempt is given to help us all understand the cataclysmic world of one and the obsessive world of the other, you figure out which world is destined for which.John Cusack plays Rob.  Rob is a small record store owner that specializes in hard to find records, or better yet, records that the fascist staff think is worthy for people to buy.  The other two guys that work there are pathetic in their own way.  Dick and Barry are complete opposites but one thing that is clear is their love for music.  Dick is a shy and submissive man that has many opinions but doesn't give them out as noxiously as Barry. Barry on the other hand, thinks mainstream music is the plague and only music he deams worthy is even permitted to cogitate about in the store.  Any modicum, any scent of an artist like Stevie Wonder or Bryan Adams is frowned upon, God only knows what he would be like if Britney Spears was mentioned. These two characters provide much of the comedy in the but it is such an intelligent and original way to do it.  It is refreshing to see comedy try something new every once in a while.  I am not opposed to films like Road Trip and American Pie ( I actually like them very much ) but once in a while it is cleansing to see Hollywood come out with something original.The crux of the film is about Rob's inability to stay with one woman.  He can always find something wrong with them and this in turn causes him to break up with them or they seem to find him banal and they leave him.  From these experience, Rob starts his top five list.  This list consists of top five things about everything.  Top five records about.. top five songs about... and top five breakups.  Laura is his latest break-up and he does not want to give her the pleasure of admitting her to the top five so he goes on telling himself how worthless she really was.  But as the film goes on he can't get her out of his head and wants her back badly.  Now this is where most films take the course that is subscribed to as Romance 101.  This is where scriptwriters set up the love interest, take it away, and then the rest of the film kinetically involves the one party proving to the other party that he is worthy of her.  End of story, they live happily ever after. But High Fidelity is different.  Laura is different.  Laura knows what Rob is like, she has spent the last two years of her life with him and she is not going to come back that easily.  And it is here that Rob goes on one of the most honest and complete journeys that I have seen a character go through.  Sure he learns about himself and wants to change that, but it is what he learns about himself that is the fascinating part. 
' Then I began to realize that they only have one pair of frilly red underwear.  The rest is just regular cotton.'Rob begins to learn that the idea of the perfect relationship is just a fantasy, and in fantasies, nothing ever goes wrong.  But eventually those fantasies turn into six month relationships and work is actually involved and spontaneous sex on the floor turns into sex on the weekend, on a bed, between the hours of midnight and one in the morning.  It's not to say that relationships get stagnant and boring, but they are not sex on a first date either.High Fidelity is honest, smart and incredibly original and funny in so many ways.  But it is the honesty that I enjoyed about the film the most, well, that and Barry.  After all, a film that can tell you why men are as mobile as they are and then can end it with a man that apparently has no talent singing his guts out and sounding like Barry White, well it is a treat. Films don't come out like this often and that is because they are smart. Smart is not easy to do in Hollywood.9 out of 10 ( also look for a hilarious cameo by Tim Robbins )",9,0,0,24 May 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," It will grow on you
","I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well, but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again, as is usual for a Coen film, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!",10,141,187,25 January 2001
