E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," This should be around the top ten, not number 244
","E.T. is without a doubt one of the best films ever made. The direction, the script, the acting, the score, and the message are all flawless. Not only is it one of the most important films ever made, but it is also one of the most fun to watch, at any age. A true masterpiece. 10/10",Null,0,1,26 January 2003
From Hell," A Very Good, Yet Extremely Gory, Account Of The Famous Jack The Ripper.
","This Is A Very Good Movie, That Follows An Opium Addicted Detective, And The Accounts Of The Jack The Ripper Case. Although The Reasons For The Murder Are Not 100 Percent True (The Jack The Ripper Case Has Not Yet Been Closed By Scotland Yard In Real Life), It Is What Many People Believe To Be True. Johnny Depp Delivers An Excellent Performance, As Well As The Rest Of The Cast. However, Heather Grahm, Seemed A Bit Fake To Me.",9,0,1,21 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," AMAZING!
","This is the best movie I have ever seen. Everything about it is perfect. This Beats My Other Favorite Movie, Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone! The cinematography is improved from the first one, as is the acting by the three main leads. Kenneth Branagh and Jason Issacs also add to the overall enjoyment of the film. The special effects here are wonderful, and I just love this film so much.... This truly is the star wars of the new generation!",10,0,0,17 November 2002
