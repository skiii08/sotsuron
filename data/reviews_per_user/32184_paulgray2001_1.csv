Hereditary," Don't believe the hype
","This is more an art film than a horror film.
Pretty sure half of this movie was just focusing on having a brilliant camera angle and zooming in and out of people's faces for 'effect'.
The actual horror parts of this film were quite good but the ending? God knows what that was all about. 
Watch the 2nd half of this film, you don't need to see the first hour. 
People saying the acting was good it wasn't. 
Extremely disappointing.",2,3,6,26 August 2018
