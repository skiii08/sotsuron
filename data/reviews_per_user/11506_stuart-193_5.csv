Alien 3," Alien 3 - directors cut a cut above
","When I first saw this movie, I can remember being really quite disappointed - it seemed to be incoherent, not very scary and definitely not worthy compared to the previous movies. Now I know why - the director was clearly overruled by the money men and his film wasn't the one released in 1992. Oh yes, it was the same actors and he shot the scenes, but someone took an axe into the cutting room. The directors cut doesn't just add a couple of extra scenes, its a completely different movie with real tension, grit and true horror befitting the Alien franchise. This movie has now gone from being the worst of the four to equal second. Thank god for DVD!!",7,2,4,10 November 2004
Star Trek," Set phasers to stunning
","Reload the photon torpedoes - we're going warp 9 with J J Abrams Star Trek.Action packed from the beginning, Abrams has not forgotten what makes audiences interested as he also allows us to become invested emotionally with the concept within the first 3 minutes. Then, never dropping the pace, he takes us on a roller coaster ride through the galaxy ingeniously re-introducing some of the most well known and well loved characters in TV and film history with an insight to their beginnings.As with many other 'remakes', all is not totally different in Abrams Trek, but a new twist will no doubt breathe vibrant new life into these fabulous characters once again for many more outings to come.So. Dust off your star fleet uniforms, get your Spock ears out, sit back and enjoy arguably the best franchise reboot this decade so far (notwithstanding the yet to be released Terminator Salvation).",9,2,7,11 May 2009
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rocking the queen fans
","If you're a queen fan then this is definitely for you. Otherwise, the cast is competent and the technicals are as would be expected. There is some licence from actual events but for entertainment value only. Rami Malek needs some kind of award for this, probably won't get one but he brought Freddy to life again for one more lap of honour.Basically - worth going to see even if you weren't around to see it happen for real or they weren't you're favourite band - regardless, they raised the roof wherever they played and Freddy was a legend and you should see that performance again on the big screen.",9,2,4,8 November 2018
Alien vs. Predator," Gets better each time you watch it - extended version best
","Like many movies of its genre, this film is exactly as expected, so its never going to get the greatest accolades or win any Oscars. The first time I saw AVP, I didn't rate it that highly, though I thought it was OK. However, having seen it once or twice on TV I began to warm to it, so when I saw a cheap copy on Blu ray going in Blockbuster, I decided to buy it. The disc has two version of the film, the theatrical release and an extended version. In terms of the overall feel of the film both are similar, though the extended version does have some additional 'explanations' which the theatrical version leaves you wondering about. Now I have seen this film 4 times, my initial feelings of disappointment have changed to thinking this film should rate around 7/10 overall - it certainly delivers what is expected with above average effects and storyline for its franchise mix. So don't feel put off by the low score on IMDb. If you like Alien and Predator and have a blu ray player then get the extended version - you won't be disappointed. Go on, give it a chance",7,0,0,11 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," To all those giving this less than 4/10
","If you hated the film, that's absolutely fine - but it can't get anything less than 4/10. Why? Because you have to look at the whole production with honesty and be fair. Break it down into its basic components and come up with something sensible. For example:
For a scale of 1-101. Script - you can give this 1/10 if you want. I gave it 6/10 which in my scale is OK - largely because the target audience is kids from the age of 8 upwards so you have to give it some latitude for that. 
2. Acting - all round pretty good considering the material. So 7/10 = good in my scale. 
3. Direction: not as good as I could have been but still good - another 7
4. Camera work - here's where it excels. 9/10 = excellent 
5. Editing - well - brilliant again another 9
6. Score - John Williams iconic themes - 10/10 - superb 
7. Special fx - pretty impressive 8/10 = very good (cos we've seen it all before'in the last one and so many films are impressive these days)
8. Personal feelings and enjoyment - for me it's an 8 as it's so iconic and I grew up with it all. Therefore 64/80 = overall 8/10As the technical stuff is so good there's no way it can get less than 40/80 so you guys giving 1-3 out of 10 are being unreasonable. For me 1/10 is reserved only for the absolute worst movies ever - and not this - even if you hated it with a vengeance that's a personal view and not a realistic one and very unhelpful to those who want to know if they will enjoy it and should pay to see it.",8,3,31,10 April 2018
