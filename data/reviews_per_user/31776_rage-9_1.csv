The Blair Witch Project," Shouldn't miss it
","This is the most original movie i have ever seen. I have never heard of this incident occurring, so it left me wondering if it actually happened, or if it was just a movie. It looks so real, because the entire move is shot with two amature cameras. it is not scarry as hell as rolling stone suggests, but it is truly scary by using the fear of the unknown.",Null,0,1,20 August 1999
