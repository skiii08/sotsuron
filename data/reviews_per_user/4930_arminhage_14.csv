Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Gross failure in quality
","Screenplay was well written, specially the whole Tatooine section is full of excitement and emotion as well as breathtaking special effects. most has been said before this review so I skip to the cons:1. The special effects are worthy of a late 1990s 3D video game not a blockbuster feature film specially the Naboo section was awful, the whole grass is a solid green plane with polished 3D objects moving around. Even back in 1999 when I watched the movie on VHS tape, special effects looked awful in low resolution of the tape and now that I watched it again in HD, they looked much worse. If I were George Lucas, I would curb my enthusiasm of the possibilities of digital technology and focus on creating less crowded but more believable scenes with combination of old school stop motion animation and digital technology. I bet James Cameron could also make Avatar in 1999 but he was wise enough to wait another decade for the digital technology to mature. While Cameron is a genius, Lucas is just a lucky child who created the successful original Star Wars and is nurturing on the franchise ever since. I have no credit to give to George Lucas. Even today with all the progress in digital technology I still like the old school stop motion animation much better than CG because stop motion is an actual object like the actors and actresses themselves but CG as realistic as it can be is still pure animation and the audience deep down in his mind knows what he is watching does not exist even as a model. A wise director should try to create special effects with combination of stop motion, camera tricks and CG. Relying purely on stop motion makes the movie look dated and relying purely on CG, gives the audience a flat forgettable experience in the stream of CG flooded Si-Fi movies.2. There is a narrow line between funny and ridiculous. Supposed to be Funny characters in the movie were ridiculous not funny. Even the script is ridiculous to the extent that makes an 8 years old child to complain and cry.3. The whole droid army, their abilities and strategies was one big joke. It is essential for the director to hire a military adviser before creating any grand battle scenes. Apparently those primitives were not so primitive as they had magnetic shield or something like that, that's cool but how come the bullets could not penetrate the shield but droids could just walk past it? Nevertheless, the problem was far greater than that. It was not supposed to be a fictional version of ZULU wars. An army of primitives on open grass land, just carpet bomb them, nuke them, fry them with the guns of mother ships. Why sending those ridiculously FRAGILE droids to confront them? the whole thing was ridiculous and insulting to the audience's intelligence unless Lucas admits to his innate retardedness.This movie was the second worst installment in the series. The worst installment was 'Return of Jedi', yes, the third part of the original series. Overall a watchable movie (it should be after spending 150 million on its production) and commercially successful because of the hype based on original series but a gross failure in quality.",5,0,2,20 September 2014
Argo," Just read the review please!
","'Early in the morning on Sunday, January 27, 1980, Mendez, 'Julio', and the six American diplomats, traveling with real Canadian passports and forged entry documents, made it easily through security at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport'That's the real story according to Wikipedia. They easily boarded the aircraft and they left! Was it based on chance? I'm sure it was to some extent. To an audience of year 2012 the whole thing looks like a huge high adrenaline gamble with 1/100 chance of success but considering that year 1980 was 25 years away from the dawn of information age, it was absolutely possible to easily fake everything and get out of the country with aid of an insider at airport. I have no problem with dramatizing a simple true event in order to make an appealing movie out of it and that's what Chris Terrio did exactly, following all the clich√©s of Hollywood but somehow the end product came out to be the worst possible story. Here is why:1. I have no respect for CIA but I do not believe that they are stupid otherwise God helps us all. Since they are not stupid, they would never approve of a mission heavily relying on luck. This mission as odd as it looked, had reasonable chance of success with aid of a local agent to place fake entry papers at airport and I'm sure they had such aid and for obvious reasons, they just ditched him out of the screenplay (and the public story of the true event). Without that local agent, that would be a suicide mission as pictured in the movie and I'm sure no one in Washington would approve such mission. 'If they are going to die, let them die in streets of Tehran, it's much less embarrassment for us'... this would be their logic.2. We are talking about Tehran's International Airport in the year 1980. Passengers boarded on the plane? fine, they are still in Iran. call the airport administration and ask them to revoke the clearance of the flight. It takes time? Plane took off? Fine! Ask air force to intercept. It normally takes an hour and half for a 747 to get out of Iranian airspace. Bottom line, provided that we accept what pictured in the movie was what actually happened, they had ZERO chance of success after exposure at Tehran's airport.3. They managed to reconstruct an imitation of Tehran with computer but almost all of the real time street scenes were shot in Istanbul. Iranian cities have very distinct architecture. You can shot a movie in Istanbul and claim that it was Cairo or Damascus but that doesn't work for Tehran. If you want to picture Tehran or other Iranian cities, you have 2 ways. either you go there or recreate them with computer using the thousands of clips available on Youtube as your reference.Besides what was mentioned, I would say the main problem with the movie was lack of a descent villain. It doesn't matter how stupid the whole idea is as long as it is presented appropriately. The revolutionaries and hostile situation are not considered as villains. A single person should represent them as villain. A person who presents from the very beginning of the movie till very end were he is defeated (or wins) as the final resolve. I like to know who was the story consultant! Overall it was a flat boring movie from start to finish. The screenplay was awful, horrible dramatization of real events, relying all on chance, it could be emotionally involving for the people who were involved with the hostage situation but absolutely not emotionally involving for ordinary audience. BTW! What happened to Julio? The other guy who were supposed to be with Mendez?????This is not a movie I recommend someone to waste his time on. If you haven't seen it, just move on!",1,16,25,10 October 2014
Interstellar," Capitalizing on people's crave for stupidity
","Christopher Nolan is either stupid or takes advantage of people's crave for stupidity. The movie was so bad that I don't know where to begin.1. In the beginning of the movie we have a world with frequent sandstorms (or lets say that we see an state in US Midwest). Apparently there is no army anymore, we do not know what year is it exactly, we do not know what has happened to earth, We do not know Cooper's background. We never get any answers but some very vague clues... A clever director could skillfully embed the answers in the screenplay and make the movie more pleasant and engaging. The whole idea is that the climate on parts of earth may escalate to the down side but it can not affect the whole planet which most of its surface is covered with water and even based on what we saw in the movie, the planet was not in such a bad condition to summon extreme measures like leaving it.2. Cooper is an ex something who is farmer now. Based on strange phenomenon in his daughter's room, he discovers a coordinate. He jumps in his truck and goes there to get arrested, to meet familiar people from his past and to get the job offer!!! Like there was no pilots and they were just making the spaceship without a pilot and now God sent them Cooper! At that moment that Professor Brand asked him to pilot the ship, I felt I was watching Alibaba and Forty thieves of Baghdad! It was that cheesy and unfortunately the cheesiness happened way early in the movie.3. We assume they made it into the wormhole in. After that in theory, all the communication with earth should cease as no means of wireless communication can follow them into the wormhole. Granted that they emerged out of the wormhole somewhere else in this physical world but it can be millions of light years away from earth. Nothing can travels faster than light, if you are millions of light years away, or even hundreds of light years away, that simply means that you will not get any signal from earth in your lifetime even if 1 minute of your time is a year o earth. It just doesn't make sense. I think they tried to described how they communicate but it was so stupid that I can't even remember.4. In the beginning of the journey, a huge 3 stages rocket launched the spaceship into earth's orbit but later on, they land on a planet with gravity 1.5 times stronger than earth and they manage to get off the planet without the rocket???5. The robot was probably the most stupid. Actually it was so bad that they never really showed any details. The way it was laying in the spaceship reminded me of R2-D2 in star wars but R2-DD2 was making sense... this one? it reminded me of Spongebob at best!6. They keep talking about starting a human colony by cloning human genes. No one is talking about plant seeds or animal genes as apparently the humans in such colony are supposed to eat rock and sand!7. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST! THE PLAN A!!!!!!!! Oh my God, this is where i got offended. Plan A means relocating billions of people from earth to a distant planet. Apparently the professor knew it was bullshit but if Cooper was not smart enough to slap him in face for saying such nonsense, I do not know who would trust hims to pilot a spaceship?Nolan tried hard to recreate something like the Space Odyssey 2001 but the closest he got was the music of the movie! Worth watching but very stupid and forgettable.",2,6,11,23 November 2014
American Sniper," I wish there was a refund policy so I could get my money back
","I'm speechless for the amount of bullshit they tried to feed the audience with this movie and I am eager to know what order was behind the production of such a sham! I do apologize to the family of Chris Kyle (the real sniper) for writing this review in this tone, I know he was murdered recently and the pain is still fresh but I guess they made themselves ready when they sold the right of making a movie based on the deceased's book. Chris Kyle's book title is 'American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History' Autobiography of the most lethal... means the guy was so proud of being the most lethal and in my opinion, whoever is proud of being 'The Most Lethal', has serious mental problem, period! So we are not dealing with a hero, we are dealing with a 2 bit bully redneck who was brought up with guns shooting animals he was not going to eat... (I'm not against hunting but I believe if you kill an animal, you have to eat it! If you kill an animal for pure pleasure, you are mentally unstable). The cheesiness of the movie begins with Kyle being touched with seeing the news of bombing US embassy. Its' not pleasant for anyone to hear that a place got bombed and people got killed but his reaction looked like a senator from Senate's foreign affairs committee not a redneck somewhere in Texas. So he decides to sign up. Now what's the real version? He was probably a redneck out of job and options, signed up for military to get the sign up bonus and get his life on track, not heroic but respectable decision. He is being trained as seal. Good for him but even a kid knows that the identity of seals is almost kept secret if not top secret so a seal goes to the bar, drinking and probably speaking about the secrets of the U.S. Navy, that may happen but that is deemed as irresponsible act punishable under martial and even civilian law and I highly suspect that was not how he met his wife. People like to lie about these things and they have years to come up with a glorified version! I wouldn't be surprised if they originally met in a Yahoo! chat room! Now 9/11 happens. Again that senatorish look while seeing the news but I know what is behind that look 'Fuck! Now I have to go to war!!!' They go to Iraq. It's war, it's fair game. Americans kill Iraqis. Iraqi's kill American. On the battle field, none are evil, they just follow the orders and its fair game, its just business. No need to mention that USA was on the evil side, invading a country on totally unacceptable pretext! Like those of Hitler's on invading Poland. In Iraq Kyle meets his arch enemy. An Arab sniper who we never know who he was and for the rest of the movie he wants to hunt him down. He will eventually but I suspect that the whole story is fictitious. Kyle was not a hero. He enjoyed killing people as he enjoyed killing bucks, he was probably highly delusional who wrote an autobiography based on his delusions.Eastwood instead of trying to decipher a sniper's real personality and mix it with some events from the book so he can tell that the movie is based on actual events, decided to make a movies 100% based on Kyle's delusional book and capitalize on it in which he succeeded greatly. He did a great job of depicting the obsolete concept of 'Americans are always right and everyone else is evil and stupid' once more! By making this movie he put everyone in difficult situation. Kyle's family now have to hear these harsh word on their beloved decease, a murder suspect may not get impartial trial because of this movie. Who knows? maybe Kyle had some problems, maybe he was murdered while trying to bully a trouble veteran while given his record, no one would have questioned him. He was murdered in 2013 and a movie was made in 2014. Maybe Eastwood taught he was too old and for him its now or never.Overall an awful one dimensional movie, do not waste you money as I did! I wish there was a refund policy so I could get my money back!",1,32,74,31 January 2015
Fargo," Does not deserve the high reviews
","This movie does not deserve the high reviews despite the fact that it is reasonably entertaining. Problems are:1. This is suppose to be a serious crime movie not crime-comedy. While is not exactly a comedy, it grossly overdo the supposed to be but not so funny script and action. 'OH YEAH' is funny when the sheriff interviewing the pay girls but not funny beyond that point.2. Movie is full of scenes which are not contributing to the resolve of the movie in any way. Reminds me of Antonioni's Blow-up! Not that gross but still too much irrelevant scenes.3. Opening credit indicates that the movie is based on true story... a big lie.Overall not a bad movie but nothing special, just another movie, that's it!",5,1,8,11 August 2014
American Psycho," No hero, no nemesis, no direction!
","I've never read the book so I do not make a comment whether it was a good adaptation which if it was, I'm certain the book is also awful! Movie has no hero, no nemesis, no direction. Audience does not know what to expect. I would say the whole story is comparable to a movie like 'The Great Gatsby' a pointless body of motion picture trying to lure audience with scenes of ultra rich extravaganza! Movie is mostly talking heads with limited action, 75%+ of the movie is plain exposition, explaining everything but something relevant to the movie, absolutely nothing to root for. OK, it is a motion picture about the daily life of a rich psycho who kills people... so what? What is the message? What is the resolve? Where is the structure? Screenplay never followed the approved Hollywood guidelines, one simple flat line from start to finish so I wonder how did it pass the studio executives into production. The exposition was so weak that the audience may not realize that the movie occurs in late 80s not early 2000s, apparently the director assumed that everybody read the book and now wishes to see it on big screen. I barely finished the movie, it was pure waste of time and I do not recommend anybody to waste her time!",1,40,83,8 August 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," It is not overrated but it is not worthy of rating at all!
","I have a fantasy. Sometimes I imagine a film festival, not necessarily Oscars, just a festival. There are some nominees for awards of course. Then it comes to announce the winner, the hostess announces that no movie won the award as none were good enough to be worthy of consideration! It may be my fantasy but it reflects the reality of the movie business. Mind blowing movies are endangered breed these days and film festivals to continue their game are choosing between crap and crappier to award something to someone. Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the much debated movies of 2014 and won some awards, most likely it will find its way on Oscars too but does it deserve the buzz? The answer is BIG NO! The story is plain boring with with no emotional or mystery factor to encourage audience to watch it without getting bored till the end. Character development is crude and senseless. Cinematography is cheesy at best and there are insanely stupid mistakes/deficiencies in production such as English writing on everything even the temporary passport instead of German or Magyar! Seriously! LOBBY BOY???? Was it a movie or Pink Panther cartoon? Or maybe they taught the audience is illiterate and stupid! Young Mr Moustafa is very dark. Old Mr Moustafa is white! Hair gets grey by age but the skin only gets darker not whiter! The story is supposed to happen in year 1930 something. The Austria-Hungry empire has been collapsed for 15 years and yet in Captain Henckel's office (The police chief) we see the picture of emperor Franz Joseph of Habsburg dynasty and numerous other mistakes and deficiencies. I wonder how they managed to lure all these big names into an insanely stupid movie like this? And also I have zero ability to understand why critics acclaimed this movie. I would say a watchable movie, do not expect 'Grand Hotel' out of it, just a movie to watch and maybe go to sleep in the middle. 2/10!",2,9,18,16 December 2014
Gone Girl," Overrated with obvious holes in plot and very unsatisfying ending
","Too much was said about this movie so let's get to the point. 1. Granted that Amy was a troubled woman (we discover that when we find out how she framed her ex lover as being a rapist) but there was never a profound problem in her current marriage to summon such intense action. Don't forget that she officially and supposedly forever killed herself as Amy before she had to change the plan and she was not nobody but a successful writer from a rich family so if she was Amy the maid who wanted to kill Amy the maid after running away with some serious cash to re-invent herself as lats say Jane, I would buy the story. But Amy the successful writer from a rich family killing her name for a husband way inferior to her in social class, physically torturing herself, hitting herself on the cheek with hammer and to live in a cabin swarmed with bedbugs... that's just ridiculous! Nick appeared to be a good husband, actually he never wasted her wife's money as she claimed. All he did was having an affair which looked pretty normal given the state of their marriage. 2. VIDEO CAMERAS! We saw some scenes that she tried to play victim in front of the cameras but to make the scheme work, she had to access the records, modify them and etc, pretty much something like the 'Rising Sun' movie which was obviously out of the scope of her ability in this movie. The movie could work beautiful without those stupid and ridiculously plotted video cameras.3. Amy was recorded in the casino, a redneck couple just robbed her, a costumer in casino almost recognized her... so many traces left behind could easily lead to and expose her.4. The ending were the worst. My guess is that in original script, she was supposed to get caught but David Fincher decided to give it an intellectual ending and as a result, the script was hastily edited and of course some holes in the plot left behind. Probably he wished to aim for Oscars with this move which I hope he never wins ans he greatly ruined a could be great movie.",4,11,24,26 October 2014
Some Like It Hot," Don't watch this movie based on Billy Wilder's credentials
","I noticed that most people watch this movie solely because of 2 names. Billy Wilder and Marilyn Monroe although the real credit goes to Jack Lemmon who became a woman and played as a woman so good which I almost forgot he was Jack Lemmon! Jack Lemmon's performance was nothing short of a masterpiece dwarfing any subsequent similar attempts like Dustin Hoffman's in Tootsie so there is something very original and unique about this movie however even Jack Lemmon's mind blowing performance was not enough to cover the shitty screenplay, insane cheesiness and obvious deficiencies in production. Let's start from Miami. I have no problem that Wilder decided to film Miami in San Diego California. Palm trees are palm trees and the thing about the difference in direction of afternoon shadow on east coast and west coast in not something an ordinary audience would pick up immediately however filming the the movie in a famous landmark like 'Hotel Del Coronado' was an unforgivable insult to the audience's intelligence. That's something I never expected from Billy Wilder, a shameful disappointment. The second problem was character development or the character ark. Sugar Cane (Monroe) was a woman attracted to millionaires, yachts, private train cars and money of course. She was the best imitation of a shallow character. Now to make her fall in love with a 2 bit musician like Joe (Tony Curtis) was required a great character ark. Sugar Cane remained the shallow character till the very end. She fell in love with a fake millionaire or his fake money to be more precise as there was nothing lovely about the fake millionaire that Joe invented but his money. When Joe called her o say goodbye, she became upset and sad because she lost the millionaire. She never fell in love with the quality of kiss or sex, bottom line is that she never fell in love with Joe as a human being. What one could reasonably expect was shocking and emotional encounter between Sugar Cane but what really happened was a flat hasty encounter as Joe exposed himself in front of everyone and gave her the hasty and flat kiss. Based on what was developed (or not developed) in the movie, the logical response was anger and despise not that hasty baseless character ark in final minutes of the movie. It was so bad and cheesy that it could win an award of cheesiness and awfulness! Also nothing was cute about the humor, the flat humor was as childish as a Pink Panther cartoon which made the movie almost boring. 2 hours was a long time for such movie, a better editing and possibly trim it to 90 minutes could mask most of the problems so I would say the editing was a masterpiece of awfulness by itself. I don't know where the 8+ rating came, I can't find a reasonable answer why a serious film critic would give this movie anything more than 4. 3/10",3,5,12,30 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Gross negligence in quality, a trend of George Lucas!
","Six years gap between Episode I and III proved a great progress in digital technology as the CG special effects are incredibly improved over the video game worthy CG of the episode I although not perfect in any sense. For a movie bearing the title of Star Wars I expected ground breaking not just ordinary mainstream good special effects so in terms of special effects, although they are generally good but still a failure for such a movie however probably the biggest failure of the movie is weak acts. Scenario is nothing special, audience has the superior position and knows what would happen to Anakin, some stuff are answered like why the emperor got the disfigured face, why twins were separated, why Darth Vader got that look and some other stuff so the screenplay did not require much thinking. Generally the screenplay was descent but it grossly failed in character development. It failed to emotionally involve the audience with Anakin in his transformation from a Jedi to a dark lord probably because the acceleration of change was to slow so when it got to the point when Anakin killed master Windu, it looked very unnatural. Hayden Christensen's weak act complements to this defect in screenplay, he failed to deliver the intense emotion supposed to arise surrounding such action. After that he kneels before the emperor and without showing any emotion says 'Yes my master'... The whole point of him slipping into the dark side was his emotional attachments but exactly when he should show some emotion, he acts like a zombie and after that point, he kills even younglings without showing any emotion. The whole thing looks very unnatural. Also Ewan McGregor's performance when he finds out about Anaking killing younglings were extremely flat and emotionless... 'I can't believe what I see' he says that without showing a believable emotion when he should go insane! Another goof was that Obi Wan refers to the chancellor as EPEROR, I can't believe such thing could just slip past the multiple layers of scrip control. There is also another problem. In this movie we are dealing with millions of planets but the time required to travel between planets is ignored, most noticeable when the emperor arrives to the volcanic planet to save Anakin just after defeating Yoda. These things are more than goofs. Goofs are the defects which an ordinary audience can not detect easily but these defects are way to obvious giving the sense that Lucas was in hurry to finish the film and did not want to go the extra mile to change some stuff in screenplay so everything at least make sense and he could do that easily. Generally a good entertainment but gross negligence in quality, a well known trait of George Lucas!",5,0,2,22 September 2014
The Conjuring," The best horror movie in recent years!
","Hands down this was great! Just great! It couldn't be better. Of course there was some negligible issues like the voice of the demon/child or whatever you wish to call it. It was plain and hasty, it could be slower with more depth. Also the supposed to be 16mm footage was better to be filmed with real 16mm Bolex or something for authentic look and grain instead it was in HD and looked like a footage from a modern camcorder. The thing is that despite near perfect production, director failed to take us back to year 1971 but the movie was so great that these things are negligible. I would say 8/10 because of mentioned deficiencies and also because I've seen better movies like 'The Changeling (1980)'. Also there is something good to mention. I've seen lots of none christians complained about the movie based on what they call 'Christian Nonsense'. Well we can debate it forever but the fact is that the movie is primarily intended for United States and western hemisphere were the majority of people are church going christians. I'm certain if it was made in East Asia or a middle eastern country, they would have come to some sort of explanation based on their respected religion as what we saw in movies like Kwaidan (1964). As long as you believe in a supreme being and a demonic force in this world, you'll enjoy this movie. It was good as it was.",8,0,0,30 December 2014
Flight," Awesome movie sending a wrong message!
","Screenplay was perfect, acts were perfect, flight sequence was nothing short of masterpiece. I totally loved this movie, started to watch it 30 minutes past 12 in the midnight, I never hoped to watch all of it in one piece but I did, it really hooked me. But speaking from a pilot's point of view (Of course I do not fly commercial jets but the concept is the same), It was obvious that he drove the plane over it's mechanical limits on the pretext of getting it out of the storm faster but I strongly suspect that it was an over excitement caused by high dosage of Cocaine he sniffed to converse the alcohol effect, to be realistic, he put everyone's life in great danger by unnecessarily overriding the auto pilot and manually drive that show in first place. Now at the end of the movie we find out that a part in the tail section was worn off and was never changed, ran on that condition for almost 2 years, obviously a negligence from the airline but It is very likely that the speeding on ascent and put unnecessary pressure on the aircraft caused the already defected part to suddenly cease to work at that very same flight some 20 minutes later. Yes, he was skilled pilot, he managed to avoid an all out crash but also it was his fault in first place that the part ceased to function. His Alcohol and drug abuse led to his speeding on ascent, that put unnecessary pressure on the aircraft, as a result, already defected part ceased to function and catastrophe followed. So button line, he was not a hero, he just cleaned his own mess. He belonged to jail. The crash HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HIS DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. This is the thing that was never mentioned in the movie. Everyone accepted that the crash was act of God and some bad law driven feds were trying to convict a hero who saved 96 lives on pretext of him being intoxicated while piloting the plane. In that regard, movie was sending a wrong message so everything was awesome but the message was questionable.",7,1,2,31 January 2015
The Matrix," A pimp giant truck running on grossly non matching tires
","1. The portal between the Matrix and supposed to be the real world was extremely ridiculous, old phones ringing and that's it? seriously??? While the whole thing is pure fiction, within the boundaries of that fiction, audience expects to receive a reasonably believable action and/or explanation and in case of the portal, the thing is so cheap that is beyond any explanation so maybe that's why they just left it unexplained and I thank them for not attempting to insult my intelligence. It was 1930s cheap!2. Apparently the director(s) were into antiques. Old Lincoln car, old phones, old TVs... I love antiques too but using those stuff in the movie was like an unmatched patch on hole on pair of jeans! Some may find it fashionable but I say its just irrelevant, and it was an irrelevancy overdone!3. To elicit emotion in a good screenplay, hero and villain(s) should be fundamentally the same and that similarity should be explained early in the movie otherwise there would be no elicited emotion on audience side as a result of their conflict. In this movie there was absolutely no similarity between the hero and villain except a cheesy explanation near the end of movie which aside from being so cheesy, it was also too late and as a result, confrontations between Nemo and the agent throughout the movie were among the most senseless I've ever seen on big screen. It was good action (for year 1999) but that was it! no emotion, no excitement!4. Villains had no weakness(es). They could virtually do anything, there was no limit to their power. On scree writing point, the villain(s) of the movie were pure disaster and at the end, Nemo was dead! So he came to life again after the kiss of the true love (thank you for making me laugh a bit) and all the sudden he became the one who could do anything better that villains and destroyed them... really???If I want to explain this movie in a short sentence I would say I was a giant pimp truck running on mini copper tire on rear left, 18 wheeler tire of on rear right, regular truck tire on front left and no tire at all on front right! yes, it was that bad and yet it was successful because of the action and relatively innovative special effects for a time. Also for those who claim that the movie was philosophical... No it was not. The story was not new and there were numerous books and movies on the subject of what if this world is just a dream. That is an evergreen subject and this movie was just an attempt to capitalize on an evergreen subject.",3,1,5,17 August 2014
Contact," Not perfect but highly watchable
","Contact with alien life form is an ever green story concept for movies. There are 2 very distinct categories.The first type is actually showing the aliens. Among them the most recent was Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' which I have mixed feelings about or more traditionally the Star Wars or Star Trek series. The second type is not showing the aliens at all and often has some sort of open ending, probably the most famous is Kubrick's '2001'.Both types are considered a double sided blade. If the shown alien is not appealing enough or is not wrapped in properly sequenced mystery, it will be categorized as 2 bit science fiction and in case of unseen alien, the end of the movie may not be appealing to the target audience, the younger people.I recall the first time I got my hand on this movie, then on a VHS tape and I simply bypassed it because it looked too slow and talky for my age, I was 17 or 18. Now at age 34 I watched it and I really enjoyed it specially after seeing shams like Interstellar!The screenplay is solid with minimal holes. Everything has an explanation which passes to the audience mostly by vision not just words. Probably the most interesting part is the opening, the further we move from earth, the further we move back in time. I consider it a masterpiece, there is no narrative but just video, motion and it passes what it intends. I have to admit that I loved it and I got hooked immediately. The underlaying love story is touching and full of chemistry although it was never a main part of movie and virtually had nothing to do with the resolve. I'm not a scientist but as an space enthusiast I know some stuff about physics. Of course most of the scientific part was fiction but not in a bad way. One who is familiar with these things would only say 'Its possible'. Movie is rather long and with minimal action but never bores.Of course there is some issues. From the discovery of the alien machine plans to actually building it moved very fast which never happens in reality as just decoding the plans and manufacturing the parts takes years to achieve, no need to mention that some technologies need to be developed just to make parts even if the blue print is available otherwise every single industrial nation on earth would replicate the B2 bomber in 6 months. Making something out of a blue print is way different than the reverse engineering. That's forgivable as this is a movie and no one wants to see the beautiful Ellie to go to space in her 70s! Probably the biggest question mark is that why the tribunal in congress. The machine and the pod looked like intact after the experience so send another one to confirm. That was a real hole in the screenplay which could have been easily fixed by somehow destroying the machine after experience. a 500 billion dollar machine got destroyed and of course no one has the money to rebuild it but if the machine is intact which it was, all those things after the launch was nonsense. This is something that I can not bypass, there should be no holes in screenplay, if there is hole, movie loses stars and this one lost one star for that.The second star was lost because of failure to come with a logical explanation why the aliens sent the blueprint. She traveled through multiple wormholes to another universe to see an alien disguised himself as her dad in Pensacola. And that illusion actually said nothing to her nor showed anything and sent her back. That small steps he mentioned actually was not a step at all however I can not blame Carl Sagan (Author of the novel) and other people who were involved with the story as it is extremely complicated. Even Kubrick couldn't close his infamous 2001 properly. Highly watchable movie but I would like to see more refined ending and reasoning if not perfect. 7/10",7,0,1,16 December 2014
