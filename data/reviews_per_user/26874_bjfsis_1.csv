Walk the Line," Walk the Line
","I just watched Walk the Line and I have to say that it is one of Reese Witherspoons best movies...if not the best. I love her in anything she does but she really shined in this. Portraying an icon has to be hard and having to learn to sing and play an instrument is no easy task but both Phoenix and Reese rose to the occasion. Hats off to you both for such a wonderful movie and an awesome job. I have always been a fan of both Johnny Cash and June Carter but this movie made me an even greater fan that I went out and bought every CD I could find that they made. This movie, mixed with comedy, drama, and a little rock and roll was amazing. I hope everyone out there enjoys it as much as I did.",10,0,0,11 March 2006
