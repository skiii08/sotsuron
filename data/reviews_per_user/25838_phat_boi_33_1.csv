Scarface," Scarface
","In the movie Scarface money equals power because how much money you have means how powerful you are and because after Tony gets money people start gunning for him because of his power. In addition to if you don't have money in the drug game then you have nothing.I've only had one other experience with this film and it is that I have seen the edited version of it. This is what intrigued me to watch the unedited vision.In this movie how much money you have means how powerful you are. This is proved in three essential parts. When they are in the club Tony and Frank are talking about the other people around them. Frank states that all these people are powerful because of how much money they have. This proves that money equals power. Then again at the beach Tony tells Manny first you go to have the money then you get the power. Even Tony knows that money comes first then you get the power. Last way is shown with Elvira and Tony. Tony is trying to impress her with his money because he knows the only thing Elvira likes is power and in the drug game if you have money then you have power. So with all the money he has made him a very powerful person and he uses that to his advantage.Also in this movie if you have money and power then eventually people are going to start gunning for you. This is shown because after Tony starts to get all the money and power his own boss Frank even turns on him. Frank tries to have Tony killed at the night club because Tony was becoming more powerful then Frank. This is also shown at the end when Tony thinks since he has so much power he can do whatever he wants, but when he crosses Alejandro Sosa Tony is wrong. Tony thinks Sosa isn't going to mess with him because he is such a powerful drug dealer in America. Yet Tony is dead wrong. The power Tony gets throughout the movie eventually leads to his death.Money is very key in the drug game. You could not buy any drugs if you didn't have any money and then you would get anywhere. This is shown with Tony and Manny in the first couple scenes. They are very poor and have to live in the freedom place with all the other Cuban that immigrated. They were doing whatever to get out of this freedom camp and when the deal came along they took it. All Tony and Manny had to do was kill a man for a little bit of cash and passports. This was the started of they rise to the top and it all began with a little money. If you have no money in the drug game then you have nothing.In every situation in everyday life money will always equal power because even thought they say money cant buy happiness in this movie it did.",9,0,1,19 January 2006
