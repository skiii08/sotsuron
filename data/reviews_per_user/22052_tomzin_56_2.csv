Vertigo," Hitchcock's Best!
","A detective (James Stewart), who suffers from severe acrophobia after a horrific accident, is hired to follow a wealthy friend's, deeply troubled wife, Madeline.Madeline is an extremely beautiful woman (a typical Hitchcock chick), and as you would expect the detective finds himself becoming obsessed with the mysterious woman.The movie sounds basic when you try and explain it, but it is very well planned and a great thriller to watch. It has magnificent twists as you would expect from a Hitchcock movie.You will find yourself becoming obsessed with it... I think I am...",Null,3,6,7 August 2004
Psycho," Would've been scary for 1960's audiences...
","I really enjoyed this movie!Before I saw this movie I had a pre-conceived idea that it would be absolutely terrifying (as I did before seeing The Exorcist).Putting the movie in context with its time (1960), I actually realized that it was really frightening!In 1960, this movie sent people fleeing down the theatre aisles.The murder scenes are very creative in terms of angles used, even though they won't scare you, as today we've been de-sensitised by movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.However, the psychological aspect of the movie and of course the mystery is what will entertain you, no blood and guts here.The movie really pioneered the idea of mental illness as the killer, moving away from crimes of passion and greed being motives.Watch this movie and then appreciate it for being a pioneer of all the great thriller and horror movies we have now.",Null,0,1,7 August 2004
