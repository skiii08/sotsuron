The Blair Witch Project," grade B student-film
","This is by far the most overated, completely stupid piece of student-film crap I have ever seen hyped onto a big motion picture screen. Scarey?! All it did was make me seasick. The numerous film parodies of this story which have followed only confirm how goofy this film is . I live in Maryland and it would be impossible to get lost in the woods for hours, much less days - witch or no witch!",Null,6,11,19 July 2002
First Man," Gosling is No Neil Armstrong
","You would think that a film about one of our nation's great pioneering heroes would be so uplifting it would leave the audience clapping. Not this one. It does do an excellent job of chronicling Neil Armstrong's brave, death-defying career. But fails to reach orbit due to one fatal flaw: Ryan Gosling.He is terribly miscast as an almost anti-hero. I thought his monotonous sourpuss was bad enough in Bladerunner 2049. But it returns again to cast a rainy day on this film. Gosling comes off as mysteriously brooding, sullen, if not clinically depressed. Maybe spacy? But not in a good sense.I grew up in the glorious Apollo years and saw the real Neil Armstrong on TV plenty of times. The character Gosling crafted has little resemblance. I doubt he even studied archival interviews with the first man on the moon. Armstrong was terribly shy, soft spoken, but had a wry sense of wit about him. In fairness, Armstrong's children do say his cold family interactions are correctly portrayed.That said, the film has a good pace and dramatically captures the mind-numbing dangers and claustrophobia of early manned spaceflight. So, it's worth watching just the get an insight into the barnstorming years of NASA's space race with the Soviets.However, the Apollo 11 moon landing at the end is terribly anti-climactic. We just see Gosling wandering around. The only flash of creativity is to have him do a 360-degree pan of the desolate Tranquility base landing site.The controversial omission of erecting the American flag, according to director Damien Chazelle, was to focus on 'loss and sacrifice and failure.' Guess what Mr. Chazelle, American is built on bold pioneering efforts that always involved loss, sacrifice and failure. Nothing worth doing is ever easy. It's presumptuous of the director to take the 'glass half empty' preachy tone, and therefore dismiss such an iconic image of American 'can-do' technological prowess.Unlike the film Apollo 13, this film is easily forgettable.",4,18,27,2 February 2019
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sleazy Rider
","Those reviews that call this sophomoric toilet humor are blind to its biting satire.This is a wicked and devastatingly ingenious comical rewind of the 1969 'Easy Rider.' Borat's wacky adventure puts him in touch with the real Americana.In doing so it paints a grotesque 'Picture of Dorian Gray' portrait of the frivolous, discomfortingly and ugly side of America.Unlike in 'Easy Rider,' Borat doesn't reserve this for the easiest targets: narrow minded and provincial southerners. He starts with New Yorker feminists and winds up on Los Angeles' Sunset Strip. In between we get an unvarnished look at frat boys, evangelicals, and bigots.The American anthem vignette at the rodeo is both devastating funny and frightening. Likewise, the dinner club conversation.OK, so it's done at some people's expense. That's a small price for holding up a mirror to ourselves and seeing how out our narcissistic culture is perceived by the rest of the world.",10,6,9,4 November 2007
The Others," somwhat predictable copycat
","This is a gloomy and ponderous movie that is a blatant rip-off of `the Sixth Sense'. It has very little  edge-of-seat spook-house stuff. Instead, the overdone music score keeps trying to make it seem more scary than it looks. The true situation of the children was predictable halfway through the movie.",Null,0,0,19 July 2002
Brokeback Mountain," Flawed Classic
","This is a top-quality motion picture, beautifully filmed, astutely edited, largely well-acted, with an outstanding music score.However, the film is inexplicably crippled by the way the character Ennis Del Mar is played by Heath Ledger. Thought one of the two lead characters  and having the most screen time - - he mumbles his way through the film and is frequently barely understandable. This becomes a significant distraction. It disengages viewers trying to follow the drama.His persona is equally distracting. I have known several terribly shy people but never one so acutely introverted they come off as clinically depressed. So the viewer is distracted again wondering what's wrong with this guy. It's not just his sexual adventures.Finally, the screenplay gave me little insight into homosexuality in the 60s and 70s. All I came away with is that these two guys are confused, frustrated and fearful about the deadly consequences of leading an openly gay lifestyle. The Jack Twist character hits it off so well with women I don't know if the two cowboys are bisexual, homosexual, or experimenting heterosexuals, or *whatever.* Sensitive as the film is, it doesn't help in building gay social acceptance. Also, I can't remember a film about a heterosexual love affair where the where the cheaters get so much sympathy while they deceive and hurt others.",6,1,20,6 January 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," One of a Kind
","Ingenious script, brilliant acting, exquisite editing, dramatic sets, unforgettable scenes, all rolled into a bulls-eye satire courageously made deep in the black heart of the Cold War. Why can't they make movies nearly as good as this today? (and on a $2 million budget!)",Null,1,2,5 October 2002
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Blood Lust
","This is simply one of the ABSOLUTELY WORST films I have ever wasted two precious hour of my life on. If you have any doubt Tim Burton is a total weirdo, this seals it. This goes over the top, even for him.Only O.J. Simpson could watch this film with any comfort. I lost count after endless throat slashings and buckets full of squirting blood, which simply left me squirming in my seat. This film will give you nightmares.The only unintentional comic relief comes from Borat's Sacha Baron Cohen, who is guaranteed to send giggles though the audience. His character briefly allows you to come up for air in this otherwise morbid, dreary tale.And as a musical no less?! Get real. 'My Fair Lady' has no worries about being eclipsed. I've heard better tunes from stray cats.Johnny Depp sort of makes you imagine that Edward Scissorshands has grown up into a shaving blade wielding serial killer.This is a relentlessly grim, dark, grimy film that is monotone from start to finish. The final scene betrays sort of a blood-fetish by Burton, and is nauseatingly disgusting.",1,10,29,26 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Bores
","I enjoyed this movie, but despite the whiz-bang effects it is light-years away from the magic that propelled the original `Star Wars' to such phenomenal popularity in 1977. The original film had a tightly edited pace that never let you catch your breath. It was full of well -timed humor, suspense, playful dialogue among an effervescent cast, and loaded with action. It was a cinematic roller-coaster ride. The 1977 film shamelessly and openly stole from the best of the movie action-adventure genre, and was even a bit of a self-parody.In contrast, it takes AOTC 90 minutes to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph. It's a bit glum, serious, pretentious. It completely lacks the sparkle, dynamics and camaraderie among the actors in the original Star Wars. The `love scenes' are so dull I actually reclined and closed my eyes. Do we REALLY have to sit through this soap opera for Luke Skywalker & Princess Leia to be born?! The poor Jedi Knights, described so intriguingly by Alec Guiness in the first film, come off about as excitingly as watching a board meeting (yes they finally, finally kick butt in the late scenes). For example, Yoda tells one Jedi to `go meditate' to figure out who altered a star map. Sheesh, what edge-of-the-seat adventure! For being so smart the eclectic Jedi Club seem clueless. No wonder they got wiped out.Poor R2D2 and C3PO look like excess baggage in AOTC. They originally were supposed to provide continuity among ALL three trilogies, but they have been diminished to bit players, props. In the original Star Wars the interplay between R2D2 and C3PO was a wonderfully endearing `Laurel and Hardy' comic relief that kept giving the movie a `kick in the pants' when needed. (Yes, C3PO can be annoying, but at least he has an `off' switch, unlike Jar-Jar)It's also weird watching this film plod along toward what you know is GOING to happen in the second trilogy. It's about as suspenseful as watching a WWII documentary. You know exactly how the good guys win, and that poor Aniken is headed toward being a walking `iron lung' machine (not too soon for my tastes). There are lots of fun scenes and memorable dialogue from the original film. These latest two installments in the first trilogy are largely forgetful, take themselves too seriously, and are glacial in pace. They sputter away from the electricity of the first Star Wars not long after the opening scrolling story text.",Null,0,1,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Must be a 'Ring-Thing'
","OK, I never ready the books. Without that preparation I found the film just plain dull, ponderous and dragged-out. The first 30 minutes are a especially boring. I'm told it's faithful to the book. So what? It makes a lousy movie for the uninitiated. My teenagers, who are heavy into fantasy gaming, were equally bored. None of us have any desire to see the 2nd installment.",Null,0,0,5 October 2002
Knowing," Wish I had the psychic power to have known this film totally stinks
","This nonsensical film is an amalgam of story elements stolen from such films as 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' 'Close Encounters,' 'The Sixth Sense,' Signs,' and 'AI.' Even worse it blatantly rips off an Arthur C. Clarke science fiction novel. The film ham handedly tries to get a jump start on the 2012 'end of world' paranoia (from the Mayan calendar). And, piggybacking on the popularity of 'The Da Vinci Code,' can't resist flirting with Biblical allusions.The story about a little girl's prognostication over future disasters will keep you riveted through much of the film. But in the last 20 minutes the film takes a hard left turn and goes off a cliff. The mystery that develops through most of the movie is left unsolved and will leave you going 'WTF?!'Instead, all we are let with is a horribly unsatisfying 'alien ex machina' closing that makes you feel you've totally wasted 2 hrs of your life. My family (sci-fi buffs BTW) was so mad that they wanted to throw rotten tomatoes at the screen. I've enjoyed all of Nicholas Cages's movies, and he does his best with this totally screwball doomsday yarn that, needless to say, is scientifically impossible. The closing scenes are taken straight out of the Arthur C. Clake novel 'Childhood's End,' and his family should sue for plagiarism.",1,5,12,2 August 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," FUN-FILLED WILD RIDE
","At last! the return of an outrageous, rambunctious, tightly paced and funny adventure flick that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't mind being a self-parody.I am so grateful that T3 does not get bogged down with the hokey mysticism of the new `Star Was' trilogy, the pseudo-techno babble of `The Matrix', and the sappy self-indulgent New Age-ism of the 'Star Trek' series.
It's just a good old beat-em-up, shoot-em-up yarn with a simple theme: artificial intelligent machines hate us and they're relentlessly bent on killing us. Period. Without getting itself sidetracked on boring detail, this trilogy finally acknowledges that the past can't be changed. All the characters are trapped in a time-paradox -- something awkwardly glossed-over in the dismal `Time Machine' remake.Arnold will go down in history as making more money per spoken word than any actor since silent films. His one-liners are devastating.  What more does a robot have to say? The choice of a female Terminator was inevitable, and pretty Kristanna Loken really plays it straight with a chilling determination.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
Enchanted," Disney self-parody is enjoyable adventure for the whole family
","When I first saw the trailer for this film I had my doubts that it would ever fly. The idea of turning Disney fantasy characters into real people running around New York City seemed clumsy and silly.The film soared way past my expectations. It is a wild ride from start to finish and offers nonstop laughter for child and adult alike. Between all the unrelenting humor it offers a simple and tender message of love and acceptance that is understandable by people of all ages.Kudos go to actress Amy Adams who very plausibly fulfills how one might expect a Disney fantasy heroine to behave once turned into flesh and blood. Her talents really make the whole outlandish story work.The cute self parodies on all the elements from classing Disney-adapted fairy tales are too numerous to go into here, but they give the film a buoyancy and bubbly never-ending pace.My only small criticism is that the talented Susan Sarandon was underutilized in her role as the wicked queen. Her henchman, played by Timothy Spall, wasn't nearly as funny or engaging in the screen time allotted. One can imagine an energetic cat-and-mouse chase around Manhattan between the queen and the princess.It's been a very long time since I'm seen a children's film so complete enjoyable, funny and touching. I was beginning to lose hope after sitting through the very un-funny 'Bee Movie.' No wonder it was released a couple weeks earlier. In terms of pure entertainment, this film is light-years ahead of that insipid clunker.",9,1,3,21 November 2007
Avengers: Endgame," An 'Endgame' without much of an ending.
","This latest of the Avengers series is pretty predictable because it is so formulaic: a convoluted set of story strings that must come together at the end, gratuitous little interpersonal dramas, and lots and lots of explosions, fistfights, and a pseudo battle of Armageddon. Also, predictably, the final battle must invoke Deus ex machina to save the day.It's too bad that a lot of engaging actors and Marvel characters are wasted on such an insipid, uninspiring script.The God wannbe, Thanos, is a boring and not a terribly scary sci-fi villain. He looks like a World Wrestling Federation refugee who overdosed on steroids. And, the quest for the five magic stones that give power over the entire universe sounds like a gimmick straight out of an adolescent-level video game.The first 60 minute takes forever to ramp-up. And the viewer is lost without remembering the previous installment,'Infinity War.' After a padded full three hours of superhero antics - so many superheroes I can't keep them straight - the ending is dismally anticlimactic. Killing off Iron Man seems terribly misplaced. And, just to drag out the boredom, it follows up with a painfully long shot of all the super heroes - clad in black - at a funeral that is, well, deadly.A forgettable fractured sci-fi yarn.",Null,149,256,17 August 2019
District 9," Dark humor for video game generation
","What kills this vastly overrated film from the start is that it is the most nonsensical plot I've ever seen in sci-fi cinema. What's more, it has the most hapless extraterrestrials ever seen on screen since those water-phobic melon-heads from 'Signs.'The story is allegorical to mankind's cruelty: genocide, racism, and intolerance. But the aliens should have been smart enough to known that before the came to this backward little planet.These masters of the universe live in shantytown slums and eat cat food, even though they brought far-future weapon technology with them. What demolishes credulity is that an alien species is advanced enough to travel light-years to Earth and then inexplicably gets stranded in South Africa of all places. In all of anthropology there has never been a case of an advanced society being subjugated by a less advanced society.Their city-sized mothership, inspired by the film 'Independence Day,' just hovers like it's out of gas. The Air Force does not even tow it to Area 51, despite the fact it clutters airspace for 20 years.Even more bizarre, the aliens' ticket home relies on a pint of some inexplicable black liquid that also inexplicably turns humans into aliens. Gee, a floor wax and a desert topping too!This is so outrageously nutty, that for the first 30 minutes I though it was some tongue-in-cheek parody, like 'RoboCop.' The plot just lunges along with lots of bullets and mayhem. The cinematography and editing is modeled after a Halo-style shoot-'em-up video game. Not doubt to hook younger viewers.The aliens are very well done as CG characters, even if they look like the Terminix man's worst nightmare. Thank God they don't speak English, unlike those sappy Star Trek humanoids.",1,33,76,22 August 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Muddled Earth
","This second part of the Rings trilogy is better than the first installment, but that's not saying much. There is no excuse for a film that is so complicated and convoluted you must read the book before going to the film. Or, they should include a `Guide to Middle Earth' with each ticket purchase. Just like the story's walking trees, the film lumbers along slowly and awkwardly. The editing is a bore, the dialogue is a bore, the characters, with a couple exceptions, are a bore. Gorgeous vistas, elaborate effects don't make up for such a dark, ponderous, pretentious and emotionally flat film. In three monotonous hours absolutely nothing brought me to the edge of my seat. Even comic relief was sparse for and adventure yarn. The much-touted climatic battle scenes are unremarkable. They are just plain cluttered with a godzillion warriors milling around like ants at a picnic. 
Unless you're a Toliken buff, this film is marginally entertaining if you've got nothing better to do for three hours. Just go find yourself a nice soft theater seat that *reclines.* You're in for a snooze between fight scenes.",Null,0,0,29 December 2002
The Lion King," beautiful but low-voltage as compared to the original
","For those of you who grew up with the 1994 animated Lion King, this film is nice trip down memory lane. It's worth watching just for the exquisitely beautiful CG effects that are completely indistinguishable from reality - making the film a real landmark in cinema effects history.But, unlike the original cartoon-animated Lion King, the film falls flat on fun-loving excitement. The characters aren't as lively, and maybe this is due to the constrains of re-telling the story with photo-realism.Also, parts of the film are too dark for a young audience. The hyenas will give kids nightmares, the evil Scar is as creepy as the Grim Reaper.Inexplicably, one of the funniest side-splitting scenes from the original was changed to the point of being terse. This is the scene were Timone dresses in a hula skirt and plays a ukulele to distract the hyenas. Why change it at all? Was the idea of Timone dressing in drag considered tasteless, or un-PC?Similarly, the three hyenas came off as four-legged Three Stooges in the original film. But that nyuk-nyuk slapstick goes missing in the remake.A wonderfully illustrated film that lacks comic energy of the original.",5,0,1,22 July 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Deeply moving but lethargic
","This is an outstanding film from the point of editing, cinematography, screenplay, set design and visual effects. No wonder it got so many Academy Award nominations.The screenplay's story of how ephemeral life is with all its loving and poignant moments makes this film unique and timeless.My only criticism is that the plot is lethargic, and monotonous. This would have been a better movie if shortened to no more than 120 minutes. It boringly shuffles between New Orleans and New York, and a few other points of interest. But the film's journey across the decades is a snooze and largely forgettable, unlike the rhythm, buoyancy and electricity of 'Forrest Gump.'",5,1,2,9 August 2009
Men in Black II," neuralizes your brain
","This movie is OK if you want to 'neuralize' your intellect for 88 minutes for some mildy amusing mindless fun. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones make the movie survivable. However, it is pretty bad when a dog gets all the good laugh lines! I found the first film completely forgettable, and this goes the same way. Must be that neuralizer again!",Null,0,0,19 July 2002
Paranormal Activity," No one can hear you scream ('cause it's so deadly boring)
","This is yet another 'Blair Witch Project' copycat that is seeking to maximize bucks for minimal expense and effort – except when it come to viral web marketing.It is 'Blair Witch Goes Suburban,' where café lattes, wine, a flat screen TV and plush furniture replace roughing it by camping in the Maryland woods. The film fails miserably at any kind of horror unless you get scared at lots of loud thumps, gratuitous screams, and things being pulled with transparent fishing line. The only brief attempt at horror-show is some cheesy imagery that is shamelessly stolen straight from 'The Exorcist.' The ghoul makeup was supplied courtesy of the Wal-Mart Halloween aisle.It has boring, repetitious and claustrophobic cinematography – if you can barely call it that -- given that most of the videography involves running up and down the stairs ad nauseam.It's really hard to get spooked about the self-imposed cage the couple puts themselves inside in the middle of San Diego. Don't these saps have friends to stay with? At least take a walk!The bedroom scenes are monotonous and predictable. The two-person cast is so whiny and bitchy they soon grate on your nerves and you're rooting for the demon to finish the job. The boyfriend's macho response to all the creepy antics is impossibly implausible. A wimpy psychic offers a brief diversion, but soon we're back to prowling the modest sized house that is anything but a haunted mansion.This Blair Witch genre is so insipid I wish it would just die. But the old adage still holds, 'there's a sucker born every minute.'",1,24,42,26 October 2009
Everest," Snow Job
","Having read John Krakauer's account of the doomed Everest climb in his book 'Into Thin Air' I was anticipating a much more dramatic film with a gripping script. The wonderful ensemble of actors didn't have much to work with. The film is monotone with no edge-of-seat moments -- given the life-or-death extreme setting. And not much of a dramatic soundtrack either. The film has no cadence at all and just comes off as a flat docudrama. The only highly emotional moment is when a dying Rob Hall makes a final call to his wife in New Zealand. I am especially disappointed that a compelling part of Krakauer's narrative is almost completely left out. If there is one pivotal anti-hero in this story it is the NY socialite Sandy Pittman Hill. She's accused of causing many of the crucial delays to the other clients' ascent. Without these delays the climbers likely would have likely gotten back to base camp before the storm came. The film shows one of these critical delays in the absence of rope lines being fixed to the summit. But the film never bothers to explain why this happened. In reality Pittman's distraction of the Sherpa responsible for installing rope lines is to blame – at least according to Krakauer. This would have made for high drama, but the filmmakers inexplicably show her character in just a few brief shots. One wonders if they were threatened with a libel suit by Pittman, or simply co-opted by her when, I assume, they interviewed her for background.The blend of special effect and cinematography is excellent, and it's not to be missed in 3D. But the story suffers from lack of oxygen.",3,39,57,3 October 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," Unparalleled Sci-Fi Classic
","This is a profoundly intellectual and stylized motion picture that will remain a classic for all cinema history, long after all other space sci-fi yarns have been forgotten.OK, so the film has a horribly glacial pace, especially when compared to most of today's films that obsessively whirl by at a frantic pace. The sequel '2010' has a faster pace, but is an utterly forgetful movie. Also '2001' may be too cerebral and abstruse in this age where people swoon over computer special effects gimmicks in intellectually vacuous adventure flicks. Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke crafted an epic story: The ascent of man from ape to human to 'superman.' The influence of an unseen extraterrestrial intelligence drives this evolution.Also, Clarke was an award-wining science fiction author, not some Hollywood scriptwriting hack who butchers classic science fiction stories for screen adaptation. The ending is weird only because Kubrick realized he could never show the extraterrestrials without it looking hoaky. This is as impossible as showing the face of God. And, attempts in all other sci-fi 'E.T.' films have failed miserably, including the overrated 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'So, '2001' becomes a bit abstract with the hotel room 'cage' in the final scenes. Likewise, the legendary Black Monolith is a perfect representation of extraterrestrial technology: complete unfathomable. Critics miss the subtlety that Kubrick was painting a bland picture of the techno-world of 2001, with boring, everyday bureaucrats and space jocks caught up in a fantastic civilization-altering event that is much larger that they can comprehend. Hence the low-key acting and dialog. The film is impeccable and perfect for accuracy and attention to detail ands goes to astronomical lengths to assemble a plausible and realistic vision of the future. The cinematography and set design, done all in the Cinerama screen aspect ratio, is unparalleled in sci-fi film history. But the film is showing its age in a few areas. 1. the psychedelic 'stargate' trip at the end cements the film in the hippy-dippy 1960s. 2. The notion of a sentient all powerful HAL mainframe computer predates microprocessors. So there will never be such an all-controlling computer. But there will eventually be artificial intelligence that will blur the notion of a what it means to be a consciousness entity. 3. Though visionary, the film did not foresee women's liberation. There are no women characters except for flight attendants. Of course the Soviets, which were a step ahead in women's equality in the 1960s, have a couple of astrophysicist characters in the film. 4. The great lengths the government goes through for secrecy, like not telling the Discovery crew about the monolith (!?), is overly melodramatic and implausible. 5. The attempts to re-create a zero-gravity were clever for the time, but look pretty pasty now that we have real footage of astronauts in space.",10,2,7,20 April 2008
Avatar," Star Wars meets Dinotopia meets the Abyss
","Like the original 1977 'Star Wars,' this film at last raises the bar in terms of crafting a breathtakingly beautiful and mesmerizing alien world and its creatures. I predict there will be several copycat films that try to cash in on the Avatar 'look,' and the film certainly will have a cult following. Though the movie is over two hours long, it presents such a rich tapestry and lively pace it flows by quickly. The film is so visually overwhelming that the storyline became secondary to me. No other sci-fi film in memory has so convincingly woven together and entire alien biosphere and pre-technological civilization. When I saw the blue 'Smurfs-on- steroid' aliens in the trailers, I was afraid this would be a sappy tale. It is anything but. Many elements from Cameron's earlier films are obvious. Sigourney Weaver looks and acts like she just shipped out after her adventure in the movie 'Aliens.' The bioluminescent creatures of the moon Pandora are reminiscent of the aliens in 'The Abyss.' The fighter ships come straight from 'Terminator.' Cameron also heavily borrows designs from the 'Dinotopia' fantasy book series.What I do find tiring is the heavy-handed environmentalism message that seems a prerequisite for otherworld fantasy films today. There is even a veiled allusion to the Bible's Tree of Life. Apparently the moon Pandora is a living Garden of Eden. That is, until those greedy, warlike, and arrogant humans come along. This is where the story gets weak and horribly contrived. The moon has some magnetic superconducting element not found anywhere else in the galaxy. And, the natives of Pandora just happen to be living on top of it. Talk about location, location, location.Never mind that the universe is collectively made of exactly the same bricks and mortar found in the periodic table of the elements. Or, that transporting an exotic element to Earth across interstellar space would be ridiculously expensive. It would be vastly cheaper to synthesize it on Earth.The film draws obvious parallels to the decimation of Native Americans by the New World colonists. The military bad guy's are straight out of Cameron's 'The Abyss.' Apparently humans are so evil they not only would strip mine a planet but also decimate its inhabitants. In reality our scientists would always have the upper hand in such a discovery simply because Pandorans don't vote for Congressmen. A moon like this would be just an astrobiology curiosity. It's totally implausible that any private corporation would have the resources to mount an interstellar gold rush.These story shortcomings aside, 'Avatar' is still a powerfully engaging and memorable film. It's a long-awaited break from much less imaginative and utterly moronic story lines in most contemporary sci-fi films, such as 'District 9' and '2012.'",10,17,27,27 December 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Appeals to All Ages With a Style, Wit and a Gentle Message
","After squirming through some real losers like 'Bee Movie', this is the most enjoyable children's film I've seen in several years.I watched it with my 5 yr-old grandson and both of us were equally engaged and entertained from start to finish. That's quite a stretch and no small task for today's audiences.I went to the cinema expecting to snooze through some sappy 'boy meets dragon' Lassie tale. But the story is astutely pulled together with sophistication, sensitivity, and a lot of excitement.Why this movie succeeds: 1. The main characters are endearing and simply don't come with any saccharine cutesiness. Jay Baruchel captures the character of 'Hiccup' with a wit and style that doesn't pander to youngsters or is otherwise gratuitous.2. The dragon 'Toothless' thankfully doesn't talk, sing, or act like a human covered in scales. It doesn't exude some sappy puppy dog love. Nor pop philosophy, which made the film 'Dragon Heart' mawkish. Toothless simply acts as an intelligent creature that communicates though an enchanting range of expressions.3. The film has one nicely simply yet deep message for kids: treat all forms of life with respect, kindness and empathy. The film doesn't try to monotonously cram some New Age or politically correct rhetoric down your throat, as 'Wall-E' did.4. The editing and pacing is superb. There is never a dull moment. The film zooms along with nonstop action, adventure, fun and dry wit. It is visually stunning in 3D.Don't wait for the DVD.",10,6,11,27 March 2010
Total Recall," Total-ly Revolting
","This sci-fi tale of 'is it real or is it Memorex?' had interesting potential. But is suffers from wretched excesses: gratuitous violence, endless filthy language, and a preoccupation with stupid-looking rubber doll puppets that can got through all kind of improbably grotesque distortions. This is a hard-edge film that simply is uncomfortable to watch. It should have been 'terminated' for gross stupidity and a high 'yuck' factor.",Null,1,4,23 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Matrix Re-tread
","Unless you're a Matrix devotee this movie will leave you clueless and lost in cyberspace. It's a lot of gloss wrapped around a truly stupifying tale. For example, the closing monologue by the character called 'The Architect' is unintelligible to at least 95% of the audience.The Matrix mystique is built on a simple scheme to copy action elements from adventure, kung-fu and sci-fi films and blend them together into a 'cyber-wars' yarn. this virtual reality world allows the filmmakers to showcase a lot of wild special effects, which unfortunately have become a cliche'. The story has about as much intellectual ballast as a ride on a roller coaster.",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
War of the Worlds," short-sells Wells' classic
","Regrettably, Spielberg's style and H.G. Wells drama mix like oil and water in this screenplay. Absolutely gorgeous and faithful special effects aside, this film should have had the style, frenzy and pace of the 1997 'Independence Day,' which is more of a tribute to Well's work than this hybrid.The entire freakin' earth is being torched by Martians but we the viewer are mostly stuck taking a snail's pace walk through New York State and presumably Connecticut. We mostly watch a lot of dispossessed people screaming and running and getting stomped on by the tripod Martian war machines, which take the place of Godzilla in similar Japanese film shots. Almost too soon, we end up at townhouse in Boston's Back Bay which is inexplicably spared the Martian wrath. Instead, the Martian war machines, are stumbling around like drunks, with absolutely no dramatic buildup to their demise, as in the closing chapter in the Wells novel.Far too much of the film dwells on Cruise's mundane family issues. I can't help but think that Cruise insisted on a quota of screen time minutes so that he could do such insipid things as sing a Beach Boys song as a lullaby, and engage in everyday banter with his son as to why he's such a lousy dad. He's so worried about this he doesn't even attempt to turn on a radio or TV to see what The President has to say about the End of the World. He instead struggles with making peanut butter sandwiches. We know nothing about what lead to the family breakup, and so are left as voyeurs as the world comes crashing all around them. The wicked Martian invasion plays second fiddle to watching Tom Cruise sort out these commonplace parenting issues with his two children. The need for this kind of story thread is a classic Spielberg flaw. It similarly skewed 1977 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' In fairness, Spielberg does show respect for the Well's novel (unlike the abysmal 2002 Time Machine remake). There are some wonderfully horrific scenes reminiscent of his style in Jaws, but there just aren't enough of them, thanks to Mr. Cruse's control, I suspect.Some wonderful cinematic opportunities are lost: 1. Some sort of Armageddon-ish, large scale battle with the U.S. military. Barely a couple lines a dialogue talk about the Martian's having invincible force fields (introduced in the 1950 George Pal version) but that battle is left to the imagination. Even the George Pal version built up to nuclear bomb drop on a Martian 'nest.' Instead, we get few low-budget Humvees burning up and a lot of Army reservists doing crowd control.2. An attack on NYC as described in the 1939 Orson Wells' radio version: i.e. war machines wading across the Hudson River and stalking up Broadway, gassing everyone in there wake.3. The chilling emergence of a living Martian from their landing craft in the pit. The disastrous first encounter with the military, and the emergence of the war machine from the landing pit.4. The dramatic military showdown between a battleship and a wading war machine, where the ship blows off the head of the machine.5. The snake-line arm that feels its way around the cellar, rather than a return of Pal's roaming remote TV snake.What's especially annoying is the film's inane plot scenario, which is even worse than the water-allergic aliens in 'Signs.' The Martians buried zillions war machines on earth one million years ago. Yeah sure. They had a million years to evolve and think about a minor inconvenience like biocontamination, and still didn't get it? They also patiently wait to humans to arise, pollute and pave over the planet (not to mention building military weapons) and then decide to invade?No doubt their final word was a big Homer Simpson 'Doh!'",1,1,3,3 July 2005
Joker," No Joke
","I'm dumbfounded this film gets such a high IMDB rating.If this was meant to be some kind of social commentary on the ravages of mental illness, it could have been done without hijacking one of the most colorful characters in the Batman comic book genre.Viewers are held hostage to two hours of somber, relentless depression, murder, and mayhem. There are endless shots of a solitary, anguished Joaquin Phoenix, which get pretty monotonous.In a nutshell: adopted boy suffers brain damage from a brutal father, lives with a sick mentally ill mother, and, after getting beat-up by street hooligans, builds a self-pitying clown alter-ego that's going to hold up a mirror to a dismissive society. *Yawn*Of all the actors who have played Joker, Heath Ledger got the right balance of being a scary, crazed, murderous, diabolically clever sociopath who could go toe-to-toe with Batman. The pathetic, hapless Phoenix character lacks all of that persona.Yes, Phoenix does an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. But that alone doesn't save a film that is a boring flop because it is monotone, dark, dour, and mostly pointless.",1,18,37,18 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," clunky, insipid, and illogical space soap opera
","Though science fiction requires a willing suspension of disbelief, this film requires a suspension of logic and common sense. As predictable, Lucas did a clumsy and awkward job of trying to splice the tail of this story to SW Episode IV. Some glaring disconnects: 1. In a society with advanced medicine, doctors let a young healthy mother basically die on her own will? Also, instead of plastic surgery and prosthetics, they encapsulate a burn victim in walking 'Iron Lung'? 2. A Jedi 'defender of the helpless' literally walks away from his young apprentice who nearly burns to death? You wouldn't treat a dog like that.3. A lifetime of Jedi training is overturned after a couple conversations with the creepy old Chancellor? 4. Why go horror-show and disfigure Palpetine so that he looks like he needs an exorcism? He could simply have aged to look that weird and wrinkly by the time Luke Skywalker grows up.5. Where did Anakin's Edifice Complex come from for suddenly wanting to rule the Galaxy? his Dark Side flirtation started out as altruistic.6. It's going to take 18 years to build the Death Star? Must be a NASA project.7. The light saber weed-whacker, General Grievous, needs an organic heart? Who made him, the Wizard of Oz? And what with the wheezing, is he overdue for an oil change? 8. The Jedi's are so ineffectual they can't use The Force to figure out what all audiences deduce  with their eyes closed -- about the identity of Darth Sideous? This is more transparent than Superman disguising himself with eyeglasses. The Jedi win the galaxy's version of the Darwin award. They are light-years from what I imagined during Obi-Wan's solilquie in SW IV.Only George Lucas could turn what started out in 1977 as a fun-filled Saturday matinée film genre and turn in into a gloomy, self-indulgent and pretentious faux Greek tragedy.Good-By Star Bores",3,6,11,23 May 2005
WALL·E," An Inconvenient Ruse
","We've come to expect Pixar animated cartoons to be intensely funny, imaginative and adventurous from beginning to end. Despite tremendous efforts this one doesn't make it because the story warps out just when things are getting good. I'd say that for kids, going to this movie is like going to dinner where they serve the dessert first and the broccoli and cheese later. For adults, it's like spending a night at a vacation condo and getting a sales pitch on time-shares the next morning.The first 40 minutes of this film is totally adorable and very memorable. It's just extraordinarily delightful, clever, imaginative and nonstop laughs. Then it abruptly goes off the cliff with an unexplainable need to get pretentiously preachy about 'saving the planet'. This self- flagellation goes way over the heads of young viewers and doesn't do much for adults who don't need or care to see *yet another* caricature of our sloven culture.A space film with two adorably cute robot companions had tremendous potential for all kinds of fun misadventures among the stars  weird aliens, maniacal robots, lost worlds. What's more, the lack of dialog makes this film uniquely delightful, especially for kids. But as soon as the humans show up its 'wha wha wha!'Instead of going on an adventure across the galaxy, halfway through the film we are plopped down into something that looks like a cross between the Love Boat and the Mall of America. We're distracted by endless grotesque images of fat lazy humans of the 28th century. They're just stupid and very un-entertaining. They can barely take care of themselves (where's a good Morlock when you need one!). Of course they are that way because we stopped hugging trees centuries earlier and turned Earth into a junkyard of consumer waste, blah, blah, blah . . .The only scary 'bad guy' is a failed, ineffectual take off on 2001's HAL 9000 homicidal computer. So, there is never any enthralling climatic moment of good winning over evil.'Bee Movie' was just as obnoxiously preachy, but I didn't watch it with much of an expectation. To see Pixar fail at its consistently and wonderfully entertaining formula is heartbreaking. Did Al Gore put something in California drinking water a few years ago that compelled the cartoon animation industry to go all environmentally squishy and 'green'?I saw WALL-E in a theater full of children. I could just feel their energy drain as the film got entangled in all the confusing shenanigans aboard the space mall. This is the first Pixar film I've sat through where the audience didn't spontaneously applaud at the end (as they did in Kung Fu Panda a few weeks earlier)I'll rent a DVD of WALL-E when it comes out, only to relish seeing WALL-E and EVE playfully get to know each other again. But the moment the dumb humans and the dialog starts, it will be time to hit 'eject' button on the DVD player. I wish cute little WALL-E had a chance to do this to the humans in this film.",6,10,21,5 July 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," Bane Drain
","This is by far the most boring and ponderous Batman movie I've ever seen. Be warned that you better refresh yourself on the story thread from the previous two Batman films in the series, or else you will be left largely clueless as the plot plods along. The story line is dull, dragged out and very, very implausible, for all the film's pretenses of being a 'reality' Batman series. The action scenes with Batman are anemic for the little bit of screen time you see him in costume. If you're a Batman fan, be prepared to spend half the tedious 2.5-hour film watching Bruce Wayne languish in a desert prison until he regains his mojo. This follows a lame opening where Christian Bale is so craggy-looking and injured, he looks like the only thing he can do for the day is find his Viagra pills. But the worst element of the film is the villain 'Bane.' He's a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader. Or rather a lovechild between a pit bull and professional wrestler, because of a silly dog-like muzzle he wears through the film. Heath Ledger's Joker character was spine tingling and very scary. Bane is a bore. Even his long-awaited demise at the film's end is anticlimactic.He gets tiring quickly because you never see any facial expression, and his words and muffled. The gimmick only works for Darth Vader because of James Earl Jone's voice talent. Frankly, you get more expression out of a ventriloquist's wooden dummy than Bane. The Bane-bouncer beats Batman to a pulp and unmasks Batman halfway though film in a fistfight – which is a first in itself for the series. What's amusing is that the viewer only realizes near the end of the film that all Batman had to do is rip off Bane's mask to incapacitate him. Oh duh. Anne Hathaway's performance as a very dark Cat Woman is excellent and holds up against all the sultry actresses before her who have donned the mask, ears, and skin-tight costume.My taste is to have the Batman series stylized on screen as a graphic novel. Tim Burton cleverly accomplished this in the earlier films. The gritty reality of placing the setting in the New York City is a lazy and inappropriate substitute for the comic book Gotham City. More than a decade after 9/11 it is still uncomfortable seeing NYC buildings in flames and screaming people running down the street, and even bridges blowing up.I found the final three minutes the only redeeming piece of the 164-minute film. It leaves the door open for more sequels, hopefully with a different director.",1,39,78,22 July 2012
Casino Royale," Not your father's James Bond
","OK, this is the 21st century. So, maybe it's time for even the Bond genre to get a tune-up for new generation audiences. At least that's what the producers thought.But the New Bond is as disappointing as New Coke. Nothing beats the original.For starters, the producers seemed to make sure to keep everything out of the screenplay for 'Casino Royale' that made the Bond series unique, exciting, engaging and fun.The so-called 'Bond formula' balanced sadism with sensuality, and ironic humor. Sadly missing from this film too are the other Bond staples: gadgets, buxom blonds, and wonderful little quips and double entendres. This all gave the Bond series a comic book adventure cadence and buoyancy. It didn't take itself too seriously.But 'Casino Royale' jettisons all this and just keeps slogging along with relentless action scenes, brutality, banality and not much else. Yes, the action scenes are astutely choreographed, filmed and edited. But they are needed to shore up a saggy, dragged-out and somewhat convoluted plot.The opening immediately warns you that this is not 'classic' Bond. It sets the film's heavy tone. Bond brutally assassinates two criminals, one by drowning in a lavatory sink, in black-and-white film noir, no less. By contrast in the 'Goldfinger' (1964) prequel, Bond blows up a narcotics operation, changes into a tux, romances a cabaret dancer, and easily dispenses with an assassin, all the before the opening credits.The opening credits of 'Casino Royale' alone are another warning. There is not one stylized silhouette of a female model, which was the glamour signature in almost all Bond films. Instead, we just have silhouettes of guy shooting each other and bleeding in Technicolor across the screen. Yuck! What's horribly pretentious is that the whole film tries to chronicle the apprentice Bond's transition into a 007 assassin. But it's as contrived and unconvincing as Anakin Skywalker's metamorphosis into Darth Vader. And, in the end it's even sappier than the brief marriage of George Lanzenby's Bond to Dianna Rigg in the 1969 'on Her Majesty's Secret Service.' Frankly, I'm not Bond's psychologist and so I really don't care to delve into life's little traumas that shaped 007. I'm content with accepting that he just grew up that way.Daniel Craig is terribly miscast as Bond. He's a blue collar Bond. He looks self-conscious in a tuxedo. He's too hard chiseled in appearance for the debonair Bond as invented by Ian Flemming.Craig could have just as easily been cast as one of the villains in the film. His strident, driven demeanor reminds me a little bit of Donovan Grant, the SPECTRE assassin played by Robert Shaw in the 1963 'From Russia with Love.' Craig is humorless, and too much on the edge for my tastes. Actually, his squinty eyes, big upper torso, and gait reminds me a little of Popeye the Sailor.Like the Timothy Dalton Bond, he has no sense of playfulness either. His romantic side seems forced in the film's few dull and gratuitous lovemaking scenes. And, the women cast to play opposite him in this film can barely gain admission into the sorority of Bond babes.Equally lackluster is Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of high-roller Le Chiffre. He doesn't fit into the shoes of previous legendary bond villains such as Goldfinger, Largo, and Blofeld. Frankly, Mikkelsen is just plain creepy, but not scary. As the top bad guy he seems to be on Valium most of the time.The silly torture scene at the end is also out of character for him. Mikkelsen doesn't have any of the bully, bluster and swagger of the classic Bond villains. Please give me just one script line like Goldfinger's: 'I expect you to die Mr. Bond!' Ho hum.All of this makes for just another forgetful spy movie with lots of fists and blood and guts, nothing more. It's wrapped itself in the James Bond mystique  which will guarantee a good box office  but pays no homage to the genre.It's too bad the creators felt they hand to change such a celebrated formula that has sustained the popularity of Bond series for nearly four decades.",1,147,285,23 November 2006
Signs," Space Oddity
","(Caution: spoilers)In 'Signs' writer/producer/director M. Shyamalan attempts to merge Hitchcock and H.G. Wells into a spine-tingling story about a extraterrestrial invasion of earth, as experienced by a Pennsylvania farm family. The pre-release Hollywood hype about alien-carved 'crop circles' (as so well documented in supermarket tabloids) tries to make the film more relevant and spooky than previous 'monster space invaders' flicks. Despite all this hype and Mel Gibson's acting, this insipid film flops miserably. How did Gibson ever fall into this black hole of a screenplay? 'Signs' serves-up an embarrassingly numbskull science fiction yarn and pretty anemic horror. It's mostly a lot noises and shadows, and those pesky crop circles just sitting there, but little else. The film's fleeting glimpses of the 'jolly-green' alien fleeting around the farm like Bigfoot, is about as scary as a kid putting on a white sheet and yelling 'boo.'There have been so many space monster and horror creature films, Shyamalan can't help but copy elements from everything from 'Poltergeist' to 'The Thing.' But the story line just keeps heaping absurdities upon absurdities. For example, any real farmer would get his pitchfork and shotgun and go hunting for any aliens lurking around his farm and flattening his corn (as in the hilarious vignette in 'Back to the Future' when Michael J. Fox first makes a crash landing in 1955). Instead, Gibson and brother played by Joaquin Phoenix just whine about the end-of-the-world coming. They then board-up the house, just like in 'Night of The Living Dead.' In that cult classic film there are dozens of seemingly indestructible wicked zombies.But in 'Signs' all we finally get to see is ONE clumsy alien, who must have gotten sidetracked from the invasion force. He turns out to be the first movie character since the 1939 Wizard of Oz's wicked witch to be killed by water! Now, think about this. The alien invaders are smart enough to travel countless light-years across space but don't realize earth is the only 'water planet' in the solar system. Duuuh! What's more, any middle school student who has ever done a research paper on astrobiology will tell you: no water = no life, even if it has three eyes, three toes and is polka-dot. Artistic license aside, this idiotic premise sets back science literacy by 20 years.Shyamalan should go find his boyhood 8mm movie camera and go back to making student films until he gets in right. A copycat film that is as dumb and uninspired and this deserves an 'F'. It is such a drawn-out bore, even the gang on 'Mystery Science Theater 2000' would have trouble staying awake to mock it.",1,6,11,22 February 2003
The Sixth Sense," convoluted and dragged out
","I have to confess I didn't figure the plot out in the first 10 minutes.But that's because I was so BORED I didn't waste neurons trying to figure it out. This film has no alternative to being boring because the screenplay has to carefully keep Bruce Willis from engaging in conversation with any other adult for nearly two screen hours! This give it an oddly staid funeral parlor cache between the gripping beginning and end sequences. That said, it is artistically done, well-edited, and well-acted, despite being so drawn out.I agree with other reviewers that it would have been perfect for a 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, or longer treatment at the hand of Alfred Hitchcock.",5,0,1,20 April 2008
Spectre," License to Bore
","Watching the newly rebooted 'Millennial Bond' film series is like watching a plane in a descending spiral. Just when you think the next Bond installment can't get any worse, it does, and just keeps plunging into a bottomless abyss of pure insipidness.After the awful un-Bond predecessor 'Skyfall' I swore off seeing any more agent 007 films. But the title 'SPECTRE' enticed me to give its creators one more chance. After all, in the previous Bond films SPECTRE a powerful global terror and crime juggernaut. Its syndicate has the audacity of stealing and ransoming atomic bombs, trying to nuke Fort Knox, hijacking manned spacecraft, carrying out cunning assassinations and blackmail. The ruthless leader, Ernst Blofeld, is the Steve Jobs of global mayhem.But not in this film.Actor Christoph Waltz is fatally miscast as Blofeld. Rather that exuding the sheer evil of a terrorist mastermind CEO, he comes off as quirky fruitcake. His maniacal smirk and stare makes you think he just got released from a mental health institution. He might do better as 'The Joker' in Batman. Blofeld's extent of terror is to inexplicably play at the keyboard of some computerized torture device. Blofeld couldn't find an iPhone torture app? Bond dispatches this psycho-clown with little effort.Frankly, the Blofeld character has never been properly cast with previous actors either. The character is most unsettling when you can't see his face, just his cherished Persian lap-cat. This was sobering in 'Thunderball' and 'From Russia With Love.'All you see of SPECTRE as an organization is a boring boardroom meeting in a set reminiscent of Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut,' and a nonsensical secret desert base that looks like it belongs in a sci-fi version of Area 51. The base doesn't last long. Bond blows it sky-high with little more than a hand grenade disguised as a watch. I though this kind of silliness was only reserved for an Austin Powers movie.We see so little of SPECTRE that filmmakers don't even bother to spell out Ian Fleming's acronym – Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion. Too polysyllabic for today's audiences?Once again, Craig – our blue-collar Bond - struggles to be charming and romantic with his leading lady, actress Léa Seydoux . There is a gratuitous, brief one-night-stand on a train -- and that's about it. Craig's sex appeal is in need of Viagra.The concept of SPECTRE has been so bastardize in this Bond-age bore poor Ian Fleming must be turning in his grave.",1,3,8,14 February 2016
Moon," The Clone Bores
","I rented this movie based on the IMDb rating of 8. Wow! I'm in disbelief. I'd give it a rating of 0.05 if I could.Any comparison between this film and the seminal masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey' is as absurd as comparing a high school football game to the Super Bowl.This is one of the absolutely worst films I have ever seen. The plot is so haphazard, dull and convoluted I still don't understand the story line.What I was able to piece together is a pretty implausible scenario for conducting mining operations on the Moon. The dialog – what there is of it -- is unbelievable and ridiculous. The story drags and drags and drags because Sam Rockwell only has one other character to play against – a clone of himself. His character is hapless, clueless, and idiosyncratic. He reminds me a little of the neurotic isolated astronaut Bruce Dern played in the 1972 'Silent Running.' Oh, there's also his computer sidekick that's yet another clunky imitation of '2001's' legendary HAL 9000 computer. But this computer is a crying bore too. Kevin Spacey tries to sound like a flat unemotional computer, and his voice is so over-equalized that he sounds like he's talking from inside a toilet stall.Unlike the devilish scheming HAL, this is a nauseatingly altruistic computer that displays – believe it or not – sappy emotioncons. It's so submissive it offers to have its memory wiped. You half-expect it to ask you out for a beer at the bar, or to give you a back rub.By the time the film ends you are lost is space, or at least went through a space warp where 97 minutes stretched to what seems like three hours of tedium.I hope this film is not a DVD on NASA's International Space Station. The astronaut crew would be driven to go outside into the vacuum of space without their helmets on.",1,27,66,9 February 2010
Contact," About as close to real thing as we might ever get
","This is a classy, beautifully executed sci-fi tale about the true ramifications of contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence. It is the most realistic portrayal of cultural, governmental, and scientific reaction to such a bombshell discovery that one could ever predict. But the story has two serious flaws:1. Jodie Foster's affair with the preacher, and his preoccupation with her believing in God is a distraction, and only presents a 'speed bump' in the film's momentum. It also promotes the tired old stereotype that scientists are all atheists.2. the climax at the galactic core with alien-morphed-into-father, is a hokey old cliche and reminiscent of some of the poorer Star Trek plots. Yeah, it's impossible to show a realistic benevolent alien (even the visionary Kubrick steered clear of it). But this is just silly.other than that the scenes at Kennedy Space Center, the White House, the VLA, etc. are so plausible they give the film a special polish and rock solid realism.",Null,0,2,24 May 2003
Alien: Covenant," Oh No! A Prometheus Sequel!
","When I go see an Alien franchise sequel, especially when directed by Ridley Scott, I expect to see H.R. Geger's nightmarish alien from the first film.No such luck — except for an un-scary cameo appearance.It was nice to see some allusion to the flavor of the first Alien film in the sets. But as a story, the film is a boring, contrived, and convoluted sequel to the disastrous film, Prometheus. Despite the infinite capabilities of CG to create a truly bizarre and arresting planetary landscape, the colonists are filmed walking through a forest that looks suspiciously Earthlike. I'd expect more from a nearly $100 million budget. The original Alien remains a cinematic horror masterpiece that works even without all the CG effects of today. James Camron's sequel, Aliens, ratcheted up the terror. An Alien 3 film should have been about getting the evil species to the Corporation on Earth and having all hell break loose.Instead, the franchise has mutated into confusing gobbledygook with some gratuitous blood and gore.Why can't the Aliens series just be about the quest for evil xenomorphs that have value on Earth as a military weapon? Nice and simple. They don't need to be genetically engineered by some android with a God complex.Also, spare me the confusing melodrama of embattled evil and benign androids, and some still mysterious ancient humanoid race of space-seeders.I'm glad I streamed this cinematic disaster so I could fast forward through all the pretentious, dull dialogue.",Null,2,4,27 August 2017
