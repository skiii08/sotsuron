The Blair Witch Project," Whoever doesn't like this movie didn't understand it.
","Ok so for all ya'll who didn't like it, get over it cause The Blair Witch Project was a scary as sheet movie. It was original and it was very very intelligent. Anyone really pay attention to the ending? Anyone pay attention to the point the whole movie makes? I doubt it no one seemed to listen to it, or really understand what it was trying to prove: Movies can be scary without gore, or seeing anything. Um did Chris Rock ever think about the 35,000 (not 60,000) all going to crew, cast and stuff? Get over it people Blair Witch is a new classic, and it cannot be classified as anything else but that!",10,1,3,10 October 1999
Alien 3," Pretty good for a third installment
","If you watch it Alien 3 isn't that bad, it's entertaining, scary, and violent, which made the first two films good. This time Ripley is on a ship that serves as a prison, and of course the alien returns. Filled with corny yet effective special effects, and lots of gore, this is a decent alien film, not the best but it is entertaining. I give 'Alien 3' 7 out of 10. Rated R for strong sci-fi violence and gore, and for language.",7,0,4,13 December 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WOW!!
","In 1977, George Lucas wrote and directed a masterpiece of modern cinema. 'Star Wars' revolutionized science fiction in a whole new way. Anyone who has seen it, knows, that it is a true classic. Making 460 million dollars, 'Star Wars' has stayed a very popular film with people. Some seeing it more than once when it came out. Some not even seeing it. but through 23 years, everyone has surely seen at least the first 'Star Wars' once. If you haven't seen it, go out and but it. For it's time, the special effects were spectacular, and took movie-goers by surprise, and amazed them. The story being about a young Jedi, Luke Skywalker, who has to try and free his not-then-known twin sister Princess Leia. With the help of his droid friends C-3PO, and R2-D2, and the young, and suave Hans Solo, they fight and try and save her.In 1980, George Lucas returned with the spectacular sequel, 'The Empire Strikes Back', which has been hailed as the best sequel of all time, and even hailed as better than the original. To me, the first was better, but that's just my opinion. Of course, everyone liking the original, went and saw this one. It did not disappoint. The special effects were improved, the fight scenes vastly enhanced, and the acting somewhat above par. This is what made Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and especially Harrison Ford stars. Not just the Empire Strikes back, but the entire series, known then as 'The Star Wars Trilogy'. In this one, Luke has to fight the federatuon, as well as learning some dirty family secrets. Some of the most spectacular scenes in this are: The lightsaber fight which pits Luke vs. his Dad, and all the outer-space fights. This is a great film as well as a great sequel.In 1983, George Lucas brought us the excellent sequel 'The Return of the Jedi' which most say is the least of the series. But I say it is the best. I thought this was a great way to end a series, and great way to begin one. He made the audiences wait 3 years, before he made a new one. And most were disappointed. But to me, the special effects, the action scenes, and humor was better the first two. The little ewoks, and characters in this movie were charming as they were neat. I thought the best scenes through the movie was the race in the woods, and every other scene in this movie. I love it all.Now, in 1999, May 19th, we have the long awaited (16 years!) prequel, Episode I: The Phantom Menace. When I went into this movie, my heart was racing. I was humming the score of the movie, and I was ready! Alas I thought, I get to see the first 'Star Wars', my dad, my mom, my family saw the other ones when they came out. Now I, get to expierence it. Being a strong fan of the triolgy, I knew I would not be disppointed. The theatre grew dark, the audience sat up, all eyes locked on the screen. After the previews the words: 'A long, long time ago in a far away galaxy', came up, and then it started. Cheers came throughout the theatre as all the people were excited to see and hear this movie.We go back to the very start, before Darth Vader ever was, before Luke Skywalker. Now we go to Ben Obi-Won Kanobi and his master. Ewan McGregor plays Obi-Won Kenobi, Liam Neeson, plays Qui-Gon Jinn, his Jedi master. The film starts out with them, going on a ship. Being reconized as Jedis they are quickly attacked by battle droids, soon to destory them, they escape, and meet a friend creature named Jar-Jar Binks. After they escape, they land on a planet known as 'Naboo' run by the Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). This peaceul planet is being challenged by an evil federation, who wants to take over the planet. They free the queen and land on a planet, where they meet the young Annakin Skywalker. Who everyone will know soon as Darth Vader. Annakin is a slave, who builds stuff with his free time. From here, if I tell anymore, it will ruin the plot. But let's just say it's excellent. The ending, pitting the good vs. bad, is more than incredible, and I think has the best special effects ever made. The last scenes with all the shootings and lightsaver action is great. And will be hailed as some of the best special effects ever made.If this were made as the first in the series, it would be hailed as an astonishing achievment of visual effects. Underwater cities, creatures that look as though they are there, ships that fly through the night sky, and lightsabers that look amazing. The action scenes in this movie, were absolutely incredible. The nonstop action in the movie, was amazing. And the sound, man the sound was awesome. If you see this movie, try and see it in a theatre with THX Sound or better. Because if not you will the whole expierience.Most critics are saying now, the acting in this film was not that good. I strongly disagree, and say that all the people: Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and young Jake Lloyd, all did an excellent job playing their characters. We are also given the first look at some favorite characters. A not yet finished C-3PO, R2-D2, Jabba The Hut, Obi-Won Kenobi, and young Annakin Skywalker. Seeing this film you don't. To me you live it, and that's exactly how I felt throughout the entire film. I was amazed at the special effects. Stunned at the way George Lucas wrote and directed this movie. And all together, I loved it. I will see this movie more than once. And althought 'Titanic' was good, I hope this beats the heck out of it!! See this movie today, tomorrow, and more than once. You won't get tired of it. At least, I know I will be seeing it, and I won't get tired of it.I give it a 10!Rated PG for sci-fi action and violence.",10,0,2,20 May 1999

Batman Returns," Only sequel to Batman to be actually good
","This was original, and full of good stunts, although it was kinda dreary and dark, it was still enjoyable, and entertaining. And Michael Keaton is great as Batman, Michelle Pffiefer is both sensational and sexy as Catwoman, and Dannu DeVito is so-so as the Penguin. All in all the movie was good, but not as good as the original, it didn't have that thing that made the first good. I give it a 6.5 out of 10 Rated PG-13 for action and violence, and for sensuality.",6,0,0,11 December 1998

Alien," One of the Best Sci-fi ever!
","This movie was a turning point in terror and sci-fi genre, it was smart, stylish, violence and gory. It had everything to make a great sci-fi thriller and everyone should see it.

The Shining," Forgot how good it WAS!!!!!!!!!!
","I watched this a couple of years ago and didn't like it, see my review below but put a big X over that, cause this was a great film. Actually almost as good as Scream 2, but that's my fav movie for now, so nothing can beat it!. I give this very scary movie a 10! I give the remake a 9 cause it was different, but still good. Rated R for violence/gore, language, and nudity.",10,0,1,3 January 1999

Aliens," A terrific piece of art

The Exorcist," A classic!
","The Exorcist is a brilliant horror classic, from bestselling author William Peter Blatty, who scripted. The movie stars Linda Blair as a young girl, who is possessed by the devil. Her mother who's an actress, doesn't find this out, till she finds her bed shaking and moving by herself. Then after awhile, she becomes looking almost like a demon. Her mother, enlists the help of a young priest, who tries to talk to Regan (Blair) and get the demon out of her. Instead she also terroizes him, driving all of them out of her bedroom. They live in an apartment, to which has become legendary now, and the demon is trying to make Regan do stuff she doesn't, hurt even kill people. The pea-soup regurgitation scene is the best, and has become a memorable and famous scene, of the whole horror genre. The voice over is done by Mercedes McCaimbridge (extremely creepy), and some spectacular make-up effects. The acting, is also very well-done, with an extremely well-acted role by young Blair. Everyone else in the film, also does a great job. Although this isn't a movie for everyone because of the whole possessing thing, I do think, everyone who even if they don't like horror will like this. I must say, I was impressed with this film, even dealing with the Devil, you won't be offended or anything. The ending finale, is very intense, as is the whole entire movie, which will keep your stomach in knots from beginning to end. See it it's a classic. A 10. Rated R for violence, language, and brief sexuality.",10,1,2,10 February 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Great sequel, one thing better is....
","More dinos, this movie had much more dinos than the first one did, it had more action, and more violence. It wasn't better cause it was equal. I give it a 9 out of 10 or **** out of 4 stars. Jurassic Park gets the same rating.",9,7,13,9 December 1998
Good Will Hunting," One of the most powerful movies I've witnessed
","I sat down watching this movie, thinking hey this isn't gonna be a very good movie. Well guess what I was wrong, I was struck by Robin Williams Oscar winning performance (which he deserved), Matt Damon was also very good in the lead role as Will Hunting. Ben Affleck was also very good as his friend, so what I'm saying is that this cast who played in this movie were very talented, and deserved all they got. The movie itself is very very and I mean very POWERFUL. It strikes you like a 2x4 coming out of nowhere. So I suggest whoever has not seen this movie, well you're missing something. Go rent or buy this movie. You will find the performance of the actors are great, and the movie itself will touch you and movie you like never before. And oh yeah all the rumors about the cussing is true, but after a while you don't hear them anymore. The humor is in it, the drama is in it, and the goodness is in this film, which everyone of all ages should see. Take the time now, and go see this film! I give it a 10. Rated R for strong language and sexual dialogue.",10,4,10,18 January 1999
Event Horizon," Highly Underrated
","This film, if u watch it is very good. It's scary, and gory, and I could watch it over and over. Why do u guys not like it? The movie itself is very powerful in a way, only hardcore horror fans could see it as. It gets a 10! Rated R for strong sci-fi violence and gore, language, and some nudity.",10,0,2,22 January 1999
The Evil Dead," One of the best horror movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Men in Black," Overhyped
","Yeah this movie was ok, but it wasn't one of the best movies i've seen. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are both good in the titles roles, but the movie itself has a plot line as thin as a piece of notebook paper, and some of the jokes aren't funny. Plus the dialogue is dumb. So i went to see this movie expecting to see a great movie, and I didn't. I give Men In Black a 5 out of 10. It was OK but not what it was hyped to be.",6,3,6,9 December 1998
Titanic," One of the most spectacular movies made!!
","This was a very good movie that was both entertaining and sad, that had a great love story. The special effects were great as was the acting. 10!! Rated PG-13 for disaster violence, language, nudity, and sensuality.",10,1,2,17 January 1999
Psycho," One of the scariest, and best horror films of all time!!
","Psycho is a pure classic, that along with Halloween is the scariest movie ever made. Anthony Perkins stars as the famous Norman Bates, who in fact is a psycho. Now how he comes in the story is this: Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, she steals $40,000 from her boss, flees the town, and buys a new car. She decides to stay at a hotel, cleverly named The Bates Motel (Vacancy). Run by a timid, yet sweet man whose name is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), now this man, is attracted to this woman, asked her for dinner, she declines. Now for the most famous scene in a horror film, she decides to take a shower, while he watches. He hears his mom calling him, so he goes up and sees what's wrong. While Marion Crane is taking a shower, the mother comes down and brutally stabs her to death. After all this, and people start to notice that she is gone, her sister and her boyfriend, decide to check out this motel. They hire an investigator to look into it. He finds nothing wrong with the place. What happens to him? Well you'll have to see the movie. Anyway, the sister and boyfriend, investigate and find out what Norman Bates really is. The film is extremely well-acted, not to mention directed by the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock. All the cast-mates support a wonderful script, and make this lively, scary, and classic horror movie a must-see. A 10!!! Unrated/Rated R for intense violence and some brief nudity.",10,6,10,10 February 1999
Rosemary's Baby," Excellent!
","The only thing wrong with this movie is that it ended, and the ending, even though it was her baby, I wouldny have kept that demon child! Anyway it was a very good movie, with lots of scary parts, and I bet the audience who went and saw this movie was surprised with the nudity and sorts. I give this gem of a movie a 9 out of 10. Rated R for violence, some sexuality, and nudity.",9,0,1,7 January 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Flew Over One of the Best Movies Ever Made!!! (And that person was me)
","First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to stand up and cheer.I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.The supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic, intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.The second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay. And it deserved all of them.Rated R for language, violence, sexual content, and brief nudity.",10,185,300,19 March 1999
Scream 2," The Best Movie Ever Hands Down!!!
","This is my all time favorite movie, I saw it twice in the theatres, and although I haven't bought it yet, I rented it for 5 days and watched it 8 times!!! I can't seem to get enough of this movie. Everyone in its great, Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett, Neve Campbell, the girl who plays her roommate, Jamie Kennedy, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jerry O'Connel (Stand By Me), Sarah Michelle Gellar, and everyone else in this movie make this scary and often witty movie better than Scream. 10 reasons it was better than Scream: 10. More suspenseful 9. More Deaths 8. Better Scenery 7. Neve and Courtney looked better 6. Sarah Michelle Gellar 5. Better Ending 4. Better Killers 3. Better Beginning 2. More and Better plot 1. STU WASN'T IN IT HE WAS HORRIBLE IN THE FIRST I COULD NOT STAND HIM, HE WASN'T FUNNY AND HE ANNOYED ME!!!. RANDY WAS MUCH BETTER!! I give Scream 2 a 10/10! It's great. I give Scream 9/10 it's good but Scream 2 is better.",10,0,0,16 December 1998
Scream 2," Much Much better than Scream
","I mean don't get me wrong, I loved Scream but Scream 2 had a much better plot line, and much better acting. In Scream they spoofed the horror and it wasn't scary yet it was funny. In Scream 2 they made a horror movie, not a comedy. I thought it was not as gory and it had more scares, and thrills than Scream did.",10,0,0,20 September 1998
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Pure Magic
","This was one of Disney's best movies they have ever made, it had the magic, the animation, and wonderful characters. Along with amazing technicolor, this is a Disney favorite, that should stay around for a long time. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,2,3,9 December 1998
Halloween," Nothing but a classic, and it will always be a classic.
","Ja, this movie is nothing but a pure classic, that has earned its right to be the scariest movie I have ever seen. I watched this movie originally when I was 6 and it scared the hell outta me, I really didn't remember it till I bought it a few months back, and whew I almost wet myself. The movie is both stylish, very scary, and non-stop entertainment. The story has a young very disturbed man stalking (the then not known little actress who became huge in Hollywierd) Jamie Lee Curtis, why well you'll find that out in Halloween II, but he stalks her and tortures her throughout the entire movie. While her other friends get murdered in gruesome yet bloodless ways, Ja thats right this movie was like Poltergiest it needed no blood or gratuitous gore to make it scary. The acting by Nick Castle as the imafamous and endlessly copied psychopath is killer Michael Myers, who scares me even now all though he is awesome. Donald Pleasence is Dr. Loomis Michaels psychiatrist whom, is trying to find Michael who has escaped from the hospital and like i said b4 stalking Jamie Lee Curtis. When this movie came out it wasn't a million dollar movie, it was a low-budget horror movie that went on to make a whopping 47 million dollars. Yeah thats a lot for a movie that didn't even cost 500,000 to make. So if you're in the mood for a scary, stylish classic horror movie that pays much to the movie that started it all 'Psycho', which Jamie Lee Curtis's mom Janet Leigh played in then you're ready for 'HalloweeN' And if you pee your pants easily when scared, 'HalloweeN' isn't for you. I give this never-not-be-a classic a perfect 10 or ****. Don't watch it alone. Rated R for intense violence, sexuality, and some nudity.",10,0,0,10 December 1998
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A true classic of the horror genre
","This was a wonderful movie, with scares, gore, and wit. It also featured the most grotesque looking killer in a movie. 9 out of 10. Rated R for strong horror violence and gore, sexuality, nudity, and some language.",9,0,0,18 January 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," An Excellent Movie
","Interview with the vampire, is an exquisite, very stylish film, that at times is boring, and repellent. But the acting is so good, that you have to wonder why these people did not get Oscars for their work. The Story: A vampire who has lived for 200 years, tells Christian Slater his life story, first of how he became what he is, what he's done of what he is, and what he plans to do next. Tom Cruise plays the lead vampire, who turned Brad Pitt into a vampire. Brad Pitt plays the vampire who is telling the life story to Christian Slater. Kirsten Dunst (Jumangi, Small Soldiers) plays the young girl, who the both male vampires turns into a vampire. Therefore she is cursed and will stay a young girl the rest of her life, till someone kills her. The film itself is a fine one, and if you watch this, even though in parts it's boring, its also superstylish, and scary, and also quite gory. So watch this with an open mind, I think you will like it. I sure did! Rated R for vampire violence and gore, sexuality, and nudity.",9,2,3,22 January 1999
Contact," One of the Most powerful movies ever made
","This was an absolute masterpiece of movie making. It was entertaining, powerful, emotional, and everything else all at once. The special effects were great, and I think Jodie Foster shoulda been nominated for best actress for this movie, she did a terrific job. Actually Contact shoulda been nominated for best picture, and it woulda beaten Titanic. (Titanic was good no pun intended to Titanic fans). I Give it a 10",10,0,2,29 November 1998
Jurassic Park," Great Movie
","This was one of those movies, that you either liked or didn't like, I personally enjoyed it thoroughly. The special effects were excellent, the thrills, were non-stop, and the atmosphere was amazing. The sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park was also very good, and it was better cause it had more dinos and action. I give Jurassic Park a 9 out of 10, or **** out of 4 stars. I give it the Lost World: Jurassic Park a 9 out of 10 too, or **** out of 4 stars.",9,1,2,9 December 1998
