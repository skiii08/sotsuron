Marie Antoinette," More like an extended trailer than a movie
","I know a good amount about Marie Antoinette, and have always found her an interesting character in history. So naturally I was excited when I heard there was to be a movie made about her. I watched it with two friends, one of which knew pretty much nothing about Marie Antoinette, or the French evolution. There is no way that someone could fully understand this movie without knowing about the French revolution and Marie Antoinette. The only thing clear in the movie is that Marie Antoinette is upset about her life and attempts to make things better by spending. There is hardly any dialogue. The pieces of dialogue that are in the movie are basically gossip. There are multiple scenes where there are two different groups of people gossiping about different things, the focus constantly switching between the two- it was not very easy to follow along. The modern music in the movie did not work - why would modern music go with a historic movie anyway?? None of the songs ever really coincided with what was going on, except maybe when 'I Want Candy' was played..which was one of many pointless scenes. One scene showed various pairs of shoes that Marie Antoinette was obviously picking from, and in the background there was (as plain as day) a pair of purple converse. I am sure it wasn't some kind of mistake, so what was the point of putting them in there? Basically, whatever Coppola was aiming for, she didn't achieve. It was kind of like when someone in high school writes a history report at the last minute and just throws in bullshit.",2,1,2,18 February 2007
