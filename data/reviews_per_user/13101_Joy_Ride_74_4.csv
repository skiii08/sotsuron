The Blair Witch Project," Wow!
","Well, when I first saw this movie, as low budget as it was, it scared the heck out of me! I had to spend the night at a friend's house because I was so scared. After a few days, I started having dreams about it. Mainly because I was convinced that the movie was real. According to the previews, this was supposed to be actual footage from the 'documentary' these 'students' were filming. It wasn't until weeks after I saw this film that I found out it was just another scary movie. I think that's why they did it this way. When you know something is fake, you won't scare so easily, but when you're convinced it's true or based on a true event, that's when it becomes terrifying.",Null,0,1,18 December 2006
Dawn of the Dead," My Take
","I thought the movie was excellent! I didn't really care for the 1978 original. Sorry! This 2004 remake was full of action, surprises, and a bit of humor here and there. The only part that I found to be really stupid was where Sarah Polley's character, Anna, SAW what happened to her husband, but said absolutely nothing to the rest of the gang about it until the next day or two. How dumb? It wasn't difficult to figure out. She saw the condition of 'Vivian' the little girl who lived on her street, and she saw what Vivian did to her husband, Louis. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that he died and then 'came back' due to the bite from the little girl. I just didn't like the way they had Anna so closed-mouth and clueless about how the 'sickness' spreads until darn near the end. Also, it would have been a nice touch for them to go a little in depth about HOW the 'Zombie-Virus' started. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie and I've watched it at least a million times!",10,3,6,14 August 2007
Us," Great Movie!
","First, you have to have an IQ higher than your shoe size to be able to understand the movie. Most reviews here are posted by people who feel that breathing requires too much thinking. Therefore, they are judging the movie unfairly. The movie is filled with mystery and suspense. If you're the kind of person who needs a tutor sitting next to you explaining the movie scene by scene, then yeah, I agree....don't bother. But for THINKERS, this is our kind of movie. If definitely makes you think.",9,0,10,17 May 2019
World Trade Center," World Trade Center
","Well, I just came back from seeing this movie, and all I can say about it is that it's great, and worth seeing. Nicholas Cage & Michael Pena were excellent. It bought tears to the eyes of many, including mine. I hope Hollywood doesn't try to get rich by continuing to make endless movies about this tragedy. I think one is enough. The other movie that they made about Flight 93 was good also, but if I had to pick between the two, I would say this one was better. I only saw and heard what went on during 9/11 on the news, but this movie took you there to experience what it was like on that fateful day. I can see Cage being nominated for his role. He did a great job. I urge everyone to see it this movie.",10,4,10,11 August 2006
