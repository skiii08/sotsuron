","First off, I gotta say, Stephen King books just don't make great movies. If you've read the book, you know how weird it can be. Then try to cram all that detail into a movie or, as was done here, just chop and change a bunch of stuff to get it to vaguely fit together. I was really annoyed that Mike's story was changed in the movie. His parents are alive and well in the book! And he was barely in the movie...But again, to those who have read the book, how could all stuff eg, the story of the Black Spot, possibly be put into the movie?If I'm honest, I watched the movie more to compare it to the book just to see how closely it would follow. I'm not scared of clowns so Pennywise seemed to more goofy to me. The kids all did a good job with their acting but with all the swearing and joking around with each other, there was just so much humour, it totally outweighed the scary parts. I didn't feel even a tingle of fear through whole movie, although Stan's creepy painting lady almost did it. To sum up, for me the movie was a collection of a hilarious moments with a some gross stuff to look at. And yes, I will watch the second one, probably for the same reasons I watched this one. Just to see how the hell they're going to end the story in a coherent fashion. Plus I heard Bill Hader will be in the second one? Hope so!",4,0,1,2 July 2018
