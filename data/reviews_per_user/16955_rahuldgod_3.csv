The Avengers," 6 superheroes join forces to give an awesome movie
","Hulk was good, iron man was good, Thor was good, captain America was OK (movies)...................................but 'The Avengers' was awesome! It had everything that you expect when different superheroes from different origins join forces! Believe me it was worth every penny. Whedon did a great job in bringing out all the heroes together. But if you haven't watched 'Thor', 'iron man', 'captain America' etc you will be puzzled throughout the movie. But all in all, it was really entertaining and funny!If you want to have a great time with your kids and family this is the film you would want to see.I would give the film 9 out of 10.",9,2,6,30 April 2012
Super 8," Clearly someone knows how to make a movie these dayzz!!!!!!!
","I first heard about super 8 from IMDb itself. I wasn't aware of the genre of this movie till i read the full plot. I didn't really trust the user reviews, but i had an urge to see the movie. And so i did! Was i disappointed? No way! What a gud movie it was. Direction was amazing, great plot, suspense was good too. And the acting..........well I was surprised to see such gud actors in those kids. They were superb.Another positive thing about the movie was it's script. It was good too. I was simply glued to the movie till the end. Clearly someone knows how to make a movie nowadays. I still don't know why this movie wasn't given much publicity before it's release even though it was a Spielberg production!! Maybe that's one of the reason behind this success, who knows. Was it worth every penny.........sure. I really liked the way they kept the suspense towards the end. Lot of films lack those things these days.I am rating it******8/10****** I took 2 coz it did lack some perfection. But overall a great movie to watch as a family!!",8,1,2,1 November 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," An epic conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever!!!!
","There were a lot of batman movies, but none of them could meet the expectations created by the comics, with 'batman & Robin' being one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen! Then Nolan came along with a bunch of masterpieces behind him, and then created two astounding batman films within a span of 3 years! And now, he has concluded, which to me is one of the best trilogies ever, in an epic and a heart-stopping way! As they say 'THE LEGEND ENDS, BUT THE LEGACY CONTINUES'............!!!Its hard to compare this and TDK, both of them are amusing in their own prospective. TDK was run mainly by joker, aka heath ledger, and this was clearly batman's show. I can't imagine a perfect way to end the trilogy. And Nolan did an amazing job in maintaining the fire created by TDK, clearly stating that he is one of the best in his genre.The action sequences were pretty amazing so was the background music. There is a reason why Nolan retained the same cast for all the movies, and they did it professionally.It was one hell of a ride for me, and gave me goosebumps throughout. Being a batman fan, I loved all the 3 movies, and just like the other two movies, I rate it 10/10. Don't miss it guys, besides you have got to see the 'legend end'.",10,7,12,22 July 2012
