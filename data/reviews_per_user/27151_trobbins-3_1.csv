Requiem for a Dream," I just couldn't buy into the feel of this film
","The examination of drug addiction as illustrated in this film is a worthy topic to explore. However I felt it was just too disjointed and inconsistent to help me as a viewer understand what the storytellers were really trying to convey. It certainly had some interesting situations to examine, particularly the issues involved with weight loss and the typical unfulfilled expectations associated with such endeavors. However, I felt the film's 'story question' was not 'well-formed'.Stylistically, this disjointed feel may have been the intent of the filmmaker, yet I don't feel it belongs in the same company as say films like Memento, City of God and Taxi Driver.",4,8,16,3 December 2004
