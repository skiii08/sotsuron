Requiem for a Dream," This is a film that bears on my mind every day.
","The imagery, themes, acting, direction, and music are amongst the best I've ever experienced. A truly disturbing film that leaves a strong impression for life. Ellen Burstyn  gives a particularly strong performance. I can also highly recommend Clint Mansells fantastic soundtrack.",10,0,1,30 October 2002
