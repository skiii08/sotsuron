Sucker Punch," much more than expected
","the trivial moviegoer won't get Sucker Punch... they'll say it lacks a plot or character development, is one long music video, is nonsensical fluff.... a lot of negative stuff...the intellectual philosopher who sees film as a canvas to present an artists view of the world will be able to see much more.... the alternate reality within and alternate reality / dream state view of life struggle and personality perspectives is very rich in this movie... as with most deep movies, it is open to a great deal of interpretation... for those who wish to see more... it's a great journey.. and happens to be very fun at the same time... especially if you see the uncut R version which adds some significant depth to the story.There's a genre class of directors attacking big questions with visionary work of late... Aronofsky and Malick's new stuff comes to mind right away... if Snyder continues this direction, I'll look forward toward everything he does....",Null,2,3,30 June 2011
Alexander," the king of misunderstood films
","wow am I amazed at the level of hatred for this film....this is a great film and forceful dramatic examination of Alexander and his philosophy, leadership, passion, and amazing grasp of what was possible in the world....it is a major intellectual failure for anyone to interpret it as a: historical documentary: the two main battles of the film are composites of events in Persia and India and as such do not convey accurate detail of a singular event... the backdrop of the Alexandria Pharos (lighthouse) likewise is a simple piece to represent the fantastic world that Alexander made possible... if you want scientific examinations of history, watch the History Channela statement on homosexuality: Alexander's bisexuality has ample historical evidence, was common in his contemporaries, and as such is dramatized in the movie in completely reasonable fashion.. it is not any type of a statement, if you interpret it as such you are overreachinga statement about Tyrannical aims: history suggests that Alexander wanted to unite the world, was conflicted about his place in it, and a whole bunch other stuff, some of which referred to in the film.. attempts to extrapolate that into comparisons to Caligula, Hitler, etc. totally miss the huge evidence of Alexander's planning to unify the world, expand learning and trade, and to be happy in the 'doing' of things there is much more but you get the idea....this film delivers an interpretation of Alexander's dream as a dream...the audience can choose to complain and moan about the correctness of a battle or the characterization of homosexuality...but the reality is, it's an inspiring tale of one of the world's greatest people",Null,9,14,24 June 2008
Pawn Sacrifice," pawn sacrifice.... so so
",Toby McGuire has now been typecast as the psycho guy that excels in his undertakings and pawn sacrifice is just another nail in the coffinToby cranks out his now normal psycho guy poses and eye super close ups with his typical look.. it's now boring and this movie does little more than make the point that Bobby was mentally imbalanced. This film could have been so much more and could have given more depth to one of the most mysterious characters of post WWII USA... and it completely failed... I was really disappointed and wish the movie had been so much more.This is basically a 20 minute statement that Fischer was a paranoid blown up into a feature film.,Null,2,8,8 December 2015
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," a disappointment
","I am not a typical Twilight fan.... I'm not in the age group, I'm not the right gender, but I love film and shockingly thought that the original Twilight was, well, great.TOT (the original Twilight) directed by Catherine Hardwicke was full of subtlety, inspirirng cinematography, the unwinding of the mystery of the Cullens and how the introduction of Bella into that world and in reality opening her eyes to the entire world. TOT branded the story as being smoky, mysterious, and filled with connections for anybody who watched it.Then they got rid of Hardwicke.... and now that Eclipse and New Moon are out, it's clear that the creative identity of the films IS, without a doubt, her.Eclipse takes the premise of a vampire skirmish and stretches that alone to a 2hr 4min stretch of poorly directed intimacies, snappy one liners, and.... well I just saw the movie and I don't remember anything else other than the anticlimatically filmed primary scene of the movie which I won't identify here to save people the serious spoiler.You should wait for DVD so you can have something else to do while you are watching, because this poorly directed and written portion of the story is insulting to TOT.I don't know why Hardwicke isn't directing these, but it will go down as the stupidest creative decision of this decade in film for sure. I'd be willing to bet that some egotistical moron at Summit was thinking greedy and that Hardwicke wasn't gonna be able to helm something with so much more money riding on it.... insert headslap here.very very disappointing... I really want there to be another installment of the series that measures up to TOT, here's to hoping that happens.",Null,37,72,30 June 2010
