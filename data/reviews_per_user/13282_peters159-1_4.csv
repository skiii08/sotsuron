The Devil's Advocate," Giving the Devil his due
","So many films have been made showing the Devil in so many different forms that it was nice to see Pacino as just another human. Of course, this isn't the first time that the Devil has been portrayed as just a man, Ray Milland did a wonderful and sinister turn in Alias Nick Beal and Walter Huston played the role with abandoned glee in The Devil and Daniel Webster. Even Ray Walston did a merry turn in Dam Yankees. But it took Pacino to really ham it up and make us enjoy every minute of it. Since I really don't believe in 'the devil' I just enjoyed the story and Pacino and even Theron, I just wish she had done something! with her first name. It's a nice fantasy, and yes, vanity is by far my favorite sin. :)",10,1,1,15 August 2006
Love Actually," Love Actually
","I saw Love Actually on TV and liked it. I like it so much that when it came on I watched it again. Unlike so many posters here I didn't find it putrid, boring, or not well put together. It made me feel good!. It made me know that there are all kinds of love and although there were several stories bounding around I found every one of them interesting. I was not disappointed in the director or his material. I think that you have to let yourself go when watching this movie. One story showed that love can conquer all even if you 'don't know the language.' Many poster here seemed to hate this movie, I found it uplifiting, funny, and very romantic. I give this movie 10 stars. And I watch it every time I get the chance. P.S. I also bought the soundtrack. It helped the movie immensely.",10,0,2,27 September 2006
Man on Fire," Denzel's done it again......
","I hadn't noticed but looking at my DVD collection it seems that every other film I have is a Denzel Washington movie. The actor is phenomenal! The only other working major movie star working today that I would call phenomenal would be Al Pacino. He's another actor that will not disappoint. I won't go into a litany of names of Denzel Washinton films but Man on Fire is among them. It's kinda shame that I don't go to the large complexes anymore and usually wait 'till a movie is out on DVD (the public has become overly rude, ill mannered and thoughtless- cell phones, etc.) Much has been written on this board about this wonderful movie and I can only say that like most I can't get over how well the whole thing works. I'm a huge fan of Tony Scott and have an idea of his work. I also like his brother Ridley Scott. Anyway, Man on Fire is right up there with Washington and Scotts best pictures. And Dakota Fanning is right up there with Washington. Violent but an enjoyable experience. I give it a ten. Coda: oft times American writers seem to enjoy putting down Mr Washington's movies. When usually the public will flock to the very movies that have been given a 'thumbs down' or some tepid review. I find that puzzling.",10,1,4,25 July 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," The Shawshank Redemption. Long life.
","What can one say about the Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already been said. I remember when it came out but refused to see it because of the title although I am a big fan of both stars. Besides, I had gotten so burned by critics saying that this movie is a four star or that one only to go and see them and find that the movies mentioned were ordinary or most certainly not the four stars the critics gave them. Even Roger Ebert is guilty of this. So, because of bad information I usually wait for the DVD to come out and that's too bad because I'm denying a good movie some money it could use in it's theatrical release. But so many movies coming out just isn't worth my money. I saw the Shawshank Redemption in rental and turned around and bought a copy. I like prison movies anyway from the TV movie Against the Wall, the story about Attica to the Chicano epic Bound by Honor to the great OZ my all time favorite prison story. The Shawshank Redemption transcends most prison movies because it has heart and is told in such a leisurely fashion that you can absorb it and enjoy the art and superb dialog and the brilliant acting without feeling hurried. Many posters have already commented on this wonderful movie and although I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever made I do enjoy it and am glad that it's in my library.",10,0,0,7 November 2006
