Marie Antoinette," Bad Music sinks shaky movie
","You need look no further than the awful use of rock music in a period piece to figure out why Sofia Coppola is one of, if not the, most overrated directors of recent memory.What was she trying to do with those songs? Was she trying to make the story 'relevent' to younger audiences? Guess what? If you need to stick inappropriate music to make a film relevant, you have a stinker of an irrelevant film no matter how you score it and you might as well do a good job.But Sofia chose to go for the hack job.I can just imagine her and her yes-people meeting and telling themselves how brilliant they were, how insightful and how funny.Next time, Sofia, why don't you hire a couple of honest people to give you feedback? You'll make a much better film and you'll be a much better director for it.",3,2,5,26 October 2006
