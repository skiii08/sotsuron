Requiem for a Dream," Wow.
","I've seen more movies in my life then minutes I've spent with my sister since the age of ten. I've seen it all: Beatings, Rape, Graphic Murder, etc. and I'd never been affected...until this movie.'Requiem for a Dream' grabbed me from the top of the stairs and threw me down, forcing me to watch one of the most disturbing movies ever filmed. Despite the images on the screen, I couldn't turn away. My eyes were locked on the movie, never leaving the screen for a second, not even to blink. The acting was amazing, as was the direction and the editing.Growing up, I used to hear people talk about the rape scene in 'A Clockwork Orange.' I was scared of seeing the movie. When I finally saw it, I was unimpressed. I'd seen it all. But I hadn't seen this movie. There are scenes in this movie that I will never forget, scenes that will come to me in the middle of the night and wake me in a cold sweat. Mr. Aronofsky has out done himself this time, setting the bar so high for his next movie that not even he may be able to overtake it. This is 'A Clockwork Orange' for the 21st century, a movie no one should watch but everyone should see.",10,0,0,26 November 2000
