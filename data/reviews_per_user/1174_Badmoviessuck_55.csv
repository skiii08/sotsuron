The Avengers," A formulaic but good Superhero movie
","This movie isn't a 9/10 or 10/10 nor is it a 5/10 or anywhere below that.
Yes its really formulaic but i think what makes this movie so good is the characters.
The dialogue is pretty good i like the dialogue between Bruce banner and Agent romanoff in the beginning it was pretty tense and i think is one of the best scenes in the movie.
The Avengers having arguing with each other is really good especially the one where Loki was in prison and the reason the dialogue is so good is because these characters are very different from each other and them arguing is very interesting cause you get see their opinion on different subjects and their motives and morals and that's really good when it comes to character one thing that justice league never managed to succeed on.The villain is eh.
Loki is much better than any other villain in the marvel cinematic universe and he was pretty fun to watch on screen.I have nothing really big to say when it comes to the action scenes they where fine i like how the Avengers teamed up when they fought loki.Good movie.
good characters weak story.
If you haven't watched it go do it know cause i think you will have fun watching it",8,1,2,16 October 2018
The Incredible Hulk," bruce...
","This movie is nothing special.
This is my third time watching the movie the two times i watched it i liked it but the third time i didn't.CHARACTER
Bruce Banner is pretty bland.
He is not realy bad but he is just a boring character with a weak character arc.
Betty is bad she is terrible.
The actor just whispers through her lines and is just there to be Bruce's love interest.
They did something interesting were Betty has a boyfriend and it added conflict to the story, they even presented it good they showed her relationship by using visual story telling which is great.
But then they ruined it by Betty seeing Bruce and Bruce deciding to hide from Betty for some stupid reason, then Betty finding Bruce and they just become a couple.
They ignored the conflict they added and they just made this excuse that the boyfriend is really nice.RELATIONSHIP
Their relationship is bad.
There is never conflict when it comes to their relationship and they don't even communicate well.
You just don't believe that they have been a couple for awhile cause it looks like they become awkward when they are together.FINAL ACT
The final act was the worst part of this movie.
They just ignored what they have set-up for over an hour to end the movie.
Blonsky (the terrible underdeveloped villain) want's the stuff to defeat Hulk, he becomes crazy and want's to kill everyone for some reason, and then the military and Bruce just team up to defeat him even though they have hunted Bruce for more than two years.
And the fight was horrible it looked like a Ps2 game and when i say it looks like a Ps2 game i really really mean it.VERDICT
This movie does not really fit in with the MCU.
It's cool for being so different from the other movies but this movie is a failure.",5,0,3,18 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mesa wanna kill Jar Jar
","I'm so mad i have to review this movie again cause the first one i did didn't get sent.
This movie is bad okay everyone knows how much hate it gets and i don't understand people who like this horrible movie it's boring and has bad pacing, the acting is also terrible, the characters are bland, the action is non existent and when it's there it's nothing special and Jar Jar.POLITICS
I don't know why they choose to add politics in a star wars movie a movie that's promoted and directed towards kids.
The politics was so complex for me that i had to watch an twelve minute video of someone explaining it and i quit like half through cause i stopped caring.
The politics in this movie is the reason the pacing is so cancerous cause everytime there was dialogue in the movie people would just stand and talk or sit down and talk to give exposition and it almost made me sleep.CHARACTERS
All of the characters are bad.
Qui gon is an uninteresting character who gets way to much screen time.
Anakin is also a bland character cause they fail to give him a decent character arc.
He has a decent backstory, decent desire and a villain who tries to stop him from achieving his desire he isn't developed but he dosen't need to be developed.
Anakin has a personality but the child actor can't act so he comes off as bland and also he dosen't change as a character but i will let that slide.
Obi-wan is also bad but he has barely any screen time so i won't talk about how bad he is.
No-one cares about Padme so we will talk about a character everyone hates including me Jar Jar Binks.
Jar Jar is clearly meant as a comic relief but people who worked on this movie thought that talking weird is funny and it's not funny at all.
I used to make some of my characters talk weird cause i wanted them to be funny... i was 8 when i did that.
I haven't watched all the other Star wars movie with an critical eye yet but i will say that this one probably will be the worst one for me (and then i watch the last jedi) they just fail to set-up the prequels.VILLAIN
Darth Maul is a terrible Villain.
he barely says anything in this movie which is good and bad.
Good cause the screenplay is terrible and bad cause he dosen't get developed.
Don't get me wrong you can have a good character who barely says anything in the movie by showing how compelling the character is using visuals but they don't even do that.
Darth Maul is a pretty boring villain.VERDICT
This movie had two goals.
To be an enjoyable movie and to set-up the prequels.
and it fails to achieve both of those tasks.
The prequel is about the protagonist Anakin and his relationship with the deuteragonist Obi-wan.
But they fail to develop the relationship with Obi-wan and Anakin they barely get screen time together and Obi-wan didn't even wan't to train the kid but he made a promise with Qui gon and he dosen't want to break that promise.
So i will just say that this is the worst Star Wars prequel ever made but we will see if The attack of the clones can even be a worse movie",4,1,4,27 December 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bella forces zex
","I don't know why i'm making myself suffer like this.
This movie is the worst Twilight movie to ever be created.PACING
The pacing is so slow.
They drag this movie out for so long to reach that near 2 hour mark for some reason.
This movie could have been an hour long but they dragged it out.
The plot is that Bella is pregnant and that he want's to keep the baby but it will kill her, that's it and it's not something that you need to make a 2 hour movie about.TONE
The tone is inconsistent.
In the beginning it looked to be a positive love story between Edward and Bella. I wasn't looking forward to it cause i can't stand them being together, but then after being a positive love story between them two they make a complete 180 and it becomes this dark drama instead.
It wasn't executed properly in my opinion cause it went light to dark really quick it didn't build up to be something dark.
Stuff can get light to dark quick but those should just be dark moments not a second half of a movie.CHARACTERS
Bella is the most annoying and manipulative user i have ever seen.
For the first she pushes Edward to have sex even though he dosen't want to and that is enough to prove how sickening she is.
Jacob has gotten worse cause he is always mad and grumpy and it gets annoying.
I mean he changed as a character giving him a character arc but he just got more annoying.
And Edward is just being Edward doing Edward stuff and is all over the manipulator named Bella.VERDICT
I could just quit now it would be easier for me but i will watch this last movie and review it, i heard that it was bad but fun so i wont die of the bad pacing hopefully.",2,1,2,12 January 2019
Kung Fu Panda," KADUSH!
","Kung fu panda is a enjoyable movie.CHARACTERS
Po is a decent character.
He goes trough a decent character arc.
He is first a man who is a fan of the furious five but then gets choosen to be a dragon warrior. He believes that he isn't the Dragon warrior and dosent fit in until something happens that makes him believe that he is the Dragon warrior and he saves the day.
Shifu is also a good character with a little development.
After Oogway died he Was the guy who needs to take the mantel and lead his students to become the greatest Dragon warriors they can be. He dosent believe in Po first but he felt obligated to lead him the right way when Oogway died and he learned an important lesson.
The side characters were alright.VILLAIN
Tai Lung was actually a good villain.
He is cool and they managed to set up how much of a threat he is to the Heroes and he has an alright backstory that gives the villain a tiny bit of depth.ACTION
The action is pretty amazing.
How they choreographed the action scenes and the different camera movements to make us really see and grasp the action is all well.VERDICT
It's a pretty good movie 8/10",8,0,0,16 June 2019
Iron Man 2," The disappointing sequel
","Iron man 2 had potential to be great actually but there are problems with this movie that prevents it from being so good.CHARACTER
How they handled Tony stark was great... in the beginning but then they rushed his character arc and executed it so poorly that Tony stark just becomes this meh character.
The scene were Tony fought Rhodes was great way to give Tony a character arc (but what happens after kinda dosen't make sense) but then the character arc gets completed by Nick fury coming out of nowhere and giving Tony stuff Howard Stark owned how convenient.VILLAINS
The villains are really bad.
Justin Hammer is this buisness guy (like we haven't seen that before) and he dose what he dose because of money and nothing more.
Ivan does what he odse cause Stark killed his father or something and none of these characters get fleshed out and they have such an anti climactic end.VERDICT
Iron man 2 isn't a bad movie but they make a bunch of missteps that makes Iron man 2 lose it's potential it had",7,0,2,20 April 2019
The Hunger Games," The battle royale before BATTLE ROYALE!!!!!!
","The movie is decent.CHARACTER
Katniss is a decent enough character.
She does her part in the movie but her as a character is pretty weak.
There is no depth nor development to her which makes her a pretty weak character.
Peetah is also an alright character, you get more depth with him than Katniss but it's pretty short and don't really amount to anything really important to the movie.
I just want to say this.
Haymitch was supposed to give Katniss and Peetah tips to get sponsors but he refuses cause he is drunk and he thinks it's pointless but then Haymitch later gives advice on how to get more sponsors that's a bit of a contradiction but ok.
Rue is also an alright character even though things got a bit rushed with her they managed to finish her story in a satisfying wayWORLDBUILDING
The worldbuilding is splendid and they really manage to capture the tone of the world by just a few scenes.
The contrast with the districts and Panem really expands the world and the political themes of the story to enrichen the world really males you hooked but I would like to see more of the other people's reactions to hunger games and how they are affected by 8t a little bit more in detail but other than that it did its job well.VERDICT
The movie has problems (which are nitpicks) but other than that it's a decent movie and I would give it a 7/10",7,0,1,15 June 2019
Spider-Man 2," Pizza Time
","Spider-Man too is so god damn great. and it is one of the greatest Spider man movie (Spider-Man 3 takes the spot lol jk).CHARACTERS
Peter Parker is such a great protagonist and i sat for awhile to think why that was the case.
And it's because he is a so called underdog and we care about him so much.
First everything goes wrong in his life and he never seems to catch a break.
In that scene were Peter is going with JJ Jameson they setup as many subtle inconveniences as possible and then Harry stops being friends with Peter MJ dislikes Peter and she is getting married.
And when Peter saves that girl from the fire someone else died in that fire.
In the beggining he loses his job as said again the relationship with harry is at stake he disappointed MJ he loses his power he needs to pay rent and so much more.
And during all that struggle Peter never gives up and sucks it up instead of being a massive cry baby and we respect him more for that.
And all the resons the inconvenience happens is cause he is Spider-Man and with the loss of his Power he quits being Spider-Man not realising his responsibility until the end of the movie giving him a slight character development.
There is a better video explaining all this just search filmento Spider-Man.
Harry Osborn is an alright character as well and i like the conflict that is between them cause it adds to Harry's character.
MJ is just and alright Damsel in distress.VILLAIN
The villain isn't that great but he has a cool character arc which i can respect.ACTION
The action is so much fun and creative and it manages to set the stakes greatly.
First action scene between Spider-Man and Doc Ok set the stakes greatly by having Doc ok capturing Aunt May about to kill her.
The train fight scene did that as well by setting all the civilians in the train at risk for being killed.VERDICT
Spider-Man 2 is a great film which manages to have a great protagonist",9,0,4,30 March 2019
Spider-Man 3," Good riddance
","It isn't that bad but it isn't that good either it's just meh.CHARACTERS
Peter Parker in the beggining was the character we all loved and they were trying to give him something to make him develop which was good but his character arc was a mess.
He becomes Edgy Peter parker for a few seconds reverts back because Aunt May said some stuff reverts back again after what Harry did and then he starts to dance and then it becomes a short pointless petty love triangle in that one scene were Peter slaps MJ and then he reverts back again.
They are trying to convey this one Theme but it's such a mess that they don't manage to execute it well enough.
Harry was an alright character who was a bit weird.
He lost his memory and regained it after looking at a picture of Norman Osborn (which is stupid but fine) he becomes this 'intimidating' villain who want's Mary Jane to do something that ever gets further executed.
He wantäs MJ to brake up with Pete and then he admits to Pete that it was him who made that plan and it was never explained what the purpose of the plan was.
And Bernard or Bernie whatever his name was he should have said that Norman killed himself a long time ago and how the hell did he know that?
You could have said that Spider-Man told the cops but then Harry would know so it's only Spider-Man and this Butler who knows about the death of Norman and the Butler wasn't even there (makes no sense).VILLAIN
Venom was a terrible villain.
He should have been set-up for Spider-Man 4 cause Eddy Brock is there doing shady stuff later want's to kill Peter Parker and then becomes Venom in a stupid way.
If he knew that stuff was falling down (cause symbiote was falling on his jacket) he would have moved but nope he stood there and just let it all consume him.
And he want's to be bad cause he likes it which is a terrible motivation.
Sandman was an actually decent villain but he should have had way more screen time than he got.VERDICT
It could have been great but sadly it's meh.
It had the right ideas but the problem was the execution of those ideas.",6,3,4,5 April 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Dissapointment
","Second time doing this review god damn it.COMEDY
Comedy was alright it was the reason i gave it a 6/10 but it minimized the stakes of the movie which is not a big flaw i had cause even though they decreased the comedy so that the stakes were shown we still wouldn't care.
This movie would have been called one of the worst Thor movies if it wasn't funny to be honest.CHARACTER
We had a strong female character who was bad cause she had no development and just wanted to join the team because it was really convenient and they didn't have any better way to make her join and when she is with them they instantly become good comrads.
Hulk was alright but they could have done more to make him better like showing how it is to be Hulk and the struggles or some stuff like that.
I like how they depowered Thor but they could have used that as character development.
Thor struggles with not having the hammer and then Odin comes and Thor developes and the movie might be better.
Loki is the best character not good but the best at least cause of the previous movies.VILLAIN
Hela is a bad villain who had an alright motivation but was bland cause lack of screen time.CGI
Cgi was bad just watch Thor vs Hulk to see the worst part of the cgi.ACTION
Action was meh nothing special just a bunch of fast cuts to hide the fact that these people can't fight.
Jason bourne could do way better fast cuts like that cause those fast cuts were an artistic choice not a way to hide how the characters couldn't fight.VERDICT
Overrated movie.
What happened to the guy who ruled the garbage planet they just ignored him.",6,3,7,29 March 2019
Ready Player One," Style over substance
","Ready player one is nothing special.
Just a bunch of pop culture stuff thrown around to give people nostalgia and why they do that they forget to make an actual good story.
This movie is style over substance.CGI & VISUALS
Let me say pros before we say cons.
The visuals and cgi are phenomenal one of the greatest i have ever seen in my opinion and the race scene captures that perfectly.
The creativity and all that amazes me and i thought this movie was gonna be great but sadly not.CHARACTERS
The characters are all bland.
They atleast manage to give them some backstory and a desire but it's a really cheap one. It is 'get the key cause it's necessary for the plot' there is no reason to why they want the key other than they want to control Oasis.
It's excusable if the protagonist want's the keys to control Oasis but if all of them are after the key to control Oasis it's really unoriginality and lazy writing.
But anyways the side characters are bad (as expected) they don't have that much screen time and they should have at least made Aech into a more important and well developed character but she is just a side character.
Wade is a mediocre character who dosen't change as a character which makes the whole adventure pointless and Samantha is a boring love interest (i'll explain later.)
All of them are cheap.ROMANCE
The relationship between Wade and Samantha is rushed.
In the beginning they are instantly friends and then even faster they are nearly lovers.
It was excusable cause There was a conflict happening when IOI attacked but that conflict got abandoned after Wade's aunt and uncle got killed (which was a great scene but never got developed into a greater reason for Wade stopping Nolan) so they never talked about Wade and Samantha's relationship and then when it was most convenient they just kissed.VILLAIN
Nolan had so much potential.
The scene were Wade meets Nolan.
Instead of making him a corepret a-hole they should have made him a lover for pop culture and his motivation for controlling Oasis is understandable but wrong.
And him killing Wade's Uncle and aunt was the perfect way to make the villain more threatening but they failed at doing that.
And the bounty hunter was just bad.VERDICT
It's a bad movie and i understand people who like this movie but i just don't find the enjoyment",4,1,2,26 January 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," Where is the sequel?
","TinTin is alright.
I expected to like the movie a lot but i thought it was decent at best, silly and stupid at worst.SOLUTION
The first problem i have with this movie is the solutions.
They encounter a problem and solve it easily with no challenge.
For example, the plane, the key, Hadokks memory etc.
It gets boring when they just easily solve things with no hardship at all.CHARACTERS
It feels like Hadokks was supposed to be the character that justify's Tintins blandness but he never does that, he is just a man that drinks he has no character arc at all cause they focus more on the story than characters.VILLAIN
The villain is pretty bad he is not horrible i enjoyed watching him a bit but i think they should have given him more screen time.VERDICT
Tintin is a decent movie i was going to make a review of why it sucks but it dosen't have enough flaws to be classified as a bad movie.",6,0,0,13 January 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Iron Man Homecoming
","This movie is great and is one of the best marvel films i have ever seen with a critical eye.CHARACTERS
This movie is about Peter Parker all the other characters are enjoyable to watch but they don't really matter.
Peter Parker has a great character arc one of the best character arcs i have seen in marvel.
Peter has a desire that gets focused on and that is that he want's to prove to Tony Stark that he can do bigger things and go on bigger missions. And how dose he try to prove that? By defeating the Vulture.
Peter Parker is an active character everything that happens in the movie is by him making a choice to defeat Vulture and that's great.
And in the end he changes and matures he manages to prove to Stark that he is capable of doing things and he gets what he wants but he says no to the offer Stark gives him showing that he has matured and changed a bit a a character.
The first Thor movie was good. Why? cause Thor had an decent character arc and he changed as a character but that became a problem in the second Thor movie cause he became a perfect character that could do no wrong.
Captain America was the same but atleast in the sequel they challenged his views and outlook on the world which made the second movie so good, but this movie manage to mature Peter Parker but at the same time not making him to perfect still making him flawed so that they could make him grow as a character in the sequel. Just wanted to point that out.VILLAIN
The villain is good.
Many Marvel villains are bad that's just how it is with Marvel and superhero movies in general but Vulture isn't like the other Marvel Villains, he is actually good.
They made his motive to rob banks and get money personal which adds to the character and the twist were we see that Vulture is father to Liz was great and well thought out, they for shadowed it in the beginning of the movie.
overall a great.ACTION
The action was pretty good.
What i want in a Spider-Man action scene is Spider-Man finding a creative way to solve his problems i have always seen that in Spider-Man movies and cartoons and that's how i grew up viewing Spider-Man action scenes.
And they pretty much nail that part specially in the boat scene were the boat splits in half it adds stakes and it's Spider-Man trying to save people which is what Spider-Man does and it's overall the best scene in this movie.
The Final Act was also great.SUIT
I have heard complaints about Spider-Man having basically his own version of the Iron Man suit with Karen and all.
I agree Spider-Man shouldn't have a special suit that helps him with stuff it removes a little bit of what makes Spider-Man Spider-Man.
But i didn't find it a problem cause that suit is used to add to Peter's character.
Like how he talked to Karen and when Tony removed the suit cause Peter was not responsible.
And they made sure to add stakes to the battle by having Pete use the homemade suit (Btw the homemade suit looks amazing it's my favorite Spidey suit).
Black panther tried to do the same but ultimately failed.
T'Challa and Killmonger fight and then when the train comes they get split so they cant attack each other. Were they are most vulnerable they cant even fight each other and Black panther kills Killmonger by being lucky and having a lucky shot at his chest.
Spider-Man he is vulnerable all the way having a disadvantage and he needs to use his smarts to defeat Vulture.VERDICT
One of the greatest Marvel movies i have ever seen and i hope that the sequel wont disappoint.",9,0,1,29 December 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Better than the first one
","Captain America the first avenger was wasted potential the first half was great and the second half felt rushed.
The sequel however is great better than the first movie.TONE
The tone in this movie is very different from the tone in the last movie.
Captain America and the first avengers was a Science fiction-film, but they changed that in the Winter soldier and made the movie into a Thriller.
I like the tone better in this one.
It's a tone that is different from Marvel but not to different so that the movie doesn't fit in with the MCU the thing that The incredible hulk did.ACTION
This is a fast paced movie, the main plot already starts at the 10 minute mark.
It's good that it's fast paced it keeps the viewer interested.
The choreography for the action is pretty good.
The russo brothers have always managed to make good Action and Fight scenes.
The ne in the first movie was pretty bad.
The best one in the movie was when Bucky and Steve first fought each other.
The choreo was amazing and the different techniques they used to fight was really cool and the fight scene was overall well thought out but the final act was the only part where the fighting sucked.VILLAIN
The villain sucked.
there was actually two villains, The winter soldier and Alexander pierce both of them where bad.
The winter soldier barely talked through out the movie he wasn't even there through out the movie.
They should have developed Winter soldier so that we would like him more as a villain and if not that they could have made Alexander pierce a better villain.
His motive 'Kill 20 million to save 7 billion' it's basically the same as i want to destroy the world but they lazily changed it up a bit.
If the winter soldier sucked as a villain and Alexander pierce was a good villain then it would be okay but because both of them sucked it's not okay.CHARACTERS
The characters are pretty good.
Steve rogers was good, Black widow was good, Sam wilson was meh and Nick fury was meh.
They managed to develop Steve rogers more as character and him wanting to do the right thing no matter what happens to him really ads to his character.
Black widow was also good we get to know her better as a character but Sam wilson and Nick fury didn't have much development but i like Nick fury more because of this movie and how important he is in this movie.FINAL ACT
Let me keep this short.
The final act was a mess.
really mediocre to bad action.
The final battle between Steve and Bucky didn't have any stakes nor did it carry any weight it was all boring action.
But that's just how i feel.VERDICT
Just watch the movie",8,0,0,19 October 2018
Doctor Strange," Got it from Inception
","I really liked this movie actually.CHARACTERS
Steven Strange is a well fleshed out character with a really good character arc.
We get to se him being an a hole to slowly developing into being a true hero.
You could say that the story is formulaic and all but i didn't really mind it that much (and yes it's a minor flaw that it's formulaic) and they managed to also make a few other characters interesting.
Ancient one is a interesting character.
I though she would be that flawless person that dies near the end of the movie but they showed that she has flaws and that nobody is perfect which is a great addition which strengthens the movie.
And the other guy with sword (i forgot his name) was also an interesting character who left Strange and Wong in the end which was an interesting scene.VILLAIN
The villain was terrible one of the worst marvel villain to be ever created and that's why i gave this movie an 8/10 instead of a 9/10.ACTION
I lacked how they had interesting areas to do the fight scenes even though they weren't that amazingly well choreographed.FINAL ACT
The final act was underwhelming.
They had an interesting place to do an action scene but because of the mediocre choreography the action wasn't really that interesting and it ended pretty short.VERDICT
I really like the movie.FINAL WORD
I promised myself to watch as many marvel movies and review them so i will be prepared for endgame.
I'll probably watch.
Civil war.
Infinity war (i'll definetely watch that movie)
Ant man and the wasp

Pacific Rim," Live action Darling in the franXX
","Pacific Rim is good but not great.CHARACTERS
The reason this movie is good is because of the characters, but it's also a reason for why it's not great.
Raleigh is a pretty bland protagonist that has a conflict which never ever gets explored and gets ignored through out the movie which makes him really bland and the acting of that protagonist isn't really that amazing either.
Mako is the only one who is even a decent character cause they manage to give her conflict and a backstory in a subtle way which gives the viewer enough information to know what's going on with her character but also wanting more from her backstory (they showed that greatly with the scene of her as a kid) and doing that they can actually make sequels, novels, comics etc explaining her backstory so they can get extra cash by expanding the lore of Pacific rim (which they did).
But how they finished mako's character arc was bad.
When they used the gipsy (I think) for the first time it didn't go well for mako and mako couldn't control the gipsy with Raleigh which would be a good way to develop her character but they just ignore and for the second time the use gipsy they did very well ignoring the conflict that was set up.
Chuc Hansen is a very bad character.
The reason I bring him up is cause they rushed his character arc and executed it very poorly.
They broke the rule with show don't tell and Stacker just said every problem Chuc Hansen had which could potentially be used to develop Hansen. One of those problems were daddy issues which the movie never shown that Chuc had so we never knew it until Stacker said it.CGI
the CGI was really good and they manage to blend in the location the robot and the Kaiju really well.ACTION
The action was bland it was basically a robot hitting a monster in the most blandest way possible.
It was just a bunch of basic moves you see used in many movies.
And the weird thing is that when Raleigh was fighting Makos candidates the fighting style there is very very different from what we see in the movie.
In real life they use a certain fighting style that's pretty well choreographed but when they fight in the robot that fighting style gets thrown out the window and they just use basic fighting techniques.FINAL ACT
The final act was great and put me on edge managing to finalize a bit of Makos arc and they manage to set the stakes pretty high which is a good feat cause this movie has those 'the end of the world' stakes that can often go bad.VERDICT
I heard there was a sequel to this movie which I wonder how that's even possible since they won and they prevented the Kaiju from arriving in their world.
They will probably do a bs explanation to why the Kaiju can still arrive at their world.
6/10 it's fun.",6,0,0,6 June 2019
Ant-Man," Decent movie
","Ant-Man is good it has good stuff in the movie but there are flaws ht instantly make it a 7/10 for me.CHARACTERS
The whole movie felt rushed.
They give Hope a character arc and they resolve it after 40 minutes, they don't even develop Hope as a character, she just is mad at Hank for not telling the truth and all that and then Hank talks to her for awhile and all is resolved.
Scott is a decent character he goes through a decent character having a clear goal that is personal and he cant achieve that goal cause of his background so he has to change which is a pretty good character arc in my opinion.CGI
The CGI is the best part in this movie.
How it looks when Ant-Man is small is very good and when Ant-Man fought Cross looked beautiful.VILLAIN
The villain is horrible.
He has a trashy motivation that is to sell the yellow jacket for money.
He has no development at all he is just this lousy villain that cant be taken serious.VERDICT
The movie is decent.",7,0,1,31 December 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," It could have been something great
","The first half of the movie was great.
It really managed to develop Steve rogers as a character and his motivation to why he wants to fight the war.
But after Steve rogers gets buff then the movie becomes decent if the second half was as good as the first, the movie would be a 9/10 cause the second half felt rushed.The characters in the movie where... eh.
it felt like they where just there, many of them never got developed.
the characters didn't make the movie better or worse.But the scene i despise is the scene where The blondie kisses Steve.
The reason they had that scene is so that there could be some problems with the relationship Steve and Peggy have but they just put the blondie in the movie never mentioned her before or after the movie and when Peggy was mad at Steve all got forgotten because Bucky died.
So there was no point in having that scene.Red skull was bad he was the generic super villain that wanted to win the war nothing special about him.The movie is good i feel like they needed to make the movie longer so that it could have been better but its overall a good movie.",7,0,0,16 October 2018
The Godfather: Part II," Wonderful sequel
","This movie is just as good if not better than The Godfather.CHARACTERS
Michael is unrecognisable in this movie.
How his character developed and into this cold hearted man is amazing and compelling and he is one of the greatest protagonist i have seen.
The prequel story was great as well.
How they showed how Vito became so popular and owned the streets naming himself the godfather is a compelling story were we see how he develops and becomes who he was in the first movie.
They managed to do what a sequel should do, expand on the lore.
I like as well how they give Fredo an small arc and it shows how they care about each one of the characters.
and the end of Vitos arc in the movie was great when he gave revenge and also that final shot were we see the Michael before The Godfather and the Micheal after and we can see how they are vastly different with the posture and look showing that Michael is different.VERDICT
This movie is great would rewatch.",9,0,0,29 December 2018
Bird Box," Fat wamen kills all
","Oh gosh this movie is enjoyable.
I enjoyed the heck out of this movie and in my opinion was a roller coaster ride i would not wanna experience again.
But sadly this movie isn't that good.
The plot is interesting but similar to a quiet place (that's not a flaw just wanted to point that out don't @ me) and characters.THE FIRST SCENE
The first scene was good and interesting and Sandra Bullock really nailed the acting in the beginning.
She is serious but scared and she shows how bad and serious the situation is by explaining what the kids need to do and what will happen if they don't follow orders.
But then the 'Flashback' starts and pretty much ruins everything.
Until we see our main survivors we know what will happen to them so any shock factor given when someone dies is gone.
PLOT
The plot is simple.
Creatures attack and if you look at them you want to kermit sewerside.
I have heard that the book never explains where the creatures came from so the comic relief explains by giving a minor exposition dump and when they ask how he knew he said that he did research. Well that's convenient.
I mean at least they explain what they are but they never explain were they came from but i'll let that slide.CHARACTERS
They were already in trouble when they had so many characters.
So what they do is kill them of.
All of the main survivors never gets developed or has any depth.
I'm not asking a lot when it comes to depth and development with these characters i just want something.
For example humanize them show their life what they wanted to achieve in life and how they can't get that cause of the current situation, or show them argue, they did that a little which was good but it was all because of that bald old man disagreeing and being rude, what i want them to do is show all of them disagreeing and show their way of thinking and go personal so that we can expand on the characters.
Cause all of the characters were there just to die they had no other importance at all.
Malorie was a mediocre protagonist she didn't have a lot of development but none of the characters had.VERDICT
Enjoyable movie you wont get bored.",6,0,3,8 January 2019
The Bourne Identity," Spi movie done right
","This movie is good.
The reason that it's so good is because of Jason bourne.CHARACTER
Jason bourne is an compelling character who goes through an pretty great character arc cause if Jason bourne wasn't as good as a character as he is this movie would have been a 3/10.
In the beginning of the movie we already get to know what his name is and his name is, when his birthday is and where he was born, that's all we know about him but then we see that he has a lot of passports saying that he lives in Canada Schweiz etc.
And then when get to see that he has a hidden compartment and there, there is guns and money.
We never know why he took all of the money and threw the gun i think it's because he was aware that people where watching him so he needed to take the stuff and escape and that beginning scene was amazing.
So we get to know a bit who Jason bourne is.
His desire is easy, survival, he want's to try to do the right thing and survive while knowing more about who he is that's his two desire's.
the people who are giving him a challenge doing so is Alexander and his team they are tracking bourne to kill him.
He dosen't face a lot of challenges but it's a fun ride nonetheless.
And change he dosen't change a lot as a person which isn't a flaw in the movie.
The change we get is that bourne remembers what happend and what he did and who he really is.RELATIONSHIP
This is gonna be short but i like how they deal'd with the relationship between Bourne and Marie. They kissed and they are a couple but they don't show that they are an actual couple cause the thing i hate with certain movies is when characters relationship dosen't develop that well but they become a couple and they act like a real couple kissing each other loving each other even though their relationship wasn't that much developed but that dosen't happen in the bourne identity.
They kiss in one scene and that's it, they show a little bit that they love each other but they don't show that much and Marie isn't even there like 30 or 40% of the movie cause bourne made a choice to keep her safe.ACTION
The action is decent.
I feel like they could have gone more creative with the action cause all it was, was Jason fighting bad guy's and it just felt like there was no emotion to the action.
Example: the car chase, it was the worst scene in the movie cause it felt tedious and it didn't have any stakes.
Most of these action scenes don't have any stakes but it didn't bother me that much.VERDICT
The bourne identity is a solid movie i think you guys will like cause it has a great character arc when it comes to Jason bourne",8,1,1,16 December 2018
Justice League," Why again?
","I have watched 4 DCEU movies.
Wonder Woman.
BvS
Man of steel
And Justice league the one i'm reviewing now.
It has been a long time since it came out but i will review it anyways cause why not.CHARACTERS
All the characters have almost no personality.
Batman has no personality, Wonder Woman has no personality, Aquaman has some personality, Cyborg has the least personality, And Superman has no personality.
The Flash has the most personality but he is just annoying.
They should have just made a solo film of all these characters instead of having a bunch of undeveloped characters.
How could they not think that this is a bad idea.
1. The director of the movie had to leave cause of some personal issues so the new director needs to make the movie instead.
2. The new director reshoots most of the scenes cause he felt like the scenes weren't good enough to show to the audience.
3. The director needs to develop 3 characters in 1 movie.
4. Cause Warner bros are a bunch of idiots, The director needs to cut most of the movies scenes so that the movie could be only 2 hours long.
This movie is a mess.VILLAIN
Steppenwolf is really really bad he has no development he has 0 personality and has really weak motivation.SUPERMAN
The revival of Superman was a mess.
It felt like a chore that had to be done to please the DC fans.
And its not really a spoiler cause they said that Henry cavill would be in Justice league.
And it obviously shows that they don't really care about the DCEU they are just doing it for the money.
They could have had Superman dead make a bunch of solo films where they develop all the Justice league characters and then when Justice league comes out then they could revive superman but they cant just revive him any how.
But sadly Warner bros revived Superman any how.
They fought Superman and then Louis lane came and then everything was fine.
That's the biggest Deus ex machina i have ever seen in a movie.
I never thought that Superman and Louis lane where a good couple in the DCEU movies and now to make us believe that Superman and Louis lane are such a good couple that love can solve Superman's evilness when he gets revived it just blows my mind.
Superman feels like an unnecessary character and that's shocking cause Superman should be the most important character in the movie.ACTION
The action is bad its so uninspired.
They really thought of the most basic way to make an action scene.
Infinity war a good movie the action scene there was amazing many different fighting styles many cool moments i don't need to say more about the fighting.
But Justice league its the opposite.VERDICT 
If you haven't watched justice league don't watch it just ignore it and watch a better movie instead.",3,0,4,16 October 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The second one is 4 hours long......Kill me.
","This movie is good actually.
It's and enjoyable fantasy adventure that will give you a fun ride.
It has some pacing issues at the beginning of the movie but after like 1 hour or so the movie get's better with it's pacing.
The action is well done and i enjoyed it throughout the movie.
But there is this one problem with the movie which i will talk about.CHARACTERS
The characters are very weak.
Frodo is a weak protagonist, Sam is barely there in the movie. Mary and Pippin are weak characters and pretty much all of the gang are weakly written.
But i'll give it the benefit of the doubt that they will be developed on the second and third movie and this movie had clearly story driven characters cause Frodo is kind of a passive character.
Frodo made about two choices in the movie.
The first one that starts the adventure, that choice was so that he could survive and that the world would go under and that gandalf told him to make that choice.
The second one was Frodo decided all by himself but the rest of the movie Frodo and all the other characters are let stuff happen to them which makes them passive.
It's nothing wrong with that and they could do alot to change that anyways but they should have atleast gave all the characters a little more depth not a lot but just a little.
And i think Frodo should have somewhat changed in the first movie like for example he is going a little bit more crazy cause of the ring but i believe that they would keep that in the sequel and i am sure that the sequel is going to be better than the first one.VERDICT
Overall a solid movie with some problems but they aren't major problems and i recommend this movie",8,1,1,25 November 2018
Man of Steel," SuperBland
","This movie was not that great.
BEGINNING
It started out really bad with generic lame dialogue and action with no emotion to it, piss poor acting and a generic af score.CHARACTER
At least they tried to make Clark kent a good character but they failed.
I would believe that the Theme of this movie is purpose.
What's Clark kent's purpose in this world but they executed that Theme really poorly.
They show flashbacks of Clark kent having conflict of who he is and that develops Clark kent into becoming a pretty interesting character but they threw all that out of the window cause they needed Big CGI action for an hour straight.
Clark finds his purpose because he conveniently and without explanation worked at a place with Lois Lane and found a ship or a place that's from Krypton.
His dad arrives and explains his purpose and Clark kent's development is over.
It's over in the 40 minute mark and the rest is bland and boring action.ACTION
The action has no stakes in it.
It's basically Super man has to save the world.
Which is high stakes really early in the first DCEU movie and the first Superman movie in the DCEU.
The stakes dosen't build up it just happen out of the blue (maybe if they didn't have an hour of action then they could have build up the stakes of this movie)RELATIONSHIP
Lois Lane is a really bland character but the relationship with Clark is really terrible.
First she revealed that there was a being more powerful than man which risks the livelyhood of Clark kent but then Cöark being as virtuos as he is forgives her and makes love with her.
And the kissing scene when they destroyed that big thing destroying the city i would have cut that out cause i believe that the movie would be a bit better if that wasn't there cause they have no reason to love each other.VILLAIN
The villain is not that good.
His motivations are understandable but he is so generic that he becomes a bad villain.
And Clark killing Zod was stupid the family had room to escape but they didn't escape and Super man could have made so that Zod didn't shoot at the family.VERDICT
This movie is not good at all and is just another failure.",5,1,5,14 April 2019
Kung Fu Panda 2," KADUSH! 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALO
","Kung fu panda 2 is a better made movie than Kung fu panda.CHARACTER
Po gets way more development in this movie than in the last movie.
In this movie he goes through self discovery not knowing who he is and were he came from but manages to pull himself together and become a more stronger man afterwards.VILLAIN
Shen was also a pretty good villain.
He wasn't as good as Tai Lung but they manage to do the same with him as they did to Tau lung to make him an acceptable villain.
He dosent show his strength but he manages to be a good plot device for Pos development and he has a bit of a backstory himself to give him a little bit more depth.ACTION
The action was yet again amazing and awesomely choreographed.
The different shots and creative techniques they use will definitely get you hooked.VERDICT
Awesome movie and really a worthy sequel.
I really wonder what they will do in Kung fu panda 3",8,1,1,16 June 2019
"I, Robot"," Shia LaBeouf leads the revolution
","This movie could have been way better.
I'll be honest i like it, it has interesting themes but there are flaws in this movie i can't ignore.CHARACTERS
Spooner is a generic character.
He has no real depth brought into him but in my opinion he is decent but his one liners are cringe af.
I liked the scene where he finally explained why he didn't trust the robots and it was a pretty sad story actually and i liked that scene a lot, but Spooner is still dumb.
People kept asking him why he didn't trust the robots but he just gave them the same moot point and that was 'they don't have feelings they only choose the most logical decision' which dosen't prove his argument and the moment where the house broke down and he was mad at the robots was stupid, the robot was gonna demolish the house 8.00 but he still blames them for warning him.
And that moment when we get to know that Spooner has an robot arm is stupid and is there cause of plot convenience, and i know that they knew that too.
Susan was this generic smart chic that is there to give exposition.
She has no depth at all and the closest thing to depth they give to her is, 1. Her crying and 2. Her not killing Sonny. That's all they give.
Sonny is the best character in the movie cause you can resonate with him the most but he just lacks development.
We barely get screen time with Sonny cause that screen time is wasted by showing mindless action and showing characters we don't care about.CGI
The CGI is bad
this movie didn't age well.
It looks like a PS2 game 50% of the time.
I like how they designed those new robots.
They look weird cause they gave them a face to try to humanize them to get a larger audience but that ended up looking weird and i like that cause that shows that you can't humanize a non human.THEME
The theme was what made the movie a 6/10.
They executed the themes of being a human pretty good but they could have done better.
All they needed to do is to not make Spooner look like an idiot 70% of the movie but either than that the themes where executed exceptionally.VILLAIN
The villain VIKI is dumb.
She is this surprise villain that shows up int the end, those villains almost never work.
They managed to make her motives really good actually but she was still a bad villain cause lack of development.
Just because the villain has a good motive dosen't mean that the villain is instantly a good one they need to be developed.VERDICT
If you want a better version of this disappointing movie i recommend you check out Detroit become human",6,0,1,21 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," All i could ask for
","Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse is really good actually one of the if not the best Spider-Man movie.
It was funny exciting and a well written movieCHARACTER
I think the reasons people like this movie is cause of Miles Morales.
He is a character not ready to take the responsebility as Spider-Man and not only that he has a goal to stop the world from ending cause he made a promis to Peter Parker.
I think he couldn't control his power cause Miles wasn't ready to be Spider-Man yet cause he didn't want to accept the responsibility and i think him turning invinsible is a subtle way to show that.
And Miles uncle and how they handled him is a great way to add conflict and it further develops Miles into being the person he is.
But i wanted them to explain why he did what he did.
He is a well developed character.
Peter Parker is a meh character with decent development that don't get as focused on.
He has problems with Mary Jane so he acts all negative but being with Miles makes him slowly change and he pulls himself together and becomes a better man being able to change who he is.
The rest of the Spidey people are underdeveloped.VILLAIN
The villain was actually not bad.
King pin hade a motivation and he wasn't this all bland Villain.
Even though the backstory was messy you could still understand his motives and why he is doing this.VERDICT
Great Movie to watch.

Divergent," Dievirgin
","Divergent is a bland experience and they do not do anything new with the story they are telling.ORIGINALITY
This movie has a lack of originality.
Cause 80% of the movie is just Beatrice trying to not be under the line and we see her trying to succeed, that is her desire through out the movie.
They didn't use their time to try something new with the story to improve the experience.CHARACTERS
They didn't try to develop the side characters they choose their time to only focus on Beatrice, It's fine to let the side characters have little screen time but the movie would have been better if they made the side characters have a good amount of screen time and they manage to develop the characters.
Beatrice is this bland character who has no personality whatsoever.
For me it felt like that sometimes she was a bit shy and when the plot needed her to not be shy then she wasn't, when it came to her it felt like her personality was unclear and lacking.
And during the end of the her growing as a character was almost non existent.
She began as a trash fighter and then turned into a decent fighter that's the only growth you will get from her and we never get to see how she develops and becomes a decent fighter cause when she trained hard she was still trash at fighting and then magically she could fight decently cause it was convenient for the plot.
Beatrice is there for plot convenience.
Four is bland as hell.
I'll give them some props for managing to make him grow as a character that's the only good thing about him and that growth felt rushed and poorly executed.
He has more personality than Beatrice and we could clearly see those personality traits.
Four might be bland but he is still better than Beatrice.VILLAIN
The villain was bad she had a lack of screen time and if she had more screen time she would be a decent villain.
I understand her motive that they kill the Divergents cause they are scared of the unknown but i think it could have been developed more.VERDICT
This movie is an unoriginal wasted potential that people should not watch.",4,1,2,3 December 2018
Spider-Man," Thanksgiving scene was a masterpiece lol
","What a great movie this is.
It might corny and filled with the cheese but that's a part of what makes this movie so good.CHARACTER
Toby maguire is an excellent Peter parker.
They gave him a short but great character arc in the beginning of the movie but even after that they managed to make Peter parker a great loving character and you can see that with the dialogue that is being provided.
For example the first time Mary Jane and Peter parker are having a real discussion and when Peter parker talks to Mary jane after graduating college all these dialogues show how great and loving of a character Peter is.
Harry is a decent character who is affected by his father not being there for him and it shows there is more to come.
Mary Jane was damsel in distress and was a pretty meh character.VILLAIN
I would call Green goblin one of the greatest generic villains i have ever seen.
He might be generic but i still love him (Maybe cause of Willem Dafoe's performance) But at least he faced a challenge for Peter.SPIDER-MAN
Toby maguire isn't that good of a Spider-Man cause he dosen't speak alot or make any jokes.THANKSGIVING
The thanksgiving scene was amazing.
This were all gets bad.
Osborn figures out Peter's secret and Henry and MJ arent in such a good terms when Norman says some rude stuff.
It was a great set-up to the end and i know there is a greater reson to why this scene is so great but i cant come up with it (i'll edit this later when i do)VERDICT

The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazingly dissapointing
","This is the third time im doing this review cause for some reason i couldn't send it but here we go again im just gonna make this quick.PETER PARKER
Peter parker is lame in this movie he is smart cool and confident the stuff that Peter shouldn't be.
Peter parker is a nerd and they never show how nerdy he is which is lame.SPIDER-MAN
Spider-Man is mediocre in this one.
This Spider-Man is better than Sam Raimi's Spider-Man but he is still mediocre.
He has only cracked jokes twice in this movie and all of them fell flat.
It felt like the reason they made Spider-Man crack jokes is because they wanted to please the fans which they did a poor job of doingSUIT
The suit looks like a basketball.
I wont go deep into the suit but it looks like a basketball and they should have just stuck to the classic.
You can change the Spider-Man suit but as long as it looks good and homecoming did great on changing the suit to look good.CHARACTERS
The characters are weak.
Aunt may is there to worry, Uncle Ben is there to die, Captain stacy has no purpose to the story and Dr Connors/ The Lizard is just the worst.
They should have gave the characters more purpose to the story and they just feel lazily written.VILLAIN
The Lizard is one of the worst villains i have ever seen but lets begin with Dr connors.
Dr connors is underdeveloped we almost know nothing about him and we never get to see how much he struggles without an arm which is bd development.
The Lizard is worse he has no personality he gives no threat to Spider-Man.
And his one motivation for killing Spider-Man that gets ignored later on is 'He is stopping me from doing what i want to do, i will kill him.'
That gets ignored after Lizard fights Spidey in school and then he has another motive to turn everyone into Lizards which is stupid.
And you know yo made abad villain if the police the ones who are trying to save and help people are bigger threats to Spider-Man than the main villain.ACTION
The action is bad.
A good Spider-Man action scene is when Spider-Man tries to find a way to solve his problems but des it in a creative way, there is none of that in this movie.
The best action scene is Lizard vs Spider-Man when they fight in the school but that scene is pointless cause the reason they have that scene is because The Lizard want's to kill Spider-Man and has a bad motivation for why but after that scene they just ignore the motivation the Lizard has for killing Spider-Man.
Action bad.DEATH
I will keep this short the reason Uncle Ben died is because Peter was mad at the store owner for doing his job.
And Captain stacy's death and the Final act with him was pointless, the reason it was there cause after all the disagreements they had with each other they finally work together but they never developed how there opinions are so different so we don't really care if he dies.Teacher: You are late Mr Parker.
Peter: Sorry for being late it will never happen again
Teacher: Don't make promises you can't keep
Peter sits behind Gwen
Peter: yeah but those are the best kind
Idk why i did that but who caresVERDICT

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Credence should have been the main focus
","I have been a huge fan of Harry potter.
I have watched all of the movies (except for the newest one Crimes of grindelwald) and i have enjoyed all of them.
I have only read 5 of the books and i will continue to read more of them
Cause the second Fantastic beast movie has been released i will review the first movie and tomorrow i will watch the second one.
This movie was decent.
It had pacing issues but overall i liked it.CHARACTERS
Newt is an acceptable protagonist who has personality.
We know he is an introverted guy who cares about creatures and want's them to live in peace.
They could have gone a little bit deeper with Newt as a character but i like the mystery behind him.
The biggest problem i had with him is that he didn't grow as a character and if cause of that it felt like the adventure was meaningless cause he didn't learn from it and grow as a character.
Jacob was mediocre he was just the mediocre comic relief and the guy people explain to what's going on so that we understand what's going on.
They didn't develop him enough he had motivation and personality but those where weakly developed and he was a mediocre character overall.
Porpentina was a pretty bad character as well they didn't develop her as a character and she was just there cause she is important to start of the plot and she is just there in the end of the plot.
She is more important than Jacob but she is also worse than him.
Queenie she has the same flaws as the other characters that they didn't develop her moving on.ACTION
The action lacked creativity so they just ended up being mediocre.
It's just a bunch of people casting spells and others blocking it and they almost didn't try anything new.
it was kinda enjoyable when Newt tried to catch all of the beast.
They tried something new but that ended up being decent.VILLAIN
Credence to me is ans should have been the main villain but instead they focused the plot to something else that was mildly important.
They should have made the movie longer so that they could have developed Credence more.
Credence could have been great he could have been a great misunderstood but he just ended up being a mediocre character that contributed to the ending of the movie.VERDICT
This is a decent movie with some good stuff here and there i will watch the sequel and review it and i will as well review all 8 of the Harry potter movies.
Go watch it i think you will enjoy",7,1,1,23 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," The Best MCU movie
","CHARACTERS
Avengers end game is the best MCU movie to ever be created imo.
Some of the characters (like Tony and Rogers) were greatly developed
Ronin went from something terrible happening to him and that changed him as a person and after he decided to have hope another conflict ensued on him.
Ronin was developed good but they could have done way more.
Like him being easily convinced to save everyone was not that cool and he really should have had more conflict to make him a better character.
Tony has had the greatest character arc in this whole entire Franchise.
Going to not caring about lives to trying to save every single one of them and his death is great.
Steve Rogers the virtuous guy who has gone through alot decided on a decision that changed him and made him learn. And him lifting the hammer was amazing.
Heck even Nebula had a great character arc.
She went from trying to kill Gotg to actually trying to save the world and it's pretty compelling actually
Thor is comedy gold but the character arc he had could have been way better but it wasn't
Hulk is also pretty funny but he never got used that much.
Captain Marvel felt a bit like a Deus ex machine and it got pretty annoying but I'm glad she wasn't in the movie that much.VILLAIN
Thanos was actually a good villain as well.
He wanted to make half of the people disappear but he knew that it wouldn't work so he changed his ideology to destroy and rebuild and it shows how greatly compelling he is and he is one of the greatest MCU villains.TIMELINE
The timeline was handled recentely but I have one question I just want to be answerd cause it makes me really confused.
So after the Thanos snap the movie is played in the year 2023 and then everyone that died in 2018 comes back alive in 2023.
I can understand that they look the same age as when they died in the movie but my problem is shouldn't Ned and Peter be out of high school since Peter came back alive in the year 2023.
That's the only thing that confuses me when it comes to this movie and I want an answer. (I know the answer now but I won't delete this cause I want you guys to see my stupidity)VERDICT
The ending was truly great and I th8nk the MCU should have just stopped at Endgame bit sadly 20 more movies has to be made.
But nothing I tell you will top endgame cause imo it feels like the most Marvel comicy movie out of all the 21 movies.",9,1,5,26 April 2019
Twilight," Bella like shiny man
","This movie is terrible and i truly hate it.THE FIRST 50 MINUTES
The first 50 minutes were the worst.
For the first the acting was horrendous and the interaction between Bella and Edward was very hard to watch cause they couldn't even speak properly.
Edward was talking quietly and took pauses every sentence.
Bella said a bunch of short answers and barely speaked at all.
The beginning was also bad.
They had to explain to us what was going on and what was happening in the beginning of the movie instead of showing us that through visuals and dialogue. And it was easy for them, all they needed to do was remove Bella as the narrator and add some dialogues between Bella and her Mom and Dad.
There was this one funny scene tho.
It was when Edward couldn't be near Bella, Bella thought it was cause of her smell, and we never got to know that until later so we just get to see this scene were Edward is avoiding Bella which was hilarious to me.CHARACTERS
Bella is an annoying character.
throughout the movie she barely speaks properly.
She is always so silent and say a bunch of short answers and she barely has character development.
Kristen Stewart probably thought barely speaking properly meant you were and introverted shy girl.
But there were these moments when she speaked properly that was when it was convenient for the plot.
Edward was better he actually went through an character arc even though it was a bad one which dosen't really make sense.
His desire is to be with Bella and the thing holding him back is the blood but he manages to control himself without any explanation and how he manages to not kill Bella in the end is by Dr Cullen doing a little pep talk.VILLAIN
The Villain James is the worst villain i have ever seen so far.
He just shows up sees human and then goes beserk.
James was with a gang and they did this crime where they killed a man in s boat. What was the point with that?
They were setting up these evil trio but then they just abandon the set-up they made and decided to make a random person in the trio with the least screen time the main villain.ROMANCE
The romance between Bella and Edward was the worst romance i have ever seen.
They barely spend time together before Bella knew that Edward was a vampire but she just says 'I'm not scared of you' 'I wanna be with you' like they were hanging out with each other for a long while and the time they did hang out with each other was to move forward the plot, not expanding their relationship.CGI
CGI was horrendous, looked unnatural when Edward was running.
He ran normally but the background was moving quicker than he ran which looked weird.VERDICT
This movie fails at being what it was supposed to be, a romantic film with some fantasy elements.
This movie is disgusting",3,3,5,2 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Should have gone for the head
","Avengers infinity war is great.
I will keep it short cause the reasons why I like this movie people have already said in a better way than I could ever doCHARACTERS
Thanos is the best villain in the entire MCU and a great protagonist.
We can understand his goal for wanting to whipe out half of the people In this galaxy and there is alot of sacrifice conflict and sympathy for what he is doing to achieve this goal which makes his motivation more personal.
He kills Gamora so that he could succeed in his goal to get an infinity stone and that makes him suffer.
His planet got destroyed cause of over population and Gamoras planet became great because of Thanos whipping out half of the people in that planet and that makes us understand Thanos even more.
If he could have saved people by killing half of the population in that planet why can't he do the same everywhere else?
And that's what makes his motivation so great. Understandable but flawed.
He could have also used his mighty power (I.e. when he gets all the infinity stones) to give resources to people so there was no need to kill of half of the people in the galaxy but because he is a flawed person he dosent see that (and his character gets better in endgame) he is an imperfect character with great development depth and arc and the fact that he won makes the movie even better when you see the last scene of him in his farm.OTHER STUFF
The structure was really good and everyone acted in character and I think Peter Quill and Tony stark were the best characters of the heroes who were fighting Thanos.
Peter Quill being emotional over the conflict of Gamora and that makes him act irrational.
And Tony stark dealing Great consequences for what he has done (and it gets better in endgame) And the action is really amazing specially in the Titan fighting scene were every thing was so well choreographed. this movie is one of the best MCU movies.VERDICT
This movie is really good.",9,1,3,27 April 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," I'm dying Peter
","I don't like this movie.
It's not good and that's something almost every film critic agrees on.
And gonna give my reasons to why it's bad.SPIDER-MAN
Spider-Man is way better in this movie than the last one.
He actually consistently cracks jokes but of course there is a problem with that.
First the jokes fall flat 98% of the time the jokkes Spider-Man throws around are the simplest jokes you can come up with and none of them are good.
There was one joke in the movie that made me chuckle and that was when Spider-Man teamed up with fire men to splash water on Electro.
It made me chuckle a bit but that was the only time the movie made me chuckle.
or sorry that was a lie there was this other scene when Harry said 'I'm dying Peter.'
That got me laughing.
Overall Spider-Man in the movie is a 6/10 in the last movie he was a 4/10 which is an improvement.CHARACTERS
Idk what to say about the characters.
i never liked any of them i never hated any of them.
Aunt may is still there to worry and be stressed about everything.
Gwen is now an independent wamen who can make her own decisions.
It's always a thing in these movies that when a character is supposed to die in the movie they make sure that they are there to die they don't have any other importance than to die.
And that's the same for Gwen stacy she is an independent wamen just so that she could die.
She gets herself into these crazy situations where she could die and her excuse is that she makes her own decisions.
Peter in this movie was fine i wish i have something to say about him but i don't so lets move on to the villains.VILLAINS
The villains are what made this movie so bad.
I don't even know Electro's motivation to kill Spider-Man or i think is that they are teasing him and they think that he is a monster and that is a weak motivation that never gets talked about or developed.
Electro is just has no personality.
But Harry he is probably worse.
He is a character that never got talked about in the last movie they never even said his name there and then they just say in the sequel.
'Yeah Peter and Harry where best friends they did a lot together:'
And it just blows my mind that they did that.
Harry has some personality which is good.
And his motivation for killing Spider-Man is that he needs his blood that motivation isn't completely bad and is in my opinion mediocre.
But when Harry turns into Green Goblin then he is a worse character but luckily we never got to see how bad Green Goblin could have been.ACTION
The action is way better in this movie it looks so cool and great but it's not really that creative or dose anything new.
They never do anything new with Spider-Man's combat skills in this franchise which leaves the action just mediocre.
This is a nitpick but why whenever Spider-Man is gonna fight some evil dude why do people watch him fight shouldn't the police make sure that the people are as far away from the crime as possible.
But anyway the action overall is mediocre.TONE
The tone is way more different in this movie and that's why i thought at the time that this movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I was dumb back then.
But i like the tone it's different and looks way more cooler but the movie is still badCGI
In my opinion the CGI looks amazing it's so beautiful to look at Spider-Man fighting the villains but that's another small thing i wanted to talk about.SUIT
The suit looks way better it doesn't look like a basketball this time and i would say it's one of the best Spider-Man suits.THE RELATIONSHIP
It's mediocre.
I like the scene where Peter and Gwen where talking about ground rules.
The topic of ground rules was stupid but the chemistry between them was good and it seemed genuine when they talked to each other.
But keep in mind that was the only scene where the chemistry showed cause the other scenes when they where together felt really empty they should have kept the chemistry between them consistent but they didn't.VERDICT
don't hate me for this but i like this movie more than the last one cause i hated the last movie.
This movie is bad and i wont deny that it's the worst Spider-Man movie but i liked it more than the last one and the reason is that i felt less annoyed about the flaws of this movie and i would rather watch this one than the first one.
But they should really just ignore the parents stuff about this movie cause that stuff is unnecessary.
Don't watch this movie",5,0,2,29 October 2018
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Bella is a user
","I think this movie is better than the last one.
It's still bad but this one is an improvement.ROMANCE
This is a better version of the last movie in my opinion.
The relationship with Bella and Jacob is better than the relationship between Bella and Edward cause Bella and Jacob has some chemistry.
The problem with Bella and Edwards chemistry was that it was non existent.
Bella and Edward talked to each other it was for the sake of moving the plot forward, not expanding the relationship.
But in this movie the dialogue between Bella and Jacob is only to expand their relationship which is the plot of the story... well now i know why their relationship is better.CHARACTERS
Bella is one of the worst protagonist i have ever seen.
When Edward leaves she goes through some stuff.
Jessica even says that she is going through depression but that barely shows.
She changes as a person and becomes an adrenaline junkie by watching action movies and ride bikes and she has also those dreams that occur to show how much she is suffering.
But when then the rest of the movie she acts just the same as she did in the last one.
Having bad dreams dosen't equal character development.
She is also a user.
When Edward left she was all over Jacob but when Edward came back She went back to Edward.
Jacob is the best character in this movie.
His desire to protect Bella is the reason to why he is such a good character.
Jacob wants to be with Bella but he wants to protect her so he he changes and joins a group, it's not a big change but it's something.THE FINAL ACT
They failed making the final act.
They just shoved it in there to end the movie.
There was fake stakes, bad fight scenes, bad CGI, everything was there.VERDICT
This movie is bad.
People complained about the slow pacing but it never bothered me.
But i don't understand why people hate this movie more than the first one, the first one dosen't work it's giant mess but this movie atleast does the romance part decent.",4,0,1,8 January 2019
Men in Black II," What an Oofie sequel
","MiB 2 isn't as bad as other people say but it's not that good either.CHARACTERS
I actually think that J is a better character in this movie than in the last movie.
For the first they developed him so that he is a professional good agent in MiB 2 and they also made him more humane by making him not whipe the memory of Laura giving him a little development.
K isn't as good though.
They could have focused on developed the plot about K getting his memory whiped but they just made that a conflict and it got easily resolved.VILLAIN
The villain is pretty boring.
She has a basic motivation similar motivation for the Villain in MiB 2 but the difference is that the one in the first movie was actually funny but she is just pretty bland.COMEDY
The comedy was lacklustre in this one.
A few repeated jokes a few new unfunny ones it didn't make me laugh that much.VERDICT
I kinda get why people don't like this movie.
It's similar to the first one and it has some holes in logic for example.
1. People saw an alien in the first scene of the movie but they didn't memory whipped and even if they did it would be impossible for all of them to be memory whipped (they solved it later but even that's stupid).
2. Why didn't the citizen react scared to what was just happening.
3. They whipped agent T's memory but isn't that suit exclusive to MiB
4. How did James know how many people were in the subway is he some super genius cause he has done some stupid stuff.
5. The flushing system is stupid and it will make people pay attention and sceptical of what's actually going on.
6. K got his memory back but he needed to know how to fight of the aliens even if he worked on MiB longer than J.
7. They didn't care to solve the problem with big worm staying on the subway they just let him kill civilians.
8. If they whipe the whole cities memory won't memory whipe some people from the MiB.
That's actually alot of holes in logic, you know what? MiB is pretty bad so I'll give it a 4/10.",4,0,1,9 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ben swolo
","One of the worst Star wars movies to exist very much.
I'll admit my Tfa review was wasted potential and this review will probably just repeat the same point as countless of others but i don't really care.CHARACTERS
Luke is really bad.
He first says that he can't go against the first order cause they are too powerful even though he has defeated the empire.
One counter argument can be that he is old and grumpy and that what Ben solo did had an affect but then later R2D2 shows a clip of Leia saying 'Obi wan you are our only hope' (fan pandering very much) and Luke immedieately changes his mind which is stupid.
Let me just go over to the training stuff which makes no senseTRAINING
Rey trains to control the force but wait... isn't it established that you don't need to train to use the force but maybe they are training to make Rey's the force stronger but then is already really good at using the force and we never get to see her train for real we just get all this stuff happening in the temple cause it is convenient and later in the movie Rey can use the force really well.CHARACTERS (CONT'D)
So Luke 'trains' Rey and alll that stuff happens and Yoda out of nowhere explodes a place with Jedi stuff and luke dies being a bad character im done talking about lukeEXPLOSIONS
People don't die by explosions when they should.DEATH
Leia should have died it's stupid that she didn't
Snoke shouldn't have died its stupid that he did.CHARACTERS (CONT'D)
Rey was bland as ever and more Mary sue than ever.
Ok so her parents were nobodies then how did she learn how to use the melee weapon and how did she learn to fix ships and fly them so well maybe her parents new about ships i didnt listen that well (i'll edit this review if im right or wrong) and she could use the force extremely good making her training pointless.
Finn was bad and bland and Rose was just wasted they should have cut the scene with Paige.
Kylo Ren was the best part and his conflict with Luke and the dark side was cool but they expo dumped his back story.
and they never explain why Rey and Kylo have connection but maybe next movieVERDICT
I think this was all i wanted to say but this movie is bad.",3,8,12,17 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Bring back James gunn
","This is a solid movie.CHARACTERS
All the characters are fairly well setup.
Peter quill is a great character who has a fair amount of depth and a character that could get explored way more in the next movies.
Rocket Racoon is also a good character and they put some care into setting up his backstory and giving him some depth into his character.
Draxx is a meh character.
He has a basic Background story and he gets a mediocre character arc.
Gamora is fine and the manage to set up and develop her pretty good.
Groot isn't anything special but his death scene was a pretty touching moment.
They manage to set up and give fair character arc to all of these people and i hope that they improve on that in the sequel cause i felt that the characters weren't as strongly handled as i hoped they would be.VILLAIN
The villain is just nonsensical and stupid.
He has a weak motivation and i don't know how he rose to power.
I mean how could he have thought that it was a smart idea to try to kill Thanos the guy who managed to do everything the Guardians of the Galaxy were fighting against the guy who could defeat Hulk using the power stone (and Hulk is really strong) i just don't like this villain.SOUND
I have never ever critiqued Sound when it comes to music cause i'm not good that doing it but i will tell you the music in Gotg is great.
Using old school music to convey a certain emotion or theme and when they don't use old school music it's still great and manage to execute the tone it's trying to convey expertely.CGI
The cgi is amazing and it manages to set the tone for the enviorment and through visuals they manage to show the state and tone of the planets which is always good when you make a movie with a big world that needs worldbuilding.
And btw there are alot of humans in those galaxies shouldn't it be more aliens or strange creatures you know to diversify the world so that it dosen't feel to blandVERDICT
Solid movie but could have been better with stronger developed characters and a better villain.",8,0,1,13 April 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Disappointment
","After my terrible review of the first Avengers i'll review the second Avengers movie.
The movie was overwhelming to say the least and disappointing.
This movie failed to meet my expectations and im kinda disappointed cause all it ended up being was a movie similar to it's predecessor.
It manages to be a good movie i was almost about to rate it a 6/10 but it has flaws and i will address does flaws.CHARACTERS
The characters are great and we get to see their personality shine throughout this movie.
The part where we where at Clint's house was a good part in the movie where we got to see the characters act and we also give more depth to Clint and we see that Clint is just a normal human being like all of us and i really like how they made these characters more down to earth.
Thor's character didn't get to shine as much as the others which is kind of a flaw.
And Vision just made the movie more overwhelming. It's good to have him but there are other ways to put him in the movie.ACTION
The action is still great and it still holds up.
The Avengers working together as a team is great and fun to watch and i don't have a lot to say about the action.SIMILAR
Now to the flaws.
This movie was similar to the last one.
What it should have been was a very different movie that has originality to it and way more depth than any other movie in this universe but it failed to do that.
it's just Avengers 2012 with robots.
in the end there is this huge fight with loads of enemies and the world nearly ending but the difference is that in this movie its way overwhelming cause it has so many things it needs to focus on.VILLAIN
The villain is wasted potential Ultron could have been a great villain with depth but all got ruined by Nick fury saying that Ultron's goal is to destroy the world.
I was so disappointed when they Nick said that.
The villain has character problems idk if it is intentional but at one moment he is a little bit charismatic and in the other he is very dark and serious.
The villain is just bad and disappointing to me.VERDICT
You should watch this movie cause it's pretty good but it's overwhelming.
overall a dissapointment.
I will review the third movie when i have time and i have watched it but i don't remember anything so i will rewatch it.",7,0,2,17 November 2018
Men in Black," It was cool
","Men in Black was good but I didn't enjoy it as much as other people did.COMEDY
The comedy was alright.
It had some smart jokes here and there but it wasn't really anything that would make me die laughing at.CHARACTERS
The real reason to why I didn't enjoy it asmuch as others was cause of the characters.
it's interesting how they didn't give these characters much character depth or development and people still love this movie so I asked a question to myself 'Why do people think that this movie is good' And I found three answers to that question.
1. The humor
2. The dialogue
3. The world building
I will go through two of those answers (cause I already went through the humor) in a bit but first I will go through the characters of this movie.
Edward isn't a good protagonist and I will stand by that.
Edward gets good lines that are funny and make me chuckle or laugh but other than that he is just a character with no depth which weirdly enough made me more interested in him for some reason.
And I really think the point of the protagonist isn't to give him any depth I really think the point of this movie isn't even about the characters.
Edward joins MiB cause he wants to, there is no other reason than that. We don't anything about his family life we know very little about his background.
But I really wanna know the answer to why Agent K whipped Edwards memory cause he was gonna get Edward to join MiB anyway.
Agent K was decent he had really good lines and he got some character development which was executed really well in the end.DIALOGUE
Know the reason why people like this movie so much is cause of the engaging dialogue.
The dialogue is related to the humor which makes the dialogue engaging and funny.
Even I was engaged in the dialogue.
For example when Agent K and Edward talked at the bench about MiB, really interesting thoughts were conveyed in that small scene about what Humans think they know and that us one of the examples of why people loved the movie so much.WORLDBUILDING
When we go through the plot of this movie the writers made so that we saw how the world works with aliens and humans on MiB which made the world more alive.
Examples are when an alien was gonna be born or how MiB works when it comes to people knowing that aliens exist.
Moments like that makes the world more lively.VERDICT
I fought MiB was good but I didn't like it that
much so I will give it 7/10",7,0,0,8 June 2019
Avatar," I guess people say it's original which is a lie
","Avatar was decent at best a snooze fest at worst.The FIRST 4 MINUTES
The first 4 minutes were really promising.
It gave us exposition but in a creative way in my opinion.
They set-up well who Jake sully is and it was just something i wanted to point out.CHARACTERS
All the characters are pretty bland.
The main character Jack Sully has no character arc nor any depth.
He was promising character with him not being able to use his legs and all that they could have gave him a desire based around that but after watching the movie i knew it wasn't possible cause Jake has a lot of desires.
First one is learning their culture which he succeeds in with no hardship.
Second protect the Tree.
So he shifts desire not having a clear and true goal which is pretty bad.
And he never changes during the adventure maybe a little bit but it wasn't enough.
Neytiri is also bad, i mean she has a character arc but it's not that good.
She first can't trust Jake and is pretty hostile with him, but then after sometime for no reason they start to like each other.
There was no conflict between them to they just like each other so that the plot can move forward.ROMANCE
The romance between Jake and Neytiri is actually not bad.
They like each other and then there is a conflict between them that pushes them away from each other and then they love each other again.
Yes it felt rushed but at least it's better than how Divergent or Incredible hulk or Twilight handled it.VILLAIN
Miles is a bad villain.
His motivation i think is that he dosen't care about those blue people and he does it for the money.
He dosen't really have any depth that make him a good villain and his death was really anti climactic.CGI
The cgi is very good and they put a lot of time making it look good.VERDICT
It feels like they focused more on the visuals than the story telling which made the movie not that good.
I checked RT on Avatar and they said that the story telling isn't that good but because the visuals are amazing it's a 8/10.
Ik RT is just a bot that and ik how RT works but whoever wrote that are stupid people.
They were aware of how decent it was but they ignored it.",6,1,2,20 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good first movie
","This movie is pretty good, It's an enjoyable movie.
It manages to set up the wizarding world and it never felt slow paced when they did it.
There is some flaws to this movie and i will say them.CHARACTERS
Harry is a bland protagonist.
He never shows emotion and when magical stuff happens in the beginning he never feels shocked that those stuff happen.
HISTORY
We get to know Harry's history and that's basically what the Harry potter franchise is about
DESIRE
His desire is to know what the three headed dog is guarding and figuring out the mystery of the philosopher's stone.
VILLAIN
The villain barely get's shown in the movie and that's something i will address later.
You can keep the villain a secret to the audiences but only if you manage to develop the suspects that might be the villain but they didn't do that but again i will talk about the villain later.
CHANGE
Harry dosen't change.
I will give it benefit of the doubt and say that they will develop him in future installments but at least some development needs to be done.
Even Ron and Hermione change as characters it's not a lot of change but it's still there.
Hermione has a closer relationship with Ron and Harry and Ron has a closer relationship with Hermione.
The change is very minimal but it's there while Harry never changes as character and grows but hopefully this will be achieved in future installments.VILLAIN
They could have develop Snape and Quirrell more as characters cause Snape was the suspect and Quirrell was the Villain and they felt underdeveloped.
Snape will be developed as a character in future installments but Quirrell just felt like a waste.
I will excuse Snape's lack of development but not Quirrell's.
Quirrell is a wasted villain.VERDICT
Oh gosh this review is trash.
I will still send this cause i could not be bothered to make a better one.
I need to start to put more time and thought into these reviews.",8,2,3,2 December 2018
Thor," Even Odin was bored of the movie so he took a nap
","This movie is pretty boring.
No-one want's to see Thor bee a normal human being facing challenges.
I understand why they did that, Thor is a very strong character and they want stakes in the story by making him weaker but that's not how you do it.CHARACTER
Thor isn't a bad character he is actually pretty good and during the film he grows and develops as a character by learning from his mistakes.
But Jane is pretty bad, she is just this boring bland love interest of Thor.
Erik selvig ain't bad he is not good either he is in the middle and the 'comic relief' who hangs out with Erik and Jane i don't even remember he name cause she is that forgettable she serves no purpose to the story, if they removed her then nothing would change the story would end up the same the only difference is that there would be less jokes.
We have also the boring uninteresting side character that we are supposed to believe are Thor's best friends.VILLAIN
Loki is a bad villain in this movie.
I know he could be a really good villain but he is just wasted potential.
His motive to why he want's to kill Thor is because he is jealous of him and that's a lousy motive it would have been less lousy if they would develop the motive.ACTION
The action is boring, bland and has no creativity behind it.
There isn't a lot of action scenes there are like four i think but all of them where bad.
When you make a good action scene there might be stuff like good choreo or the character finding a creative way to solve his problems but none of that exist in Thor it's just Thor smashing stuff.VERDICT
Thor is a good but lacking movie which could have been better if it was longer.
But watch this movie anyway it's not that bad",7,0,1,14 December 2018
Wonder Woman," Captain Ameri...I mean Wonder Wamen sucks
","This movie is fine.
Of all the DCEU movies i have watched this is the best one.
But it has major flaws that instantly make the movie a 7/10.
When i watched this movie i was about to give it a 9/10 cause i liked it and enjoyed it but when i think about it then it's another bland superhero film.
CHARACTERS
The characters aren't that good.
Diana is mediocre she has an character arc halfway through the movie and then that character arc stops cause of the stupid Final Act.
She has a desire and we get to know who she is and where she grew up and all that but she dosen't have a good villain nor dose she change after the event.
Steve is also kinda bad but he is better than Diana.
I like how they give the side characters some personality but it dosen't matter cause they barely get any screen time.WAMEN
One small thing why don't they treat Diana like a woman in this movie.
And what i mean by that is that during WW1 Women weren't treated the same as men they didn't get to vote and most of them stayed home and did house work and all that.
Diana goes into a meeting for men and no-one cares they cared for awhile but then they just let her stay there and they didn't even bother to have guards to escort her out cause she was breaking the laws and also they just let her go and fight the war even do Womens weren't allowed to fight the war.
They just let her do all of this stuff and no-one even bothers to stop her.VILLAIN
The villain is pretty bad he gets no development whatsoever and he has a pretty stupid ideology that war can make a human improve and that's why he want's to have an endless war like Ares wanted.
But didn't he want to end the war in that one scene were he said that we can beat the Germans and that we don't need to sign the peace treaty? Maybe i'm wrong.
And also it dosen't matter how you try to spin on the destroy the world motive it's still a bad motive nonetheless and they should have atleast try to make the motive more believable cause he just said his motive in that one scene and that motive never gets developed.ACTION
The action is decent at best, bland and over the top at worst.
In Act 1 when we see the amazonians fight it's so CGI and over the top it's kinda funny.
And it's always that way.
The CGI and VFX are always bad in these movies even though the movies have pretty high budget.FINAL ACT
The final act was the worst part in this.
Diana kills Ludendorff and the war continues and we have this good scene were Steve says that there isn't this big bad guy that needs to be defeated to end all wars it's how are beliefs are that makes this war continue.
It was a very good scene but then Ares literally shows up and tries to kill Diana and it becomes a mCindless DC action movie.
This movie could have been good if not for the final act which ruined everything cause after Ares is killed the war ends so Diana was right all along.VERDICT
This movie is overrated and i don't know why people like bad movies these days.
But this is the best DCEU movie",6,0,4,28 December 2018
Black Panther," Overrated mediocrity
","This movie wasn't that good to begin with.
It amazes me when RT thinks that it's the best MCU movie ever made.DEPTH
It didn't have a lot of depth.
It feels like they are trying to go deep when it comes to morals by bringing oppression when it comes to the villains ideologi but they executed it poorly.
Most of the depth they where trying to show where minimal and they never made you think.
This movie was really simple the 'depth' that was shown consisted of someone saying that this is bad and why and the other say 'This aint bad cause the benefits are this' that's all nothing more it is.CHARACTERS
The characters are really bad.
T'Challa is very bland character with no charisma at all and he has no depth when it comes to him.
He dosen't develop as a character and he never grows into something better.
There is minimal History shown behind this character and his desire is to be a good king, The villain is mediocre i will talk about him later, and nothing changes with him cause his desire to be king is so minimal cause he is pretty much a good king.
He shouldn't be a good king he should be a flawed king that want's to do good and become better.
But he is a good king cause they never show his flaws as a king he basically knows what he is gonna do as king.
And he is also op he kan never get hurt cause even Vibranium wont give him a scratch and if people hit him repeatedly he could just send a big wave that makes everyone fly away.
The suspense is gone when they do that and we never have the feeling of 'will he make it?'.
The side characters are bland as well and they lack depth.VILLAIN
The villain is mediocre
His motivation is help the helpless by starting a war.
It's not a bad motivation but it never gets developed and that's what makes him a pretty bland villain lack of development behind motivation.ACTION
The action is really well choreographed in my opinion it kept my interest.
But the final battle was horrendous and bland as hell it had no creativity into it just a bland fist fight.CGI
The CGI was terrible whenever it kicked in stuff felt out of place specially in the final battle that's when the cgi where at it's worst.VERDICT

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," WhY dID YoU SaY tHAt nAmE!?!?!?!?
","Oh my god.
This movie has opened my eyes.
When i first watched Justice leagues people said that it was the worst DCEU movie, i didn't know why people thought that it was the worst but after watching this movie i understand.SET-UP
The entire movie is a set-up for the fight that is BvS and it's boring as hell.
The pacing is so slow it's amazing and the fight we were anticipated about was short and pretty anti climactic in my opinion.
They did worldbuilding over character development, they sprinkled some development here and there but in the end we got nothing special when it comes to character development.
Superman's ideals should have been challenged more so that the characterization of Superman becomes better.
And shortly the Martha scene was just bad, the idea was cool but poorly executed.ARES EFFECT
You guys know the ending of Wonder woman were Diana killed Luddendorff and then Ares showed up? Yeah those who have watched Wonder Woman will know but the reason i call this the Ares effect is because of that ending.
Yeah BvS came before WW but that effect was more known in WW than BvS so i will call it the Ares effect instead of the Doomsday effect.
BvS did the Ares effect.
They had an interesting but bad villain being in the movie and then at the end they just shove in Doomsday there so that they could kill Superman.
Lex wasn't a good villain he had interesting ideas but he didn't get enough screen time to show how good he could be but it's even worse when they shove in a villain who dosen't get any development at all and is there to kill Superman.VERDICT
Justice league is has no care put into it.
With BvS they try to make something good, they had an idea and went for it trying their best.
Justice league is nothing, it's not a movie cause it has no soul put into it that's why i will change my JL rating to 3/10 instead of 5/10.",4,0,3,12 January 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Loki is 'dead' and all you say is NO!?!?
","This movie is bad, everything good they did with the first Thor movie is gone in this one.CHARACTERS
Thor is mediocre in this one.
They didn't do much with Thor that they could have done.
What they should have done is to put Thor to the test and make him have conflicting emotions like they did with 'The Winter Soldier', in that movie they made Captain America shine throughout the movie and he made choices that moved forward the story, they used his character to move forward the story.
But in 'Thor The Dark World' stuff happens to him and it's not him making the choices to move forward the plot, he is a passive character.
I have a problem with Odin.
In one scene Odin wanted to start a war with the Black elf's, but wasn't he the guy who didn't want to start a war with the frost people, i don't know if it is an actual flaw or they did this to show how fearsome the Black elf's can be but if it's the ladder then i will hate this scene even more.
Loki is actually not bad.
I like how he exploits others to benefit him and that really adds to his character and it was a twist to find out that Loki isn't actually dead.
Thors moms death was pointless, they shouldn't have killed her because no-one cares if she is dead even Thor didn't care that much (But he dosen't really care that much if any of his loved ones died) Thors mom dying was pointless and the reason they probably put that scene was to show how fearsome Malekith is.
Jane has a bigger importance to in the movie but she is still bad and bland, Darcy (I finally remember'd her name) is bad also but she dosen't have a lot of screen time so she is not as annoying as she was in the last movie, Erik selvig is mediocre and no-one cares about him, Ian has no importance to the movie.VILLAIN
Malekith is trash.
he has barely any screen time and when he does he says cliché lines.
I think his goal is to get the Etern so he can rule the world which is a generic bad guy motive.
and i don't get how Odin's men could win the black elf's, in the beginning scene they are fighting really good and then after that scene the guards are really bad, one guy managed to defeat like 10 guards.
Malekith is the worst villain in the MCU and i hate him.FINAL ACT
The final act was the only good part and it wasn't even good.
The reason i liked it was because it was so bizzare and weird.
Thor and Malekith fight in different places by falling through portals, Thor and Malekith gets smashed and a Frost creature teleports to greenwich.
It's not that weird but it's weird enough to interest me.VERDICT
This movie is peace of garbage and you should not watch it",5,0,1,19 December 2018
Lucy," She-God Lucy
","Lucy is an okay movie that you maybe will enjoy.
I got tired of this movie and stopped caring about the movie the more it continued cause the movie just gets silly.CHARACTERS
All the characters are one dimensional ass hell.
Lucy had a personality for 30 minutes and den it all went away after she got the CPH4.
She is just this bland character with no personality and no threat is given to her.
She is this really smart person who can do telekinesis and other amazing powers who is fighting a group of koreans with guns so she doesn't face a big threat.
The rest of the characters that is in this movie are barely shown or even have a major importance to the movie cause Lucy just steals the spotlight.VILLAIN
I wouldn't call him a villain cause he has no major importance at all to the movie.
It's the group that has more importance to the movie and they dont give Lucy a threat.
There is nothing to say about anything when it comes to this movie cause Lucy is the only person with most screen time and when she doesn't have screen time it's about her.EXPOSITION
This is something really small but in the beginning of this movie when exposition was given then it was Samuel just talking and explaining what the plot was gonna be about.
There isn't a major problem with that but there could have been better ways to explain the plot.VERDICT
This movie is fine just don't expect much from it",6,0,1,10 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's a worse New hope
","This movie is complete trash.SIMILARITY
It's really similar to a new hope there is nothing new with it.
The beginning were Kylo ren kills a lot of people is similar to the beginning of a new hope.
Ray lives in a dessert planet with no family members is similar to luke but the only difference is that look had family who lived with them but they died later.
Han solo getting killed is similar to Ben kenobi getting killed.
i could be here all day explaining why it's similar but you can just check any other reviewer for that answer.CHARACTERS
Fin is a garbage character.
He has mental breakdown for some people then later killing a stormtrooper with a lightsaber and he is fine he has no development and he is to virtuous for my
taste.
Rey is a bad character she is not a mary sue but pretty clo0se to being one (if you wanna see a true mary sue watch wonder women) but she is an underdeveloped character with no personality whatsoever.
Kylo ren is a annoying cry baby that destroys everything as soon as stuff don't go his way.
And Han solo is uninteresting and his death was a pretty bad one cause i had no emotional interest in him.FINAL ACT
It was a mess bad action and the ending didn't really make sense.
yeah sure Kylo ren was hurt so that's why Rey could defeat him but Kylo is a better force user and i think it was said that you could use the force to enhance strength and Kylo could do just that but anyways maybe i'm talking crap.VERDICT
Hey at lest it's better than phantom menace",4,10,15,2 March 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Filler
","Well Eclipse is bad.
I don't have a lot to say about it but it's bad.
It's better than Twilight and worse than New Moon it's a pointless movie that's only there for the sake of Love triangel.LOVE TRIANGLE
The movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes of filler and the 30 minutes are there to kill off Victoria.
The love triangle is pointless and there really is no point in having it cause Bella literally says that she loves Edward more and they are going to marry each other.
Also Jacob all of a sudden is a r/niceguy which was hilarious to me.VERDICT
I ended this review short cause there is no point in making a long review about filler.",3,0,2,8 January 2019
The Social Network," Don't forget who you are
","This movie is really good.
This movie isn't about Facebook, it's about the friendship of Eduardo and Mark and it's themes are very interesting and important in today's society.THEMES
Mark... he is an anti-hero.
His ego is high and he tries to distinguish himself from others which leads to consequences, for example Facesmash.
Eduardo is kinda the opposite of Mark. While Mark is kinda like a robot Eduardo is what we call a normal human being and there is a contrast between Mark and Eduardo which is cool to see.
Mark dosent really care about Eduardo cause he isn't good with social interactions but Eduardo still is friends with Mark no matter how many times Mark screws up.
But things start to shift once Sean comes, he sees an opportunity to use Facebook to get money and he does that by signing up a meeting with Eduardo and Mark.
Sean is delusional and Eduardo sees that but Mark dosen't, and that makes Mark and Eduardo's relationship struggle because of Sean but Eduardo stuck with Mark no matter what until something major happened that made Eduardo lose it.
The moment when Eduardo was mad and stopped being friends with Mark was the time they hit 1 million users on Facebook i think or something like that, and that was the moment stuff fell apart with Sean using illegal drugs.
Mark fires Sean and in the end of the movie makes the first human thing, he sends a friend request and that scene was freaking great.
The theme is that you should remember were you started from and keep you're friends close cause as soon as you only go after the money, the only real friend you had will disappear and you will be with a bunch of fakes that aren't friends with you cause you are good person, it's cause of the money, and that's what i think social network is trying to teach us.VERDICT
this movie dosen't really have well developed characters but the only well developed character is Mark but i think why this movie is so good is because of the themes it's showing.",9,2,2,6 February 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," spi movie sequel done right
","I am conflicted.
I don't know if this movie is better or worse than the first one, let me explain.PLOT
This movie is plot heavy.
It has a really good and interesting plot about an Russian family getting killed by Bourne but there are flaws about making this movie so plot heavy.
First it felt like a setup movie. This probably is a setup movie to The Bourne Ultimatum cause it took over an hour setting up the plot and most of the stuff isn't yet resolved.
The Bourne identity had an simple plot and it felt more satisfying finishing the movie cause it had an beginning, middle and end but in this movie it feels like there is an beginning and end.CHARACTERS
Cause the movie was so plot heavy they didn't manage to develop Bourne further.
He is still a good character but not as good as in the last movie cause he barely talks.
In 'The Bourne identity' they manage to develop Bourne greatly and we liked him as a character, they didn't really do that in this movie.
When Marie (I think her name is Marie) died, that was the best scene in the movie.
How Bourne desperately tried to save her under the water and the atmosphere felt empty and it really managed to set the tone for the scene great lighting as well and the emotion Matt Damon portrayed was great, he felt bad but he didn't have time to feel emotional about this cause he needs to survive. Overall a great scene.
The Bounty Hunter is really bad.
He was there in the beginning of the movie and they shoved him in at the end.
He was the biggest reason to why it's so hard for me to choose if this movie is better or 'The Bourne Identity', but the car chase at the end was good.VERDICT
This movie has some good qualities that the first movie didn't have, but the first movie has more good qualities this movie dosen't have so the first movie might be the better one.",8,0,1,21 December 2018
The Godfather," A wonderful movie
","This movie is good in my opinion and it's really different from any movie i have watched.CHARACTERS
There is a lot of characters in this movie and they give the side characters the screen time they deserve.
Micheal is truly a compelling character.
And he has an amazing character arc.
In the beginning he isn't really involved with the family and their buisness but when his father got shot five times he chooses to be apart of the gang and kill Sollozos and at that moment he changes as a character slowly.
He goes to another country to not get into trouble he marries a girl and that girl dies and Sonny dies and those death i think slowly changes him as a character cause he get to learn how it is when you are apart of the mafia thus having a responsibility to be the new godfather.
When i first watched that part i didn't understand why they added that part in the movie but now i do it's all because they want to develop the characters there is a reason for everything when it comes to this movie.
When they showed that scene where Connie gets abused by Carlo is because they wanted to kill off Carlo so that people will think it's Micheal thus adding to his character.
Sonny dying is to show how hot headed angry and simple minded he is and if you are not careful then there will be consequences.VERDICT
When i first watched it i didn't understand why they put certain parts in the movie but now i understand that it all makes sense.
They choose character over plot and it made this movie one of the greatest piece of cinema ever created and it has inspired me and made me think of movies in different way.
I would 100% rewatch it",9,0,1,28 December 2018
