The Monuments Men," fresh movie
","I was very surprised by the low ratings (6.1 at the time of writing this review). Also the user reviews were mostly negative or neutral at best. Is it because most viewers were expecting yet another action movie, something similar to the mindless Inglourious Basterds? The Basterds were rated 8.3, yet they contained hardly any thought other than 'kill those bastards'. The Monuments Men are very different. The movie goes much deeper. It is much more authentic. It is much more fun to watch. If your are really into action movies, you may want to skip The Monuments Men. For this movie was not made to brainwash you with visual effects and senseless violence. It was made to give you a food for thought, and a fresh perspective.",10,0,3,22 July 2016
