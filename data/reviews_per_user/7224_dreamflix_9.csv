The Expendables 2," Expandables
","Read some reviews of this and the critics complained about the clich√©s used in this ('I'll be back'). Actually, if I hadn't read about this, it wouldn't have bothered me. In fact, when the time came to hear this, I didn't care. This is the movie you go to see the guys whom you haven't seen in a while. Most of them made zillions of dollars in their action flicks and now here they are years later, and they look good. They've added Liam Hemsworth, and you can't complain because he and his brother Chris are easy on the eyes. They've also added Nan Yu, who blends in nicely with the gang of tough dudes. The opening scene is great, as you get to see each guy show off his strengths. Jet Li has a wonderful martial arts segment and Jason Statham plays with knives. Everything seems to be going well until Church (Bruce Willis) comes along to get Ross (Stallone) to pay on his debt. Ross reluctantly takes on the job, but tragedy befalls one of the crew. That puts Ross in revenge mode. The Villain, played wonderfully by Jean-Claude Van Damme is not going to be easy to catch. And then there's the play on words with his name: Villain. Van Damme aged well, and does show off his signature kicks in the show-down with Ross. But who really steals the show is Chuck Norris. Figuring the guy is 70-something, he comes in a blazing with his guns. And there's the play on the names with him: 'Lone Wolf' from Lone Wolf McQuade and 'Booker' from Good Guys Wear Black. There is a lot of blood in this, hence the R rating. It moves quickly and it delivers. The sets are so-so, but you really don't care because you know they're going to get blown up anyway. This is one of those fun, action flicks that you go to see and not care about the story line or the sets. It's fun and they should definitely go for an Expendables 3. How about digging up a few other oldies but goodie action heroes like, Michelle Yeoh, who just turned 50 this year, and Yun-Fat Chow, who's 57. Both were wonderful in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And what about Jim Kelly from Enter the Dragon? He's 'only' 66. You figure you've got Chuck Norris from Return of the Dragon, which basically jump-started his career, and is 70, why not Jim Kelly? If you're a fan of these type of action flicks you will not be disappointed in this one.",7,2,7,3 September 2012
Source Code," Deja Vu
","Have I seen this before? I watched the previews and went in wondering if this movie would be much like Tony Scott's Deja Vu from 2006 where the guy keeps going back in time to save the world and get the girl in the end. So, the guy actually does not go back in time, or does he? Same question I asked at the end of Deja Vu - how many times had the main character gone back in time to fix a mess? If you saw Deja Vu, then you've seen a version of this movie. It is predictable. But the action is sharper and at a better pace. Also, Gyllenhaal does a good job of bringing presence to the screen. He has that star-power (not saying Washington doesn't). Farmiga does a good job, considering you see her mostly through a small screen. She gives pointed doses of emotion just at the right times. Wright does a killer job as Dr. Rutledge. He hits a bunch of stereotypes: geek scientist, slash brilliant nutty professor, slash can't see the harm he's doing because he's buried in his experiment. The 'recall' scenes were different enough where you were able to tolerate all of the trips back in time. A nice add-in was Scott Bakula on the phone as Mr. Stevens. Monaghan's character could have been given more substance. But in eight minutes, you get what you get. I did leave wondering why a trained military guy couldn't seem to keep hold of a gun? The conductors take it, Frost takes it, but okay. He's a pilot. Do we really like Hollywood endings so much that we end up sitting there being able to easily predict the outcome? When there's a good twist ending, it's really worth it.",6,3,6,2 April 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," TinTin Has Some Shine
","Took my two nephews to see this. There were other children with parents in the theatre. Spielberg really comes through on the animation. 3D animation brought it out even better. If you're into this, then you need to see this move. It has quite of bit of action. There are twists and turns wherever you turn. TinTin and Snowy fell into all sorts of mishap and adventure. My nephews particularly liked the scene with in the airplane. Yet, I observed that the movie theatre was very quiet. (Which they should be anyway). But when you're in there with children, usually you may get some oohs or aahs. There weren't any in this movie. In fact, I noticed some children sleeping. This movie really must hit a certain age group, as some children have moved on to the luster of their Wii games. This movie had too many ho-hum moments. But it looks like there would be a niche for this type of animation and it may catch on. It seems to be holding its own at the box office.",6,0,1,30 December 2011
Underworld Awakening," No Sleep Walking for Selene
","Good to see Beckingsale come back to this role. This film is well done. Though the year is never given as to when Selene wakes up, and because it was filmed in Eastern Europe, it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be present-day or not. But it really doesn't matter, considering Selene wakes up to find out that Lycans and Vampires were being extinguished by humans. There was some chatter about previous films with a battle between Beckinsale and Michael Sheen, who played Lucian, or who was going to direct this one. But the end result is that this is a good film, worth collecting.Selene comes out of her chamber and the audience learns that she's been experimented on for the past twelve years. She is Specimen Two and she assumes Specimen One is her beloved Michael. Turns out there's a hybrid girl who broke out of her chamber and released Selene. The child is a product of Selene and Michael. So the lycans are after the girl, the vampires don't want her, nor Selene, and the police are hot on their trail.So you can imagine the action. There is one time where Detective Sebastian (played by Michael Ealy of Barbershop and Seven Pounds - and yes, his eyes are really blue)asks Selene why is it that she can stay out in the sun? She answers that she 'had help with that'. Selene seems to be more powerful in this installment. She jumps a lot, she runs a lot and she shoots a lot. Her fight scenes are good, yet the new breed of lycans are quite animated as well. Then there's David (played by Theo James), a vampire who wants to side with Selene because she is a fighter. It seems that the lycans and the vampires have been run underground (separately), and still fighting one another. In comes Dr. Lane (played by Stephen Rhea of Priest), who is working with another doctor (played by Sandrine Holt, who has a history of action films, such as Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Starship Troopers, and TV series such as Once a Thief, Witchblade and Mutant X) who are trying to engineer a bigger, faster lycan.Becksinsale actually gets a good workout in this film. And you realize that considering this is the fourth installment (three now with her), she has to up the ante on her abilities, especially when you have Resident Evil: Awakening coming out around the corner and we know that Milla Jovovich will deliver on her action.The story leaves with a sense of another installment coming. Selene finds Michael for a moment, and then he disappears. So she has a new crew with her daughter, David, and Det. Sebastian who seem to head off to find Michael and to grow their coven. There were rumours that this may be Beckinsale's last installment. Let's hope not, because there's no one else who can play Selene and jump from roof tops like Beckinsale.",8,7,15,22 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Cruise Delivers Again
","Tom Cruise really delivers in this action sequel. He's 47 and is as fit as a fiddle. He can continue to make more MI's as long as he wants as far as I'm concerned. We need to see more actors who aren't in their twenties or thirties doing action (like Liam Neeson) and can still deliver. Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood held on for a long time, and drew in audiences of varying ages. When we want to see action, let's see the actors we like to see doing it and not age them out because they hit a certain age. By then, they've evolved as actors. Cruise really hit it hard with the action. To see him running as he did in the previous movie says this guy knows how to stay in shape. The story line was okay. The previous editions had better character development. This one didn't have the 'feel' of the previous ones. Yet, I do have to say that I didn't go in there expecting an awarding winning script. I went to see action. Paula Patton held her own, as she was fun to see in 'Jumping the Broom'. This may open doors for her into another venue. Jeremy Renner has the quality of being a good or bad guy and we weren't sure until about the end where he stood. And, yes, thanks for bringing Ving Rhames in again, and letting us know he is still in action. The locales were beautiful and the cinematography was good. This is a good movie to see, and Cruise can keep making then as long as he can continue to deliver, as he usually does.",8,2,6,30 December 2011
Insidious," No Night Terrors
","There was a review on Friday from a 13-year-old who saw the movie with his mother. The kid was spot on with his review regarding the music. The music was great for this movie. It reminded me of the old-days Vincent Price movies. The opening credits were attention-getting. After that, the movie fell into sleep-mode. The kid did mention that to him the movie was scary-creepy, but for adults, it might be just scary. I thought I would give it a try, expecting to see a good movie. I would say that if you liked Paranormal Activity I/II and from years back the Blair Witch Project, then you would like this movie. Had I known it was made by the same folks from Paranormal Activity, I would have stayed home and saved my money. The movie is so slow to start. The story line was oh, so predictable. If you watch movies of this genre and have done so for decades, then you can pick up on the story line in a heart beat. The ghouls were not scary. Reading that the movie was made on $800k explains a lot about the cheap look to it. - Just like the Paranormal movies. Why did I bother to even see those movies? I thought the first one was fact-based. My nieces talked me in to seeing the second one. And they were bored. Back to Insidious, I could hear restless movement in the movie theatre. People were bored. Only a few jumped here or there. If you're scared easily, this is the movie for you. If you like something that's fresh, moves at a good clip and keeps your mind active, this isn't the movie for you.",4,4,13,2 April 2011
In Time," No Logan's Run
","Seeing the previews of this, I totally expected there to be comparisons to the 1976 Sci-Fi movie, Logan's Run. After all, when you see that people will die at age 25, you get the zing of 'oh, I've heard that before'. So going to see this allowed for time to see how different this movie would be. And it was. Then I realized that there's going to be a re-make of Logan's Run set to open in 2014. Why? Can't we get some creativity here Hollywood? In Time has similarities to Logan's Run though, such as the obvious: you die at age 25. In Logan's Run, you had some type of gem on your arm that turned red when you turned 25. Then it was time to go to 'carousel' where your under 25 homies cheered you into oblivion. There's the futuristic city where the young are living a ruse that there can be no existence after age 25. But Logan is sent on a mission to catch a 'runner'. He and his buddy work as enforcers that track and kill runners (those who's gem has turned red, but didn't go to carousel). But, of course, Logan ends up being chased by his enforcer buddy, who thinks he's a runner. Along the way, Logan meets a girl and the two run off. Then they find that there is life after age 25. So what's different about In Time? Well, Timberlake's character, Will Salas is actually given a bunch of extra time by someone who had become disillusioned by society. This society has a caste system. Those who have (time) are the posh elite, and live in a different time zone. Those who have not, live in the ghetto. The have nots move fast. They run. Because they don't have a lot of time. They pay for food, drinks, transportation, everything, with minutes. Their time clock is on their arms. They can look at their arms to see how much time they have left. Then there's the timekeepers. Something like Logan's friend, who chase people whom they think have stolen time. But Salas was given the extra time. Doesn't matter. Timekeeper Leon thinks he has stolen it and so begins the running. Along the way, we get to see the posh society. Enter the girl, Sylvia Weis, played well by Amanda Seyfried. The two end up on the run. Weis' father, is like a master timekeeper. Seyfried adds some comic relief in this movie. As Sylvia, she finds a way to steal time from her father, and then Salas and Sylvia change society by giving the have nots some extra time. The have nots can actually slow down. There are themes that tell the audience that Leon knew Salas' father. He possibly tracked him for giving away time. Something Timberlake's character, Salas ends up doing. Leon seems to be a lot like Salas. There's even the feeling that he could have been his father. If you like the Hollywood happy ending, then you'll find Salas and Weis becoming more of a Bonnie and Cylde type couple who steal time from the haves in order to give it to the have nots. Would I buy this on DVD? No. It was an interesting journey. Wonder if the casting director consciously cast main actors with blue eyes. Also, the cars - were they fuel efficient in the future? They didn't have door handles. Yet there were today-like bridges and roads. And there was the convenience of someone leaving their door open during the action scenes that allowed for their car to be taken. The tick-tock of time can be felt in the movie. The wall sized maps showing time zones and the people whose purpose is to track time and keep it under control. If you want an action movie where you can root for the underdog, then you'd like this one. If you're a Timberlake, or Olivia Wilde fan, then you won't be disappointed.",Null,0,4,29 October 2011
X-Men: First Class," X-Men Glows
","There was a good mix for all audiences on this one. There were children and adults in the theatre and all seemed entertained. Many were still sitting in their seats after all the credits rolled, which is rare, from my experience. The music was good. It certainly helped to make the movie. It was clear that money went into this version. Seeing James McAvoy take the lead in an action flick since 'Wanted' was good. Playing more of the thinking man suited him. Michael Fassbender held up well to the twists and turns of his character and what made him tick. Yet it was a real pleasure to see the un-aging Kevin Bacon as the villain in this one. His version of Sebastian Shaw was chilling. It was too bad that his character had to come to and end, but with this franchise, who's to say? There were also nice, brief scenes that were eye catchers, such as Hugh Jackman. I was pleased to see Michael Ironside playing the Captain. There was stirring in the movie theatre, so perhaps others recognized him from 'Starship Troopers' or 'V' (the 1980's original series), or other sci-fi. Rose Byrne kept us grounded as the 'normal' person hanging out with the mutants. It turns out that it was through her research that she was able to pull together the x-men. While Xavier was using cerebro, it was eye-catching to see all of the possible mutants out there. One seemed to be a young Storm. Another kick were the 1960's sets. Shaw's living room really hit the nostalgia mark with the sunk-in living room and cozy fireplace. January Jones stood out as Emma Frost. She made a tough dynamic duo to Shaw's incredible powers. It was clear that the movie-goers were ready to see more when the credits rolled. It will be fun to see the next venture of X-Men. Though I am wondering how many angel, beast, devil, magneto, mystique and diamond costumes will hit the stores this Halloween.",9,2,6,4 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman Rises from the Dead
","This one came along, and because it was advertised as the last one of the Batman movies, I thought I would go see it. I saw a few during first-release, but some of them let me down, so I stopped seeing them. Glad I went to see this one. There is a story line. It makes you think a bit. You have Batman in a funk and hurting since his encounter with the Joker in the last episode. Harvey Dent has been made a hero and Bruce Wayne is basically hiding in his house, yet dutifully served by is butler, Alfred. Gotham city believes that Batman is a villain and they want him gone. But then there's a story line of a criminal who lives beneath the city and apparently trained by the same person that trained Bruce Wayne years ago. But the criminal, Bane, is heartless. He is pumped up and seems to show no fear. It seems the battle is between Wayne, who has lost his fear to die, and Bane, who is determined to help Wayne find a reason to fear again. Among the chaos that Bane causes is a cat burglar, or the Catwoman. Anne Hathaway was a good choice for this role, as her dancer body fits the catwoman suit well. And, she seems eternally happy, even though she plays a down and out character. Catwoman, or Selena, slips in and out of Wayne's life. She eventually is the link that brings Wayne and Bane together. Yet into this is the go gooder cop, Blake, who is trying to help Commissioner Gordon bring order to a city that has gone bonkers, now that Bane has taken control. There is a good scene between Wayne and Alfred where Alfred tries to give Wayne a reason to go on living. Wayne rejects him, which causes Alfred to leave. Wayne turns his money and stock over to Miranda, who seems to be the only person who still believes in Wayne and his mission to bring clean energy to the world. But beneath the talk is someone who is in league with Bane. Bane and Miranda strip Wayne of everything he has, and along the way take Fox captive. Finally, the Dark Knight Rises and attempts to save Gotham city from a nuclear blast that will certainly destroy the city and more. The ending leaves the impression that there is a set up for a future Batman movie, or a spin off with Catwoman and Robin. If this movie is the end of anything, it is the end of Christian Bale playing Batman, as he now has worn the cape in three installments. This one is worth viewing as it has a good story line, good pace with action, and good special effects.",8,1,4,3 September 2012
