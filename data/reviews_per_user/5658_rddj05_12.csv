Moneyball," Film Hits All the Bases
","Well-written, well-acted, and well-directed. Sometimes there's not much more that needs to be said. Moneyball is an authentic film, and Zaillian, Sorkin, and Miller don't allow the false notes to creep into the film. With a runtime of just over 2 hours, it flies by.Based on a true events, Pitt plays Billy Beane, the baseball general manager of the small- market Oakland A's who, back in 2002, realized that if his team was to have any chance of competing against big-market teams like the New York Yankees (with a payroll 3-4 times larger) he would have to change the way a baseball team is traditionally assembled.Beane discovers a young, stat-obsessed scout-in-training (Jonah Hill) that believes the best way to gain wins with little money, is to carefully assemble a team with the type of players who do one thing well, and are overlooked or undervalued by other teams.Throughout, Beane must deal with the resistance and skepticism of the team's owner, manager, players, press core, and fans who do not believe that non-stars or players past their prime, can outperform a team of more traditionally attractive players. Beane also struggles to maintain a close relationship with his young daughter, whom he only has partial custody of, while his job appears to be in constant jeopardy. Moneyball isn't a traditional 'rah-rah, the little team that could' type of story (thankfully, as that is a storyline that's been played to death over the past 20 years in film). Rather, it is a film showing the struggle and failures of one man and his insistence in fighting an entrenched mindset of people who think a the the methods and rules of a 100+ year game cannot be changed.The crazy ideas of today, often become the acknowledged wisdom of tomorrow.",9,0,1,2 April 2012
42," Competent Storytelling, But Safe, Cliché, and Predictable
","I suppose this film would be somewhat interesting to view for anyone who is completely unaware of the Jackie Robinson story. Aside from maybe 1 or 2 scenes, this safe and predictable film could easily be shown to grade-school kids. Antiseptic and color-by-numbers, in just about every way (again, except for 1 or 2 scenes). The writing is sometimes groan-worthy, and no cliché is left unturned, including slow-motion running of the bases after home runs and a saccharine, syrupy-sweet shots of Mr. Robinson and his wife. Every scene is played and shot almost exactly how you would expect (but hoped not), and most of it seems to take place on a carefully constructed movie set. Basically it's pretty much a Disney version of The Jackie Robinson story. But it gets the story across. Mr. Helgeland Oscar-Award winning screenwriter and obviously very talented, but screen writing and directing are different skills. I must admit that I kept wondering what a more skilled and inventive director like Spike Lee would've done with a story like this.",5,7,11,26 May 2014
Don Jon," Would Have Worked Better As A 30-minute Film
","Don Jon is not a terrible film, it's just not a particularly good one. Similar to an SNL sketch that goes on too long, the story and the characters are far too thin and uninteresting to warrant a 90-minute treatment. Joseph Gordon Levitt (who wrote and directed) does a fine acting job and gives a solid impersonation of a shallow, ignorant, aggressive, sex-obsessed, porn-addicted 20-something Jersey boy. But he is sorely miscast. Anyone having spent any time with real-life Jersey boys of this type (or even watched them on TV), will have a very hard time accepting the cuddly and slight JGL in this role. Straining credibility even further, we're forced to accept that JGL's slick character can pull any gorgeous girl from the local dance club, in minutes, and bring her home for sex (this apparently happens every weekend.) But real sex is not nearly as fulfilling to him as watching porn. He can't 'lose himself.' The premise of the film (and where it will go) is recognized about 15 minutes into the story, but there is nothing deep or interesting enough about any of the characters or plot to merit us wanting to invest in the journey any further. Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore also give great performances, but again, they can't overcome the script's lack of depth.In terms of tone and style, it's a bit like watching a well-done, if very unfocused, student film. It's not quite funny enough to work as a pure comedy, and not nearly weighty enough to work as a drama. Visually, it's not particularly attractive or consistent. Unmotivated camera movements occur during the few scenes that actually warrant it being still, giving us no help in connecting to the characters in those moments.I respect JGL greatly for getting this film done, an it will be interesting to see how he develops, but for now, he is clearly a much more talented actor than a writer or director. My advice. If you want to see a great film about a young, ignorant Italian-American's journey to evolve into a more substantive human being, put Saturday Night Fever in your queue. Not only is a great film, based on a superb script, shot during one of the best eras of American filmmaking, but you'll get to see some amazing dance sequences.",3,5,9,19 February 2014
Knocked Up," Good Film....eventually
","Knocked Up winds up being a funny and honest movie...eventually. It has a running time of 2 hours and 15 min. My advice to anyone watching would be to skip the first hour and 15 min. Nothing really happens in this time except the setup to the film (which is not even remotely plausible), and a LOT of penis and fart jokes. A lot. The first few are mildly amusing, the 20th one, not so much. There are no spoilers involved in the following setup. Katerine Heigl plays Allison, an absolute knockout, who is intelligent, funny, and who's career has just taken a big leap forward with her recent promotion at a popular entertainment network (that's the believable part). She suddenly decides to go to a club one night (apparently the only date she can get is her sister) and for some reason, no one hits on her. No one. So, obviously desperate (and a bit drunk), she decides to pick up the biggest loser in the club (Ben Stone), invites him back to her place, and has wild sex with him (apparently because he helped her get a drink at the bar. Guys, if you want a really hot girl to have sex with you, this may be your plan).Despite being disgusted at the sight of him the next morning, and despite the fact that she realizes that this man has no income, no ambition, lives in a post-college frat house with 4 other man-children (insert penis joke here), and can't seem to say anything remotely intelligent or tactful, she improbably decides...'let me stick it out with this guy', since she's been, yup, you guessed it, insert movie title here.However, it is a broad comedy, so I suppose some leeway should be given (and this setup involves a LOT of leeway). But after it settles down in the 2nd hour, it becomes a really honest (and funny) portrait of adult responsibility and the headaches and joys that come with it. And this almost makes the first half worth sitting through for.",6,1,3,14 November 2007
Yesterday," Disappointing
","I have deep admiration for Danny Boyle and usually enjoy his films, but I was very surprised that he took on this project, due to a story and script that weren't particularly strong. It's not a poorly made film, but it seems to really struggle against the script. The idea is great. The story which extends from that idea is severely lacking. Aside from the fact that it treads well-worn rom-com territory and perpetuates every schmaltzy rom-com false cliche (including the one where someone suddenly realizes that their platonic friend for 20 years may just be 'the one' after all, if they can only wake up and realize it), the script doesn't make much sense. There's no real spoilers in this movie to give away, but I'll be vague just be safe. The premise: There's a 27-year old failing British musician who's reached a point where he realizes his music career likely isn't going to go anywhere, so he'll return to teaching. Then, one night, there's a worldwide blackout, which lasts a few seconds, and when it's over, he's the only one who remembers who The Beatles were (and all their songs). There's no record of them online and no one remembers them (oddly, the same goes for Coca-Cola, cigarettes, and the band Oasis). There's some mildly amusing over-the-top characters who come into story after this, almost all of them are characters who say and do things that no real person on the planet would actually ever say or do, and a lot of bad advice given from the female romantic interest (seemingly presented in the film as good advice) where I can only assume most audience members would be yelling, 'Please don't listen to her. She's making no sense.' The most troubling thing about the ending is that the premise is never explained. Even with all the rom-com cliches, it may have been fun to realize precisely *why* no one was able to remember these few major aspects of pop-culture history. Nope. And yet, despite the lack of a logical--or even wacky--explanation of the premise, it includes a scene near the end, at a beach house, that only served to confuse me more; it raises more questions than it answered because the scene doesn't really make any sense. The best thing about the film is the premise (which could've gone in so many more interesting places), the music (obviously), and the fact that even when Danny Boyle is working with a somewhat weak script, he still knows how to make a fairly entertaining movie. It's just unfortunate that it doesn't have a good enough story for most people to want to watch for 90 minutes, even when it's filled with The Beatles music.",3,0,0,8 June 2020
The Hurt Locker," A Refreshing Take on Why Some Soldiers Do What They Do
","Very well done film revolving around a three-man, bomb-defusing EOD team in Iraq circa 2004. It is subtle, honest, and defies cliché at almost every turn. Basically, it is the anti- Michael Bay film.What is most interesting about the film is that it isn't a hagiography on the war soldier. It shows these 3 men for who they are; men who are good at what they do, and who may have made the choice to do it before knowing exactly what it would involve. The three men include the experienced, competent Sergeant (Anthony Mackie), who wants to fulfill is duty and get out of Iraq, the fearful private who is convinced on his own imminent demise, and the adrenaline junkie, war-addict who would be lost but for the dangerous jobs he intentionally involves himself in (Jeremy Renner). The screenwriter embedded himself with an American combat unit in Iraq before writing the script, and obviously realized that for some soldiers, it's not as simple as 'defending honor and freedom, and the American way of life'. Like most people who go to work everyday, whether their lives are in danger or not, some soldiers do what they do because they made a commitment, or they're good at, or simply because it's the only thing that has ever given their lives any meaning.",8,1,5,14 February 2010
Garden State," If You're a 20-Something Navel-Gazer, This is the Film for You.
","Every once in awhile the critics will get behind a truly mundane and insipid film; Garden State would be your pitch-perfect example. Many of us have long-awaited the death of this tired trend of making movies about boring, middle-class 20-somethings, doing nothing while using the same lame jokes and interacting with their merry band of local buddies. Fortunately, there is a top rate cast who turns in excellent performances, and some very pretty set pieces. However, Braff uses every film-school trick in the bag and almost every comic cliché imaginable (yes, we know, a dog humping your leg can be absolutely hilarious), in order to elevate the film to a watchable level. Not even the first-rate soundtrack is able to accomplish this. One of the reasons a film like The Graduate (which this film steals heavily from), made the impact it did was because it was making a statement on generational differences and the boredom that can come with an upper-class lifestyle and the suffocating expectations that can come with it. Garden State doesn't seem to aspire to deal with issues anywhere near this big, but simply seems content to divert your attention with pop tunes and hangdog looks from its characters until it can get to its protagonist's final monologue, which is clearly the strongest point of the film.",3,1,3,28 October 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorcese Still Showing His Master Filmmaking Powers
","Wolf of Wall St. is a fascinating film by a master filmmaker, bringing 40 years of skill to the table; from casting, to shot selection, to how he pulls you into that world. And a guy who just plain having fun. The 3-hour film, traces the rise and fall of Wall St con man Jordan Belfort. A tightly constructed film, I wasn't bored for a minute.There were some people who kicked up a fuss about the film and its glorification of these slimy characters, their materialistic lifestyle, and their treatment of women as nothing but sex objects. Some have said that the film glorifies that lifestyle, but to me, Winter (screenwriter) and Scorcese went out of their way to show the reality of it. The film focuses on how animalistic and primal people can become when greed takes them over. The obsession with money and power becomes a pathology. This, of course, is what many Wall St people will loathe about the film.As for accuracy, I'm sure Jordan Belfort (who the film is based on and worked as a consultant on the film), embellished a few things, but according to one of the FBI agents who worked on the case, many of the more outrageous aspects depicted in the book and film were accurate.The sad part is that even though there will will many Wall St workers and finance people who will watch the film and think, 'That's a bunch of crap. They're painting with a broad brush. It's not fair,' there will be far too many young (and not-so-young) Wall St up-and-comers who will ignore the whole last hour of Wolf of Wall St., and simply look at the first 2 hours as an inspirational tale of the American dream.",9,4,6,28 May 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Outstanding Film. Not for the Transformers Crowd.
","Outstanding film. I thought Birdman was a complete breath of fresh air, and not what I was expecting at all...in a good way. I will say this: If you saw the trailer, and are somehow expecting this film to be a version of Transformers, it won't be. But if you're looking for a film with some of the best writing of the year, amazing camera work that totally absorbs you (20-minute non- stop takes following the actors through the scenes), a film with an almost perfect blend of humor and drama, and one in which, within 5 minutes of it's opening, proves itself so charmingly odd and unpredictable, that you're not quite sure what will happen next...than this film may be for you. Birdman skewers everything that's wrong with celebrity culture and Hollywood, while in many ways, embracing what can be great about it. Michael Keaton (who has been off the Hollywood radar for quite some time) is perfectly cast as a former movie star, who is well known for the 'Birdman' movie franchise that was a series of hugely popular comic books films 25 years earlier. (Not all that dissimilar from the Batman franchise the real-life Keaton starred in 25 years ago). Keaton's character, Riggan, is trying to resurrect his career, but as a serious actor, by directing and starring in a Broadway play. Pulling of this feat, will have numerous barriers, including him taking on a difficult role that many may not accept him in, a co-star lover, and, most hilariously, a narcissistic, unpredictable co-star (played Ed Norton), that seems to be trying to sabotage the production at every turn, if it means staying true to himself.Riggan is an actor who is desperate not to be forgotten. He needs to feel important again. His character taps into the self-loathing attitude and the need to believe that he is special, that we all feel, all while he is haunted by the voice of his alter-ego, the Birdman, who taunts him that he is a fraud who is making a huge mistake.Is Birdman light on plot? To an extent. Although I would say the plot revolves around an aging Hollywood movie star trying to pull off a hugely expensive Broadway show, without losing millions of dollars of investors money, all to see if he can salvage his career, and hence his reason for living. But even if some do feel it's light on plot, who cares? It's a completely engrossing film that follows interesting characters, played by actors who are compelling to watch. That's about you can ask for in a film.",9,2,9,10 January 2015
Flight," Sharp Performances Dulled By a Script That Slips Into the Absurd
","The first 20 minutes of Flight are fantastic and riveting. Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance of an alcoholic airline pilot with incomparable flying skills, who gets caught in a sticky situation. The rest of the cast, including Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood, are rock solid. Unfortunately, after the first half hour or so, it begins sliding into a color-by-numbers, overly formulaic script that contains more coincidences, improbabilities, and absurd events than any script should be expected to withstand. Then adds quite a bit of schmaltz on top of it.I won't give away any details, but will only say that those improbabilities grow so extreme that by the last 20 minutes of the film, it's absolutely groan worthy. And it's a shame, because Mr. Washington gives such a strong performance, and Mr. Zemeckis is a top-notch director. However, it seems that no matter how much the screenwriter or director wanted to do an edgy movie, they both find a way of cleaning it up and sanding down any rough corners.",6,0,0,26 May 2014
50_50," A Solid Final 20 Minutes, if You Can Get Through The First Hour and 20
","I feel a bit guilty being a dissenting voice on 50/50, as it tackles such a serious subject matter, and a has a very likable lead character. But in the end, there just wasn't much substance to this piece, until the final few minutes, for me to really invest in it.Most of the material in the script is dealt with the slack, off-handed 'Dude, remember the time you got cancer? Yeah, sucked, huh?' type of way.The film works so hard to not be serious or over-dramatic, that it winds up with almost no drama at all. When a serious moment does arise for the character, a pop tune is inserted into the soundtrack, to make sure we as the audience don't have to sit with the pain and confusion that the character is feeling. We can simply zone out for a bit, while we sway to the music.Now, I certainly wasn't expecting 'Terms of Endearment', or a super-serious drama, but I also wasn't expecting the topic to be handled in such an incredibly frivolous, predictable, and frankly, sometimes boring manner.The film doesn't quite work as a drama, and even though there is a few genuinely funny moments, they are certainly not enough to sustain it as a comedy. The plot itself is fairly cliché and predictable. You'd have to have never watched a film before not to know just about every development that will come to pass; other than the eventual health outcome of the Levitt's character. But frankly, even that was tipped off to anyone who saw the weeks of promotion in the run-up to the film where Seth Rogan speaks about the film being based on a true story. What basically saves the film in the end is Joseph Gordon Levitt's likability factor, and a very strong performance by his mother, Angelica Houston, who unfortunately, didn't get more screen time. Had the film focused on that, it may have been stronger. Seth Rogan's character seems only to serve as a device for comic relief, to make sure we don't get too down.The last part of the film ends strong and hits all the emotional buttons (it would've made a great short), but the majority of the film is basically another arrested development story, with Rogan's character acting like the affable, 12-year old boy, providing his fair share of penis and weed jokes, that we've grown to love...or at least tolerate. This was surprising, after I'd heard so much talk about how different this character was from all his others. I'm sure it was very difficult, especially in today's filmmaking environment, to get a film about cancer made. This is likely why the director and writers tried to lighten it up whenever possible. But one can only dilute a potent cocktail so much before it simply gets too watered down to drink.Unfortunately, I will likely remember very little about this film, except for the end, which was handled quite well. For me, it just wasn't enough to make up for the insignificance of the first hour and twenty minutes.",4,11,21,24 May 2012
The Fighter," Film That Puts Together the Entire Package
","Russel, along with screenwriters Silver, Tamasy and Johnson do an excellent job with 'The Fighter'. The film was shot on location in Lowell, MA where the story takes place, and being quite familiar with the area, I can tell you that they nailed all the little details. The performances are sublime, and everyone in the film is perfectly cast. Wahlberg underplays (as the real-life, quiet, big-hearted Mickey Ward), and Bale and Leo take advantage of every moment in their wonderfully-written roles, that are both surely award-winning performances. It can be easy to forget how crucial proper casting is to a film. Often times, directors are put under enormous pressure to cast bankable stars or supporting players who may not be the right fit for the characters; especially if those characters are the gritty, un-beautiful, working class type (for an example of where this can go terribly wrong, see the lovely Cameron Diaz woefully miscast in Scorcese's 'Gangs of New York'. To see where appropriate casting is used wonderfully, watch every episode of HBO's 'The Wire'). Russell clearly used a number of local non-actors in the film as well, and there isn't one in the film that you feel doesn't belong there. After Russell made few off-kilter, slightly 'unconventional' films, including I Heart Huckabees and having apparently behaved as a Class-A ass on the set of 'Three Kings' (if George Clooney's account is accurate), he apparently felt the pressure to deliver a Hollywood-style 'hit', and he surely did. And yet, there is nothing about this film that feels 'Hollywood' (a pejorative term that tends to be related to something sappy, sentimental, and extremely false in it's feeling and execution). One who studies boxing might think the fight scenes were a bit over-the-top, but that's the way the real Mickey Ward fought; able to withstand an enormous amount of punishment. The story is clear, engaging, touching, funny, and honest. Which is proof that you can actually make a gritty docudrama that is entertaining for an audience. You just need a great script, great actors, perfect casting, and a highly-skilled director willing to take some chances. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, there's only point where the writers tip their hand that they may not have grown up in the northeast. At one point, Charlene asks Dickie 'what's that blue stuff on your arm', to which he replies '(cake) Icing.' Now, as any true Bostonian knows it's never 'icing', but 'Frawstin!'",9,0,1,6 February 2011
