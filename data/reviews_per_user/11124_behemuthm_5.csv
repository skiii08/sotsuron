The Blair Witch Project," A Milestone in Horror Movies
","I actually got my hands on a copy of this film about two months ago from a friend of a friend. We watched it at work and everyone loved it. I started passing it out to people I know, who took it and showed it to other people they knew, and I have tallied about 600 people have seen my copy in the last two months. I know that of these people, 572 of them thought it was the scariest movie they'd ever seen, 8 didn't get it, and the rest hated it. I hope Haxan doesn't get mad at me...it's not even my tape! Besides, it's free advertising...I know that people who saw the tape went and told their friends who went to go see it in the theater, so hopefully I helped a little with the word-of-mouth. :)",10,1,2,3 August 1999
Spider-Man 2," I didn't even like the first one, and I LOVED this one!
","I'm proud to work at the facility that did the visual effects to this movie, but it would be unfair to claim that the visual effects made the film. The story is what really sells it, and the effects are the icing on the cake. Don't get me wrong, the effects are mind-blowing--some of the best action sequences I've ever seen. And Raimi is at the top of his game--and there are sweet little tidbits for those of you who have followed his career over the years--certain actors, types of camera moves and angles, will make you chuckle with delight and remind you who's directing this wonderful film. It's fun, warm, exciting, overall just amazing. I'll definitely go watch it a few more times!",9,4,13,1 July 2004
Mulholland Drive," What movie were the critics watching??
","I saw Mulholland Drive expecting to see a David Lynch film. I loved Blue Velvet and the Stra, and even Lost Highway. I love 'out there' movies. But this one was just boring. It's a lesbian jerk-off flick. So what? Why is this winning so many awards? It wasn't good. It was terrible and stupid. You can totally tell that he reshot all the porn crap later just to get the distribution heads to go nuts and release it. I as an audience member am insulted that this trype is considered 'brilliant' or 'unique'. It is neither. Lynch is a hack.",1,20,38,9 January 2002
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo Fails Again
","If you didn't enjoy Broken Arrow for its terrible direction, be braced for worse in Woo's latest attempt Mission Impossible 2. I thought the first installment of the two was okay, but as is the case more often than not, the sequel turns out worse. More than anything, Woo's style of slow-motion and extreme-angle shots would be cool if it wasn't taken too seriously. The music is way over the top (read: big music rise when man grabs a scarf...). The sound effects editing is equally as bad (a woman slaps a man in the face and it sounds like a 70s kung-fu kick). It would be fair to say that if you removed all of the slow-motion scenes in this movie, it'd be about 35 minutes long. However, Scooby-Doo fans will appreciate Woo's obvious tribute to lame plot-twists. This film is basically an excuse to show Cruise with wind blowing in his hair with a little smirk behind dark glasses (Matrix, anyone?). I don't care how many freakin' Kung Fu movies this guy's made: Every American film he's been involved in has sucked bigtime: Broken Arrow, The Rock, Face/Off, and most notably: Hard Target (poo!). Don't get me wrong: I wasn't expecting Shakespeare here...but there's no law stating that if you make an action movie, it has to be really unintelligent. Look at the original Bond films, for example. This has never happened to me before, but about twenty minutes in, I felt like I was in a movie theater, not involved in the story. I had to try to keep focusing on the screen and try to get into it, but I just couldn't. So in conclusion, if you like to be insulted as an audience member or feel like staring at a 40-foot-wide slow-motion extreme low-angle of Tom Cruise trying to be cool or acting tough, you're sure to get your eight dollars' worth. Oh yeah, an abundance of big explosions from three hundred different angles. Yawn.",1,1,2,25 May 2000
The Terminal," Better than most have stated
","I was surprised to see such a different movie than other folks have described here. I've heard people complaining about 'animals' at the end of the movie...what on earth are you talking about? There's nothing weird at the end at all! It's a very touching film, small by Spielberg's standards, but hey, let the guy make whatever kind of film he wants. It has a heart, deep down. Sure it's got its flaws, but it's by no means a bad film, as compared to Pearl Harbor or Armageddon, for crying out loud. Hanks is the man, and can work wonders with any sort of material.",Null,0,1,22 June 2004
