Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Movie!!!
","This was the greatest movie I have ever seen. I live in a small town and still had to stand in line two hours to watch it at 12:01 AM Wed. morning, it was well worth it! I will go see it many more times. It has everything a good movie needs. Also, when it ends, you are left in wonder about what is to come. This is a must see for everyone, even the non-Star Wars fans, it's just a great movie!",10,0,1,19 May 1999
