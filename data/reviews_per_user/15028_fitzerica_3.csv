The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," I loved it, give me a break the rest of you naysayers
","The rating of 4.9. is ridiculously low and most definitely unfounded. Give me a break people! (yes I was born in the 70's). I LOVED the music, I LOVED the emotion, I LOVED the nostalgia. I was very much affected by this movie. I think it was very well done, from a regular person's point of view (who else really counts as far as the box office is concerned). The wedding made me cry (because of the music), the honeymoon locale and ambiance was unforgettable (I would do anything for a moonlit night on an exotic beach with the man of my dreams), the rest of the story and particularity the music was moving and I felt, well acted and convincing. The low IMDb ratings for the Twilight movies, despite the exorbitant profits is a little annoying. I LOVE watching them as do obviously a gazillion other people! Be sure to view this with the lights low, a glass of wine (if you are of age) and an open heart and you will be transported into the feelings of love and life and the emotion of it will be an absolutely unforgettable experience. Heartless cynics, get lost and find another place to reside, you don't belong here.",9,1,6,26 August 2012
Twilight," Excellent movie, not given enough credit
","The first time I saw this movie I was brand new to everything Twilight. I had not read the books and really didn't know much about them or the movie. I remember leaving the theatre intrigued, entertained and wanting more, but felt like they could have stepped it up a bit especially in relation to the special effects. Since that first screening, I have now read the books and seen the movie at least 5 more times. I, like so many others, devoured the books and have definitely grown to love the movie as well. You can't watch a movie repeatedly if it is crap. I absolutely adore the music and the story and although it can't completely capture the tension and yearning of such a moving love story that the books are easily able to convey, I think that it does do a great justice to it. I feel that the director and actors did a wonderful job and I believe in each of them. This picture is lovely and moved me as well as making me laugh and enjoy myself, and as I said previously, it is a continuing pleasure to watch.",9,0,4,12 September 2009
P.S. I Love You," Absolutely wonderful movie, makes my top 10 list
","This movie makes my top 10 list of favourite movies of all time. I am 43 years old, so that means I have watched a decent amount of films over the years. I always have this as a go to movie if I want to feel love, emotion, sadness and joy. I find it to be very emotionally moving. The music is top notch and placed perfectly throughout. I am continually impressed upon subsequent viewings. Originally it received poor ratings, which really irked me, but I notice it is currently sitting at a 7/10, which although not as high as I would like, at least is an improvement. I have watched this movie at least 20 times and I truly love it and very much recommend it. I gave it a 9/10 only because there were just a few lines (maybe 3 in total) in the entire film that I would have written differently. I hope the actors in this picture are proud of their work, I know that I greatly admire the writer, director, actors, crew, and especially the person who picked the score......... Thank you so much for giving this to us, it will be something that I never forget and I have deep admiration for all who were involved in the making of movie!",9,0,0,2 February 2014
