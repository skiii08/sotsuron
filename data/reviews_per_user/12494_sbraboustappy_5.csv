Ford v Ferrari," Incredible piece of entertainment!
","What a great movie this was! It has been some time since I felt so excited while watching a movie. It is simply great, no wonder why it was nominated, I hope it wins! GO WATCH IT! Superb!",10,6,7,16 January 2020
The Blair Witch Project," This is a waste of time. Run!
","This is not a movie. It's a bunch of teenagers playing with a camera. Don't waste your time watching it, it's bad. Like I read in one comment 'this film will stay in your thoughts for some while', indeed: I never forgot I actually paid to watch this thing in a cinema.",1,3,7,17 January 2020
Salt," Just bad writing and shaky action scenes
","This movie was awful. Behind all the clich√© and the ugly face and swollen lips of Jolie, the writing is bad. Shaky camera shots with fast cuts make me dizzy and angry. Many unanswered questions and God Mode on for her during all the scenes. It's easy not to like Jolie in this movie. Don't waste your time, go watch something better. Kudos for the sound mixing, only.",3,0,4,20 January 2020
1917," What a piece of stunning work!
","This movie is so much thrilling and the camera work and performances are superb. Effects and CGi is so real and well done, a jewel of a movie to watch. One of my favorites for 2019!",10,7,10,19 January 2020
Joker," Solid performance for a dark, creepy movie
","You do not need to know much about the DC universe to watch this movie. Actually, this is one of the reasons I watch it since I am very fed up with comics-derived movies. But this one is intense. Joaquin's performance is absolutely perfect, leading to a dark and creepy character that makes you uncomfortable at every scene. I like the connection with the Batman universe, it's subtle and nailed on. This is certainly NOT my favorite film for winning the Oscar but is one hell of a well done movie.",8,1,5,19 January 2020
