Iron Man 3," Good film but villain twist is disappointing
",In my opinion this was a good and enjoyable film but the villain twist was disappointing. The cast was solid and all put in good performances as their characters with Robert Downey Jr standing out yet again for his portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man and the soundtrack went great a long with the action.I have to say though I was annoyed with how they chose to deal with the villain 'The Mandarin'. At the start Ben Kingsley looked very mysterious and intimidating and it definitely looked as if he was going to be a great and powerful villain with Guy Pearce's character looking like a worthy sidekick but to then turn him in to just an actor and making Guy Pearce the 'real' mandarin left me disappointed.Overall though this was still a good film and I am excited to continue to watch the build up for the next Avengers installment.,7,1,4,21 July 2013
Django Unchained," Another masterpiece from Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino has delivered again. The film doesn't stop being great from start to finish with great dialogue, action and the soundtrack to go with it. The cast is superb with Christoph Waltz in particular standing out from the crowd which is saying a lot considering he was up against actors such as DiCaprio and Jackson so it really shows how good his acting ability is. The soundtrack is possibly one of the best i've heard and it really makes the film even more great and dramatic. Overall this is a brilliant film and goes down as one of my favourites although this may not be everyone's cup of tea with the amount of blood on show and also audiences may find the language a bit too much for them.",10,0,2,21 July 2013
