Minority Report," Overhyped.. Undermade.
","Worst Spielburg yet? I think so.  I've had never turned off/walked out of a Spielburg film until last night.  With me, Spielburg has always been a hit or miss director, but his misses have never been so wide as with Minority Report.  After a few hours (I watched another, much better film) I returned to where I'd left off in Minority Report and was pleased to see that the film did improve (however slightly) during the latter half.The first image the audience is handed in watching Minority Report is a robotic lathe that looks like it was drawn up with some 10 year old CAD software by a drafter bent on one night of heavy drinking.  This special effects showcase was off to a bad start to say the least.  In fact.. the only special effects worth giving merit were the 'spiders'.  The entire world's ability to go from muted color sharp photography in one frame to air-brushed soft focus (and poorly textured) CGI in the next was staggering. One minute I'm watching a grungy cop flick.. the next I'm watching Blues Clues as our hero pretends to jump from one moving vehicle to another without drawing undue attention to himself.  I kept waiting for him to miss his mark.. look at the camera.. and then, upon looking down, fall with the full Looney Toon orchestral accompanyment.  I couldn't suspend my disbelief for an instant.. special effects?  3/10One of the worst sins of this flick was the touchless interface used in the pre-homicide detective's work area.  Sure.. it looks cool... I thought we'd be in for a real treat when the lights dimmed, Cruise lowered his head, raised his arms, and we saw a spectrograph form across the middle of the screen.  I figured Spielburg would incorporate some music after creating such an image of a Hi-Tech conductor.  No.. no.. instead we see yard-long hand motions made to do the same functions (select, drag, zoom, focus) I can do with my mouse, one hand, and 12-18 square inches of area to move within. If you're going to create a futuristic computer interface, at least try to make it more practical than what we currently have.  A keypad, a mouse and two jog-wheels would have made the whole process 10x more productive.  The set being filled with lexan screens that were glued together with ugly, poorly formed seams was a letdown as well.  I figured the future would have something better to offer.The storyline was very contrived, yet used very basic character generalizations.  There was nothing difficult to figure out since every aspect of the plot was spoonfed to you, so the intellectual aspect was ruined.. if you try to actually sink your brain into the intricacies of the plot, you see it holds less water than a sieve.Anderton undergoes 12-16hours of pain to have his eyeballs swapped out, so that he won't be IDed by the sensors in every public domain.. only to whip out his old eyes (during one extremely pointless scene) so that he can scan himself into the Pre-Crime headquarters.  Good thing he got those new eyes... or ..or else  *shrug*  Anderton purposefully enters the room where he's been fated to murder someone (with the murder weapon armed) simply because he's a moron... There is no reason established for him to enter the room, other than to advance the already disgusting plot.Didn't know Colin Farrell was in this one until I saw him step into view.. If that was his first mainstream exposure to an American audience, I bet he's glad some people saw him in good flicks like Tigerland before passing judgement... what a poor role.Bottom Line:  Cold pointless summer flick that doesn't hold a candle to most others in the special effects, action or philosophical realms. Tripe.",4,6,9,2 October 2003
Underworld," As expected.. mostly.
","Yet another action based vampire movie.  Yet again, enjoyable to watch but very shallow in execution.  Yet again, a new director who shows promise in being able to pull a professional film together but who's ability to direct is obviously immature.I just read Roger Ebert's review and he very accurately likened Underworld to a porno.  While there is no sex to speak of.. and hardly an ounce of eroticism (save the 'gothic requisite' abundance of tight fitting leather), the movie flows like a porno in many respects.  Ebert left the analogy at the opening and closing of doors, but I believe much more was implied. The dialog is minimal and purposeful.. like a porno's.  The action is abundant and full of cliche.. like a porno's.  The scenes between action are merely showcases for the characters to posture themselves as objects that we should feel drawn towards.. you guessed it.. just like those of a porno.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but unfortunately for this film, an otherwise half decent story is drown out by too much action, a tad too much posturing, and way too little characterization.Ebert managed to get a key element of the plot completely wrong (did he walk out halfway into the film?  seems like it) so I'll try not to harp on his other criticisms.  If he'd paid attention he might have awarded this flick another half star.The use of CGI in Underworld seemed constrained to advancing the story line by showing us the internal transformations of creatures into and out of their human forms, and moves such as impossible jumps and creatures running on walls.  Many of the scenes could have been made more cheaply with loads of CGI instead of live action costumes and I applaud the move by the director/producers to keep as much live action in front of the camera.If poor acting was this flick's worst bramble, Shane Brolly (Kraven) was it's biggest thorn.  I kept expecting to see some inner conflict that might round out his character and allow the audience to second guess his next move.. but from the very first word out of his mouth, to the last, we know he's the antagonist Kate Beckinsale (Selene) will need to keep her eye on. A good villain is someone the audience can mutually feel at odds with and understand... we never understand Kraven.  We get a hint at his motives, but they're too briefly bothered with for us to give him any consideration.The short of it is: were they to make a special edition of this film.. cut out some of the gratuitous action (yes, there was too much for even an action flick) and insert some well acted dialog and character development.. they might have a cult classic on their hands.  As it is.. it's merely a shallow summer movie wearing goth clothes.  Speaking of.. Selene's character is enough to make even a preppy dude like myself wish he had been lost in the goth crowd (maybe some of the posturing worked it's magic on me).The attempts at making suspenseful, horror film-like scares were disappointing.. or maybe I'm just jaded.. several did incite some laughter from me though.  Seemed like whenever things got quiet you could count to 5 (not unlike the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch) and something with fangs would hop into view accompanied by a very loud noise.  I couldn't make a scary movie if my life depended on it.. so I digress.I give it 6.5 stars out of 10 for the excellent costumes, makeup (including the very sexy teeth), set design, use of both a Maserati and Bentley (hard driven, too), lots of eye and ear candy and intriguing storyline.  It loses massive points for the overdone action scenes (mostly the finale), poor acting and lack of character development.I've been reading a few user reviews and keep seeing Matrix comparisons. That's funny, because the Matrix's best scenes were copied from a vampire action film.  You'd think the Matrix was the only movie many of these folks had ever seen.  If the Matrix had never been made, I believe this movie would have ended up very much the same.**spoilers**An interesting bit of trivia actually.  The name Selene is from a Greek word meaning 'moon'.  This brings about an interesting fateful dynamic when you consider Scott Speedman(Michael Corvin)'s ability to be 'struck' by her as quickly as the full moon itself.With the realization that the Lycan were once slaves/daytime-guardians to the vampires, did anyone else find it a little over the top when the silver studded bullwhips (wielded by a lithe white vampire) were used on none other than a muscular black man (errr.. werewolf)?  I had flashbacks to Kunta Kinte learning his name.Plot hole...?  UV light bothers/kills the Vampires and not the Lycan.. why on earth didn't the Lycan use a few readily available gro-lites here and there in their 'den'?  I can't think of a better security system against vampires.Ohh.. Has anyone yet mentioned how good Kate Beckinsale looks in this film?",Null,0,0,25 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A great movie for fans in the know..
","I saw this movie shortly after it's emergance in theatres.  My fan status required it.  I already knew about where the general plot was headed, but sat happily through the movie to see how it would pan out exactly.  I was impressed, very impressed.  Many of the scenes were more interesting because I understood what a SW fan is supposed to.  I think if some of the people who have shown lukewarm feelings toward Episode II rewatch it after seeing Episode III when all is revealed, they will allow themselves some oohs and aahhs.  There is chemistry between much of the cast, but only for the backstory, the trillogy's plot.  There is much below the surface.. and I can understand why some people think the actors simply have no chemistry with each other... they just don't understand the reasons.  I heartily agree that the love story isn't that great.  But if you go back and look at the love story in Episode V, you'll notice that it consisted of Han being rude to Leia and Leia returning the sentiments.  Only when they begin name calling does the relationship advance.  Sure, it's more entertaining than what we see in Episode II, but it also just goes to show you that SW isn't about good love stories.  Otherwise I was very impressed once again with Ewan McGreggor (as always) and even with the new digital Yoda, who displays some personality once again.",Null,0,0,7 August 2002
Cold Mountain," Barely Watchable for the first 30min
","This film could have been a much more reasonable 2 hours in duration, if only they had made the decision to sum up the boring first 30 minutes into a 2 minute narrative.Until Zellweger appeared, I was ready to gouge my eyes out. The first clue that this was going to be a rough 154 minutes was when our main characters opened their mouths for the first time. Wow, you'd think that if you're going to shoot your film in Eastern Europe, throwing an Australian and an Englishman into your lead roles is pushing it too far. Those were, hands down, the worst attempts at southern accents I've ever heard. I really like Law and Kidman, but they just couldn't pull off 19th century Southern if they were sitting on a front porch fanning themselves while eating pecan pie and listening to a conversation about the rising costs of negros.Zellweger's characterizations were great. She was a little to impolite to be a southerner, but the overall spirit she got right.Hoffman's brief stint in the film was wonderful and I was ready to rate this film a 9, until he was killed off. It's too bad Hoffman doesn't weigh 40lbs less, he would make a fabulous Inman.Portman provided an impeccable performance, but again, for too short a period.At one point Inman mentions that it's a long way to the Blue Ridge.. unfortunately for him, he wasn't actually going to the Blue Ridge since Cold Mountain is mentioned to be in Haywood County. During the Civil War, Haywood County was much larger than present day Haywood County, but still didn't encompass any of the Blue Ridge. Of course, this may explain why the movie was so long.. Jude never stopped to ask for directions.In the end, this movie just gave me a very hollow feeling. Hollow actors in the lead roles, hollow story with holes at the edges, and a hollow love story that ended in horribly done movie-kisses that looked like two large goldfish trying to swim around in too small a tank.I'd give it a 9 or 10 if only they had cut it down to just the secondary characters, which were exceedingly watchable.",4,2,3,17 May 2006
A Beautiful Mind," A bit of a dissapointment
","Unlike most of the people who have had negative things to say about this movie... I like Russell Crowe and Ron Howard.I had heard all the hype about this movie which didn't intrigue me from the previews and eventually became intrigued nonetheless.  As I watched it I realized that this is, at least, the fifth modern film to use apparitions or schizophrenia to create a surprise.  'The Sixth Sense', 'Fight Club', 'The Others' and 'Vanilla Sky'. All have been made in recent years, all use the same devices, and all used them much better than 'A Beautiful Mind'.  I'm getting tired of it as it nears creating it's own genre of 'Suprise' filmmaking.Ron Howard does an excellent job directing as usual and the acting was good, as expected... not wonderful or perfect.  I suggest you see 'Rain Man', 'Sling Blade' or 'Regarding Henry' if you fancy a brilliant actor playing the role of a handicap.The thing I didn't enjoy was that this movie never really decided what kind of film it wanted to be.  You begin to attach yourself to Nash and then suddenly his wife takes over as the object of the movie.. and she shouldn't be.  It's like Nash wants it to be an 'October Sky' about discovery and merit and then this wife wants it to be a bad romance novel about love.  I adore a good love story, don't get me wrong, but this movie wasn't a love story, nor was it about overcoming one's odds.. it was a horrible incomplete attempt at homogenizing these things.  Especially with the ending scene at the Nobel Prize ceremony where he turned his acceptance speech into an I LUV U, when I got that awful 'Mr Holland's Opus' feeling in the pit of my stomach.  Blech.Worth seeing once. **",5,0,1,17 June 2002
WALL·E," Batteries Not Included + The Little Mermaid + Planet of the Apes
","Batteries Not Included (BNI); The Little Mermaid (TLM); Planet of the Apes (PotA):Adorable Space-Age Robots? (BNI) - Check! Mindless humans powerless to escape their predicament? (BNI, PotA) - Check!A home in ruin after spending too much time in outer space? (PotA) - Check!A precious snowflake seeking a congruent soul... up where they walk, talk and play all day in the sun? (TLM) - Check!WALL-E is the best parts of each of those movies; the cute robots, the lovesick child and the epic tale of terrestrial dismay. Unfortunately, WALL-E may or may not be as good as one or two of those movies depending on what you're looking for.The global pollution theme is too big a pill to force down the throats of movie goers, especially the younger audience this movie is designed for, so it gets dished out in small easily palatable doses. Sci-Fi nerds are going to be left wanting more, but then, aren't we always?The cute factor of the robots is right up Pixar's alley. Is the plot slowing? Insert a little slapstick or a cute emote involving some cute robots. 'Awwwwww,' goes the crowd. Who doesn't like cute? Even the Grinch couldn't resist the mystical powers of cuteness.That leaves us with the main theme. Ariel... err, I mean WALL-E lives in his treasure trove where he's collected all the wonderful artifacts from a people he wishes were his friends. He sees a fair prince.. oh, uhh.. EVE (not a prince) and abandons his lesser friend (a Twinkie devouring cockroach... perhaps named 'Flounder') to commit himself to following this 'prince' into her own territory (Axiom). A stranger in a strange land he nearly brings everything to ruin before breaking through and sacrificing for the sake of his 'prince'. The prince broods and the mermaid (WALL-E) has a happy fairytale ending with her prince.No seriously, this was The Little Mermaid, set in the distant future... except possibly less memorable being that it isn't a musical. Not bad, Pixar, considering what you had to work with... but not a home run either.",8,1,5,6 July 2008
Casino Royale," Count me out, if this is the new direction for Bond.
","This was the most predictable, least interesting, most commercialized and least 'Bond' James Bond movie yet. I knew going in that it wouldn't be the classic Bond formula, but a large portion of my fellow IMDb reviewers were claiming it was still a good movie. Thanks for nothing. I should keep in mind when reading IMDb's reviews that these are the same people that put LOTR:Return of the King near the top of the list... but enough with my rant.While I didn't like the idea of Daniel Craig as Bond going in, I think he played this new Bond well. Yeah, I'm down with the new direction.. and I firmly believe that each Bond actor needs his own style.. so I wouldn't mind seeing a better script and a better director have another go at it with Mr Craig. As always, Judi Dench is flawless and powerful.. every scene involving her was worth watching. It was everything else that turned me off. There is a lot to be desired in terms of the plot, the pacing and the dialog... I really think that this could have been a great movie (worthy of the top 250, which it is currently disgracing by the finest of margins) in the hands of a better writer & director.",5,5,9,24 November 2006
