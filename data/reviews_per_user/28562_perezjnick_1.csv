Hereditary," American Horror Redemption
","This isn't your typical scare flick, but for me was sufficient in creeping me the hell out. It's a 2 hour+ horror (don't see that often), so it can seem slow if your not looking to enjoy all the details the director put into the film. Casting, acting, cinematography, sound, and pace all fit well together. The plot kept me guessing throughout, and was complete start to finish with few holes.",8,1,7,8 June 2018
