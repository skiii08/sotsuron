Come and See," Don't 'Come and See'
","In recently becoming interested in films and mini-series centered on fictitious or historical characters in World War II, I ran across this title on several top 50 or 100 war films lists. I was rather keen to see it, especially given the reviews which called it 'chilling' or lauded it as one of the top war films of all time. Forgive me for being a killjoy here, but after viewing this film, I was simply left with a feeling of 'Really?'. The character of the boy doesn't seem developed enough and the imagery presented in some so-called 'intense' scenes did not truly attract my attention nor made me empathize with the character. Some scenes also appeared to drag on too long without any meaning or added effect. In short, I would probably put this on my 'Top 50 War Films to Pass On' list. I should have simply watched another coming-of-age war film that is an outstanding film: 'Europa Europa.'",3,20,51,2 June 2012
