Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Powerful movie
","Episode I has exceeded my expectations. After 16 years of watching the original trilogy over and over again I had forgotten what it was like to be awed by a fresh new movie, one that I did not know the next word to be spoken or the next action taken. I was dazed by the effects, music, characters, and story. I look forward to episodes II and III.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
