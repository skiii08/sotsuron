Angels & Demons," Lame Fodder for the Masses
","The only thing I like about this movie is it serves as the perfect example of what's wrong with contemporary Hollywood movie-making. The story is so completely ridiculous and implausible and yet is played with such deadly earnestness that I didn't know whether to laugh or throw up. From beginning to end the audience is treated with such disdain and contempt that it's obvious Ron Howard and crew assume American moviegoers are the stupidest people on the planet (which, unfortunately is probably true given this film's rating on IMDb). SPOILER: a dead eyeball will not clear a retina scanner! And the fact that all these inane goings-on so obviously cost millions and millions of dollars to create just highlights the vacuity and pointlessness of the whole adventure. Sadly depressing.",1,0,3,29 April 2017
