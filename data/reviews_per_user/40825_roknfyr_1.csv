","Yeah, I went to see this mess based on the enthusiastic recommendation of a 'friend,' the same friend who, raving like a madman, recommended 'The Dark Knight.' Granted, Cohen doesn't possess Christian Bale's throat-cancer delivery, but he's just as irritating; furthermore, those two recommendations have caused me to blacklist any further recommendations from this movie-whammy.

Basically, if you've ever eaten or plan to eat again, don't watch. Hope this helps. I checked the spoiler box because, after all, I did reveal that it is way-bad.",1,1,4,10 July 2009
