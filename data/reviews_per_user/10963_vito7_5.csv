Scarface," Masterpiece
","When this movie was released it was bashed by many a critic, most of which have withdrawn their statements or updated their reviews. It is now considered one of the best portraits of American crime ever made. Actually a remake of a Paul Muni classic it is possibly the most quoted movie of all time. In the history of movies it may never escape being eclipsed by the cinematic accomplishment that is the godfather, scarface lands on the opposite end of the spectrum. It is a more kinetic, exciting and darker look at what it is to be a gangster in America. It has been copied by many a movie and referenced in more hip hop songs then could be counted. Not for the faint of heart Scarface is the quintessential 'the world is yours', 'I want it all' crime saga. Despite the end sequence, Tony Montana will never die in the memories of the ever growing audience of this classic gangster flick.Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html",10,1,2,3 November 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," surprise
","I'm not exactly sure what I liked about this movie but I did. It was really one of those romantic comedies that I would usually complain didn't have enough laugh out-loud moments to keep me into it, and I can certainly say I've come to expect more from this writer but there was enough chemistry from the actors and enough quirky little moments that I came away happy with my viewing. It's been weeks now and I still find myself singing the Dracula song to my wife in a thick Transylvanian accent and it still gets a warm reception. I was also surprised to so easily accept 'That 70's Show's 'Jackie' on the big screen but she handled her role like a pro and I'm guessing my already established history with the actress had me a little more emotionally vested in her relationship than the script actually earned. Regardless of the personal mystery I came away pleased and have to say it's a pretty decent movie. Even that British fellow I had already decided I hated after the MTV awards partially won me over in this one. My only other real critique is the story seemed to think it made us really hate Sarah Marshall when they had actually gave us some room to see where she was coming from. You might want to save it for a rainy day but it's worth a watch.Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html",6,0,3,16 November 2008
The Dark Knight," Perhaps the best Comic Movie to date
","I was as skeptical as the next guy of all the hype going in but 'The Dark Knight' did not disappoint. I'm traditionally a Marvel man but I think I have to give the crown to this DC movie for the current comic best. It doesn't let up with interest and entertainment and just when you think it's coming to a close the storyline swoops back in with more shock and surprise. It is a shame we won't get to see another installment for Heath Ledger as the road was paved for many a sequel. He hands down wins the award for most compelling comic movie villain to date. His performance only ever rivaled by Nicholsans portrayal also of the joker in the 80's. Ledgers, as with the rest of the reboot of the Batman saga, is a slightly more realistic depiction of what the comic super villain would have to be like. The Dark Knight is a don't miss.Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html",10,4,8,2 November 2008
The Happening," Not So Bad
","Well let me start by saying I understand why so many didn't like this movie and I can't really argue their points. But for my viewing I must say I was intrigued the entire time and especially during the old woman's house scenes I was really on edge. Considering the genre I can't really ask for more than that out of the movie. It was certainly a strange idea but I can't down-rate for originality. My only real two complaints are that one, in the explanation, I don't really get that a gas that breaks down our naturally defense to not hurting ourselves would automatically cause us to hurt ourselves, also I have come to expect more from an M.N.S. ending. It could have used some fireworks to wrap things up. All that said I really can't recommend this movie to anyone because I see the strong potential for them to be disappointed. I guess as always it's up to each viewer to decide but it kept my interest.Logan Lamechwww.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html",6,2,5,16 November 2008
The Godfather," Greatest of all time
","For my money the original Godfather is the greatest movie ever made. Compelling, legendary and timeless, with Marlon Brando coming out of retirement to blow the barn doors off the hinges with his portrayal of Vito Corleone, one of the most revered characters in movie history. He once again raises the bar on what a great actor can achieve and should be expected to. This movie began one of the most amazing movie careers in history with Al Pacino and also took America's guilty obsession with the 'ganster' to new heights. It is a constant frustration for me when The Godfather II gets a higher rating then the predecessor. Also an all time great but there is likely no movie that deserves higher praise then this original ground-breaker. It has set a level of excellence for crime dramas that every movie since only strives to reach. The number of referenced and quoted scenes in modern Americana is matched only by Casablanca and thirty five years later it has still not faded in the memories of its audience.Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html",10,2,4,2 November 2008
