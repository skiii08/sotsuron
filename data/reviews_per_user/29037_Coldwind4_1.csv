The Ring," Any fan of horror movies must watch!
","If you love to be scared silly without any vulgarity or gore, this is a great film to turn to. I am an avid horror movie fan and I just ADORE this movie. Horror movies don't usually scare me, but after viewing this one I couldn't sleep for a week. And since it is basically clean except for a little language here and there and some scary images, anybody above the age of maybe 10-12, depending on if they scare easily, could see this film (maybe more or less.)The film revolves around Rachel, who finds a mysterious tape that supposedly kills anyone who watches it a week after viewing it. When she watches it, she has just one week to find out how to break the deadly curse. Worst of all is that her son Aidan and Noah, her ex husband, father of Aidan, have also viewed it. But with the help of Noah, she is determined to put a stop to this once and for all.I give this movie a 10/10 rating, because it creeps me out in a classy, psychological way, rather than gross and unnecessary things. You really start to care for the characters and find yourself not able to stop watching until the chilling end of this great chilling film.",10,3,5,15 July 2007
