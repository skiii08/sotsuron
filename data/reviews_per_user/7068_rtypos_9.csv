Catch Me If You Can," Moderately entertaining
","As in so many movies 'based on a true story' this one would have been a lot better if the director hadn't added so many typical 'Hollywood' moments. More attention to the details of the real story and the real personalities of the main characters would have made this infinitely more interesting and illuminating. As it is, it had some fine moments and some good acting, but it was too long and near the end when Abignail (sp?) once again gets away it is just too fantastic an escape to be believed.",Null,0,0,31 December 2002
Brokeback Mountain," not happy
","Brokeback Mountain disappointed me. The fact that a movie about gay cowboys has received so much critical acclaim is a good thing, I think. I suspect that though that the movie has received so much attention and acclaim more because of its subject matter and not so much for the quality of the story itself. I was sympathetic to the movie's message about the hatred and violence that homosexual love for some reason triggers in so many people, but I was expecting a greater, a more inspired, love story. Scenery was nice, but the story itself dragged . . and dragged . . . and dragged. Half way through the story and I was glancing at my watch. I would have left actually if I had been there by myself. This was sure a weak year when it came to Oscar candidates. I found Crash contrived and preachy, but it was probably more deserving of an Oscar than Brokeback.",4,4,30,14 March 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Same old story
","Hmmmm. . . why don't any of the cars involved in the car crashes have air bags? That's just a niggling little detail, but the movie is full of improbabilities and inconsistencies. It added nothing to what we had already seen and the first two installments did it better. I quickly became bored with the unimaginative chase scenes where you can't even tell what's going on. Same with the fight scenes. It is essentially the same plot as the first two movies. Maybe in the fourth installment Bourne will go after somebody that's even higher up in the food chain. There is no real attempt at character development here. The movie is aimed for those people who like hearing dramatic music leading up to car chases or fist fights. Obviously this is what a lot of people like, judging from the comments here, but I found the movie simply tedious after a while. I can not understand why it has received such high praise from critics.",3,5,11,8 August 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A masterpiece, but . . .
","Another brilliant effort by Jackson. Gollum was worth the price of admission alone. The special effects were entrancing and mind-blowing, the battle scenes were probably the best ever filmed, the scenery was spectacular . . . but I liked the first one better for a number of reasons.a) In the Twin towers, action comes at the expense of character development. This is my biggest complaint with the movie.  In the first installment the characters were real, heroic, in the second they often seem too much like Hollywood superheroes and they become less interesting as a consequence. Gandalf appearing like the Lone Ranger on the horizon, rearing back on his horse and then charging into battle wielding his staff like a sword.  C'mon, we don't need those cliches. When Aragorn looses an arrow, 10 orcs die. When 1,000 orcs shoot at him, they all miss. Ironically, the one character who really comes alive is the computer created Gollum who manages to be evil, innocent, pitiful and hateful all at once. If only Jackson would have spent equal time developing the other main characters this movie would have been a masterpiece, or rather more of a masterpiece. Special effects are fun, but I liked it better when the heroes appeared more mortal and their development as friends and warriors helped drive the movie's pace.b) Faramir should sue for character assassination. In the book he was as wise and intuitive as his brother Boromir was boorish and insensitive. In the movie he comes across as stubborn and dense. Tolkien's Faramir was able to guess Frodo's quest without being told, as he was able to surmise Boromir's treachery. I wish Jackson wouldn't have fooled with his character.c) The ents are mostly boring until the climactic scene at Isengard which is a lot of fun. (The ents are a weak part of Tokien's trilogy too.)d) The steeds ridden by the ringwraiths weren't very impressive.",Null,0,0,22 December 2002
Inside Man," I was robbed
","The reason for this bank heist became so preposterous as it unfolded that the movie eventually just became boring. You agree to a 'willing suspension of disbelief' when you go to a movie, but still within it's own rules the film must have some kind of logic. I certainly couldn't accept that this robbery could take place or for the reasons way Spike Lee would have us belief it did. I was looking at my watch a good half-hour before the show ended. The acting ranged from unexceptional to awful and the cinematography was much the same. Some of the lines in this movie actually made me cringe. Jodie Foster's role was arbitrary and pointless. I confess that I have never been much of a Spike Lee fan and this only cements that opinion. Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon . . . now that was a good bank robbery movie.",3,1,4,5 November 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," No magic in the movie
","As an adult fan of the Harry Potter series, I was unimpressed by the cinematic version of the story and surprised that so many critics are already calling this uninspired production a classic. I can think of dozens of childrens' movies that are superior to this one including Shrek and Monsters Inc. which are playing at the same time. Compared to a true classic like ET, this Harry Potter movie appears weak even by muggle standards.With only a few exceptions the acting here was wooden and uninspired. Maggie Smith as Professor/Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall stood out as did David Bradley as Caretaker Argus Filch. Robbie Coltrane as Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid also had his moments. The kids were cute, but they all acted as if they were reading their lines and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)had pretty well one expression for every occasion. The special effects were pedestrian.
As others have also noted, director Chris Columbus would have been better off to leave out some parts of the book and concentrate on doing a better job with the parts he kept. As it is, the movie rushes forward, lurching from one scene to another and barely taking the time to develop characters or any kind of dramatic tension.What made the first book so enjoyable for me was the excitement of discovering a magic world existing side-by-side with the muggles. It was so much fun to experience Harry's surprise and wonderment when he is first introduced to that world. This movie captures none of that. For a movie about wizards and witches there is painfully little magic to be found here.",6,0,1,19 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Crowe shines, Howard doesn't
","Russel Crowe's performance is good, but not extraordinary. The problem with this movies lies with Ron Howard's direction. He turns the tale into traditional mawkish Hollywood fare. These supposedly 'true' stories that Hollywood turns are so sanitized and simplified that they bear little resemblance to the actual events that supposedly provided the inspiration.********************************MAJOR SPOILER *****************Howard blew it by letting half the movie go by without telling readers that John Nash was in the grip of full-blown schizophrenia complete with delusions and much of what the audience was seeing was in fact imaginary. It is a lot more interesting later in the movie when we know he is mentally ill and we see him dealing with his mental illness and his delusions. This unreliable narrative voice works in a movie like Memento, but it is a cheap trick in this instance and deprives the audience of a chance to watch his schizophrenia develop.",Null,0,1,12 January 2002
The Departed," over-hyped
","I confess from the start that I did not want to see The Departed. Gangster movies with their gratuitous violence, profanity laced dialogue and sordid characters have little appeal for me. I find them, almost always, tedious and unsettling, the exception being movies like the Godfather series which were able to transcend the genre. However I told my son I would see the movie if it won the Oscar for best picture which, to my regret, it did. A promise is a promise so I sat through the entire movie even though I wanted to leave many times. Setting aside my ingrained distaste for movies of this sort and trying to look at the film objectively, I would argue that it fails on many critical levels. The acting performances range from adequate to indifferent. Jack Nicholson plays his usual Jack Nicholson role which is good or bad depending on whether or not you like Jack Nicholson. Matt Damon's character is bland and motiveless. Mark Walhberg's character is just bizarre. Leonard DiCaprio's performance is probably the best but that's not saying much. The script never calls for any real character development so the actors basically have one mood and that's it for the rest of the show. All we have throughout the movie is people swearing at each other, menacing other people or being menaced. The whole set up and execution of the plot, the obligatory love affair, the violence and the twist at the end is so just so improbable as to be ludicrous. At the other end of the spectrum in the Academy Awards Best Picture nominees was Little Miss Sunshine and though this movie had its flaws it had, at least, an original idea which, of course, never appeals to Academy voters. It was intelligent and infinitely more entertaining than The Departed which does not even rise to the top when compared to great gangster movies like The Goodfellas, Get Shorty, Snatch, Scarface etc. If you like gangster movies you will probably enjoy The Departed, even though I doubt you will find the hype justified. If you don't like gangster shows there is certainly nothing here to make you change your mind.",4,3,6,27 February 2007
V for Vendetta," tales itself too seriously
","I went to this movie with low expectations. I just wanted an adventure flick with neat special effects. Alas, that is not what I got. Although I enjoyed the first few minutes I knew I was in trouble when the hero launched forth with a long alliterative soliloquy using the letter V. I think I might have actually enjoyed the outburst if it had been done tongue in cheek. But the writers actually intended us to take it seriously. It was as absurd as the speech by that character, whatever he was called, in the second Matrix. It would have earned a d minus in a college essay. V, I realized sadly after about 20 minutes, was a boring pretentious movie, an attempt at a political message by people who obviously don't have a very good grasp of the subject on which they want to lecture the world. Instead of the directors who did the excellent first Matrix movie, I got the ones who did the two final lame installments in that series. My bad luck.",2,1,8,30 March 2006
