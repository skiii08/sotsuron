The Avengers," The perfect summer block buster.
","Okay, first off....If you are expecting to see an Oscar nominated artsy film....you are in the wrong theater.If you want so see a great action 'summer blockbuster' movie....Then go see the Avengers.After reading some of the negative reviews here I am left baffled. I wonder if these reviewers were hoping to see some deep and anguish laden heart wrenching drama. This is a movie about a group of superheroes and for what it is, it was very well made. It was funny, full of great action sequences and tons of top notch CGI and stunts. Every thing that a movie of this genre should have.If you feel like have 2.5 hours of fun and some serious escapism...GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! If you want to see a movie that will tug at you heart strings and leave wondering about the injustices of life....go see another movie.",10,3,8,8 May 2012
Man of Steel," A good but flawed production.
","I am old enough that I must admit that I have seen every single Superman film ever made. I am fond of of the Donner original, but it was far from perfect. The sequels to that one rather forgettable to be sure. The Bryan Singer attempt was not great, but okay. It was somewhat dull and Brandon Routh was not the best choice to play Supes.In the order of full disclosure, I will admit to not being a huge Zach Snyder fan. This film did suffer some of his shortcomings. His vision of Krypton was wonderful and very refreshing. The way he introduced Clark to Lois was probably the best version that anyone has thought of. The action sequences are second to none. The actors chosen were well selected for their respective parts. But the film was a bit over the top with all the destruction of a city and dozens upon dozens of buildings. My biggest issue was the pacing and editing. The film was slow at times and I found myself being...oddly enough...bored. There were a few pivotal scenes that were interrupted with pointless ones so that the rhythm was thrown off.Overall I give it a 7/10...worth a viewing, but it could have been better.",7,1,2,19 June 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A solid and well made film, but....
","Going into it I was not sure what this film would do to match the last installment. I had my concerns and while I thought that the movie was a very solid film, I walked away confused. On one hand I thought that the movie was very well constructed and and visually very pleasing. But I cannot say that I 'enjoyed' it. It was just too dark and depressing and devoid of any form of joy. That said I am glad I saw it but due to it's length and extremely brooding nature, I will not see it again in the theater. I know that the fanboys will disagree, but I can only say what I have experienced...after walking out of the theater, myself and my group of buds were all silent. nobody wanted to discuss the film, rather we all agreed that it was good but it left us all feeling a little down.Would I recommend this movie? If you are a fan of the first 2...then yes. But I would be remiss if I did not warn about the excessive darkness of this movie.",7,4,8,29 July 2012
