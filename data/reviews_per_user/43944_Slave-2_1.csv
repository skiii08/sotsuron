The Blair Witch Project," Realism is the key
",The first thing that struck me about this film was the format. It's not in cinemascope but looks just like a home video. This in turn sets the tone for the rest of the film which is completely shot in a 'real' sense. Both the dialogue and the acting were far more natural than I'm used to in the cinema and as a result it seemed a bit strange at first. The advantage of this is that once over this initial hurdle the natural nature makes everything so very believable. This is a film about building suspense and manages to do just that right from start to end while managing to keep everything going at a reasonable pace.Overall I would definitely recommend this film to anybody in the mood for something different and very involving.,Null,0,0,15 October 1999
