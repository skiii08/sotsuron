It," Highly overrated
","I honestly didn't even remotely feel any type of chill, fear, anxiety or anything during the entire movie.The story seemed terrible to me. And the movie wasn't even remotely scary. Maybe i should have read the books to figure out what was happening, but as someone who just saw this movie alone, this was a terrible scary movie.",3,0,0,12 January 2018
