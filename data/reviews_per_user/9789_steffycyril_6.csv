Airlift," review
","Airlift is one of the must watch movies.First of all it is a true incident.There are a lot of survivors helped by him and many people who are thankful for him. Many characters are appropriate and some scenes are admirable.I feel there should be more films in this genre. The heroine also is very wonderful.As the plot thickens,their love and care increases.The songs are much needed and important in the movie. It will inspire us to do something for the nation.The way he handles the situation is also good. The scenery is also depicted and things of that era are bought up wonderfully.The love for the baby is also bought here.The dialogues of heroine act to the humour.",9,1,2,31 August 2016
Tangled," enchanting creation
","The movie is the oldest one u heard when u were small.It has been created several times but maybe this the best. There is innocence ,cruelty and planning in every way.The best character is that of a horse who is the best friend of both leads. The animations are great and so are the voices.I love Walt Disney and watch most of their films.Like all said ,i also was born by hearing this name. It is funny and the best song is 'i have a dream song'.I also like the visuals of the castle and the way she tell that her hair can shine in the dark. There is also an element of suspense but not intensified as we know what the end will be.",8,2,2,2 September 2016
Frozen," never ending fun
","Walt Disney have always done their best to keep up in each movie and do not disappoint us.The film questions on the very relation formed instantly and one that takes time. The elder sister is a funny girl but overprotective towards her kingdome and parents.The courage she takes to help the sister Elsa make snowman is admirable. Elsa on the contrary is a lady with the dreams of finding a perfect man in her life.I mean,everyone does have the dream to find the prince charming but this became in built in her more because she was craving for someone to remove her loneliness.This is how life goes. Sometimes wrong persons come on wrong time.But we should have the confidence to realise and correct it. Such is the turn of life.....",8,3,8,1 September 2016
Sultan," review
",The plot is very interesting. Salman films always have a glamour and the heroines are always in good forms compared to others.Even though it was not like 'prem ratan' it did provide the viewers entertainment till the end. Hats off to Salman.I have always watched movies having sexy scenes but i was late to recognise the way he always is.When he was busy with d case even a non fan like me was disappointed. But later i came to know that his films always get better.Anushka was seen in a diff. avatar other than the bikini costume.The conversations were punchy and emotional. The songs are very much needed in the film and hit.,6,0,0,31 August 2016
Uri: The Surgical Strike," A perfect movie for patriotists!!!
","This movie revolves around the surgical strikes that happened in a surgical attack at Uri.This movie is for families who are in army or related to army in any sense.Only they can have the feelings in this movie and i must say its captured beautifully.Added to this factor is the musical background which has suspense in it.
All the characters have shown the army behaviour and tricks in a stunning manner.",6,0,0,2 May 2019
The Croods," review
","Even though the characters are from movies,they are wonderful to watch.Many of this genre that i have watched have not been read before and don't want to. The plot is a small story where a family is moving together to a safer place to survive.If i want to explain each characters: Fathers always want their children to be at their side.The attempt that he makes on the counts is funny. As soon as a lover comes,it seems amazing to do anything than being said or done by any other person.The changes is bought in a subtle way and shown in a cute manner. She thrives to do things without hesitation as that of 'BRAVE'.The plot is interesting till the end.",8,0,1,1 September 2016
