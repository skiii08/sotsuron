Come and See," Unforgettable Film
","I have seen many, many war movies throughout my life time, but this film has got to be the one that will remain in my memory forever. As I was watching 'Come and See,' I felt like a character in the movie. It was like I could smell the fires and explosions that were occurring non-stop throughout the film. This has got to be one of the most powerful movies ever made. It also is one of the most horrific coming of age movies ever. I imagine that individuals who are pro-war would also be very affected by this film. In the beginning Floyra, the protagonist in the film, starts off by trying to find a weapon which obviously shows his love and desire to be in war; however, towards the end of the film, after he has experiencing all the hardships that comes as a result, his desire to be in war is no longer evident. We, as an audience, end up having the same feeling as Floyra towards the end. The audience is rendered much like Floyra that we watch with pleasure as Floyra symbolically destroys a picture of Hitler. I like that Klimov's style of shooting in the movie allows for the actors to look directly at the camera, as if the viewers are part of the movie. Klimov does an amazing job of showing us the story through the eyes of the characters. I was astonished by the acting in this film. I have never seen such marvelous acting. This helped drive the film forward. Although this movie may be brutal and too much content for some viewers, i still recommend seeing it. The brutality is there to show us what war is truly like. This movie must be watched. It is a masterpiece.",8,1,1,7 June 2010
