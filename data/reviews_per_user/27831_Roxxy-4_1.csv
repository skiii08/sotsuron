The Blair Witch Project," Beating Hollywood at it's own game.
","First off, I had been anticipating this movie for a year now. A friend of mine conversed/es with Sanchez via e-mail and sent us a bunch of insider info. I was not disappointed when I saw the movie. I just loved the fact that these two men had a pure dream and turned it into a wonderful reality. Forget the special effects, you want that, go see The Haunting. They don't get lazy and let the effects tell you the story, the let your mind run away with itself. I'm guessing the main reason why some of the people that don't like it expected way too much from a low budget film. If you have a creative mind and want to be led by your imagination to see what will happen next, this is your movie. But remember, this is a low budget film, so you may get dizzy.",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
