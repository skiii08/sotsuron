The Blair Witch Project," at the end...
","At the end of the film in the house, Heather sounds as though she is screaming in the basement, she had been filming on the b/w camera and mike is shown through his colour camera as already being down there. Is the final b/w shot that pans slowly down the stairs and picks up Heathers screaming being shot by something else? Or is it that her and Mike have some how swapped cameras or the sound mix is just a little out? Either way this makes you think how weird and freaky the ending actually is, I've seen this movie a few times and I always pick up on something new, tonight it was this - maybe whatever has been following them is now filming them too on Heather's camera.",7,0,1,30 October 2006
