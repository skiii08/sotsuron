Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Over-rated comedy, Bored through much of the film.
","Let me start off by saying I didn't have a problem with the racial jokes, nor did I have a problem with the jokes against USA or any other nationalities this movie joked about. To me this movie was boring... I laughed at a few scenes here and there but none of the scenes were as funny as many people claim. Sasha did a very good job in convincing me that he is the character and that is how the character is. But the movie itself wasn't very funny.Most of the complaints I hear about is how outrageous and gross the movie is... or that it is offensive to so many nationalities and races. I had no problems with the satire in the film, that is to say I wasn't offended or disgusted, I just did not find them funny, and I watched this with a few other people, and they all agreed that it was over-rated.I gave it a four because there were some funny scenes, and the character was genuine. The reactions from the people in the film (none of whom were actors which is why some of the scenes were humorous) is what made me watch the whole movie... other than that I would not recommend this movie.",4,3,6,16 January 2007
Batman Begins," Surprisingly good
","This movie was quite surprising, i expected a lame movie, but it was quite good. The story was interesting and playing out very well. The main complaint about the movie is that the fight scenes were not very good. Aside for a few sword fighting scenes, the hand to hand combat was basically the camera movie quickly not showing the actual hits. But even with this, the action was still good, and the acting was very good. I expected the movie to be pretty boring, especially since, by watching the trailers, there really isn't a popular villain like the previous batman movies, this in no way takes away from the quality of the movie. Overall i would give it a 7.5 but that option doesn't exist. So if you are expecting a boring movie you will be pleasantly surprised, and i diffinently recommend this movie.",8,5,8,16 June 2005
