The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Exactly as I've seen it between the lines...
","I always thought I am among the fans of Meyer's book rather then the Saga movies. I have been thinking this way till today... My opinion has been changed by the director that made a huge job to vitalize the final book of the Saga. Of course, the movie doesn't reflect it in details, but there is no need in it. More precise conformity with the author would kill the film. Actually, the movie is a more reality-like version of the book then I could imagine. I was smiling while reading in previous reviews: 'Bella looked terrible' and 'the scene of Renesme's delivery was horrible' ... Only innocent or very young people that have never gave a birth or seen the act of delivery could write those words. Bella was lucky because it was horrible and very quick. Not many woman can consider themselves lucky cause in reality it IS horrible and VERY VERY long...and you have no fashion-magazine-cover-look at that moment.))",10,6,18,20 November 2011
