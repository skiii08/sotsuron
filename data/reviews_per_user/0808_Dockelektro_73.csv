The Mask," Good taste and originality make this kiddy tale a winner
","A must for all people between 10 and 14 years, the mask is the ultimate story of the dream come true. But although this movie could have been buried in a shallow and not so interesting story, this one manages to stand out from the rest. Why? First of all, when I saw this one I thought that I was seeing something new. The main title is dazzling, with Randy Edelman's rousing music score (I would give anything to have the cd) filling our ears, and a heavenly theme accompanying the mask in its ascent to the surface. Edge city is a crime-filled place, but manages to be a beautiful sight. Cameron Diaz is a revelation. The humor is out of this world. And when I saw this one as a kid I wished to have that power to be whoever I wanted to. Jim Carrey has in Stanley Ipkiss an even better role than Truman Burbank. The same goes to Cameron Diaz, who is the perfect bombshell. The CGI is also jaw-dropping and eye-popping (literally). I loved all those little touches that made this movie a great ride. And I would love to have that movie score, Randy Edelman: please release a cd!!! A question, however: what the hell happened to the sequel? Cartoon Network was having a contest and the prize was seeing the shooting of 'The Mask 2', but many years later, not a sequel in sight... why does this happen? I really think a sequel to this movie would be great.",8,0,0,11 July 2001
The Ring," Creepy, even if flawed
","Coming at the end as no more than good Friday night fare, 'The Ring' is, even so, a scary movie. Since we can't talk about originality (this is a remake), our attention focuses on the way the concept is handled. As a horror movie, it has a great idea to watch: a cursed tape, which kills anyone who sees it in seven days. Naomi Watts comes across the tape, and the story unfolds, revealing finally that such original concept wouldn't survive for long. Soon, the formula comes roaring, and you'll start to see some clich√©s (face it - ever since 'Shining' we have seen endless times a creepy girl with a covered-up face that says 'you're gonna die' or something like that). Even so, it manages to twist a little and to get some surprises. I was glad to see that they didn't repeat the 'screeching orchestra' gag too many times, which is always nerve-challenging. It's basically a classy horror movie, that doesn't extend on the gore and the guts, and wisely relies on the unseen to help us take it seriously.",7,0,0,11 June 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," wow!
","This was one of those movies I thought for a long time I wouldn't like but I instantly ended loving. Inventing the concept of 'roller-coaster ride', the movie is a constant journey through the means of the never-seen. I can only say thank heavens that Lucas and Spielberg didn't reformulate the Bond adventures and came up with this one instead. Because the movie is a fantastic ride, and never lets you stop for a second, quickly becoming attached to your memory with its great one-liners, its trademark soundtrack, its lead characters and its new concept of a globe-trotting adventure. Highly recommended action fest, the movie should be seen by everyone who still has a kid's heart inside. Marvelous fare, and a huge victory. One of the best products to ever come out of the Lucas - Spielberg friendship.",10,0,0,24 September 2001
Casablanca," Now I finally know why this one is one of the best
","Probably the most legendary movie of all time, I finally got to see it, it was a great hole in my movie-viewing history. And finally I got to understand why a classic movie like this has made its mark in history. The intricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot of the second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity to reach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficient to give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this is probably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best ever made in the past, present and future.",10,3,3,17 March 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," We'll never see one of these again
","The only really good movie to mix live actors and cartoons, this isn't just a cracking good story of corruption in the heart of a supposed dream-world, but it also pays an hommage to decades of animation. Mixing cartoons never seen before together (the duel between Donald and Daffy remains an absolute classic to be rewound and seen again forever and ever), the movie must have made a handful of animators of both Disney and Warner Brothers jerk a few tears, as the biggest stars of american animation of the forty's appear on screen and receive a human treatment. This really fantastic point of view is the reason I scored it a 9: the film dreams out loud, and allows us to picture a situation: what if the toons were actors, who have feelings, emotions and problems just like regular people? In the centre of this question is the show-stealer Roger Rabbit, who emerges as one of the most engaging animation characters created. But the real treat is seeing Bob Hoskins, who, accomplishing something never before seen, shares most of his screen time with a character which doesn't exist except on post-production. The movie turns out an incredible journey, far beyond the regular fare of animation movies, it will please all audiences. A victory of director Robert Zemeckis and everyone involved, this picture is an example of movie magic at work.",9,2,2,22 August 2001
Minority Report," Whodunits don't get better than this
","This could be a showcase of money and big names - just think of it: Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg working together at last. But this movie is much more than that. Set in a future Washington (the designs are awesome and don't exaggerate the future conceptions too much that they become unrealistic), John Anderton is the chief of the pre-crime department, which relies on the crime premotions of its three gifted beings (the precognitives) to arrest the murders before they commit murder. To John, the system is perfect, until the next killer is him. Completely unpredictable and surprising until the very end, this is a high quality movie that fortunately doesn't rely on the designs or its renowned two stars - actor and director - to be successful. What it does indeed is reviving the whodunit classic movies (North by Northwest and The Maltese Falcon are influences) with a futuristic twist. The result is nothing short of spectacular - exciting, visionary and gripping, this is Steven Spielberg at its best, which proves that age isn't affecting his talent a bit. Aided by a magnificent script and the charisma of Tom Cruise, the movie ends up being everything you want when you go and see a movie. Saying it is satisfying is underestimating it.",10,0,0,4 October 2002
Se7en," one of the best ever
","** WARNING SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**All-original serial killer movie with so much twists as a rollercoaster ride, the most remarkable thing about of this movie is being an absolute work of genius from such a young and unexperienced director. Using all the old formulas, using all the old paces, using all the old actor's tecniques, the movie reinvents a world of cinema, and establishes an example. John Mills, a young homicide detective, is a newcomer to the city where the veteran Williams Somerset has worked for years. Mills is retiring, and he will be substitued by Mills. Somerset agrees with Mills sticking around him for a week, seven days, during which he will supposedly give some tips of the trade to the Mills. Turns out, this week is also the week when a scarily methodical serial killer purges his obsession. As Mills and Somerset investigate the death of a titanically obese man, everything leads to the conclusion that it was a homicide. When a famous lawyer is killed and the word 'Greed' is written with his blood, they fear the worst. When they find the word 'Gluttony' written with grease at the obese man's death site, the worst is confirmed: there is a killer which acts according to the seven deadly sins. This will be the ultimate test to both an experienced man and a rookie youngster. And they will find out that everything they think they can foresee is actually wrong. They will find out that the man they are following is actually controlling them. Making history, the movie relies on quasi-expressionist ways to transmit an entire mood: the weather never changing, contributing to a depressed view of a depressing world. The violence comes never from actions, but from the pictures, the shots are almost fixed, the time is never rushed, and the movie never gives up on itself, constructing, inventing, inovating, thrilling and scaring. This is not a light-hearted experience. This is an experience in the whole sense of the word. This movie is an unique oeuvre, and will stand the test of time by the way it is inimitable. A test of a director's talent, and a true cult movie which demands multiple viewings.",10,0,0,4 October 2001
Fight Club," Mischief. Mayhem. Masterpiece.
","Being definitely the best movie of 1999, it is impossible to discover the reason of why this movie received so few awards. When I look at the awards page of 'Fight Club', what do I see? That the movie won OFCS awards for best DVD and best DVD awards. Well, I thought that opinions are not to be discussed, but I got to say this one: SHAME ON YOU!!! This movie is one of the best in movie history, I have no doubt, and I can start figuring a why to explain its overlooking by the academy awards and others: it is a violent slap in the face of all the people who think they are safe in their monochordic lives, their credit cards, their stable jobs and their month paychecks, which are used for owning things 'which end up owning ourselves'. The philosophy of the movie is brutal, and never before seen in a movie made in USA grounds. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt turn out establishing themselves as two of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen, and David Fincher leaves us drooling for his next feature. This movie will stagger even the most coldly hearted, as it depicts the life of a character whose name we don't know (not until the end, that is), who we know just by the name of 'Jack', and who lives a more than normal live: shirts, kakis, ties, a desk job, a nice paycheck and his nights spent decorating his house and seeing the tv-shopping. Jack has a problem: he can't sleep. He will find the cure for this problem, but he will also find lots of other things. I can guarantee it, you have never seen anything like this movie, and never miss out the first 30 minutes, which have a frenetic rhythm to go with Jack's first-person point of view of his life before his problems. I thought that 'Se7en' was one of my favorite movies. It still is, but it isn't alone. The fact that both movies come from the same director, it means a lot - it means that David Fincher is a powerhouse director who has a lot to give, and from who we may expect great and landmark-ish things from the future. I take my hats off to the whole team: Pitt and Norton are stand-outs, the script is the whole asset of the movie (Chuck Palahniuk's novel (from which the movie is inspired) is a smacking good piece of literature), the Dust Brothers' electronic score is a record to own, Helena Bonham Carter's Marla is as perfect as she could possibly be, the photography, the sound and the editing just make your jaw drop. Never miss out this one, and if you have a DVD player, enjoy even more the experience in a finely-crafted package - at least it won awards for that! One of those movies I would have given an 11. No less.",10,3,9,30 September 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Arrrrrr!
","Great to see that careful planning, structuring and audience studying pay off sometimes. The audience can at times be a strange beast, and can sink pictures in the same turf where others have been glorified. But Disney couldn't allow this movie to suffer the fate of Roman Polanski's 'Pirates' or 'Cutthroat Island'. First major rule: stick to what you know, and always trust the school of Hollywood -  thus, create a buddy-buddy formula, add the love interest, and then create a baddie, or even better, an army of baddies to go chase the heroes. The cornerstones of the typical american blockbuster are all right there, splattered on the screen, just pick them out. Second major rule: give the audience the very thing they're looking for when in the movies - exactly those things that they're not expecting. So assume the pirate theme and adapt it to the 21st century - and then come the bombastic the special effects. These two rules are usually gold, and when you tackle a movie genre that hasn't been touched for almost ten years, it isn't difficult to give people what they want to see. But this apparent ease of thought would trap Disney, so thank God for brilliant ideas - and one brilliant actor. Johnny Depp steals the show right from his unforgettable entrance, and never thinks of allowing some space for other things to provide comic relief. And neither do the filmmakers, and the public. As Jack Sparrow, the gallery of Depp-ish weirdness is complete with a full-on, iconic buckaneer, brilliantly crossing pirate stereotype with pop culture in a performance of rare dedication and method for a summer blockbuster. The result is the most memorable character of the picture, and also the entire blockbuster season. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' could be in many ways another flop, but the producers made this movie by studying everything that made the others sink to the bottom. And also did Jerry Bruckheimer, whose 'Pearl Harbor' left more bitterness in his mouth than memories in the entire audience. A refined sense of style, bombastic CGI skelletons and a script that only feels muddled when it seeks help in some of the chapters of the 'Hollywood book of screenwriting', make this a winner, and one of the best popcorn-munchers of the year. Expect Peter Weir's / Russell Crowe's 'Master and Commander', expect 'Pirates of the Caribbean 2', and most probably seafaring adventures are back into the silver screen. Ahoy!",8,1,2,9 September 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Incredible
","Nothing you have seen prepares you for this ride: if you have religious beliefs, if you belong to some ethnical minority, if you are just plain idiot or if you are just a human being, don't see this, for its mix of satire and gags, born in the heart of the series from which it was made, is the ultimate nerve-test. Offensive, soft-pornographic, ridiculously funny, and funnily ridiculous, this movie marks the ultimate ceiling in the world of hardcore comedy. But South Park has a section for itself, and this makes this movie a must-see in all aspects. A hit for everyone who's willing to accept it with a smile. My favorite is the relationship between Satan and Saddam Hussein: genius! the musical bits (and the satire to musical bits in movies) give it a fresh look and prevent the viewer from seeing a hour-and-a-half-long episode. A great movie, with a sense of humor which nothing else has, and original-to-the-end gags and lines.And for every kid who puts the 'cute' main characters in their Nokias or their wallpapers: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS - WATCH IT WHEN YOU'RE 18.",7,2,2,8 August 2001
Spider-Man 2," Fanfare for a common man
","It's back, and it promised razzle-dazzle galore and a tremendous amount of ass-kicking to go with it. The question, however, lied in if they would be able to equal the first one's uniqueness. They should, they created it, but the Wachowskis failed and they were masters and commanders of their creation. Good to know that, for the first time in years, the sequel beats its own predecessor. The bar was raised very high, the responsibility was huge. But with great responsibility, as the movie still says, comes also great power. And such power comes not from the jaw dropping set-pieces or the superior CGI. It breathes from its script, teaching a Jacksonesque lesson to Hollywood studios that movies can't rely in effects to amaze its audiences. They got to have a huge heart, and bathe everyone who sees it in its glow and its magic. To succeed, you gotta have great actors, and, most of all, great stories. And the way this story rages through the screen is unbelievable, all centered in one man: Peter Parker, a simple guy that, like many people of his age, goes through changes and personal conflict. That and a spider costume. We can be watching a CGI-filled scene with heavy explosions and hyperkinetic action, but we never forget that behind the mask is a human character, who suffers due to the incredible powers he has been given. And boy, does he suffer. Rarely a leading character was so put to the test in a Hollywood blockbuster. And I'm not talking about Doctor Octopus' fightback capabilities (which make him one of the toughest movie villains of recent memory). I'm talking about the way the way Parker, the man, dives to hell and comes back. And this is what really puts 'Spider Man 2' among the best of the year: it is a haunting tale of fall and ascension of a simple guy who is trapped in many of life's webs, the story of the person beneath the layer. And such situation has its high point in a sublime sequence, after the showdown in the elevated subway (won't give it away). Of course, all the things that surround it are essential to the glorious sights presented here: it is still a joy to see Spidey flying among the skyscrapers to the powerful choirs of Danny Elfman's score. But after that you can always count on an having an even more powerful dialogue scene which could be taken from a melodrama. The movie's ending, unlike the first one, is such a punch for such an experience that it leaves you craving for the third picture. Superior fare, an unexpected move from Hollywood, that has learned much with the 'Rings' trilogy, specially that the audience is getting more and more demanding these days, and the bar is always rising...",9,0,0,16 July 2004
The Fifth Element," A paradygmatic movie
","This is one of the films of my life. For everything. Maybe it's because of those dreamy visuals of the 22nd century, maybe it's because of the way Besson sees it, maybe it's because of the way Eric Serra gives it music, maybe it's because of Milla's smile, maybe it's because of its harmonial mix between action, comedy and drama. Maybe it's because of all those things combined. I just know that we can't situate this movie in any genre, since I don't see it as a science fiction movie, or a drama or a comedy, a bit like 'The Big Blue', a bit like 'Leon'. Certainly (i'm sure) an epic movie in all the meaning of the word. I loved every minute and when I become a movie director, Besson will be my guiding light, since he sees things like I like to see them: BIG. Every shot of this movie is measured epically. I loved it, no matter what, Jovovich, Willis, Tucker, Holm, Oldman, they all have talent to spare, and once more, you, Luc, if you read this, I want you to know you already are an inspiration. Congratulations, this movie is worth every penny spent in it, and every drop of sweat shed. I could watch it once a day and not get tired.",10,0,1,24 March 2000
Batman Returns," Getting on with the concept
","After the smash hit of the first one, the sequel was inevitable. And maybe it was a necessity of director Tim Burton, but this one takes much of the juice the characters of the first movie had and bets more on the pure sensation and feeling of awe. The point is: this movie has much more action and special effects, thus taking some of the wonder of the first movie, which I don't see as an action film. Even so, this movie is beautiful: the sets are astonishing (as we were used to), Penguin's character is one of the meanest villains in the history of comic-book adaptations, Catwoman is one of the sexier (miles away from Poison Ivy's foolishness, and some moments are genius (the penguins taking The Penguin to his underwater grave, 'Meeow' and the bomb explodes in the first showdown between the three protagonists, etc). The score is also a must, a much more spectacular version of the music from the first movie, and a much more produced one. A cool action picture altogether, much more spectacular, but not so deep and a little more violent.",Null,0,0,16 June 2001
Finding Nemo," Just right as rain...
","God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their 'secret'. No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. 'Finding Nemo' is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best.",10,3,5,6 December 2003
Troy," Clean fun with flaws
","Ok, this story had to be adapted. It was far too epic and super-sized to remain in Homer's pages. To do it, of course they would have to get all the best money can buy, and the results when you see it are as expected: massive sequences, massive sets, amazing sights, amazing visions. But 'Troy' falls a bit flat specially because of the way the source material had to be juggled in order to adapt itself for a two-and-a-half-hour movie. So, apparently, the gods are dropped in favor of a much more militaristic, 'gladiatoresque' approach - in the original tale, men fought alongside the gods, which were pivotal to the battle events. Here, men fight for honor, for their homelands, for greed, for courage, for love, but are never aided by some sort of divinity. This makes 'Troy' little more than an extended battle scene, divided into several set pieces, some amazing (the fight between Aquilles and Hector is an eye-opener), some a already-seen (those rings movies already defined and claimed the massive battle shots we witness here). Of course, as an epic of gigantic proportions it certainly achieves - the shot of a thousand ships sailing to troy is unforgettable. But even if Brad Pitt transpires charisma, and Eric Bana provides a much-needed nobility, this enterprise sounds like little more than Hollywood dollars to the service of popcorn entertainment. Not deep, only fun.",7,1,2,3 June 2004
Home Alone," Good christmas flick
","I got tired of this movie because of two things:
1. Every christmas night they aired this one on TV2. In my junior high's library, there always kids watching this movie every afternoon.
This, united with the fact that I also saw this one several times as a kid, made me reach a level of saturation which makes me almost puke. But that's just me, because this is a really good christmas movie, with all those lights, candles, santas and the inevitable reference to 'It's a Wonderful World'. The music is, of course, top-notch, showing that John Williams has a sensibility far beyond the normal standards. I think I will see this one in a couple of years, and will like very much. Right now, I'm still tired...",Null,0,0,26 July 2001
The Beach," Cult movie potential
","Like the many times referenced 'Apocalypse Now', this one could really reach the status of cult movie among the nature lovers and hippy heirs. The movie its all the perfect spots during the first half. The beach, the people, the rhythm, the actors, the music... all is stunning. They even sing Bob Marley by the fire. But the film's second half is strange, erratic, scattered, it leaves the awe-inspiring journey sense and centers in a strange and sudden 'mood' by DiCaprio's Richard. This is where the letdown is fully, although the ending doesn't feel disappointing. As for the cult movie potential, I think the next generations must judge it, but it has a great deal of bitterness to it and if two years later the film isn't a 'word of mouth' phenomenon, maybe it won't have such a cult afterall. Anyway, I thought it was a great work by the scottish team of 'Trainspotting', the script is an asset, and I say it again, DiCaprio is not just a pretty face. Recomend it to all people from 18 up. Live it and think about it. I sure liked it anyway...",8,8,11,1 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Return of the Old Feel
","SPOILERS AHEADWell, saw it finally. What can I say? 'Attack of the Clones' is an almost automatic reflex by George Lucas of the overwhelming problems of 'The Phantom Menace'. In that movie, the possibility of making anything happen surpassed the movie itself and in the end the movie was just a parade of special effects that, as fantasticaly crafted as they can be, only helped the poor script to look fluffy. Here, the wish to make a CGI reality come to life is much more soft. But there are many things that they could have avoided (Obi Wan's reception on Kamino and the conversation with their leader is too CGIed). Effects, however aren't the thing that threaten's the film's performance. Here the trouble lies on an opposite side: the love story. Hayden is great as a Jedi in action, and him and Obi Wan have cool scenes together. But when it comes to show his feelings for Padm√©, it all sounded too damn fake, and, although Natalie Portman tries to do the best she can, she can't make up for the arthrysis in those intimate scenes, that should be treated with more sensibility. I can fairly say that, even though that this is a starting relationship, they will have to be much more believable in Episode III. The rest of the movie, however, works as a fantastic ride. It's a Star Wars fan dream: Jedis kicking ass in huge numbers, force powers galore, Jar Jar out of the plot (but important in a crucial point in the film) and Yoda finally showing why he the greatest. Christopher Lee also makes a great Jedi-turned-evil. Mace Windu could have more screen time. The sights and sounds have a mixed quality: even though some computer generated images and sound design are beautifully made, some others show some lack of perfectionism (the clone army is entirely computer-generated - even in close-ups, and sometimes we feel like we are watching the Final Fantasy movie; some sounds of speeders, ships, etc, sound exactly like the podracing machines of The Phantom Menace). John Williams score is vivid and inventive, the highlight being undoubtedly the love theme, the lowlight being that cartoonish interruption of that same theme when Padm√© refuses that kiss by the lake.Basically, this movie shows that there is a lot of potential to be drawn from the basic structure that makes a Star Wars movie, but that the technological achievements can't surpass the very movie that is being made (one feels relieved to finally see a crowded scene where the people are NOT computer generated - the bar scene). This movie ends up being an amendment to the errors of The Phantom Menace, even though it falls into the same traps again (the use of CGI creatures should be more modest and be used only to compose the cities and landscapes, one can tell why in some animations and close-ups). The fans won't be disappointed, the remaining viewers will only like if they have the slightest idea what all the entire saga is all about. Basically, a movie that can be appreciated as a single one, but that really should only be scrutinized as part of a whole. May the Force Be With You, makers of Episode III - this story needs a kickass ending.",8,0,1,18 May 2002
Romeo + Juliet," An incredible journey of love till death
","In the day this one premiered I as in vacation and had nothing to do. I thought it might be cool so I gave it a try. And the way I felt when I came out was something spectacular. I was still mesmerized by the whole experience, the incredible sets of Verona Beach striking me the most. I got stunned by the power of the actors, the music (one of the best soundtracks of the year), the editing and the direction. I left the theatre with my mouth open and went home thinking a lot about it. I saw it again. And again. I went three times to the cinema to see it. And three years ago, I had a wish of experiencing everything the world of Verona Beach and its two star-crossed lovers had to give: fireworks, lights, coreographed gun fights that look more like ballet dances. This movie influenced me like few movies have. Since then, I remember wishing that someday I took part on the creation of such a world. Now, I have good memories of this movie, and still feel the influence it made on me. But the effect was lost on video. And the really good memory comes from the time I saw it on the theatre. But all isn't lost. The day the DVD arrives to our shores, I know I will experience all the same again... Romeo + Juliet is one of the best movies of the decade, and director Luhrmann is a good hope to the future of sharp movies. I gave it a 8 out of 10, just because of a few flaws in the end, but not to like this movie at all is definitely a crime. Bravo!",8,1,3,24 November 2000
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Overwhelming
","Strikingly beautiful, the movie delivers even if you see without any sound. Surprisingly simple (only a few scenes, most of the movie is made of close-ups and shot indoors) it has nevertheless the characteristic that elevates a director to the height of myth. And here the screaming yet peaceful expression of Maria Falconetti is pivotal - she conveys all the emotions that the viewer feels, and therefore nearly expenses the need of other characters in the picture. Magnificently shot, amazingly acted, this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, that has the power to make you really develop feelings towards it. Unmissable.",10,2,4,16 October 2002
L√©on: The Professional," This movie changed my life
","I have written a comment to almost every movie of Luc Besson, and every time I confronted myself with the opportunity of writing a comment to this one... I didn't have the courage. Because, from all I have to say about this movie, I don't know where to start. My encounter with this movie was, like many love stories, occasional. It aired in the public television one night, and I had anything better to do. It grabbed me and never stopped amazing me until now. Here started my interest in Luc Besson's career and work, and in Eric Serra's music. Today, after having seen it for maybe the 20th time, I am still an unconditional fan of the sheer experience that this movie is.Maybe the most universally acclaimed movie from Luc Besson, its premiere was surrounded with scepticism: the last movie of the director was almost 4 years ago, and it was an underwater documentary many people dismissed. Even so, people still remembered the hit that was La Femme Nikita (1990), and how it made the hearts beat. So, they decided to try this one. The success was out of this world, putting it right next to all his other movies all of fame, and making it his third most watched movie (remember this was before the Taxi movies and The Fifth Element). All I can say is that this success was not casual.L√©on is by far Luc Besson's finest crafted movie. The means were not too big (which could make the artistic movie to slip) and the actors were not celebrities (which could link their faces to a certain established image). The result was a freedom of speech which let Besson film it the way he wanted to, using wild camera angles, lenses and editing. All this gave the movie a totally new look, which separated it from all the other action movies. But the way of filming it wasn't the only novelty and distinctiveness here.This a movie about love. This is a movie about an impossible world and the possible relationships in it. This is a movie about injustice, and the way things have to evolve. And above all, this is a movie about two characters who find that there is something more about the world than just death and violence. L√©on, under his rigid appearance, has a heart of gold. Mathilda, under her minor age, is a force of nature. And this will give L√©on 'a taste for life', and making him think that maybe there is more to it than just living like a hitman. Their fates will be unpredictable. Only them, with only their will to help them, can make it. This movie is thoroughly human, and gives us a new point of view of the concept of people on screen. Luc Besson's camera angles and shots (all those close-ups on Mathilda's face) have the power to reveal the true characters and their weaknesses. 'L√©on' has a special strength in stablishing a new way to reveal the depth of characters, and, like I said, no movie I saw made this again.The casting of this movie is out of this world. L√©on, played by Jean Reno, is the perfect choice: cool and straight but sensible and deep, he is the depiction of innocence, of the people who do what they have to, even if they don't want to do it. Mathilda, played by the overwhelming revelation of Natalie Portman, is a standout in all the other child roles in the history of movies. She takes the screen with a flash, and grabs the viewer. Pure spectacle, in a 12-year-old form. Gary Oldman, in the role of Norman Stansfield, gives 'evil' a new meaning, as he depicts someone who manages to be on all edges: mental, moral, and physical. Even though these characters are never on screen at the same time, and meet separately only one, they form a triangle which makes us think by all the three. And the perfomance is incredible, altogether.Although this one was filmed in New York, using some American actors, I never seen such a European look to an American film. And the thing that struck me the most was that in the DVD the film is dubbed in French, and the voice-overs are perfect, making the film perfectly watchable. Fact is, let's be straight, no American director could make this movie like this. We have camera angles that strike us in the face. We have wide lenses that take us to another world. And we have a form of editing like anything the world has ever seen. This gives a look like no other American movies do. That's what I like about it: this movie is European, and breathes a style only the European originality has. This makes me proud.It is very clear that this movie marked my life. When I filled the papers to enroll myself at film school, I put this movie as one of the movies that influenced me. And this wasn't casual. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, no questions asked, and it is sitting on the top of my list of Besson, right next to 'The Big Blue', and 'The Fifth Element'. I could write much more about it, but I'm afraid the limit is 1000 words, and I don't want to have my speech cut off.If you haven't seen this movie, see it now, it is absolutely unmissable, and one of the best movies of the decade.",10,2,4,17 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The birth of a new era
","And, thus, it happened. Deemed 'unfilmable' by Stanley Kubrick himself, the trilogy of probably the most powerful non-mythological mythology, came to the screen, spawned by probably the most unlikely crew: a bunch of new zealand-born people who eventually put the world at their feet. Announced as a three-installment saga, filmed back-to-back, this movie came to announce that such a beloved story was in good hands and, even better, that the best was yet to come. Because, after seeing 'The Two Towers' and before seeing 'Return of the King', this movie still inspires awe and the best thing is to know that the following chapter is so much bigger and fantastic and, as everyone is talking about, that the final one is better than the other two combined. The fact that a collection of three hour epics, filmed at the same time and released with a time window of one year manages to always be considered by many the movie of the year is memorable, and rare, if not a first time. 'Fellowship' was the one that started it all. Considering that most stories have three parts, it is visible that this movie is clearly the first one: as complete and eye-filling as it is, the movie expands little on its vast arc, and it's incredible to see that a three hour movie covers only a segment of the path. But this 'segment' became, on its release, a worlwide phenomenon, as masses of tolkien followers and also people who never heard about the books went to the cinemas and marveled at such an alternate and complex, but also seductive world. The result was New Line and Peter Jackson sighing with relief. It had been too much of a gamble, but it had been worth it. The secret to its success? No secret. Just the pure magic of movies. Here, we are introduced to such a fantastic world, that it almost embodies all the things we read and saw in all the fantasy pictures ever released. One can only surrender to such an amazing and addictive universe. The result is an awe-inspiring experience, one that brings you everything movies have to offer: laughter, scares, joy and tears; great characters, great acting, great directing; unbelievable art direction, never-before-seen CGI and a music score that raises the hair on the back of your neck. A sheer landmark of a movie, so right in everything about it that it feels like it was touched by the very magic it produces.",10,1,2,15 December 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Just a movie after all...
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADWell, and so it ends. One of the most extraordinary movies of the 90's spawned a saga of biblical proportions, with concepts and CGI to feast the eyes in a never-before-seen way. And now, it's all over. What lies on the aftermath?Well, unfortunately, not a life-changing experience. When the whole world saw Neo dodging bullets, when everyone was presented with the notion of reality being just a simulation, when the concept of alternate reality even became part of philosophical studies, the prospect of two further movies was mouth-watering: more action, more flo- mo, and also more mind-bending notions and concepts. Unfortunately, when 'Reloaded' came out, the feeling was a little bit hollow: the concepts and the wonder of the first movie almost disappeared under the weight of the colossal CGI machine. And the ending was non-existent: it would all be concluded in the next and final chapter. But when you finish seeing it, it almost impossible not to think if there won't be mor e movies: the overall feeling was simply - 'I want more explanations'. Because it is sad to see that the Arquitect's speech in 'Reloaded' is more puzzling than all of the spiritual and philosophical questions of 'Revolutions' combined. The problem is simple: the movie that should provide more answers, the movie that should clear us all about everything, is actually a movie that seldomly stops to dwell. This gives way to another bombastic spectacle of special effects, which, among all fireworks, manages not to be as chilling or inventive as the previous feature. And that's the main problem  with 'Revolutions' - a movie that spends most of its time in the 'real' world will never have the enchantment that made us love the 'virtual' world in the first place. It sometimes feels like a crossing between 'Alien3' and 'Mad Max' underground. By the time someone re-enters the Matrix again, you will miss the good old times when it was all about kung fu, expert shooting and a breakneck soundtrack. How much you enjoy this, is much up to you, but as slaving and unforgiving the virtual world of the Matrix is, by the end you will feel the need to get plugged in again.",6,0,0,6 November 2003
He Got Game," The most beautiful sports movie of all time
","We could see just one more story about a man who loves his son, but which suffers from various handicaps, like being on parole and being watched all the time, like having no wife anymore due to killing her, and like his son being one of the most stellar basketball players of his time and this man being truck-loaded with the burden of convincing him to go to college. The film marches to the pace of the two leads, Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) and Jesus Shuttlesworth (real-life NBA player Ray Allen, which makes a startling debut), as they have continuous face-offs: Jesus won't accept that he has a father, and won't listen to him, being more interested in becoming an NBA star, as the managers, the limelights, the fame and the fortune keep calling him like the chant of the sirens. Jesus is a young boy with a foot on each side. And he is facing options, choices he will have to make, and traps he will have to avoid. As a friend of his says (in the movie's most memorable quote) 'How do you spell pussy? H. - I. - V.'. This could be one more tale of choosing between college or fame and fortune, ths could be one more tale of a destroyed father-son relationship, but this is Spike Lee, and the treatment is totally different. It starts with an incredible hommage to basketball, shot like a picture poem, to the sounds of Aaron Copland, whose music flows through the whole movie and makes it look more beautiful and poetic. A characteristic Spike Lee movie, which introduces us to a new way of facing sport dramas. To be cherished.",8,24,38,26 September 2001
Apocalypse Now," Jarring piece of cinema history
","No movie will ever come out like this one. Try as they might, they will never manage to reproduce the way this film feels, looks, sound and even tastes. Because filming during 16 months (that's almost a year and a half) in the Phillipines, during a war in that country, with a director on the verge of suicide and actors on the verge of breakdown will never again be tried by any sensible production company. A pity then, that we won't get another shot at something like this, but that's what makes this movie so unique. This is the ultimate example of how from chaos comes perfection. Everything about it is absolutely spectacular, and strangely crafted, considering the production conditions, which makes us think about what was the academy thinking about when they acclaimed 'Kramer vs. Kramer' against this colossal masterpiece, only granting it two oscars. The redux version is one step further into this world and even if you only saw the film once with some attention, you will understand where are the new features, and their major roles here. Made in an era where there was no CGI, your jaw will drop in some shots, where more than 20 helicopters pass in front of the camera lenses, while a tank destroys a hut by the river, with thousands of extras running by. This was the ultimate challenge to the human resistance, and at one point in the movie, we no longer feel that it's only a movie. Its rawness comes like a near-documentary. Like Coppola himself said 'It's not a movie about Vietnam. It's Vietnam itself'. No doubt, it's the best war movie ever made, and one of the best movies ever.",10,0,0,28 July 2002
Edward Scissorhands," One of the best fairy tales ever.
","Only Tim Burton would have the heart to make such a story. Edward is a man-made being, fabricated by an inventor that lives on the top of a mountain. He has scissors for hands, but before he could have real ones, the inventor died. When the rest of the world comes knocking at his door in the shape of an Avon lady and drags him in down to the community, the problems of a single thing like having scissors for hands start coming up, but who has the greatest problem: Edward or the world? With an originality that is rare for contemporary cinema, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman establish here their cinematic tour de force, and probably one of their most beloved projects - it is clear that this one was a labor of love. Johnny Depp is surprising in the role of Edward, but he is only the leading piece of a magnificent mosaic that combines unforgettable supporting characters, Danny Elfman's haunting score (that will stay in your mind much after the credits roll) and Bo Welch's incredible art direction. One would say this movie would not be the same without the ideas that were put at hand here. And the result is that rare movie that puts in the fantasy worlds real world can invent.",8,0,0,1 April 2003

","Okay, like the trivia says, this one is too close to Kathryn Bigelow's Point Break. The plot is virtually the same. That alone would be enough to bury this movie if it wasn't the first Hollywood one to use the potential of street racing. So, this movie unique and brutal asset is the adrenaline-pumping action scenes, which teach 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' a harsh lesson in emotion. The movie rarely stops, only when the plot has to go forward, so you can expect an eye-popper, which won't leave the action-junkies disappointed.

","When I saw this one I couldn't keep from loving the all-star cast, the one-liners, Don Cheadle's cockney accent, the photography and the music. But something kept me from liking it more, that's because the concept is too thin to fill a two-hour movie and to use these stars. Soderbergh was expected after the triumph of Traffic and his double nomination for the oscars, and he came out with this remake. In one end he succeded, the film really has coolness to spare. But something is missing, and that something is deeper story and script. An average 7, to an average movie.",7,0,1,4 February 2002
Pearl Harbor," This is the end of the 'event' movie
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Hollywood believes that making a movie is like baking a cake. Like Luc Besson said, 'movies at Hollywood are like the pie machine in Chicken Run: you throw the ingredients, press the buttons and a product comes out on the other end'. The importance of the cinematographer, the writer, the director, the sound director, the actors is totally irrelevant. This system thinks that the bigger, the better. And the difference between success and failure of a movie lies in how much you are willing to spend. The film being treated as a product and not much else, it all depends on how much money you can make out of it. The rest is totally useless.The problem with Pearl Harbor is exactly that it was born out of a studio system so capitalist and near-sighted as Hollywood. And this time, they didn't made this one just to cash in at the box office. They were aiming to higher goals: box office smashes, a wide array of public and maybe even glory at the oscars. But Michael Bay is no James Cameron, and they were playing with fire when they decided to repeat the smash success of 'Titanic'. The comparisons between these two movies are huge, and, although they don't show on the final product, they are quite visible on the way this movie has been made: the thing they really wanted to do was to recreate the bombing of Pearl Harbor in all its 2.35 widescreen Dolby Digital DTS splendor, and Michael Bay, being the bubblegum popcorn director he always has been was the right choice to do this. But, as they noticed, a film doesn't live on only a bombing sequence, so they decided that they had to create a pretext, luring also the sensitive side of the audience, labeled as 'women'. This is what really gives me the more disgust: this movie was made by the numbers, no art involved, the script filled to the brim with clich√©s. The film is at all predictable, cold, a product of an industry and not much else. This is what really made me sick throughout.First part: The way to start every epic movie: the clich√©d prologue of the two protagonists when they are still children, having experiences that will influence their lives (see Backdraft and Braveheart, for example). Then we get a love story that takes nearly 5 minutes to start, the essential time (the audience really only wants to see the action). The film rushes slowly to the action sequence, with the always-seen newsreels of war. The sun is always orange, and the cameras are almost always in slow motion. Ben Affleck and a guy I have seen in Trainspotting do also the (very weak) comic relief. But we blink and the movie is already in Hawaii, because we have to get there so that the characters meet their fate, which everyone is predicting. The result of this first part is a handful of clich√©s which bores everyone who doesn't go to the movies to eat popcorn.Second Part: The thing everyone has been waiting to see. After all, this is why probably 90% of the audience bought their ticket. The explosions are, of course, massive and huge. Many people die, also in the most gruesome ways. Fire, planes, bullets, water, the 150 million dollars are all there on the screen, in those specially dramatic shots of the bombs falling and the torpedos swimming towards the ships. Many things blow up, but, maybe it's just me, there is such a lack of artistic sense of good taste and suspense that the cinematic event of the summer, which is probably those 45 minutes of bombing leaves the viewer cold. It actually tastes like a fraud. There isn't one single shot I can say that touched me more than the others. Not even that bomb falling, which I see as a different way to show the same thing. The bullets, the explosions, even 'The Rock' touched me more than all that collection of stunts. The flying bits are good, but at the same time they fall flat: why do we guess from the very beginning that the both of the protagonists will survive? I don't even ask how did they manage to be shot at during all that time and not being killed in the process. I don't even ask how two planes can lift off and escape. Why do the bad guys never kill the main characters? From the beginning, the bombing of Pearl Harbor doesn't strike us because there is no real sense of risk: all the people that die are not the people we met in the first part, and we know that at least the three main characters will make it to the end.Third part: America always wins. That's maybe the message they show here. The bombing of pearl harbor was a disaster to the american fleet in the pacific, but america always wins, no matter what. And yes, they will strike back. Hey, even the Japanese admit it's a sleeping giant (which makes us think on the reasons they attacked it). In the final part, which we see as another episode and not as a conclusion (really, the movie could continue on and on, the bombing still looks like it was glued in the middle of the absurd love story, just check out that first dialogue between Rafe and Evelyn). The final sequence is one more statement that America always wins, no matter what, and even if they lost a great deal of troops and boats and planes, they will manage to win. Like they say at one given time: 'they lost the battle but they will win the war'.It's things like these that kill the innocence and the sensibility of a movie. The credits haven't started, I was getting out of the theater. Really, it was a great disappointment, which proves that all the waiting was in vain, and that even if they invest millions in one movie they aren't guaranteed to suceed. It was a flop from the expectation point of view, and it nearly missed at the box office: the film merely payed itself and nothing more. But it isn't an unfair defeat: the film is just too damn pretentious, and aimed for sensible and artistic goals that the director wasn't prepared to reach - hey, Michael, no all is about little lights and sunsets. If we are expecting something great from a director who has filmed none other than brainless patriotic action movies which rely on frame rate to state their points, think it over, baby. I think it's time that Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer think over their strategy and think that maybe smaller is better next time (just check out the 2 french 'Taxi' movies which made over 16 million viewers in France altogether) - this is the way to do it: give the audience a thing they have never seen, for clich√©s are starting to lose their appeal. Like they said in Gladiator: 'Win the crowd'. Good luck on your next effort, Michael and Jerry. Be careful with choices and priorities.

The Commitments," Its modesty gives it grandeur
","A relatively simple tale of young people trying to be musicians and how they nearly made it in the city of Dublin turns out a great movie about friendship and the missteps of life. Aided by convincing actors and a very funny script, the premise of soul music played by white people and the obsession of young Jimmy Rabbite to manage a band which fits these parameters is a treat which never wears out, due to a voluntary lack of pretensions from the whole producing team. Made with the simplest budget, shot in the simplest way possible, the films turns out quite surprising, as it really leaves a mark in its viewer with a clever and very good-tasted use of soul music and the powerful voice of Andrew Strong. Johnny Murphy as Joey 'the lips' Fagan is also a find, and pushes the film forward as well as Robert Arkins' central character. An achievement, this one leaves you actually wanting to view it a second time. Great work on all departments, due in great part to a self-containment policy from the director. A funny film, which stands out from the rest.",8,0,1,27 July 2001
Tigerland," How the Tables Have Turned
","After the debauchery that was Batman & Robin, after the box-office bombing of that movie and the near-death experience of the Batman franchise, Joel Schumacher must have thought a lot in what to do next. One thing should be appraised: the man has conserved a shred of good taste. I say this because 'Tigerland' is the flipside of the spectacularity of Batman. It is a great war movie, with great dialogue, great actors (Colin Farrel should be a star now if this film wasn't such a low profile work), whose modesty and simplicity work to give it quality. We don't fall in political backdrops, we don't journey through complicated philosophies and thoughts. We just see how a charismatic soldier who doesn't give a damn to the military tactics and procedures manages to make enemies and friends in a situation such as the training to go the most deadly american war in history. A great movie, shot like the events were real, which gives it veracity. A great step to Joel Schumacher, which redeems himself from all the previous mistakes.",8,0,1,5 January 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Hymn to the Fallen
","Steven Spielberg has made a hymn. This movie pays hommage to millions of lives lost in all wars, by the eyes of soldiers that could be just any soldier. The synopsis isn't important: James Ryan, the last of four brothers will be bailed out of war so that he can return home before he dies. A division is assigned the mission of finding him and bringing him back. But it won't be that easy. It's just that simple, without spoilers. The real juice in this movie is first of all a masterful depiction of war as it was: a stupid carnage that took thousands of lives. And the opening sequence proves what I'm talking about: those must be the most haunting 30 minutes of 90's cinema. The movie's also a great study of how Man reacts when everything has cessed to make sense around him. This movie is not an easy experience. It's a thrill ride, but I'm not talking popcorn: everyone should see it, for his own sake. This movie opens our eyes. And we'll never look at war the same way again.

The Pianist," Touching and striking
","Polanski is back, it seems, and manages to make a holocaust movie without being connected to 'Schindler's List' and grabbing at the same time an Oscar for Best Director of the year. And it is indeed a return to form: Polanski recollects a true story, and depicts the horrors and the human paradox present in the darkest time for humanity. Adrien Brody looks like he was born for the role - his face alone provides everything we need to understand what he feels. The result is altogether touching and striking, even if the story doesn't benefit from some real life facts: if you think about it, the hero is never responsible for his own survival, always helped by friends. But even if this will make the experience a little more bitter for screenwriters and story-obsessed people, the movie is still chilling, and every time you see it and remember that it all happened once, you'll be hair-raised.",8,0,2,20 January 2004
City of God," Blood and Mud Masterpiece
","Never in the history of cinema the favelas assumed the real place they earned as a melting pot of cinematic value. Ultimately, Fernando Meirelles understood that it was time to fill the gap, and, corageously, moved forward into the excruciating experience that would be the making of a movie about them. When you see this movie, you'll thank him in silence. Because Meirelles' movie grabs this world-within-a-world with rare boldness, and makes it much more than a simple 'south american goodfellas' like someone called it. 'Cidade de Deus' is a view-changing experience, for it is the first time the audience leaps deep into the schemes, the violence, the blood and the mud. And your vision of the street gang violence in Rio de Janeiro will never be the same. Magnificently acted (and don't forget these were all people from the real ghetto), brilliantly framed and graspingly edited, this movie's real triumph is letting us know what goes inside the places we never dare to get into. And succeeds in doing so with the touch of genius. With immense production values, it is amazing how the movie never gets too heavy or too epic, and you'll marvel at the way realism is the motto here, while the film never has pretentions of becoming a mockumentary. This movie's got heart, and real guts. And it ends up becoming the film about the favelas no one ever dared to do. So you'll thank director Meirelles - rarely there has been such courage from a movie maker.",10,0,2,30 March 2003

","'The Fellowship of the Ring' introduced audiences around the world to a brave and admirable new world. It was an epic movie, that gathered fans and awards all around the globe. But when compared with the second outing, the first movie fades like a modest memory. 'The Two Towers' is probably one of the greatest and biggest fantasy pictures ever. The plot of 'Fellowship' was straight, following nine characters on their journey to cast the ring in the fires of Mount Doom. This movie catches up where the other one has finished, taking us through three separate journeys of three sets of characters, and establishing a kind of rivalry among which adventure is more epic. The stage is set for an unmissable and certainly unforgettable ride, with countless highpoints, too many of them to pick one - from the initial hair-raising ride with Balrog, to the climatic battle of Helm's Deep. Served by the best special effects this side of Jar-Jar  Binks (Gollum is one of the greatest achievements ever in the CGI world), the movie is a fantasy-fest, that succeeds almost at hypnotic level.

Moulin Rouge!," Spectacle with some under achievements
","I would really expect the most after 'William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet'. I would really expect the rebirth of the musical movie. But one thing doesn't let me score this movie higher than 7. I would also expect a better vision of Montmartre and Paris altogether. This movie lacks universe, because the action and the characters are too restricted. What I mean is that this musical lacks that epic vein it could have, because everything turns around that group of 5 or 6 people, that group of 4 or 5 buildings (the rest of the audience and the people are man with top hats and girls with dresses, let's face it) and the result is a grand musical film, but which is presented with the scenery range of a play (just count the scenes that don't take place on studio). And this is the thing that left me craving the most, since I think Luhrmann's nuts were really too big when he grabbed music from the 80's and put them in 1900. There are too many musical highlights, but if I could choose one that really touched me more than the others, it's gotta be the powerful 'Tango de Roxanne', which is as achieved as any masterpiece song we ever heard, and works also as a summit to all the movie. This is my conclusion: the movie is great, could have been even better. Love those opening credits, though. And oh yeah, how on Earth did they managed to turn John Leguizamo into a midget?

","The first one was clever, engaging, inventive and most of all funny. This had a great responsability of keeping the reputation of the blockbusting first movie, and many years passed until they found out a good script to do it. The result is something which verges on deception. You love it and hate it in equal amounts: although the running time helps to create the illusion that you actually want more, what happens here is the usual Hollywood sequel with its usual and more regular flaw: the feeling that we are seeing something rushed to happen. But my greatest challenge as a viewer was getting over the dull comic timings, which sometimes had everyone in the theater completely quiet. So you see, this is not the fascinating fest that was the first movie, but anyway there are some funny things about the MIB gadgetry and you will laugh with that dog and many other moments in the movie. But of course, the flaws are there, and that subliminal love story is unconvincing, and a near-flop. But I guess that's what happens with some sequels...",6,0,0,5 September 2002
Mulholland Drive," One of the most mind-bending movies ever
","SPOILERS AHEADWhat is after all the structure of this movie? It's really not that hard to realize, after a few viewings:Diane Selwyn has came from Deep River, Ontario. She dreamt of becoming a big movie star in the city dreams come true - Hollywood. But the producers never thought too much of her, and she never got the main roles. In one movie, she met Camilla Rhodes, which took the main role she was pursuing, and pitifully casted Diane as a supporting actress. Diane fell in love with Camilla, and they started a relationship. But it's a hard life - Camilla begins a relationship with Adam Kesher, the movie's director. This is too much for Diane, and she hires a killer to assassinate Camilla. She then stays at home and falls asleep. She now dreams she is called Betty Elms and she is starting all over again. Everything is right in this dream world: Betty has a magnificent house all for herself and everybody is nice to her, the director Adam Kesher is having a real bad time, her audition is a success and most of all, the woman that resembles the real-life Camilla, and tries to remember who she was before the accident she had in Mulholland Drive, falls in love with her. But this dream will end. And at the club silencio, the truth will be revealed, and when the blue key opens the blue box, Betty will become Diane again.
At her home, Diane finds the blue key that the killer said he would leave when he finished the job. Therefore, Camilla is dead. This is too much for Diane, which shoots herself. David Lynch has created his greatest masterpiece right here, a wittily edited movie which makes us dive into the realms of our dreams and our minds. The story above is just the starting point to see this movie and analysing all the more obscure aspects once more like the real meaning of the club silencio, the importance of the cowboy, the old lady that appears at Betty's door, and that blue box. David Lynch gave a few useful tips, but the best way to solve this is by means of dialogue with other passionated viewers of the movie. This is a magnificent achievement in aspects, and I must say that after this, Naomi Watts can't pass unnoticed again - she gives one of the best character transformations ever, sometimes you'll wonder if it's really the same person. 10 out of 10, this movie deserves no less.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," ALRIGHT!!!!
","And so, `the fourth film by Quentin Tarantino' is here, after six long years of waiting. By its outlook, by its synopsis, by its trailer, no one knew what to expect. A `pastiche' mosaic? An overload of obscure references only an ultra movie geek would find? The disappointment that inevitably spawns itself from the over-the-top hype? Or the complete opposite and a genius film all the way?First, the hype has faded in six years, even more with the underestimated `Jackie Brown'. Thus, Tarantino could have been involved with this project well earlier, and the hype would be the same. So, you can say that there wasn't a better time than this one for Tarantino to climb `his own personal Everest'.At first, you can find it somehow odd, right from the logo to some kind of obscure, oriental kind of cinemascope and the fantastic recollection of the cue card saying `our feature presentation'. But it's very easy for a movie lover to let himself be carried along this sheer trip, so idiosyncratic that, after an introduction that takes its time, you won't question its bizarre items, and the world this world creates. I confess that my primal fear when I learned about the shape of the project was the possibility of Tarantino surrendering himself to auto-indulgence, filling his epic with dozens of obscure references to lost gems of the b-movie age, that could be well lost in the limbo of justified and unvoluntary ignorance of those who never saw such films. But Tarantino surprises everyone, and that's what struck me the most: by collecting all the bits and pieces of the world of movies Tarantino fell in love with, this movie creates not only a hommage, but also a glorification, a kind of grandiose landmark, devoted to a genre of cinema always overlooked away from the major leagues. Linked to this, are the movies' charismatic characters, and the way they're filmed: they all have their own story, they all have something to tell, they all have something mythical and epic about them. Uma Thurman heads the pack, showing that cooler than a samurai with a sword is The Bride in a Bruce Lee jump suit, reducing 88 oriental Reservoir Dogs to a pulp, almost like Tarantino put his past career in a backseat. Because we're not dealing with an intensely ironic humor, you have no doubtful questions: here the answers lie in front of you, all of them ¬ñ it's a sincere, explicit work, but never diminished by that. It's now also one of the greatest Tarantino works. Not only an epic that makes you want to see long lost movie genres, but also an instant classic, a redefinition of the concept of `exercise in style' times twenty. The genius moments are too many, since that hommage to Hitchcock (complete with a Bernard Herrman score), to the bombastic showdown, that makes the Burly Brawl run for his money. The most impressive must be the unforgettable epic-within-an-epic of anim√© short that lies in the heart of the movie.With this movie, Tarantino opens again the doors to its usual genius, this time in a completely innovative way. And creates one of the most sinful fun rides of the last years.",10,0,1,28 October 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," Good starts don't make good finishes
","Damn, I am really ashamed of what I will have to say. But it's a fact. Man, we could have a new 'Desperado', we cold have another gun-slinger jewel from Robert Rodriguez. But this isn't so. Because of half an hour of disappointment. I will just say this, the movie is truly great until they get into that damn bar. Then it's just downhill, and I wonder why script-writer Tarantino did it like so. Because the movie is too cool from the start. Brothers Seth and Richie Gecko are famous bank-robbers and are on the run. They are responsible for a truck-load of deaths, and they have to escape. They choose the family of priest Jacob Fuller to accomplish it. The showcase of Tarantinian trademark dialogue is genius, with many fantastic dialogue to show in the respective quote section. As I said before, the movie is really a great movie until they get to that bar, where all hell breaks loose (literally). The makers of this movie should really have a fetish for B-Movies, since all I can say is that they really made it like so, and I am talking about everything, even the special effects. You'll see for yourself, but you are warned: when they cross that door, the movie gets really B-Grade, and never recovers. A half-disappointment, half-novelty item, on the first project between pals Rodriguez and Tarantino.",7,0,0,30 September 2001
The Big Blue," The Greatest Dream Movie of All Time
","This movie is the most fantastic contemplation of earth paradise in existence.First it's imperative that we notice one major difference: the short version and the 'version longue' are two completely different films. From tip to toe. I only knew this film previously in its short version. Yesterday I bought the 'version longue' in my local FNAC store without subtitles (it's rare these days).And.................... I fell in love with everything about it, stunned and mesmerized, being at the same time riddled by the way that the short version lost all sense, in comparison with the 'longue' version. You can think of an integral version like a way to stuff a film with pictures, but in this movie we have the feeling that the movie was intended to have 164 minutes, and not nearly two.And you can picture the transformation that occurred in my perception of this film, as I passed from that mutilated, full-screen, mono-sound version to a full, widescreen and hi-fi version. This is why 'Le Grand Bleu' passed from just a movie by Luc Besson to the greatest movie of my greatest director.My perception is that this is the great underwater epic he always wanted to make. And he achieves it in every way, specially letting the audience identify themselves with it.Perhaps my favorite Besson movie was 'The Fifth Element' (I like them all), but after having the privilege of experiencing this fantastic, beautiful, stunning, vivid and moving film, 'The Big Blue' passed from one of the medium levels to definitely the top one. The characters all gained strength, the underwater scenes all made sense, the previous movie was completely backed up, and the feeling that this movie was a contemplative journey gained finally its place.I gave it a 10 out of 10, not for the US version (how can they even think of erasing Eric Serra's score?!?!?) which, for its mutilations, deserved a 1, but for the version longue, which is the only way the movie shall be seen. What a masterpiece! After I saw this movie, I rewinded it thinking that my only wish is that one day I get to take part on such an experience, being there, dreaming and sharing my dream with everyone who would like to share it with me. Perhaps one day, a beautiful blue day...",10,118,150,22 October 2000
Black Hawk Down," The war movie fan's dream.
","It's clear that what they wanted to do here was the longest action sequence in movie's history. Everything else is irrelevant. They found a real story to back the razzle-dazzle action, and off they go. The fact that this is a Ridley Scott movie actually saves this from being completely boring and uninteresting. Because frankly, the premise is too thin. You can experience some emotion when the movie is building up to the military offensive but then when it actually comes, it is so long that you only the die-hard-military-movie-fan will not be eventually bored by the constant sound of bullets, gunshots, explosions and the occasional gruesome violence. In other hands, this would turn out an atrociously awful turkey. But Ridley Scott has surrounded himself with the experts, and thus it is explained all the oscar-hype around the movie. His talent manages to save the script and make this slightly above the standard war action fest. But don't be cheated about a movie that is way too long to sustain such a simple story. They should have been more modest. Anyway, the production values are top-notch, specially the cinematography. A well-decorated mess.",6,0,0,9 September 2002
Big Fish," Welcome back, Tim the magician.
","That's what we're talking about when we talk about Tim Burton: giant men, beautiful green-covered villages where everyone is barefoot, a world of fantasy that this man has given us, that now, after the 'Planet of the Apes' experience, is back into the screen. Of course, the sheer poetry of 'Edward Scissorhands' or the mythical flare of 'Batman' are not overwhelming like before, but what we have here is a work of maturity, and the result is a work that, for the first time, creates the dream world and also the point of view that questions it. The result is a beautiful film, that allows us to dream and live reality in equal parts, trying to make us feel like the title character when we come out. How much it affects us is up to you, I was touched by the sincerity and heart of such a tender tale. No cheap morale, no unnecessary eye candy - just the world, as seen by a dreamer. And that warmness is everything that we aim for. Could be labeled as the american 'Am√É¬©lie Poulain', but is so much more...",8,0,0,8 February 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," History
","Silence. Black backdrop and white letters. A murder. A search. A ringing phone. This is the beginning of one of the best movies ever. What follows is almost four hours of pure Cinema. Sergio Leone's final film is an elegy of gigantic proportions, a tour de force that shows who really are the hands that built America. Spreading from the beginning of the century to the end of the prohibition until the 1960's, this movie raised the foundations for all the stories about friendship and brotherhood, and established a way of making movies that continues to influence countless generations. The editing work is astonishing, the period detail priceless, and Ennio Morricone's score is already considered one of the best scores ever did for a film. A true everlasting classic that deserves its place on the history of movies, and a work that will be hard to top. Rarely has a movie condensed such emotion, cinematic intensity and gripping storyline: seeing it is virtually unstoppable. Hail to the DVD for recovering the movie in all its grandeur.",10,2,4,13 July 2003
The Last Samurai," Keeping up with the formula doesn't pay off
","Mr. Hollywood woke up one day and realized that his ideas were running thin. He went to his book of history and decided that it was time they did a movie about the samurai. He went to work and activated the movie-making machine, and in it added all the ingredients to make a box-office smash out of the genre. So, in the movie, everything you're expecting to see about the samurai is in fact depicted, even when it makes little sense (Where the hell do those ninjas come from? Who sent them?). Thus, from it comes little effect and result, and probably the most overrated of the year to come. It is simply not genuine, only the best the money can buy. Everything about is enormous, and, as usual, Cruise is the only reason for the movie to justify its existence. Did I mention that they also payed 75 million dollars for him? Well, as expected, he has done his homework well: speaking japanese, fighting with swords, the whole works. But it's a pity that the movie he serves ends up being such a flat effort. Shamelessly ripping off its concept from 'Dances With Wolves', trying to make it evolve into something with deep emotions and meanings, and creating a movie whose story is predictable from beginning until the end (the trailer only tells half of it) is a fraud, and to me is insulting. Ok so it can be entertaining. But I wasn't entertained. Only hurt, for so much has done so little. A saying in my country says that 'the mountain has spawned a mouse'. And this pretty much sums it up. I rest my case.",4,4,9,8 January 2004
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," 4.6?!?
","Hey I know this movie ain't a masterpiece, it may be just a product of the money-making machine of hollywood, it may be just a way to cash in on the first film's success, but I think this movie has a value of its own, present specially on the way New York itself is also a character throughout the film, which makes it a part of the story and not just a setting. I think this movie does not deserve the rating it has been given, the John Williams score is worth 7 points alone. The movie has also some magic moments, more-than-just-funny performances by the 'Wet Bandits' and, most importantly (a hint for the makers of Home Alone 3) IT STICKS TO THE VALUES OF THE FIRST MOVIE!!! I mean, they don't want to do it for the slapstick or the gross-out humor, it's really a sequel and not a way to make money out of the first movie. I liked altogether, no matter what the others think, it has heart and very cool moments, and of course the score makes it all worth it.

Life Is Beautiful," Sensitive, careful and sweet, but...
","In spite of having taken the world by storm with this tale of a father who tries to hide the horrors of the holocaust to his son, there is a serious flaw that affects the tone and the overall sensation of the movie to more demanding viewers: after all, is this movie a comedy or a drama? Because Benigni doesn't seem to grasp an overall tone and the structure ends up being erratic, with some great laughs and some serious dramatic moments, and some moments in between that don't allow the viewer to know if they will laugh or not. But don't let my review cast a shadow over this movie, since its idea is genius, and one of those projects only Roberto Benigni would grasp.",7,2,4,26 March 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Powerful and violent comedic masterpiece
","No one makes movie like Kubrick. He was probably the only filmmaker to establish a way of making movies that no one will ever achieve again, as hard as they try. A proof of that is this movie - which could have probably fallen into the pit of the ridiculous in someone else's hands, but which gets a treatment by a master director and deserves its place among the best movies of all time. This is not an easy one to watch - from the first shot we feel like we're being tested, like the movie is observing us, right from that lunatic stare of Malcolm McDowell's master creation, Alex. The film that follows is something rarely seen afterwards: a depiction of a psychopathic character which starts paying the dividends of his own way of living. Technically the movie is one of the most exquisite items ever put on film: the sets, the framing, the cinematography, all are top-notch. The usage of classical music is also a landmark, as the scenes only make sense with them, and gives some sequences a ballet-like feel that makes them something more than just violence. Altogether, this movie is shocking but for all the right reasons. Guaranteed to make you never forget about it.",9,0,0,19 July 2002
The Legend of 1900," Legendary
","As its pianist, this film could be bound for success, but the fact is, it remained relatively obscure. I can't understand why did a movie with this deepness and feeling end up in oblivion. Because, if there are some beautiful movies, this is one of them, from the moment that fantastic Ennio Morricone score begins until we witness the tear-jerking finale. An epic story from tip to toe, we journey through the original story of a man who becomes a pianist on board the boat where he was born. And as he grows, so does the fascination by the others in his art and the questions whether he should take that leap overboard and become a 'normal' person. A brilliant movie, from the man who brought us 'Cinema Paradiso' and made us all cry, this won't disappoint you, and it's worth by Morricone's score alone. The sequence where the piano floats freely through the dance hall is anthological. A legend of its own.",8,116,134,8 September 2001
Pulp Fiction," The Dawn...
","... of a new wave in movies, of the 'slacker-with-a-gun-low-budget-oldies-ridden-soundtrack' genre, of a concept of independent cinema and of the perception of the new values and their importance to today's movies. This one started everything from point zero, shuffled it again, left everyone baffled with the genius that can be extracted of what can be a banal setting and banal characters at first sight. This movie also shows how a completely new type of script can be born and how it can be more than half of a movie's success (just check out the quotes section). And it is also an example of how much you can play and establish a cult around a single, two-and-a-half-hour-long set of frames (and check the trivia section, perhaps the longest in the entire IMDb). A complete set of influences started here, and therefore its many ground-breaks were mirrored and copied countless times, like rescuing decaying actors and trying to use smart lines to make up for plot holes. And its position in the all-time-best list of IMDb, its collection of awards, its new face and freshness all make a great movie, which benefits from the marriage of clever directing, great script, striking editing and incredible actors rescued from the limbo (John Travolta's evolution emerges as the biggest standout, but his performance is easily overtaken by Samuel L. Jackson's religious killer Julius or Uma Thurman's fantastic stylish drug-addict Mia Wallace). A winner on all aspects, this movie is, no doubt one of the best of all time, and deserves its place in the podium. From this movie on, anything was not the same.",10,0,1,6 August 2001

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Surprise surprise
","By the 2000 Sidney Olympics, my country of Portugal had a contestant in the shooting class. It is a sport that requires a lot of concentration and clod blood. So, the athlete has to keep calm. In the TV I saw him shooting and looking down between shots. But he wasn't just looking down. He was reading 'Harry Potter'. When I was confronted with the opening of this movie, I wasn't really interested, thought it was too childish. But thenm there had to be a reason why the books appealed to children, adults, everyone. So when inevitably I saw this one, the result was an instant feeling of empathy towards it. I can only say that if they are trying to charm the viewer, if they are trying to involve him in the movie's sheer magic, they succeeded all the way. Now I understand why this one has so many fans. It is simply irresistible. It gives you something that you always search for when you go watch a movie - the power to be in another place for a few hours. And the movie delivers this and many more: all the production values are epic and magnificent, the John Williams score being a sort of conductor of all the emotions you experience when seeing this. The definition of movie magic doesn't come any closer than this! This movie makes you a child again, and thus it is unmissable.",8,0,0,9 September 2002

The score by Ennio Morricone is an asset of the movie, the script by David Mamet is a modern classic, and the violence has the poethic intensity of the 'Godfather' movies and 'Once Upon a Time in America' - I even think this movie could be placed right next to them in any gangster movie collection. Great ride, and well worth the effort. Congratulations to everyone, I really love it!",9,0,1,25 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Uneven landmark
","Ok, it would be impossible to please everyone, specially given the level of hype that grew with this movie. Everyone was baffled by the first one - only because it was such a stealth hit. The first movie grabbed everyone by the nuts and whispered in their ear: 'Movies have changed'. And the sight of Neo dodging a bullet became movie history almost immediately. After bullet-time became a regular target for millions of copycat products, it was obvious that the Wachowski boys couldn't just stick to what they know - and they were given the greenlight to do exactly the opposite. Unlocking 300 million dollars from Warner Brothers, they would finally have he opportunity to create the gaudy and epic saga they longed for since they first pitched their creation to the studios, almost 10 years ago. But how would the founders of a new era live up to the rivers of internet speculation, salivating geeks and millions of instant cult fanatics? Easy, you just go one step up. And that is the problem with 'Reloaded': the line between quantity and quality becomes very, very thin, and reminds us even briefly that the same trouble made 'The Phantom Menace' tank among most people. And indeed, there a few moments that feel utterly superfluous. But one important thing to notice: this is the Wachowskis, not Lucas. And what you have here is a movie that, like the first one, makes us think what the direction of movies is these days, and even if they don't create a new filmmaking era, they surely make their point clear: there is nothing that can't be done when there's imagination and money. Boasting some of the most spectacular special effects of the last 10 years, their most important detail is that you never can really tell what's FX or not, because their impact on the viewer is so incredibly electrifying. Okay, so it's no longer a question of storytelling like the first one, and okay, what matters is the filmmaking verve and the way the boundaries of the concept of ass-kicking are pushed. But you won't really care, even if some point of you will be a bit let down because that sheer 'Matrix' feeling the first one gave you is not there. So, the key to really enjoying this movie is never thinking of it like a sequel of compulsory ass-kicking, and instead try to see it as the Matrix times 100. And your jaw will drop with a little more conviction. Even with its flaws, this is serious landmark filmmaking, even if in a simple technical level, and is a case of must-see. Some of the things in here will require years to be surpassed, and 'the thing that will bake our noodle later on' is trying to imagine what on earth can surpass this.",7,0,0,24 May 2003
Ice Age," Now I know why this was originally intended to be a drama.
","Ok, at the beginning it looked like 'Shrek' - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. Then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, 'Ice Age' is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing.",7,0,0,18 July 2002
Con Air," Laughable, straightly stupid action flic
","Sometimes a bunch of good actors join up and throw their pickyness of roles just to make a straight, no-questions-asked, action movie. In this case, actors like the Oscar-Winner Nicolas Cage, the three-times-Golden-Globe and two-times-oscar-nominated John Malkovich, the golden-globe-winner Ving Rhames, and the already charismatic John Cusack and Steve Buscemi. But this film, despite its actors, is actually an encore of the standard Jerry Bruckheimer action escapism, or in other words, just-action-no-real-brains. Despite all these, the film still delivers some good one-liners, specially from David Chapelle, who resembles the likes of Chris Rock and Chris Tucker.

Shrek," Deconstruction
","** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **I didn't expect anything when I saw it. I just unfolded it like a book. And, like a book, the movie starts, as a fairytale, with tales of princesses and princes. The score to go with it is glorious and epic. Then, the coup: the score transforms into 'All Star', and the main character gets out of the bathroom where he was reading the book. The spirit of the movie is like this everytime: a complete deconstruction of the fairytale genre, with a fantastic finesse and sense of humor. Of course, the fact that the entire movie was generated in mainframes is one more hat to take off. But, although we could have a showcase of computer achievements, they didn't do it that way: they kept the technical details at one side, and focused on the bits and touches that make this movie a joyride. Its structure is the simplest possible: the universe of action is very limited, but this doesn't mean that the story is limited too - we really don't need no more than we have. And the film charms us in the most subtle ways. I could start complaining that the USA do commercial movies and that the american cinema is just a big business, but there is a reason why we see all those sitcoms, and watch all those movies: there are too good jokes to be left unnoticed. 'Shrek' is no exception, the movie is full of touches that fit right on all the spots. This gives place to a very funny movie, with distinct characters that will make you laugh in their own ways. And as a family movie, 'shrek' couldn't be better: kids will follow its simple plot and have a lesson by the end of the movie. Adults will marvel at the in-jokes and at the fantastic things computers can do these days.",8,0,0,29 September 2001

","A definite eye-candy, this movie explores a usually closed and difficult theme: the world of dreams. Carrying the plot on his back is Tom Cruise's engaging character, which plays a successful businessman, which can't resist a beautiful woman or an everlasting dream. His life starts being invaded by choices, errors and emotions, until something changes his life. Divided between an irritating but warm-hearted Cruz and a sexy although slightly mad Diaz, he ends up questioning what is this all about when he's charged with murder. But that's the secret of this movie, so just see it: with a soundtrack that's worth the admission alone, and a great performance by Cruise which shuts up those who think he's only an action hero and a pretty face, the movie also displays Cameron Crowe's skill in involving its viewers. And the movie never stops doing so, from start to finish also thanks to the beautiful cinematography by John Toll. Don't let the strange accent of Pen√©lope fool you, this movie requires more than one viewing. And a movie like that is always worth seeing.

Blade Runner," Essential and influential vision of the future
","This one has reached a cult status few movies can achieve without the aid of marketing and sequels. It's easy to see why, since I think it keeps getting better with age. Saw the director's cut a few minutes ago and loved it even more than previous times (it was also the first time I saw it on DVD), it brought back a nostalgic sense (it breathes 80's style) and that Vangelis score is simply unbeatable (and we know how many tried to imitate it). This movie unfortunately didn't establish Ridley Scott as a great director and bombed at the box office and at the critics' board (Leonard Maltin gave it a near BOMB rating). But it is clear that it's too good to be left unnoticed. It actually creates that essential thing most moviegoers seek when they enter the theatre - the power to escape from this world and be some place else for about two hours. The work done in cinematography is a triumph and the production design is simply astonishing. Vangelis has also made a remarkable work, which is still today a musical landmark on its own. Thrilling thriller, that's all that I can say, this movie is simply amazing.",9,0,0,7 April 2002

","Shyamalan returns, with the weight of having done two remarkable movies on his shoulders. Only two ways, apparently - or he wins, or he fails. Curiously, he manages to do both, unfortunately in the same movie. Here Graham Hess is the main character Shyamalan seems to have a fixation on - the man with something in the past that affects the way he is on the present. The strange crop signals appear, and the menace of Hess' isolated family appear. All is set for a game of creeps and chills fabulously orchestrated by the obviously-gifted Shyamalan. And you will be in the edge of your seat, as a series of creepy encounters happen. If the director had something to prove, it is settled here. As a suspense / mild horror movie, this one gives you the biggest jumps ever this side of The Sixth Sense. And then, comes an ending that, from the man that got us used to have such great endings, is hard to bear. But don't let this spoil the fun. It still remains an excellent thriller, with the quality we seek when we go to the movies to have a good time. And once more it's confirmed: Shyamalan has potential to get to the top.

Sweet and Lowdown," The reason of why I like Woody Allen movies
","No one makes them like this: simple, direct, funny but always very sensible and beautiful. Needless to say this movie is a typical Woody Allen flic, which is a complement. Sean Penn is a winner on this one, giving an unique performance, but, from my point of view, the real shiner here is Samantha Morton, which has a tenderness no words (could not) explain. She is among the all-time best portraits of innocence and sweetness in female role, and suceeds as a truly engaging character for which we fall instantly. Of course, her relationship with Penn's character, which is the exact opposite, is at times hilarious and touching. A priceless jewel, like all Allen movies, with good taste altogether.",8,0,0,26 July 2001

This one was a yellow spot in a grey world of explosions, gun fire, and death. And we all missed a movie like this to put a smile on our face again. The setting is the most beautiful city in the world. Amelie is a young and naive girl who had a difficult childhood due to a series of mistakes and accidents. Her world was an exquisite one. It still is. One day she decides to change the life of the people around her. And perhaps her own as well. This is the plot to a good natured, beautiful and engaging movie, which conquered its audiences by being itself, and nothing more. This was a project dreamed by Jeunet long ago, and it shows the level of dedication that all the creative team put on this movie. But I don't have any more words to describe it, it ringed many bells of mine, and I will probably see it again. A great smile in the face, that's what the world needs.

With this magnificent movie, the concept of psiychological terror is reinvented, through the eyes of the amazing Haley Joel Osment, which drives the movie forward.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The long farewell
","And so it ends. The world of movies has written another chapter of its history, and seals it with gold. One of the vastest literary works ever has its hommage payed in a set of movies that not only are already groundbreaking, but also are the dawn of so many things. Maybe that's the reason it is so difficult to say goodbye to all those things we cherished so much. All those characters and situations are now in history, and everybody that made them come to life are also in the memories of moviemaking. And this movie is such a long goodbye that, if you spend some seconds thinking of everything that these three pictures have given us, you will not be able to hold the tears. I wasn't. I was immersed in another world, thinking of so many things like 'How can they do this? How can they create such a world and not losing grasp of it even if briefly? How can they sum the whole purpose of movies in one single feature, and give you some of the most unforgettable cinema experiences of a lifetime?'. And the eternal feeling of being in front of living history, in front of everything movie-loving people like me are after was so much to handle. The door is now closed. All the people we cherished on that silver screen will live now only in our living rooms and in our imaginations. In the end, the bitterness of the inevitable 'so long' is hardened by one single fact: Tolkien's work was one of the biggest achievements ever of human imagination. I have no doubt that the unique feeling these movies provoked in us will be lived again, but unfortunately many years will pass until humanity achieves such a ride through the realms of imagination. All we can do is hope that this trilogy enlightens all minds and prove once and for all that nothing is impossible as long as you can picture it in your mind. Thus, goodbye. Shall we live to see other movies like this one.",10,0,0,19 December 2003
Casino," Masterpiece
","I see this as a quasi-sequel to 'Goodfellas', where we followed the life of a newcomer to the mafia and crime. In this movie, we start already with the characters in a crime world, and the movie changes setting to Las Vegas, where in the 50's and 60's the Casinos where ruled by an ellaborate web of bosses and dirty businesses. The police tried to stop it, but it was their money which was bringing the city to life. De Niro is great, as usual, Pesci is a show-stealer, and Stone, a novelty in Scorsese's work (as Ray Liotta was in 'Godfellas'), has a much-earned oscar nomination in the role of an empty woman whose path leads to decay. Scorsese's direction is fantastic (I recommend this as an introduction to his work), flamboyant and lusty as it has always been, and this is to me one of his best works. See it and marvel at it.",10,1,1,23 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of all times
","This one was the dawn of a new way to see movies. This movie created a heritage, and a cult movemement that will probably never end. 'Star Wars' is by far the greatest cult movie ever, and it changed the way people make and see sci-fi today. Of course, this was a tightrope work, and it shows. The success wasn't insured, and George Lucas really risked it here, and one can tell by the quality of the overall movie that this one wasn't so financed as Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. But it remains an absolute classic, and the Special Edition in 1997 really souped it up, adding cool effects and new sequences, making the experience even better. This movie started a legacy, and even today, one the eve of seeing the new chapter, I know I can see it without getting tired. The force will always be with the people who see this.",10,8,15,15 May 2002
Cube," Great Idea
","This film's biggest asset is providing tension, enough to grip us for a hour and a half, with only one set. The idea is the best thing in the movie, and it succeeds in making us believe that the structure's that big. Unfortunately, it somehow ends up giving place to already seen situations and the ending is a little bit convenient. But it's already a part of my DVD collection, and it's a highly recommendable movie. Loved it when I saw it, and never get tired of it. Kudos to the directing and the editing!",7,1,2,7 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The definition of the word 'unmissable'
","This movie is probably the reason why so many people devoted their lives to worshiping the saga George Lucas had started three years earlier. Here the adventure continues, but with a twist - after having the basic characters thrown in the first one, here we get a souping-up, and everything and every one is multiplied by 100. The result is the best movie in the Star Wars saga. Here we have some rawness typical of A New Hope, and we still don't have the excesses of Return of the Jedi. The result is a brutally touching movie, where its characters are the main theme and not the battles or the special effects. Magnificent work by everyone involved, the movie is a triumph, and one of the best movies ever. John Williams also suceeds to beat his own work, and present us with a richly crafted score.",10,0,0,31 July 2002
Gangs of New York," Disappointment
","Many ideas and many ideals do not a good film make. And after seeing this movie I'm even more convinced of that. Here, a supposed labor of love and a project that has been dragging over more than 20 years presents itself like just one more movie and not the great Martin Scorsese return we all expected. I saw this after the oscar failure, and the question 'why?' crossed my mind, when he had a great opportunity to receive that much wanted Best Director award. But when I saw this, I understood that the academy hasn't lost its marbles after all. In the middle of a great idea - the handling of a little known period of New York history - what comes out is not the awe of the gigantic production values, or the painful recognition that, indeed, the american society we know today WAS born in the streets. What comes out is the flaws that the movie makes so pivotal and doesn't suceed in hiding. Flaws like the much confusing structure of the story, that doesn't seem at all balanced, or that love story that turns out cold and uninspiring. Of course, the best thing about the movie is the addictive performance of Daniel Day Lewis, that steals all of the many scenes where he's in, and makes you want to see more of him by the end, and there are few moments where the power of the overall idea that New York has a dramatic background is well shown. But the sensation of ending up with nothing new is much more overwhelming than the cinematic experience, and the bad taste on your mouth becomes more and more intense, as the overlength starts picking on you. Anyway, few movies are made like this today, and Daniel Day Lewis is worth the admission alone.",6,0,0,9 April 2003
Contact," Contact with something never seen
","In my country we call a movie like this a 'esgalha'. This word doesn't have any translation to english, it's just portuguese lingo which means something between 'well-achieved' and 'fantastic' and 'truly great' but it's the only word I can find to express my feelings when watching a movie like this. From the first time I saw the trailer, I knew this one would be something great. I had been a fan of Bob Zemeckis, and I didn't think he ever failed to achieve his intentions in a project: among his all-time best are the escapist genius of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', the incredible 'Back to the Future' saga, and even one of his first movies, 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand', a chronicle of Beatlemania which was broadcasted more than 10 years ago here and I never heard of again. This movie was his great comeback. But he wasn't the only one: along for the ride was one of my favorite actresses, and she was coming to a much-wanted return, needless to say, after all those years of pause.I shall say that, if this movie didn't brought me to tears, it was because it wasn't long enough. It stroke me right on the face: before seeing it I just saw a trailer, I didn't know any plot details, I didn't know any good moments, absolutely nothing. So when I come across that opening scene, just that chilling experience told me that this one was going to be good. And it didn't fail to be so: it's, from my point of view, one of the best movies of 1997, no questions asked. Using a credible source (the book from Carl Sagan), fantastic actors (Foster deserved an oscar nomination, as well as John Hurt as Hadden) and a surrounding feeling which makes us grab the arms of the chair (my heart was beating in the the final sequence), I rarely seen a movie with such a gift to have our hearts beating according to its own pace. The scenes are surprising from the beginning to the end, and it has a kind of poignancy which is rare these days. I will not spoil any plot, I don't want to make you lose all the suprises of a good film, just see it. I just admire, and will keep on loving it. It's a part of my DVD collection the moment it's out of the stores. See it in the theatres if there is a chance, or with a really good sound system and a big screen. It is worth it.",10,0,2,10 August 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," All the way up.
","One of the films that marked my childhood, this Indiana Jones flick is the best, from my point of view. The sets are astonishing, the music is incredible, and the addition of Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr. is genius, as he and Harrison Ford manage to give birth to Spielberg's finest comedy ever. The theme here is the Holy Grail, a fantastic follow-up to the ark antics of years earlier. The bad guys are the nazis again, but this time the enemy is more subtle and treacherous. As a character says, 'don't trust anyone'. And the quest for the grail allows us to embark on the ride of our lives, as we are taken in boat, plane, car, bike and train chases, as we see the incredible action (the initial sequence of young indy is my favorite) and as I even get to see Indy fighting in a boat off the shore of my country (complete with boxes written in portuguese)! I love this movie, it has good taste, good humor, great music, great cinematography and spills Spielberg's talent through every aspect of it. A triumph, to which I would have given an 11. P.S.: Harrison Ford was 47 years old when he shot this movie. He is now almost 60. Lucas is too busy with Star Wars and will touch the Indy adventures just after Episode III (2005). By that time, Indy will be 63 years old. What shall we expect? I hope there's one more to come, I know they won't disappoint us.",10,0,0,25 September 2001
Jurassic Park," Historical
","This suspenseful, intelligent and remarkable film established new standards in movie entertainment as for the first time it was possible to bring extinct animals never before seen back to life. This established a new box-office record, and dropped the jaws of excited audiences from all over the world. And this success isn't casual. Marked by an well-written script, this movie privilegiates suspense instead of raw action, and this strategy pays off. Using charismatic characters and engaging perfomances (Jeff Goldblum's is a treat), the movie is a formula which fits the interest of children and adults. A splendid work, carefully crafted, and a reflection of true movie magic.",Null,0,2,26 July 2001
