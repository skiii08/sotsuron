E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Greatest Spielberg Classics of All-Time!
","If you are bored or there's nothing to watch, then watch E.T.! It's one of the greatest Spielberg classics of all-time because I like how they make special effects on the movie, for example when they make Elliot and E.T. fly with the bicycle. Also, I like it when they make E.T.'s mouth move without puppet strings. I wonder how they operate E.T. in the film. Finally, E.T. is a classic to watch because this classic will never be forgotten and will always be remembered, unlike bad movies out there. E.T. is one of the greatest Spielberg classics ever! I highly recommend you to watch this movie if you can because E.T. can never make you bored. I know, this movie should have won Best Picture at the Oscars.So if you're bored or trying to find entertainment for the whole family to watch, this movie is definitely for you!",10,0,0,24 January 2019
Forrest Gump," A Very Motivational Movie!
","Forrest Gump is one of the all-time classics directed by Robert Zemeckis, who also directed Back to the Future. This movie is so motivational that in the movie, a guy named Forrest went to the army and was so inspired by his friend Bubba talking about shrimps that he opened up a store which was named after him. Also, it's so sad that Jenny had to die on the same bed as his mama. Another reason that this movie is inspirational and motivational is that if there's something bad going on, run from it. Run from everything what is bad around and never look back. If a bully is picking on you, run. That's the solution to life, run from the bad stuff. Finally, this movie means a lot of things. It teaches you about how life goes on and what is the meaning of life. So, if you haven't seen this movie or if your friend hasn't seen this movie, I highly recommend you to see it, because this movie is very motivational and teaches you about life!",Null,1,1,24 January 2019
