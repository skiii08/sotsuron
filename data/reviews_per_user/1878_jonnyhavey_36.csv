The King's Speech," Speech: A Joyful Melody of Anger and Rejoice
","'The King's Speech' is a film that is about more than just a speech in a moment in time, it is about the journey of Prince Albert (Colin Firth) from being the Duke of York with a speech impediment to becoming King George VI and the voice of England in World War II. Tom Hooper directs this true tale concerning a special relationship that forms between King George VI also known as Bertie and his speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) that has received seven Golden Globe nominations and eleven Critic's Choice nominations. The film begins shortly before the death of King George V (Michael Gambon) and after a failed speech by Bertie due to his stammering speech impediment. His wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carer) has been researching the best speech therapists in order to help her husband, however, time and time again they failed to procure any results. She finally stumbles across a man named Lionel Logue known for his unique therapeutic practices., but at first Bertie is very skeptical and believes that this is going to be just another failure. However, after a minor bet over a shilling and some surprising results, he finds himself back in Lionel's office. Together Bertie and Lionel build a strong bond while preparing for his ultimate task. Bertie is in line to take his dead father's place as king after his brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) steps down from his royal role in order to marry American Wallis Simpson. England is in need of a leader and with t the help of his best friend Lionel Logue, King George VI rises to the occasion fulfilling the extraordinary role of unifying a country on the brink of war with Hitler's Germany.The acting of both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush is spectacular and the chemistry between the two is even better. They are able to transform a very straightforward and predictable story into an original look at an underdog story. Colin Firth's performance is so very real and believable that he makes you feel like you are in one of those dreams where you are trying speak and call out for help, but are not able to. Geoffrey Rush adds a lot of comedy to the movie and makes the viewing process very enjoyable. The journey that these two men take together in the film is mastered perfectly as the two curse at each other and make speech more than just well articulated words stung together. Combined with beautiful cinematography speech becomes a joyful melody of anger and rejoice as it flows from the mouth of King George VII. Despite the cinematography the film has a very boring exposition making it hard for the audience to connect to the story. The film lacks the flare that takes off about fifty minutes or an hour into the film. One thing that was very disappointing about the film was Helena Bonham Carter's performance. Does she deserve the Best Supporting Actress nominations that she has received? Probably. However, her performance does not match up to her fellow stars. She does not have any wow moments and she does not mesmerize you. Instead she acts at as a consistent above average actress throughout the film.'The King's Speech' is a film very similar to the story that it tells. Once you count the film out it begins to grow on you and is pretty damn good in the end, which is worth seeing now. Also, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are both very strong contenders in this year's award season and may surprise us in the end as they go head to head with James Franco and Christian Bale for the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor Oscars.",9,1,3,27 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Incoherent Action: The Captain Is Back
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is everything a Pirates sequel should be, trumping the previous follow-up attempts. The plot is more over the top and muddled than ever with a plethora of pointless characters and incoherent nonstop action sequences, but Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) creates a film that will please fans and revive people's love for the series that was lost because of the previous two flops. Much of the success of the newest installment comes from the axing of Will and Elizabeth from the story finally being true to the real star of the series, Johnny Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. His previous nemesis Hector Barbosa is back (Academy Award Nominee Geoffrey Rush, The King's Speech), along with newcomers Ian McShane (Kung Fu Panda) as Black Beard and Academy Award Winner Penelope Cruz (Vicky Christina Barcelona) as Angelica, a long lost love interest of Jack. The plot is basically about Captain Jack trying his hardest to beat numerous other journeyers to the 'Fountain of Youth' with his deceptive tactics. On the way he has to deal with Black Beard, a reformed Barbosa, the Spanish (even though they only show up a couple times) and an obnoxious love story between a religious man and a Mermaid. The plot doesn't matter much in this Pirates attempt disregarding the development of a storyline completely replacing it with nonstop action. The fast pace is hard to grasp at first, but it never gets out of hand as the rum flows through its veins slowing it down to a comprehensible speed.On Stranger Tides is the best of the Pirates sequels even though it still fails to come close to The Curse of the Black Pearl. As long as Depp and Rush continue providing entertaining antics with their peculiar relationship the boat will stay afloat for many more installments.. McShane's Black Beard acts as the new and improved Davy Jones succeeding in adding a dark humor to the film. Even so, all that really matters is that it is a blockbuster completely overwhelmed with action commencing with the opening sequence and not taking a breathe until the end.The most pointless and irritating part of the film is the awkward relationship that forms between a man named Phillip (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid named Syrena (Astrid Bergés-Frisbey). The audience cannot connect to the relationship because Phillip comes off as a creepy nothing character and the only point of the relationship can be attributed to lazy scriptwriting, which becomes a major theme throughout the film. The cleverness is that used to be prevalent in the series is gone causing the predictable to set in.Leave all high hopes at the door going into this one and you may just be as surprised as I was after seeing this film. Just remember the captain, the action, the rum and that it is nothing more and nothing less than a blockbuster sequel.",5,1,1,18 June 2011
Sucker Punch," Viewer: Sucker Punch to the Face
","Director Zack Snyder's ('300,' 'Watchmen') latest film, 'Sucker Punch' can be described by one word: bummer. Snyder is known for making films with very detailed, enthralling visual splendor. However, he proves that visuals are not enough to successfully create a good film. Starting with a brief back-story of a girl known as Babydoll (Emily Browning, 'The Uninvited') and ending with an attempted metaphorical message, the plot is lost in the midst of action. Babydoll's story takes place in 1955 with the death of her mother leading to the attempted rape of Babydoll and her sister by their Stepfather (Gerard Plunkett, '2012'). In order to stop her father from succeeding she tries to shoot him, but accidentally misses shooting her sister instead. She immediately drops the gun and begins running, however, she cannot escape the clutches of her Stepfather. After the police come she is taken to an insane asylum for girls known as the Lennox House. Her Stepfather pays off one of the orderlies named Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac, 'Robin Hood') to forge the signature of Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino, 'Watchmen') to have her lobotomized by the Doctor (Jon Hamm, 'Mad Men'). While in the mental institution, Babydoll meets fellow inmates Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish, 'Limitless'), Rocket (Jena Malone, 'The Messenger') Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens, 'High School Musical'), and Amber (Jamie Chung, 'Grown Ups'). Immediately following, Snyder takes the audience deep within Babydoll's mind creating an 'Inception-like' mental design of three layers. In the second layer Babydoll transforms the mental institution into a cathouse where her and her companions are just a group of entrapped prostitutes. In this mental state Babydoll is taught to dance by Madam Gorski, taking her one level further for the duration of her dance. In the deepest level she is given a mission by a Wise Man (Scott Glenn, 'Secretariat') leading her to escape the mental hospital. Together Babydoll and her fellow inmates complete a set of five tasks in hopes of escaping before Babydoll is given to the High Roller (Also Jon Hamm) in the brothel synonymous with her lobotomy in reality.It goes without saying the only reason anyone should see this film is to see Snyder's renowned graphic grandeur. Snyder mixes of light and dark with vibrant colors to distinguish the inner most layer of Babydoll's mind from the blandness of the rest of the film. Here Snyder creates entertaining action sequences in the backdrop of his graphic effects and has a little help from Jena Malone and Scott Glenn's performances.'Sucker Punch' is synonymous with a rolling ball of flaws attributed to a variety of different shortcomings. The film starts with very weird character development as Babydoll acts as nothing more than a mime until she finally speaks 30 minutes into the film. The viewer is also hit immediately with an over the top soundtrack playing a different song every five minutes undermining the integrity of each scene. The casting for the film is almost as random as the soundtrack with a wide range of B-list actresses coming from a variety of different backgrounds. Exhibit A: Vanessa Hudgens. What were you thinking Snyder? 'High School Musical' to 'Sucker Punch'? Need I say more? While, along with the fact that Emily Browning and Jamie Chung may as well be labeled as unknowns, Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino are out of place in this film. Also, it really is sad that the best actor in the film, Jon Hamm, is only in the film for a minute or two. This combined with a very poorly written script massacred the film creating horrid situational clichés and predictable outcomes.One-dimensional characters and an ending reaching for metaphorical meaning vastly overshadow Snyder's special effects. Therefore the only special thing about Snyder's latest film is the fact that the viewer gets 'Sucker Punched' in the face as the film goes down as one of the greatest letdowns of 2011.",2,44,93,27 March 2011
Source Code," The Mind: String of Cinematic Fabric
","Ten years ago Jake Gyllenhaal brought viewers into the mind of a high school student bridging the gap between universes in 'Donnie Darko.' 'Source Code' marks parallel universes round two for Gyllenhaal as he leads a seasoned cast with his charming acting talents. Director Duncan Jones is a relatively new director, however, he has gone down the mental thriller sci-fi path before with his 2009 movie 'Moon.' This time around he takes a well written screenplay by Ben Ripley (only lacking premier dialogue exchange) transforming it into the best movie of 2011 to date. The film is unique yet familiar because of the way it is told (the replay film). Gyllenhaal's character Captain Colter Stevens embodies a man named Sean Fentress repeating the last eight minutes of Sean's life over and over. Steven's mission is to use the new technology available to the U.S. government, known as source code, to find the man responsible for blowing up and killing more than 100 people on a Chicago commuter train and ultimately preventing subsequent attacks. After waking up from his first attempt he is disoriented and confused, wondering why he is no longer in Afghanistan with his unit. To make matters even more puzzling, he is briefed by a woman named Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga, 'Up in the Air') about his unknown ware bouts and soldier status. Stevens learns that he is trapped and his only escape is his interaction with the people on the train that is destined to explode. A minor love story forms as he becomes closer to a woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan, 'Due Date'), whom in the end he cannot stand seeing her blow up again. While he learns more and more from Goodwin throughout the film, mystery still surrounds the limits the project's creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright. 'Quantum of Solace') has put on source code and its affect on past, present and future events.While many may say that the film revolves around Gyllenhaal's performance, the most important character in 'Source Code' is Director Jones. Jones took the advanced in-depth concept within 'Source Code' and simplified it into a short string of cinematic fabric. By doing so he took the spotlight off of Gyllenhaal opening the mind of the viewer to the simplistic detail of his fellow cast members' performances and the detailed environment surrounding them. This exemplary artistic craft can be seen throughout the film, starting with the narrow scope that cinematography allows the viewer to see to its slow expansion as plot details come to light. Jones's greatest triumph occurs during the final sequence of his film as he compresses a 3D still image into the second dimension through what can be called pure artistic craftsmanship. However, the art in the film is presented to a broader Hollywood audience and even leaves room for snippets of comic relief provided by Russell Peters's (Standup Comedian) character Max Denoff. In the end, Peters's purpose goes beyond comedy as he helps create 'Source Code's' metaphorical undertone of happiness.Even though Ripley writes one of the best scripts of the year he fails on occasion to provide the viewer with enthralling dialogue. Periodically throughout the film the characters mend their discourse saving weekly scripted exchanges. The only other faulty part of the film comes from its almost Hollywood ending, which end on more of a happy note rather than a metaphorically profound message.The mental sci-fi action thriller genre is at its best as films continue to delve into the most profound arena; the mind itself. 'Source Code' is yet another stepping-stone for the future of mental cinema and in the end is no let down. The film proves what 'Inception' proved last year, art can be found within the scifi genre exemplifying the infinite possibilities of life, love and happiness.",9,3,6,5 April 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," REAL 3D Falls Short
","Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D Wait For DVD My Critical Perspective: D Personal Perspective: C- 20/100Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth installment in the film series Resident Evil based on the popular Video Game series with the same name. Similar to many sequels that have been released recently, Resident Evil director Paul W.S. Anderson decides to film it in 3D. For those who have not followed the film series or the video game, the following is a brief history of Resident Evil. The main character in the film series is a woman named Alice, played by Milla Jovovich. Alice used to be a security operative for a corrupt company called the Umbrella Corporation (a corporation developed both the T Virus and G Virus and perform various lab experiments) based in Raccoon City. Basically the company releases a deadly virus (T Virus) that spreads rapidly around the world and turns infected people into zombies. Therefore, Alice's overall goal is to destroy the Umbrella Corporation and prevent further infection to the world population. In Resident Evil: After Life Alice teams up with Claire Redfield (Played by Ali Larter) who at the end of the third film (Resident Evil Extinction) Travels to a 'so called' safe zone known as Arcadia, but has lost her memory. Together they lead a small group in a quest to discover the secrets behind Arcadia and continue to hunt the Umbrella Corporation.The Good: First off, the film had the highest grossing opening weekend box office out of the four films in the series making 27,700,000 dollars. Second, Milla Jovovich is back with her portrayal of Alice and stays true to her character as she has throughout the series. Alice along with Claire and their fellow survivors provide the audience with some very entertaining mindless zombie killing action that has been seen throughout the series. The best part of the film is the opening credits. They are able to utilize 3D technology the best in the film with a sequence where the camera pans around various characters as the credits are revealed on the screen. This opening scene gives an overview of the atmosphere of the film without any dialogue and in a very simple way.The Bad: The time between each action sequence is very boring and lacks substance, good acting, a thoughtful dialogue and well thought out plot. The screenplay comes off as being forced together and put together in a rush. (Example: If the group of survivors needs a swimmer of course they have a high school swimming all-star.) The story is all over the place and is very confusing even if this isn't the first film you have seen in the series. Also, besides the 3D in the opening scene/credits the 3D is unnecessary and does not add to the movie at all. One example of this is a scene shown in the previews where the leader of the Umbrella Corporation takes his sunglasses off and throws them at the audience via 3D for no apparent reason at allFinal Thought: The subpar acting of Milla Jovovich along with various entertaining action sequences does not outweigh the poor scriptwriting, or the horrible acting of the supporting cast of this film. This film is just another sequel that was made for the sole reason of making money and is not worth the 3D ticket prices to see it in the theatres. Even Resident Evil fans should Wait For DVD to see this film.",2,10,20,17 September 2010
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," 'Unification of Love: Awkwardly Realistic Circumstances'
","Unification of Love: Awkwardly Realistic CircumstancesThree love stories nay, situations, are explored in Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's ('I Love You Phillip Morris') 'Crazy, Stupid Love'. It is a drama masked as a comedy fueled by awkwardly realistic circumstances and a handful of highflying actors and actresses that know how to own it. The first story concerns a couple of high school sweethearts, Cal (Steve Carell, 'Dinner for Schmucks') and Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore, 'The Kids Are All Right'),that have been married for twenty-five years. However, when Emily tells Cal that slept with a man she works with named David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon, 'X-Men: First Class'), divorce is on the horizon. Inevitably sending Cal to the bar, Cal meets the player in the second love story, Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling, 'Blue Valentince'), who is infamous for his lady-wooing swagger. Jacob sees and hears Cal ranting about his failing marriage and takes him under his wing to help him move on with other women. Even so, Cal may not be the only one changed by their abnormal friendship because of Jacob's hang up on a girl named Hannah (Emma Stone, 'Easy A') he was rejected by the previous night. Meanwhile, Cal and Emily's thirteen-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo, 'Zathura'), is in love with his babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton, 'The Green Hornet') who in turn is in love with Cal. Everything is more connected than you may think and with a flamboyantly annoying performance by Marisa Tomei ('The Wrestler') things get crazy and stupid in this multigenerational love story.The Good: Steve Carell's Post-'Office' years could not of had a stronger start as he conjures the second best performance of his career. However, it would be unfair to say that he is the only reason the film succeeds because of the superb performances of his costars Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. Together the cast will keep you on edge as the story unravels in an obstinately realistic manner. And while Scriptwriter Dan Fogelman's ('Bolt') plan was not visible at first by the end his twisty-turny storytelling culminates in grade A fashion with the unification of the three love stories into one full of smart comedyAfter the aforementioned culmination of plot unification, the film loses its momentum. dragging on for twenty minutes. The film could have ended anytime during its climatic scene and it would have been perfect (I guess you can't always get what you want). It takes twenty extra minutes to get to the actual sloppy and impractical conclusion. Even though everything seemed to be previously settled, this second fallout to set up a preachy ending creates unnecessary forced conflict. Lastly, the inability to avoid predictivity may irk some viewers and makes characters like Josh Groban's as pointless as their casting.The first act of 'Crazy, Stupid Love' creates a series of situations that setup a remarkable amalgamation at the peak of its second act, making the stars in the film (most notably Steve Carell) into even bigger stars with the power of sharp comedy.",8,1,5,30 July 2011
127 Hours," The Will To Live
","'127 Hours' is a film about the real life story about the triumph of a man named Aron Ralston who defying all odds was driven to freedom after spending more than five days trapped with his arm pinned between the narrow canyon wall and an unmovable boulder in a canyon in Moab, Utah. All he had with him was a blunt multipurpose pocket tool, less than a liter of water, a watch, a video camera, a camera, car keys, rope, a sparse amount of food, a harness and the undeniable will to live. The love for his parents and his determination to survive alone drove him to victory. Together award winning director Danny Boyle ('Slumdog Millionaire') and actor James Franco ('Spiderman', 'Milk') have recreated this tale of determination in order to show the world the meaning of the films tagline which states, 'There is no force on earth more powerful than the will to live.' Danny Boyle's cinematic masterpiece will touch and inspire everyone in one way or another. Through flawless cinematography, Boyle documents the five-day struggle of Ralston as he learns about himself and teaches the audience to never give up. Boyle teams up with writer Simon Beaufoy to produce the brilliant adaptation of Aron Ralston's book, 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' that lights the fire for James Franco's performance. Franco has the best performance of his career with his flawless, heartfelt portrayal of Aron Ralston. Franco reveals the anguish and the revelations that Ralston felt while being helplessly trapped by the power and the magnificent forces of nature. Franco's performance shined the brightest in the most powerful scene in the film. After being trapped for five days he realizes that he had no other choice than amputating his own arm with a dull blade to survive. Franco captures the pain that Ralston felt during this excruciating moment leading to his eventual rejoice and relief. Franco's humbling performance is destined for numerous excellence in acting awards and will bring him to the forefront of the Oscar race for best actor. A performance that has caused audiences to cringe and give standing ovations to what may be the best film of the year.The film really is perfect and is not weak at all. However, since there isn't anything about the film I want to use this section to warn those with weak stomachs that in multiple showings of the film there have been people that have fainted because of the realistic self-amputation scene. Don't let this dissuade you from seeing the film, because the film is by far the best film of the year. Just be ready to look away or cover your eyes during this scene. Just follow Aron Ralston's advice, 'You just have to remember that everything will be okay.'Aron Ralston grew up in the city of Denver and attended Cherry Creek High School. He was just another ordinary thrill seeker who was thrown into an extraordinary situation and the greatest challenge of his life. I recommend to see this film now immediately and as many times as you can. We all need to learn something from this story concerning the importance of priorities because when it comes down to life or death the most important things in ones life are realized. Aron Ralston exemplifies this with his emotional statement, 'Mom, Dad I haven't appreciated you as I know that I could. I love you guys and I will always be with you.'",10,2,6,7 November 2010
Just Go with It," Chaos In Hawaii
","On the surface 'Just Go With It' is just another Adam Sandler critic hate fest, however, Sandler is one of the best modern comedians and brings home the laughs once again. The film is actually based on the 1969 film 'Cactus Flower' which received its roots from the French play 'Fleur de cactus'. However, besides the basic plot outline, Adam Sandler's version is vastly different including his trademark crazy, rude, over the top humor. Needless to say Sandler has not lost his way. Sandler's character Danny Maccabee has his heart broken by his fiancé on his wedding day. This leads him to a bar where he is found sulking while still wearing his wedding ring. He discovers that while every other guy in the bar strikes out attempting to hit on Joanna Damon (Minka Kelly, 'The Roommate', 'Gossip Girl'), his wedding ring attracts her to him. This combined with a made up story about how his wife beats him makes her feel bad for him and ultimately sleeping with him. His success leads him to continue his scheme even after becoming a wealthy plastic surgeon, until he meets a woman named Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). She gets extremely upset after finding his wedding ring in his pocket the morning after sleeping with him demanding an explanation. He tells her that he is in the process of getting a divorce and asks his best lady friend and assistant Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Anistan) to act as if she was his wife (soon to be ex). His lie grows more and more that Danny convinces Katherine's kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison, 'Brothers') and Michael (Griffin Gluck) to play the role of his kids. Everything culminates in a 'family' trip to Chaos Hawaii with Danny, Palmer, Katherine, Maggie, Michael and Danny's cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson), where (throughout the chaos) Danny finds out that his heart is actually taking him towards the woman that knows him best.Adam Sandler has been creating very unique romantic comedies for years that are able to reach out to a wider audience. 'Just Go With It' is most definitely a romantic comedy, however, it does not stick it in your face. Instead the film slowly lets the viewer know that the rom-com is there allowing it to have a lot of fun. This is also achieved by creating characters that are all very likable and not stereotypical. Even Katherine's nemesis, Devlin, played by Nicole Kidman turns out to be a very likable character. Lastly, what does every Adam Sandler film need? Well Adam Sandler' mastery of creating good entertainment.The film starts off on a really weak note with very little relevance to the rest of the film. After the opening segment relevance grows, however, the film doesn't really get going until the whole 'family' goes to Hawaii. This creates a very stereotypical cliché experience. Everything in the film has been done before leaving no surprises except some random undeveloped comical interjections which have become a pattern in the past couple years.The film's ending is very predictable, however, Director Dennis Dugan does not throw it in your face allowing the viewer to enjoy the humor of Adam Sandler. This is one of the most entertaining comedies that has come out in a while so 'Just Go To It' now.",7,4,8,17 February 2011
Midnight in Paris," Elusive Perfection: Enchanting, Likable Inspiration
","'Elusive Perfection: Enchanting, Likable Inspiration' Woody Allen directs a mish mash of great actors and actresses in 'Midnight in Paris' bringing them together to create a story about a man's enchantment in Paris. The best Woody Allen movie made in years is much more majestic than his previous work and feels much more lighthearted than his typical films. Shadows of the charm of 'Annie Hall's' success are present, as Owen Wilson ('Hall Pass') becomes a star once again. Wilson's happy-go-lucky attitude combined with his early artsy roots of 'Bottle Rocket' make his interpretation of a successful, laidback Hollywood writer Gil the most likable character of the year. Gil is in love with the city of Paris and wishes and is infatuated with life in an earlier time period (the 1920s). Consequently, when Gil and his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams, 'Sherlock Holmes') travel to Paris with Inez's parents, he becomes lost in the city as he struggles to finish writing his first novel. Gil is searching for inspiration stumbling upon a routine of walking through Paris after midnight. Inez does not support his ambitions and instead goes out with her old stereotypical snobbish French cultured friend Paul Bates (Michael Sheen, 'Tron: Legacy') and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda, 'Win Win'). None of this really matters though as the golden art of cinema is revealed with Gil's story as he meets various characters played by Adrian Brody ('Predators'), Marion Coltiard ('Inception'), Tom Hiddleston ('Thor'), Alison Phil ('Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World), and Kathy Bates ('The Blindside') in the illusion of his night pursuits.Owen Wilson has one of the year's best performances creating one of the most likable characters to ever be on the silver screen. Owen Wilson's personality was perfect for the role, however, his success is ascribed by his ability to delve deeper into his character creating a subtle Oscar worthy performance. The rest of the cast speaks for itself with a handful of contemporary A-list stars guided by an articulate original screenplay of believable imagination. Lastly, praise for the city of Paris is well deserved because without the city where would the movie be? Woody Allen makes one cliché mistake with the development of Rachel McAdam's character Inez. McAdams has a solid performance; the problem is that Inez is portrayed as a complete selfish bitch throughout the film's entirety. Therefore, this brings up questions about why Gil and Inez are together in the first place.An elusive rom-com about a man's discovery of inner harmony allowing him to find someone that understands him. Magic in the modern day setting has never been more humorous, convincing, or perfect.",10,2,5,18 June 2011
The Expendables," Testosterone Action Fest
","See it Now! My Critical Perspective: B- Personal Perspective: A-Sylvester Stallone first was Rocky. Then he was Rambo and now he is Barney Ross, the leader of The Expendables. He is the ultimate action hero, but is not alone as he directs some of Hollywood's biggest action heroes of the past 40 years. (Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Bruce Willis, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren AKA The Russian from Rocky IV, Arnold Schwartzenegger, Steve Austin, Randy Couture and Mickey Rourke) The Good: The film is exactly what you think it is going to be which is a testosterone packed action fest. The film knows its identity and does not go onto unnecessary tangents sub stories. The whole point of the film is to get these actors together to kick some major ass! The Bad: The film does not totally develop all of the characters and tends to focus mainly on two or three of the expendables (Sylvester Stalone, Jason Statham, and Dolph Lundgren). Also, there are some scenes that are unclear and confusing and do not seem to flow very well.Final Thought: The stunts and special effects combined with these action heroes make the film what it is a nonstop action film with no strings attached. A very enjoyable flick! Therefore, I recommend to See It Now! In theaters!",7,3,8,6 September 2010
The Way Back," Impossible, Incredible, Freedom
","Six-time Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir ('Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World', 'The Truman Show') directed and wrote the adaptive screenplay for 'The Way Back' based on the book 'The Long Walk: A True Story of a Trek to Freedom' by Slawomir Rawicz, a Polish POW from the Soviet Gulag where the story begins, and on real life accounts of the journey. The film unluckily missed a very well deserved 2010 Oscar birth telling the tale about an unthinkable journey of kinship created between a diverse group of Soviet Gulag escapees. Their journey covers 4,000 miles from Siberia to freedom in India giving meaning to the word incredible. The cinematography is used most majestically by capturing panoramas of the strikingly dangerous yet breathtakingly beautiful landscapes. The splendor of the film goes beyond the wilderness with the selection of a very accurate and diverse cast starring Jim Sturgess ('21'), Ed Harris ('The Rock'), Colin Farrel ('In Bruges'), Saoirse Ronan ('The Lovely Bones'), and Mark Strong ('Sherlock Holmes'). Together they recreate the peril and wonder of the impossible journey on foot that started with the idea of a man named Khabrov (Strong) to break out of the Godforsaken Soviet Gulag in Siberia. A Polish man named Janusz, driven by the fire to get back to his wife, puts the idea into action. An older, wise American known as Mr. Smith (Harris) joins ranks when he hears about Janusz's plans and warns him that Khabarov never had any aspiration to actually leave the place. However, the idea becomes a reality attracting an indebt prisoner named Valka (Farrel) and four other men escaping the Gulag and meeting a young girl named Irena (Ronan) on the path to freedom.The story is synonymous with walking more than a marathon every day through harsh terrain, uncontrollable elements and lack of food and water for an open-ended amount of time. The gravity of the story is unmatched by any film released this year; told through the art of cinematography and the acting talents of the cast. Both Oscar worthy aspects of the film, however, the cinematography itself is unmatched by any 2010 film. Also, a lot can be said about the all-star cast concerning Jim Sturges, Ed Harris, Colin Farrel, Mark Strong, and Saoirse Ronan and their superb character portrayals; however, there is one other actor that stands out. A man in the group named Zoran played by Dragos Bucar is able to break through the thin layer of dramatic tension in the film with his clever social humor. The comedy he creates does not take away from the story and instead adds to the story allowing the characters to unwind and have a good time. The outcomes to films within the 'jailbreak' genre are inevitably easy to predict, therefore, causing films like 'The Way Back' to work hard in order to be original. 'The Way Back' does a very good job by differentiating the way it is captured on film through its beautiful cinematography; however, great films such as 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Great Escape' will always be on top of the genre. 'The Way Back' isn't far off though with its main shortcoming stemming from the ending relying on a storyline tangent not fully developed (not the montage, the montage is great).This is the most underrated movie of 2010 with its limited advertising exposure, release and lack of award fulfillment with only one Oscar nomination for Best Make Up (well deserved as the group of survivors' skin is torn apart by the elements). A 4,000-mile true story taking place in the World War II era with excellent cinematography and great acting seems like the ideal candidate for the Oscars. So why was this must see film left in the shadows?",9,93,120,2 February 2011
Megamind," Will Farrell's Personal Avatar
","The release of 'Megamind' on the first Friday in November marks the beginning of the winter blockbuster season and shows that Will Farrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, David Cross and Jonah Hill know how to draw a crowd to the box office. 'Megamind' is the latest DreamWorks animation story that incorporates different aspects from Superman. The basic plot concerns the epic rivalry that began when a blue super villain alien named Megamind (Will Farrell) and his arch nemesis superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt) were babies. They both were saved from the destruction of their respective planets by small spacecrafts destined for earth. Their rivalry continued as they both grew up living very different separate lives fighting periodically through the years. All of these battles resulted in the defeat of Megamind up until one day that changed both of their lives forever and Megamind's perspective of good versus evil.The character Megamind is an exact replica of what Will Farrell would look like if James Cameron made him into an Avatar. With this being said Will Farrell is funnier than ever and is able to carry his humor over from his movies aimed at an older audience and transform it into humor appropriate for younger kids. The film also has a special guest appearance from the film's producer Ben Stiller as the voice of the character Bernard. Tina Fey ('SNL', 'Date Night') is also in the film playing the voice of news reporter Roxanne Ritchi who is involved in a very interesting love affair with Stiller's character Bernard. David Cross's and Jonah Hill's characters join the party as well playing the characters of Minion and Hal respectively in very different and dynamic performances. Despite the voices of these actors, the best part of the film is the entertainment value that Will Farrell brings to the table.Brad Pitt's character Metro Man is also animated to a T, depicting exactly what Pitt would look like as an animated superhero. However, Pitt is almost nonexistent in the film after the opening ten-minutes of the movie. Where did he go? The disappearance of Pitt hurts the film and complicates the story line that should have been simple and straightforward. The film suffers from animated movieitis stemming from plot holes, discontinuities and lack of substance. Characters that should not have been very important to the film are developed into main characters, while making the film 'Pittless.' Therefore, the movie as a whole does not succeed in creating a compelling story.Overall, the film is a very entertaining, fun family film that everyone can enjoy. However, you can wait for DVD to see it. Also, don't expect a film in the same league as 'Toy Story 3' or 'How to Train Your Dragon,' instead expect a film that relies solely on the humor of Will Farrell as he succeeds in stealing the spotlight on the animated screen once again as he did in the 2006 film 'Curious George.'",6,1,5,8 November 2010
Horrible Bosses," Balanced Casting: Bosses Better Be Nice!
","Everyone who has ever worked can sympathize with having a boss that is horrible to be around. If not, everyone at least has someone in his or her life that makes life hell. Director Seth Gordon ('Four Christmases') has exploited this idea in the perfectly casted, logically over-the-top, daydream comedy 'Horrible Bosses'. The exposition of the film is very intelligent establishing the relationship a trio of friends has with their respective bosses. Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman, 'Paul') works at a large corporation burning the candle on both ends in order to receive a promotion from his boss Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey, 'Casino Jack'). However, Harken is unequivocally evil and absorbs the position instead of giving Nick the job. When Nick tries to quit, Harkin threatens to ruin his life. Kurt Buckman (Jason Sudeikis, 'Hall Pass') has a similar problem at a chemical plant when his boss Jack Pellit (Donald Sutherland, 'The Mechanic') dies, leaving his crazy, coked up son, Bobby (Colin Farrell, 'The Way Back'), as the new boss. Conversely, Dale Arbus (Charlie Day, 'Going the Distance') is a dental assistant to the overly nice and inappropriately sexy Dr. Julia Harris (Jennifer Aniston, 'Just Go With It'). After Julia blackmails him into not telling his fiancé that she is trying to sleep with him, Dale solidifies a scheme with Nick and Kurt to kill their bosses. With the help of proclaimed murder expert, Dean 'MF' Jones (Jamie Foxx, 'Due Date'), nothing could go wrong as they challenge the limits of comedy procuring a belly full of laughs.Finally a great movie idea hasn't been wasted on a slapdash script, poor directing, and unworthy actors. Instead Director Gordon and his screenwriters have contrived a new kind of buddy comedy so ridiculous everyone can relate to it. This is achieved by the smartest casting of the year seamlessly balancing the star power of the protagonists (Bateman, Sudeikis and Day) and antagonists (Spacey, Farrel, and Aniston). Both parties are worthy of the audience's attention with each star distinguishing his or her self from the other with a unique formula of hilarity. TO make things even better Jamie Foxx can do no wrong with his portrayal of murder consultant MF.Everything is very smooth throughout the majority of the film until the climax is reached and the resolution takes place. Gordon directs a very clever film up to this point connecting all of the characters and expressing the audience's concerns, but when it begins to conclude the film is very lazy. A disconnect sets in that is not necessarily cliché, it just should have been much better. Also, Jennifer Aniston's sexual performance is so over-the-top viewers will either love it or hate it.'Horrible Bosses'' perfect balanced casting blends acting veterans with up-in-coming comedic stars to create a film that connects with the audience through awkward situations and laugh out loud humor. Bosses beware, you better be nice!",8,8,15,10 July 2011
Tangled," 3D Golden Animated Beauty
","'Tangled' is the newest film in the animated world of Disney released just in time for the Holiday movie rush. The film combines the old school classic Disney feel with animation of the modern times. The magic of song and dance flows as glamorously as Repunzel's hair itself through this new tale. After making fifty films, Disney has finally made one about the story of Repunzel explaining giving meaning to the lines, 'Repunzel, Repunzel let down your hair.' The story of Repunzel is available in both 3d and 2d and instead of the 2d Animation Disney tried to bring back last year with 'The Princess and the Frog,' modern animation and is used. The film begins with the sarcastic narration of Zacharey Levi's ('Chuck') character Flynn Rider as he explains the legend of Repunzel's (Mandy Moore) hair consisting of a special flower used to save her mother's life. The story then follows Repunzel as she seeks out the answers to questions about her child hood and who the Mother Gothal (Donna Murphy) that is keeping her up in a secluded tower really is. She asks herself what the lights are that appear in the sky on each of her birthdays? Flynn Rider is an outlaw who is more connected to Repunzel than she knows with his latest heist. The story changes both of the characters as they grow towards happily ever after. The film is a visual masterpiece showing the 3d golden beauty of the animation. Repunzel's sunlit hair flourishes across the screen as the love affair between Mandy Moore's and Zacherey Levi's characters grow through the personalities of the actors portraying them. Disney finds the perfect balance between dance and song for Repunzel, Flynn and company to express very important moments in the film. The songs are crafted as dialogue more than just catchy tunes meant to please the audience and they aren't done in a gaudy fashion like previous Disney films. The film is also a little darker than usual, ending in a more logical sense. Don't worry though, the film does not lose its magic. Comedy is present in order to keep the film fresh and happy as Repunzel's kidnapper Mother Gothel exemplifies her ridiculous relationship with Repunzel. Disney recognizes that its films tend to be very predictable and mocks itself with the dialogue of Flynn throughout. This allows the film to be more believable and captures laughs from the audience as well.There isn't much in the film for adults other than the animation splendor and a little entertainment, while the almost too Disney film will be immensely enjoyed by younger little kids.. On the other hand the film does have a scary moment as well? The entire film caters entirely to kids until one frightening moment that may cause a squirm or two. The film will not seem very different story-wise to many of the classics that the older audience has already scene throughout Disney's forty-nine other films, therefore it may leave you a little unfulfilled. There are definitely a lot of hokey over dramatized scenes that could have and should have been taken out. Jokes and drama that has been overused in Disney's past and lacks a fresh contemporary application or feel.Audiences have a film that they can take their family to throughout this holiday season. A G rating would almost suffice, however, the only problem is that there is a scene that may scare some kids. However, don't let this dissuade you from going because the PG rating fits the film perfect and is worth seeing this 'Tangled' story of happily ever after now!",7,2,4,29 November 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," America's Underdog: Retrofied and Wow-Factor-Free
","This is the first 'Avengers'' film from Marvel's contemporary franchise that puts aside imprudent jokes and replaces them with retrofied art direction and an old-fashioned superhero scheme powered by superbly written characters. However, while 'Captain America: The First Avenger' avoids being classically campy, it falls short of being great with its lack of a wow-factor. Therefore, the film wields a double-edged sword tapping into new comic adaptation ground, but still suffering from clichés and an underwhelming predictable end of the world plot. Consequently, the real triumph in the film comes from Chris Evans's ('Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World') portrayal of Steve Rogers. He becomes a star straying away from his arrogant roots; instead embodying a meek, courageous, man aspiring to serve in the U.S. army in World War II. After Rogers was rejected from the service numerous times because of his small stature and health issues, Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci, 'Easy A') sees his valor. Erskine then offers Rogers a chance of a lifetime allowing him to join the army under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips's (Tommy Lee Jones, 'No Country for Old Men'). The Colonel begins to doubt Erskine's decision, but Rogers's courage allows him to transform into America's hero with the help of Howard Stark's (Dominic Cooper, 'An Education') technology. Now Captain 'Rogers' America must lead a group of soldiers on a quest to kill a Nazi named Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving, 'Lord of the Rings') who delves into a mystic power changing himself into the infamous Red Skull.'Captain America' is the classiest and most serious 'Avengers'' film because of its authentic acting and art direction. Director Joe Johnson ('The Wolfman') utilizes the color spectrum to perfection creating passé visuals. He pairs this with a screenplay focused on furthering character and story development instead of over-the-top action oriented entertainment allowing Chris Evans to become a star. Evans makes a 360-degree transformation from his accustomed cocky characters, to becoming the face of underdog America. The story is further helped by its supporting casting casting choices including Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, and its worthy villain portrayed by Hugo Weaving.While trying to redefine the modern superhero film with classic cinematic roots, the film transgresses and loses its momentum. The film is awkwardly stuck in the middle of uniqueness and hopelessly cliché making what could have been a great movie into only being a good flick. Johnson was very aware of the generic environment his film was in and wanted to be different by cutting out the melodramatic action; however, this is still a superhero movie. Therefore, an hour of boring exposition building up to an anticlimactic ending is a disappointment.'Captain America: The First Avenger' proves that a superhero movie can be well-scripted, well art directed and superbly acted especially by its star. However, where is the wow-factor that makes you want to be a superhero? It must not have existed until the 'X-Men' came on the scene in the 60s.",Null,8,19,24 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Evil's Calling
","The six previous Harry Potter films were good in their own right, however part one of the seventh installment is director David Yates's masterpiece (since he took over the series with The Order of The Phoenix in 2007). Yates targets a more adult and grown up audience in this film, however, it is a very familiar audience and gives the original fans of the series a more contemporary film that has developed with its fans themselves. Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson's acting talents have matured after being together for so many films creating flawless chemistry. They help create an entirely different dark and evil atmosphere. The film delves deep into the realms of while inserting the comedic antics along to lift the audience up along the way. Therefore, leave the kids at home and prepare for the series' best chance for an an heard of best picture nomination. Yates sets the tone of the film right away with the words of Bill Nighy's character Rufus Scrimgeour, 'These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.' This is a very important statement and follows Harry, Ron and Hermione on their journey to destroy the Horcruxes and discover the Deathly Hallows to the films heroic somber conclusion opening up the evil realm in which Part 2 will be encapsulated in.David Yates rallies his young actors in the film and has inspired them to give the best performances of their careers. It is obvious that experience has grown within them and has been passed down to these young actors by a very well known, experienced and talented supporting cast including Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix), Alan Rickman (Snape), Bill Nighy (Rufus) and Brandon Gleeson (Mad Eye Moody). The cast's talent is driven by a very successful and thought out adaptive screenplay by Steve Kloves that captures both the magic and the emotion of JK Rolling's novels. The visuals in the film are the best of the series flawlessly bringing the book to life. Yates exploits this because he was able to make the film follow the book the best out of all of the previous films because he had two films to do it. Characters have been developed to a whole new level in the film allowing one of the littlest characters Dobby the house elf to own the screen. Dobby is captured perfectly on film as the bad ass that was undersold in the books. All of this helped to create the cinematic Harry potter triumph, but it is the ending of the film where the film shines the brightest. The series has become apart of many people's lives and is viewed as a part of reality. Therefore the ending the film places the audience in the middle of the anguish the characters feel and even fans who already know how the story ends will be cheering nonetheless to see how Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 ends.The film only tells half of the final Harry Potter story causing the audience to wait until July 2011 to see the story's emotional conclusion. Two tickets are needed several months apart to see the entire five plus hour conclusion. This is no longer a family movie, therefore, children need to be left at home while viewing this deep metaphorical journey. Also, in order to see this film and understand what is going on it is necessary to see the six previous films or have read the books. Failure to do this will leave you dazed and confused because even though this is the best of the films it relies heavily on the foundation that the previous films have built.Even though the film only tells half of the story leaving you wanting more, do not let this fool you because you will be fulfilled. Go see it now and let Dobby show you what house elves can do and prepare yourself for the second part of the epic finale.",9,0,0,23 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Animated Action: Second and Third Dimension Pleasantry
","Jack Black is at his best when embodying an unlikely kung fu fighting Panda named Po. With more action and even better visuals than the original, Kung Fu Panda 2 is successful at being a memorable and entertaining sequel. Behind the scenes, Direcor Jennifer Yuh creates the visuals of the film by pairing unique 2D story telling animation with traditional contemporary 3D distinguishing between various elements of the film's story. The story builds off of the first film very well continuing the growth of Po as the Dragon Warrior. Questions not explored in the original are delved into uncovering where Po came from. Because lets face it Mr. Ping (James Hong, 'Mulan') isn't exactly a panda and is only Po's adopted father. Even so, Mr. Ping acts as a very good loving father and is aided by Po's newfound glory with the growth of his noodle shop's popularity. Po does not see his adopted father as much because of Po's new responsibilities and search for his real parents. A new power crazy antagonist by the name of Lord Shen (Gary Oldman, 'The Dark Knight') joins the series threatening the extinction of kung fu forever with the creation of a new weapon. With the help of the furious five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie, 'The Tourist'), Monkey (Jackie Chan, 'The Karate Kid'), Mantis (Seth Rogen, 'Paul'), Viper (Lucy Liu, 'Kill Bill: Volume 1), and Crane (David Cross, 'Megamind'), Po must save kung fu and China. But where would these six be without Dustin Hoffman reprising his role as the wise Master Shifu providing Po with a new challenge to find and master inner peace.The film is all about the visual choices of 2D and 3D animation contrasting flashbacks from Po's present creating colorful, visually pleasant film. This is necessary when showcasing the significant increase in action over the original film. This is rightfully so because this is a film about animals showing off their kung fu fighting skills creating an action movie for kids. Also, the voice actors in this franchise could not have been chosen better. Jack Black is in his element masked by a big cuddly panda backed by the writers holding back the urge to overuse the famous phrase 'Skadoosh' skillfully waiting for the most epic moment in the film.A weak story comes with sequel territory; therefore, it almost goes without saying that 'Kung Fu Panda 2' has its plot flaws. However, this does not hurt the film as much as it holds the film back from being great. Instead it has to settle for a good solid predictable flick. In the end the story is not the selling point of the movie and acts as a setup for the third installment of the series leaving the audience with an open ending.Entertaining blockbuster animation at its best placing Jack Black back into his comfort zone as a voice actor within a spectacle of action and color. Perfect timing with the completion of the 'Toy Story' franchise leaving room for 'Kung Fu Panda' to grow into something great.",8,0,0,18 June 2011
No Strings Attached," Strings of Awkward Romantic Comedy
","Natalie Portman comes out of award season on top with her numerous Best Actress Awards for her performance in 'Black Swan' including the Critic's Choice Award, the Golden Globe Award and an Oscar in the near future. Now she takes on the romantic comedy genre for the first time since her 2004 hit 'Garden State'. Her costar Ashton Kutcher on the other hand is no stranger to the romantic comedy genre with most of his recent films falling into this genre ('Killers', 'Valentine's Day', and 'What Happens In Vegas'). Together they create comedy through the awkwardly realistic chemistry between their characters Emma and Adam. Their quirky relationship begins when they are both sexually frustrated teenagers at summer camp. This leads them to becoming acquaintances throughout the early years of their relationship until they are thrown into each other's lives for the last time. Emma is a successful doctor who works eighty hours a week and is not looking for a relationship, while Adam is an aspired writer looking for a break working at a 'gleeish' television show. Their latest encounter leads the two into a sexual dilemma as they make a pact to enter into a relationship with 'No Strings Attaches' in other words no commitment, just sex. However, eventually the strings have to be attached.The best part of the film is the surprisingly accurate and realistic interactions that Emma and Adam together. They are definitely not faking it as they recreate relationship situations by acting weird around each other, which is exactly what you do when you are in a relationship. Their supporting cast was also very important to the entertainment of the film and the theme of differentiation between relationships. The most notable character being Kevin Klines portrayal of Adam's father Alvin as he dates his own son's ex-girlfriends. The film is all about comedy aspect of all of these relationships and leaves out drama for the most part without totally forgetting about it. This does not change the fact that the film has a very touching ending no matter how cliché it is.If it wasn't for the great casting of Portman and Kutcher at the center of the film creating superb chemistry all would be lost among ever other rom-com. This is because the film isn't original at all. It is just a basic Hollywoodized picture perfect romantic comedy, but sometimes a movie just barely lucks out when a couple stars are able to salvage the overdone cliché storyline. Many may say that the film is too similar to the recent release of 'Love and Other Drugs' just a few months ago. However, no matter how similar the basic plot structure of these two films is, they are very different films. While 'Love and Other Drugs' follows the purely sexual relationship of its two main characters in the same way that 'No Strings Attached' does, it also delves into the realms of the genre of drama. On the other hand 'No Strings Attached' avoids those depths and instead relies on the awkward comedy of romantic see it now bliss.",7,36,53,22 January 2011
Bridesmaids," Matrimony: Unbelievably Believable
","'Matrimony: Unbelievably Believable' Director Paul Feig and Producer Judd Apatow have successfully created a romantic comedy that breaks through the usual limitations and rules of the genre. Bridesmaids proves that women can be as raunchy as men releasing the ridiculous upon audiences in original fashion backed by heart. Kristen Wiig has finally proved that she is much more than the goof seen on Saturday Night Live jumping to the top of the comedy genre brining the buddy comedy to the feminine arena. Wiig stars as a thirty-something year old women named Annie whose life is headed on a downward spiral. Her roommates are impossible to live with, her job sucks and her love life is nonexistent except for meaningless sexual escapades with a man named Ted (Jon Hamm, The Town). To top it off her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph, Away We Go) puts things into perspective when telling Annie she is getting married. On the bright side, Lillian has chosen Annie to be her Maid of Honor giving Annie something worth working for. Annie's excitement doesn't last long as she meets Lillian's diverse bridesmaids choices, Megan (Melissa McCarthy, CBS's Mike and Molly ), Becca (Ellie Kemper, NBC's The Office), and Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey, Reno 911!: Miami) along with Helen (Rose Byrne, Get Him to the Greek) who uses her wealth and power to takeover as Maif of Honor. Annie has hit bottom and with the support of a police officer named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, Gulliver's Travels) and the antics of female relationships, she embarks on a hilarious yet meaningful journey to rediscover herself. Bridesmaids differentiates itself from the rom-com stereotype with the clever cliché-free scriptwriting of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo. No matter how outrageous the jokes become, they are smart, fun and unbelievably believable. Consequently, the film controls the outrage allowing the humor to improve the story and support the almost perfect Apatow cast. For example, Melissa McCarthy acts like a complete idiot racking up the laughs giving male raunch a run for its money. However, the stand out performance and the best performance of an actress this year so far comes from Kristen Wiig's multidimensional melding of comedy and drama.How do you complain about a movie as unique as Bridesmaids? Well first audiences expecting to see a chick flick have no idea what they are getting themselves into and if they cannot take the raunch it is going to be a painful two hours. Also, while the film is titled Bridesmaids, viewers may expect a story based around more than one woman, when in actuality it is not. Even so, the only real problem with the film is its song and dance happy ending, undermining what could have been a great finale.Comedies bordering the two-hour mark usually have a hard time engrossing the audience as the jokes run thin and the drama ensues, however, Bridesmaids' comedy becomes smarter and smarter giving each of the bridesmaids a matrimonial purpose in Wiig's fasttrack to the A-List.",9,14,25,15 May 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," 'Caesar's Serkis: A Symbol Against Oppression'
","Director Rupert Wyatt ('The Escapist') proves there is always time for firsts by successfully producing a movie of epic proportions and creating the best 'Planet of the Apes' film since the original. By taking a different and innovative route Wyatt has saved the once dying franchise making it better than ever. Wyatt generates a completely new origins story in 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', however, Wyatt still needed one last thing; an actor that could flawlessly personify an ape's transformation. Consequently, Andy Serkis ('The Lord of the Rings') is Wyatt's ace and casting James Franco ('127 Hours') didn't hurt one bit. Will Rodman (Franco) is a scientist looking for a cure for his father, Charles (John Lithgow, Showtime's 'Dexter'), whose Alzheimer's is progressing. To do so, Will gives a dose of his drug to a chimpanzee who shows heightened intelligence. However, when Will presents his findings, an event leads to the shutdown of his project. When told to kill a baby chimp found in the lab, he sneaks it home naming it Caesar (Serkis). Will secretly continues to perfect a cure for his father, while taking care of Caesar with the help of his father and animal doctor Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto, 'Slumdog Millionaire'), who almost immediately becomes Will's girl friend. Serkis inevitably steals the show as the film goes through a cycle of drama, action, and Armageddon. He allows Caesar to become more than just a symbol against animal oppression, he becomes a symbol of freedom.The film has everything an apocalyptic movie needs. To start its plot may have a few minor holes, but the intense drama oriented storyline centered on humanity and personal development is enthralling. This build up culminates in the best action sequence of the year mixing amazing visual effects technology and the raw power of animals. With this being said, James Franco and John Lithgow are superb in their respective roles, but the acting does not stop there. Andy Serkis is the only person that could do the character of Caesar justice proving Serkis's genius and foreshadowing an Oscar nomination in the coming months.The biggest issues in this film can be attributed to script writing and specifically dialogue. The screenplay has a couple of minor plot holes, but they do not detract much from the story. However, the dialogue is horridly juvenile in sequences and is even worse when actors like Tom Felton ('Harry Potter') are in the spotlight. Then there is the character of Caroline (Freida), whose existence in the film is pointless beyond helping Caesar at the beginning and dating Will. Why do films disregard casting beyond its stars? Ultimately, this is the best apocalypse film I have seen since 'I Am Legend' and is a showcase to the future of acting. While Andy Serkis embodies Smeagol/Gollum, he is undistinguishable from Caesar making them one in the same.",Null,0,1,27 August 2011
Unknown," Tolstoy's Bourne
","'Unknown' is based on the French book 'Out of My Head' written by Didiar van Cauwelaert. The film brings a very diverse all-star cast to the table including January Jones ('Mad Men'), Diana Kruger ('Troy', 'National Treasure'), Frank Langella (Best Actor Nomination, 'Frost/Nixon') and most importantly Liam Neeson ('Schindler's List', 'Taken'). Neeson appeared in seven films last year ranging from 'The A-Team' to 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader' exemplifying his popularity and acting ability in Hollywood. Therefore, because of his vast repertoire of flicks, Liam Neeson is in very familiar territory with his newest character Dr. Martin Harris. The viewer is greeted with Harris going to a medical conference in Berlin with his wife Elizabeth Harris (January Jones), but as he is about to enter the hotel he realizes that he left one of his bags at the airport. Without telling his wife, he jumps in a cab driven by a woman named Gina (Diana Kruger) and heads back to the airport. Chaos is set free when an unavoidable car accident throws the cab off of a bridge into water below. Gina gets away injury free after saving Martin's life. However, Martin was not so lucky. After being in a coma for a few days, Martin does not remember where he is or who he is. While investigating, his wife denies knowing him, bringing up questions of conspiracy in a movie that is impossible for a viewer to figure out until the end.Originality definitely isn't a problem for this film because of its vast ambiguity. Therefore, that aspect will not disappoint those looking for an original film. The problem is that the only other things good about the film are the performances of Diane Kruger, Frank Langella, the awkwardly enjoyable performance of Bruno Ganz (Founder of Schaubuehne Theater Company in Berlin), and Liam Neeson, who obviously led the show. The reason why Liam Neeson is an A-list actor is his ability to play very balanced roles. He always goes as far as he can with a role without overdoing it making him relevant and believable.'Unknown' tries way too hard to be ambiguous and original therefore creating an ending that just isn't that spectacular. Too many twists and turns send the plot into completely opposite directions. The only things logical about the movie are the performances within it. Otherwise the film ends leaving numerous loose ends and meaningless plot tangents, causing a lot of things in the film to remain 'unknown.' Not to mention the fact that the action aspect of the film is completely forgotten, making the film boring and dull.The movie lacks the thrill factor because of endless twists failing to be followed by fast paced, heart pounding action. Therefore, 'Unknown' is 'The Bourne Series' meets the lengthy, longwinded Tolstoy novel 'War and Peace'.",5,1,5,21 February 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Love: Simply Fate
","Finally, an original take on the over done love story about boy meets girl, boy can't be with girl, boy does what ever it takes to be with girl. There is a twist this time around concerning an uncontrollable higher power as boy redefines the meaning of giving up everything. Writer Director George Nolfi (Writer, 'The Bourne Ultimatum') creates another thrilling screenplay with its roots coming from a short story called the 'Adjustment Team,' written by Philip K. Dick starring Matt Damon ('Hereafter') and Emily Blunt ('The Young Victoria'). Damon plays a party hard young man named David Norris who grows up to become a very famous politician with a heartbreak past. Norris is destined for greatness, however, after leading the senate race for New York state he loses leading him to the one place on earth that he can relax and be alone, the bathroom. After practicing his losing speech supported by very well crafted film editing, he meets a woman named Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). After kissing her he is inspired to give the best speech he has ever given making him the front-runner for the next election. He feels as if he is destined to be with Elise, but does not have anyway to keep in contact with her. He tries his hardest to see her again, but what he does not realize is that there is a greater force at power concerning a group known as the Adjustment Bureau. Why can't he be with Elise and how far will he go to be with her? 'The Adjustment Bureau is a supernatural, spiritual, religious thriller about mastering ones fate at any cost.Besides being very well written and original 'The Adjustment Bureau' is just a really cool movie. It is a love story that guys have no excuse to not go to with their girlfriends, because it is much more than that. First of all Matt Damon, the king of thrillers most well known for the 'Bourne Trilogy', stars in the film in which he is essentially on his own against fate. The ever so talented Emily Blunt is lovely to watch on screen as well with her good looks and superb acting ability, making a very well acted film. The Adjustment Bureau itself was very well depicted revealing just enough of their secrets, while leaving room for plenty of mystery. All of them also look awesome with because of their characterization and costumes (hats and overcoats). A simple yet very complicated and deep film is produced leaving you to even understand your life a little better.The shortcomings in this film can be attributed to minor details. The film does its best to be simple, but at certain points unexplainable incongruities appear that contradict other explanations. However, these shortcomings aren't big enough to hurt the film. Other complaints may stem from the films preachy religious ending that may be a let down for some audiences.'The Adjustment Bureau' is a part of a release weekend marking the beginning of good 2011 films. It is a different kind of love story that does not necessarily have a bad guy and a good guy simply about a man and a woman who want to be with each other. Is it fate? After leaving the theater you may even think that you were meant to see the film.",9,1,2,15 March 2011
Friends with Benefits," 'Contemporarily Relevant: The Sex Buddy Disparity'
","'Contemporarily Relevant: The Sex Buddy Disparity' 'No Strings Attached 2'? No, it is another film about a couple of people trying to make an emotionless relationship based around sex work; Natalie Portman's 'Black Swan' costar just happens to be in it. Director Will Gluck's ('Easy A') 'Friends With Benefits' is a better disparity of the sex buddy concept than the aforementioned because of its array of genuine characters starting with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Dyan (Justin Timberlake, 'The Social network') works as an art director of an online media company (my dream job) in California and has just been dumped by his girl friend Kayla (Emma Stone, 'Easy A'). The other player, Jamie (Mila Kunis, 'Book of Eli') is a headhunter in New York that has also been dumped by her boyfriend Quincy (Andy Samberg, 'I Love You Man'). Dyan was 'emotionally unavailable' while Jamie was 'emotionally damaged' making them the perfect match when Jamie meets Dylan at the airport to facilitate his job offer with a nation renowned magazine. Dylan inevitably takes the job and with one friend in New York to turn to, Dylan and Jamie become really close. As the sexual tension builds, they make fun of a clichÃ© Jason Segel ('Bad Teacher') and Rashida Jones ('The Social Network') rom-com and embark on an emotion free series ofsexual escapades. The relationship becomes much more as they begin to open up to each other transforming the happy-go-lucky comedy into a dramatic (but not overly dramatic) conclusion with splendid performances by Richard Jenkins ('Hall Pass'), Patricia Clarkson ('Easy A') and Woody Harrelson ('Zombieland').The coolest part of the film is that everything from its lingo to the character's jobs and even the credits give the film a relevant contemporary feel. Also, while the characters are goofy, they have a lot of heart making the film's conclusion clichely fulfilling and allowing the cast to fluently connect with the audience. The chemistry between all of which makes the movie feel unscripted, making Timberlake and Kunis into a naturally perfect on screen matchup. Timberlake and Kunis must step aside, as Richard Jenkins runs away with his authentic portrayal of a man suffering from Alzheimer's that will make you laugh and cry (especially for one like me who works at an Alzheimer's and Dementia home).Everything bad about the film is self-explanatory because if you are expecting a genre defining rom-com without a predictable ending, you have been misled. While, Director Glick follows suit of 'Easy A', making fun of the genre, in the end there really isn't much more he could do. The genre is fixed, and can be very repetitive leaving too much room for pointless moments. 'Friends With Benefits' seems to avoid space filling jokes most of the time, but still lets moments like the unnecessary Sean White cameo overstay their welcome.Romantic Comedies have not changed much at all over the years, but if you are looking for a film that is current and has praiseworthy actors embodying genuine characters, 'Friends With Benefits' is the fun and true solution.",Null,1,4,25 July 2011
Super 8," Sci-Fi Magic: Through A Child's Eyes
","Producer Steven Spielberg received exactly what he wanted from J.J. Abrams ('Star Trek') with his direction of 'Super 8.' Back to the old school feel of sci-fi cinema, Abrams directs a cast of average and unknown stars allowing the audience to focus their attention on the movie as a whole instead of individual cast members. The film creates a refreshing kick back to film before the term 'tween' was incepted as the young cast takes control of the screen leaving out drama found in abundance in contemporary cinema. Instead this is replaced with a believable love story and logical dramatic situations. The filmatic magic opens in the summer of 1979 after Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney's debut role) loses his mother. Joe's best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths's debut role) is an aspiring young director that continually preaches about 'production value' as the two friends film Charles's zombie movie with friends Cary (Ryan Lee, 'Shorts'), Preston (Zach Mills, 'Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium')and Martin (Gabriel Basson, 'Alabama Moon'). After realizing the film needs a love story they seek out the talents of the girl of their dreams, Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning, 'Somewhere') sparking some unfinished business. During a night of shooting at the local train station they witness a pickup truck run into a train sending it off the tracks and releasing an unknown mysterious being. While trying to finish their movie they investigate the phenomenon. Meanwhile, Joe's father Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler, 'King Kong') is coping with the loss of his wife while receiving more and more responsibility becoming the face of hope in the town with everything spinning out of control.Abrams exploits his patented lens flare filming style abundant in 'Star Trek' giving the film an overall mystical, science fiction tone. This adds to the art direction of the film and brings to life a superlative script written by Abrams filled with comic relief attributed from the cheesiness of the lingo of the 1980s. This strong backbone allows the young inexperienced cast to flourish shooting the film through their eyes causing the audience to experience the film as kids. It is refreshing to see the most successful moments of the film coming from the performances of the kids; something hard to find in modern cinema.The film is very good and it may even be labeled as great, but it will always fall in the shadows of 'E.T.' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' This is because while being a sci-fi film, 'Super 8' is a more logical film than the two aforementioned and therefore some sequences seem to be a little bit of a reach within Abrams's script writing. These tiny details have held the movie back from reaching its full potential, even though it is still a memorable flashback to a great time period in cinema making it one of the year's best.The film is a mixture of classic films like 'The Goonies' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' with a modern feel. And if you let the magic take hold, you may even feel the awe of a carefree kid seeing a science fiction movie for the first time.",Null,0,1,18 June 2011
Rio," Ordinary: The New Angry Bird
","Director Carlos Saldanha has temporarily abandoned his 'Ice Age' saga moving to the warm, beautiful jungle and city of Rio de Janeiro following colorful birds in the kid safe movie 'Rio.' While the G rating targets young children, adults may find some entertainment from the straightforward, colorful song and dance of Brazilian birds. The problem is 'Rio' does not bring anything fresh to the animated escape genre. To begin, the film briefly takes place in Moose Lake, Minnesota after bird smugglers transfer a new catch from Rio to the U.S. Their goal is to sell them as pets, however, they accidentally leave a blue Macaw named Blu (Jesse Eisenberg, 'The Social Network') on the side of the road. In Moose Lake Blu is domesticated throughout the years as he befriends a lady named Linda (Leslie Mann, 'Funny People'). Life is perfect until Blu and Linda are informed by a scientist named Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro, '300') that Blu must go back to Rio in order to save his species from extinction. In Rio things start off rocky as he serenades his other half Jewel (Anne Hathaway, 'Love and Other Drugs') and turn to the worse as the two are forced to escape the bonds of smugglers once again. They are aided on their journey by a seasoned entertainment cast including Will I Am, Jamie Foxx, Tracy Morgan and George Lopez. While the birds are running, flying and chirping for their lives another cliché love story forms between Linda and Tulio adding to the overall happy ending.The vibrant carefree musical vibes of Brazil are seen throughout the movie giving appeal to its colorful birds. The smart vocal casting of musical artists and contemporary acting stars creates speech and choral integrity for the performances in the film. This diversity also draws an older viewing audience who actually know who the actors are, while the quick simple pace mesmerizes kids. With this being said, 'Rio' is the best G film of the year for all audiences because of its built in kid safety that does not totally bore older viewers away.Is straightforward cinema good? Yes, however, sometimes a film like 'Rio' can be so straightforward that it doesn't bring anything fresh to the table. The only original aspect of the film is the fact that it takes place in Brazil 'Angry Birds' style, but in the end there is no surprise. Consequently there are moments in the film that seem to drag on because the ending is already clear. Also, while Jesse Eisenberg is currently a big name actor in Hollywood, it was very awkward hearing his voice come out of the beak of a bird. His voice personified Blu in a very nerdy way, while Blu was developed as a cute naïve pet instead of a socially awkward parrot..Ultimately, 'Rio' successfully fulfills childish expectations staying true to youthful entertainment with its straightforward plot. It also avoids causing the excruciating boredom to adults present in earlier G movie releases in 2011, however, it cannot escape the fact that it is only ordinary.",6,0,5,21 April 2011
Limitless," Cooper: Back Again and Again
","'Limitless' is only concerned about one thing and that is being really really cool. This is one of the only movies that has come out recently that has successfully ran with a cool idea by avoiding throwing in all sorts of unnecessary nonsense. The script is well written by Leslie Dixon based off of the novel 'The Dark Fields' by Alan Glynn, Bradly Cooper ('The A-Team', 'The Hangover') was well casted, and Director Neil Burger raps it together into smart entertaining fun. Cooper plays a man named Eddie Mora who is an aspiring failure of a writer. He has just gotten dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish 'Sucker Punch') and doesn't know where to turn. This leads him to a chance encounter with his ex-wife Melissa's (Anna Friel, 'Goal') brother Vernon (Johnny Whitworth, '3:10 to Yuma') who is known for being involved in the drug game. After a brief meeting, Morra is given a sample of a new drug called NZT-48 that is supposed to open up his brain allowing him to use his full brain capacity increasing his focus and intellect. At first he is very skeptical, however, he is curious and knows that he needs to do something to get out of his downwardly spiraling existence. Needless to say he takes the pill opening up a world of achievement, greed, and danger that is limitless. His life is back on track as he gets his girlfriend Lindy back and is becoming a multi-millionaire, however, isn't there always a drawback? Yes there is as Morra gets more and more involved, his health is at risk and he becomes a marked man.Eddie Morra was a character perfectly crafted for Bradley Cooper. Cooper is looked at as a hotshot, rugged, talented alluring actor mixing comedy, action and drama within his roles. Without Cooper 'Limitless' would lose its charismatic vibe and would not be nearly as good. The film itself is very captivating and doe not have a dull moment. It achieves this with consistent nonstop strings of entertaining sequences meshed together with exquisite film editing. Film editing is used in a number of ways in order to visually represent distinctions within the human mind. It explicitly distinguishes between full awareness of an opened eyed individual and the foggy state of a closed eyed individual. Depressing, nonsense drama is avoided in the film as well differentiating the film from a stereotypical movie about a junkie. Also, what makes a movie like this better? Cast a seasoned actor like Robert De Niro as a big-time businessman.First of all many viewers may say that the story has been told before, however, this does not affect the movie. One problem that the film does have is failing to fully explain the role of certain characters. Some characters are overlooked very quickly and as the movie turns towards new developments most evident with Robert John Burke's character Pierce. Also, Abbie Cornish's casting as Morra's girlfriend Lindy was not the best choice leading to a very average performance. Yes she does what she is meant to do, however her portrayal is very one-dimensional and ultimately unimportant.The basic outline of 'Limitless's' plot has been seen before, however, this is not just another movie about a junkie who discovers power and is in danger of losing it. Cooper's charm keeps Morra coming back again and again as he finds the answers to his limitless potential. It is movies like this that define the entertainment of cinema, however, the art of the movie's film editing may be commended as well at the Oscars.",8,1,2,21 March 2011
Thor," Superhero Magic: Deity Entertainment
","Marvel's most recent Avenger's prequel is about one of the most interesting superheroes. Director Kenneth Branagh's (better known as an actor, Valkyrie) Thor bridges the gap between mythology and the comic book superhero genre with action and mystical CGI. The film could have done without the third dimension (3D) and it needed better script writing, but in the end Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek) successfully brings the god alive alongside big name actresses Natalie Portman (Black Swan) and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist). The film begins where Iron Man 2 left off with a supernatural storm landing Thor in the middle of New Mexico. There, scientist Jane Foster (Portman), assistant Darcy Lewis (Dennings) and Doctor Erik Selvig (Stellen Skarsgard, Pirates of the Caribbean) accidentally hit him with their vehicle wondering where he came from. How did the all mighty Thor end up in the middle of New Mexico? Thor was on the brink of becoming king of his father Odin's (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs) realm Asgard. However, after the Frost Giants from the realm of Jotunheim interrupt the ceremony, Thor leads his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) with a small group of companions to Jotunheim without his father's permission. An epic battle scene unfolds and as the Frost Giant's leader Laufey (Colm Feore, Changeling) fights Thor off, Odin intervenes and banishes Thor to earth for his disobedience stripping him of all his powers. Thor is forced to embark on a journey to regain his honor on earth as he falls for Jane Foster while evading the mysterious organization SHIELD whose intentions come with Furry.Thor is everything a summer superhero blockbuster should be: funny, visually spectacular, action packed and most importantly entertaining. The film is uniquely shot, moving between the mystical realm of Asgard and the Earthly world intertwining the two almost perfectly. Hemsworth, Portman, and Skarsgard were all worthy cast members mending the shoddy script they were given. Hemsworth was definitely big enough for his role, while Portman balances his might as his petite, fragile love interest, and Skarsgard's multidimensional mentor figure. These three still aren't the best part of the film because of a surprise cameo that may not be very obvious, but if you know what is happening you may freak out.The film's visuals are very impressive, however, the 3D is completely unnecessary. Everything seems blurred, dark and cramped because the 3D picture takes away from the beauty of each realm. While this may not be as noticeable to some viewers the script has evident dialogue mishaps creating an underwhelming cinematic opening to the film. Script problems are subdued as the film progresses as the magic of cinema takes hold, but the script may also be to blame for the insertion of Dennings's character in the film; a character without a purpose.Director Branagh does his part in bringing the latest of the Avengers to life in grandiose fashion by creating comic book mythology. The film is everything that the Clash of the Titans remake wishes it was with a side of earthly superhero magic.",8,2,4,7 May 2011
Burlesque," Glamour and Tucci
","'Burlesque' is a musical drama that relies on glamorous costumes (or lack there of) combined with pretty women to captivate audiences. The songs are kind of bland throughout and because the girls' job at the Burlesque Lounge is literally lip sink to all of the classic songs no one is able to shine. Cher's character Tess gets a couple shots and really owns one of them while Christina Aguilera's character Ali is given numerous opportunities to sing. However, with only one star the rest of the girls are left behind in the shadows. The basic plot of the film begins as Ali quits her job in a small town in Iowa and moves to Los Angeles to make her singing and dancing dream come true. She has a lot of trouble at first, but finally finds Tess's Burlesque Lounge. There she meets a bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet), Tess's gay studio partner Sean (Stanley Tucci), a snotty dancer named Nikki (Kristen Bell) and a very wealthy man named Marcus (Eric Dane). Rejected by Tess initially to join the show, Ali begs Jack to let her be a waitress for the Lounge. The Lounge is in great financial trouble and is going to be bought by Marcus if something cannot be done. Eventually Ali gets her shot and as her career starts flourishing the big question is if Ali, Sean and Tess are going to be able to save the Burlesque Lounge from Marcus's plans? Also, who will Ali fall in love with Marcus or Jack?The glamour of the film is undoubtedly the best part of the film and is very extensive and glamorous. The costumes exemplify exactly the kind of film that it is and are elaborate enough to brighten up the screen. The dancing and choreography is very good as well. And yes Christina Aguilera owns the screen when she is singing, dancing, and performing. Cher also very good, but she does not get as much screen time as she should. Kristen Bell is in familiar territory with her role that is almost a mirror image of her Sarah Marshall character. However, the standouts in the film are the three main males; Cam Gigandet, Eric Dane, and Stanley Tucci. They are able to shine through the estrogen filled screen with very good performances. Stanley Tucci is on top of his game year after year and this film is no different.The flare of the film is gone when the characters are not on performing in the Lounge causing the film to rely on Christina Aguilera's acting ability with little snippets of Cher and the three males as stated above. Aguilera does a much better job than other singers turned actress, however, the film is too much about her and only her forcing her to act more than she should have. It isn't even her fault that the film tends to struggle outside of its musical center because unlike Musicals like Chicago, Moulin Rouge or even last year's Nine (that probably wasn't as good as Burlesque) the film does not carry over the magic of the musical genre when outside the Lounge. The film breaks entirely out of the musical genre away from the light and color spectacle and becomes just another drama without the magic and mystery of music.A very entertaining film while in the Lounge, but the magic is lost once the actresses get off the stage and the performances of the film's males in a drama setting take over. This makes the film something that its not, but allows a man like Stanley Tucci a chance to show off a little bit. Therefore, 'Burlesque' is not the must see musical of the season, however, it is the only musical and its more entertaining than last year's NINE. However, save some money wait for the dollar theaters or wait a little longer for DVD.",5,0,1,8 December 2010
Rango," Chameleon: Action Masking Symbolism
","'Rango' is a throwback to the 1950s western genre with a twist. The John Wayne of the film is a chameleon. This unlikely hero creates a modern, adult, animated, western flick of fun and depth with the help of director Gore Verbinski ('Pirates of the Caribbean 1-3') and Johnny Depp (most recently 'The Tourist'). Depp and Verbinski have teamed up before in the first three 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films and are back with their best flick since 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'. Depp voices Rango, a lost chameleon who is lost in the middle of the wild west after being thrown out of his secluded life as a pet lizard from the back of a moving car. Rango finds himself in the town of Dirt that is looking for a hero. The town is synonymous with any beaten down town in classic western cinema. The town is desperate for a source of water and protect from Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I'). The Mayor (Ned Beatty, 'Toy Story 3') is doing everything he can, but even he cannot stop the over powerful force of urbanization as the classic cow town fades away. Rango joins locals Beans (Isla Fisher, 'Confessions of a Shopoholc') and Prisicilla (Abigail Breslin, 'Little Miss Sunshine') and others to find the secrets behind the water shortage in the town while unmasking the spiritual truth behind the film rebirthing the magic of the Wild West.'Rango' is not just another animated film concerning a childish plot and overused 3D animation. While 3D has literally taken animated films to another dimension Verbinski decides to bypass it and stick with a more rugged 2D look. 'Rango' targets adults and features many metaphorical and symbolic moments alongside brilliant action sequences. The film contains one of the best animated action sequences ever created along with one of the greatest almost cameos. Rattle Snake Jake is also one of the greatest animated villains ever created. Depp's character Rango is also very well characterized fitting into the cowboy hero stereotype with a little modern flare. His monologue at the beginning of the kicks off his character's development along with exemplifying the dark undertones of the well written script accompanied by some singing birds. 'Rango' inserts modern concerns and ideologies into the west reaching a wide range of viewers.This is a film that the audience has to seek out and give a chance and in order to get anything out of it. It is a hard film to read and is meant to be invested in, instead of grasping the viewer. Therefore, this is not necessarily the best film for kids to watch and should be looked at as a more mature film because of its symbolic subject matter. Also, there is some empty space on the open range in slow sequences leading the slightly film off track. Also, the cameo is fake and even though it is meant as a joke, come on! 'Rango' is 'Shane' meets 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' released in an era dominated by animated films reliant on the beauty of color and special effects. Not to say that recent animated movies are bad, 'Rango' is just original and different. It is early to make too many predictions, but 'Rango' may be showing up again next February",8,0,1,16 March 2011
X-Men: First Class," 'Fluid Pace: Classy and Stylish Prequel'
","Director Matthew Vaughn is back for a more conventional super hero movie after wowing audiences with last year's 'Kick Ass.' He has redefined the 'X-Men' series with a very stylish work of cinema as attempt two at creating a prequel is successful with 'X-Men: First Class.' Like 'Origins' there are a plethora of characters that the audience has to worry about, however, with the smart use of time and space Vaughn develops the roots of various mutants with a fluid pace. James McAvoy ('Wanted', 'The Conspirator') and Michael Fassbender ('Inglourious Bastards','300') set up the best on screen matchup of the year with their respective portrayals of Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto). The film commences as Erik is separated from his mother and killed by a man named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon, 'Frost/Nixon'). This is followed by background of a young Charles as he befriends a very familiar character, Raven aka Mystic (Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence, 'Winter's Bone'). After this brief exposition, the audience is taken on a nonstop thrill ride as the mutants influence the Cold War. Erik embarks on a path of vengeance to kill Shaw. Since their last encounter Shaw has started his own mutant army and has a very dangerous right-hand woman, Emma Frost (January Jones, 'Mad Men'). Meanwhile, Charles and Raven are tracked down by a woman named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, 'Bridesmaids') for their mutant expertise. Everything is connected in one way or another as the 1960s setting makes the film a cool cinematic rebirth to a new 'X-Men Trilogy.'The Good: Director Vaughn reinvents the film series with a very well written script and a dark old school spectacle. Combining the classic feel of the 1960s and the Marvel comic book guise with McAvoy's ingenious, sexy interpretation of Professor X and Fassbender's rugged vindictive portrayal of Magneto makes this the best superhero film of the year. The casting of two big name congenial actors as antagonists (Bacon and Jones) along with giving their motive multiple purposes is smart cinema. Cinematography finishes it all off with a mixture of 'Mad Men' flare in a comic strip.The character development of Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz, 'It's Kind of a Funny Story') is very irritating, failing to produce a motive for her later actions. This can be attributed to the fact that even though Vaughn does a good job juggling the plethora of characters, it is inevitable that one falls through the cracks. Also, the fast pace of the film foreshadows a climatic ending which in actuality fails to impress after the interminable build up.Vaughn is following in Christopher Nolan's footsteps as he transforms his second superhero comic into motion picture form. He uses more of a comic book approach than Nolan casting to perfection and creating one of the best prequels to ever be made.",9,11,16,18 June 2011
RED," Four Words: Willis, Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren
","'Red' is based on the comic book with the same name by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner staring Hollywood legends Bruce Willis (55 years of age and the man that gave the bald headed action hero its birth), Morgan Freeman (73 years of age one of the greatest Hollywood Icons of all time), John Malkovich (56 years of age and the man who have a movie named after him called 'Being John Malkovich') and Helen Mirren (65 years of age and one of the literal 'Queens' of Hollywood). In 'Red' Willis (Frank Moses), Freeman (Joe Matheson), Malkovich (Marvin Boggs) and Mirren (Victoria) show that with age comes acting quality while playing four retired CIA agents who are targets on a hit list created to implement a top secret CIA cover up. These four retired and extremely dangerous action rule the screen when they are present melding action and comedy together. However, their star presence causes all of the other actors in the film to fall into the shadows of the screen. This results in some lackluster moments when they are not on screen. However, when four A list actors are together on one screen you can't expect less than brilliance. This is Bruce Willis's first film since 'Live Free and Die Hard' that utilizes his tough guy action hero persona to the best of his ability. He is supported by one of the best casted supporting casts of all time including the aforementioned Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren. However, the performance that stands out the most in the film is that of John Malkovich with his portrayal of the crazy Marvin Boggs and his insanity. He provides many of the moments of comedic mastery with his off the wall character including the funniest scene in the film during the ending sequence. Another stand out performance came from Brian Cox (64 years of age), one of the lesser-known actors in the film that has left his mark on Hollywood on a smaller scale. In the film he plays a Russian Mob Boss named Ivan who has a romantic and comedic personality that is actually the exact opposite of what a mob boss should be. The film struggles greatly when Willis, Freeman, Malkovich and Mirren are off screen. The star power of these four hurts the performances of Mary-Louise Parker (Willis's love interest Sarah Ross) and Karl Urban (the young CIA agent William Cooper whose mission is to kill Willis and company) greatly. They are both decent actors, but are lost in the backdrop with very average and predictable performances. There are multiple scenes in the film that seem to act almost as filler because the writers could not think of a better way to occupy the time. This creates a few discontinuities that take away from the fluent flow of the story time leaving empty spaces between high energy comedy and action scenes. The last problem with the film occurs with Morgan Freemans's lack of screen time making his character seem very unimportant. If you are paying Morgan Freeman to be in a movie you need to abuse his talents!!! Director Robert Schwentke has produced a film that he knows his audience is enjoying and having fun. The entertainment value of this film is very high because of the confidence that Schwentke exudes through his filming style of 'Red.' He has very good reason to be confident with the cast that he has. I recommend seeing it now just to see the on screen match up of these four stars.",7,0,4,18 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A Magical Adieu: The Unbelievable becomes Believable
","'Harry Potter' has become more than a magical book and film series showing us that magic does exist making the unbelievable believable. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II' marks the end of an era impeccably concluding the franchise synonymous with our generation's youth. Director David Yates ('Harry Potter 5-7') brings the series full circle perpetuating an emotional connection within the heart of the viewer that is nothing short of spectacular. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are the fantasy heroes of our day leading the fight against Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, 'The Hurtlocker') As the harsh realities of life set in with the death of Dobby the free elf and evil growing, the war is in full swing. Harry, Ron and Hermione are regrouping at a small cottage planning their next move. Before the final test between good and evil is unleashed Harry has some final business to finish with Voldemort's last Horcruxes.As their quest takes them to Gringotts Bank and the town of Hogsmeade everyone's favorite characters from the series are preparing for the last stand set to take place where it all began; Hogwarts. The problem is the school is in the hands of Voldemort with Severus Snape (Alan Rickman, 'Dogma') head master. The journey comes to a close in an epic battle worthy of remembrance accompanied by the relinquishment of the tale's secrets. The dead live on as Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, 'The King's Speech') guides Harry within conveying that nobody ever dies in vein.The Good: Stereotypical artsy Oscar films beware as the world of magic guns for your heads. David Yates has inspired the minds of millions of people with his interpretation of the second half of the series. Adversity ensued early on in the franchise, but it all came together in the end. Breathtaking visual effects, superb acting on all fronts starting with its stars and ending with one of the best supporting casts ever assembled, make this is more than a blockbuster fantasy. Alan Rickman deserves his an Oscar birth for best supporting actor. Regardless 'Harry Potter' has already won; awards would only be a consolation honor.The Bad: Complaints for this film can all be attributed to perception. If you are a person who never liked the books, or disliked all of the the films why would you waste your time with the eighth installment? This brings me to my second point concerning the film's epilogue. Personally I believe J.K. Rowling's epilogue can be credited to laziness and is the weakest point of the series, but in order to fully conclude the books, Yates had to translate it to film in some way. Yes the film should have ended before this flash forward, but at least Yates approached it as a chance to have some lighthearted fun.Final Thought: Haters will hate, moviegoers have a reason to experience the saga, fans will be satisfied and die-hard Potter folk will be euphoric. I bid 'Potter' adieu one last time; thanks for the memories.",Null,0,1,15 July 2011
Easy A," The Shark Tank
","Emma Stone ('Superbad', 'Zombieland') helps reinvent the classic 80s teen movie revolution with her Golden Globe nominated portrayal of Olive in the Critic's Choice nominated Best Comedy 'Easy A'. Director John Hughes's films ('The Breakfast Club', 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off') had a big influence on this film. Will Gluck ('Fired Up') directed the film creating a modern comedy version of Hester Prynne's 'The Scarlet Letter' that rightfully takes place in a high school setting. Emma Stone's character Olive is just another normal teenaged girl trying to live through high school. She is really close to and open with her parents Dill (Stanley Tucci) and Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson). Her best friend is a blonde bombshell that is way more popular than her and her best guy friend, Brandon, is gay. Olive narrates the story while breaking it up into different parts and making a video. Her narration begins when Rhiannon asks Olive to go camping with her and her family for the weekend Olive lies to her saying that she has a hot date with a college guy that weekend to avoid going with Rhi and her eccentric parents. In actuality Olive just has a relaxing normal weekend at her house. However, on Monday when Rhi asks her about her weekend while in the bathroom, Olive says that she had sex with the guy. Their conversation is overheard by the die-hard Christian of the school Marianne (Amanda Bynes) who spreads the rumor throughout the school. Within the hour Olive was no longer just another student, she was known as the slut of the school. Why did she do it? The story begins to parallel The Scarlett Letter as they are reading it in her favorite teacher MR. Griffith's class. Olive begins doing favors for guys saying that she has slept with them to increase their public image. This ultimately leads her to wear an A on her wardrobe to represent adulterer just like in 'The Scarlett Letter'.'Easy A' is all about Emma Stone. She has always been a very good actress and has stood out in all of the films she has been in ('Superbad', 'The House Bunny', 'Zombieland'), but they didn't allow her to be a star until now. This is her first leading role as an actress and she nailed it, rightfully deserving her present award nominations. She has shown that she is going to be a force to be reckoned with in years to come. She helps the film stay original and get back to the roots of the 80s teen movie revolution also adding to the film a lot. The incorporation of the famous fist pump scene from 'The Breakfast Club' and the song 'Don't You, Forget About Me' helps create the echos of the rebirth of the 80s in the film. And oh yeah Stanley Tucci is amazing. Enough said.Unlike the 80s teenage revolution films like 'The Breakfast Club', the ending of 'Easy A' is very predictable. The film itself is actually kind of original, but most things in the film can be seen coming. Also, Amanda Bynes did not seem like the best casting choice for the film. She has her hair bleached blonde for her die-hard Christian role of Marriane that just does not look very good on her. Her acting is also very fake and bad at times. She has to cry in a couple of scenes and it could not have been less believable.Rated one of the best comedies of the year 'Easy A' shows how stupid high school really was. People felt like they had to become someone that they weren't because of the stupid teenage social hierarchy. Emma Stone shows us how her character Olive tried to break the system, but high school is a shark tank and they will eat you alive. Wait for DVD if you are going to see the film and go rent or buy 'The Breakfast Club' now!",6,0,0,17 December 2010
Fast Five," Entertainment: Ego Driven Car Races
","Ten years after the inception of the fast car action film phenomenon, Fast Five takes the U.S. box office by storm beginning summer early this year. Director Justin Lin ('Anapolis') achieves an opening box office numbers north of 80 mil by amassing all of the franchise's most badass stars including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Sung Kang, Matt Schulze along with adding the brute power of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. As expected, there is no plot or character development what so ever, immediately throwing the audience into the escape of Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Diesel) sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, facilitated by ex-cop Brian O'Connor (Walker) and Mia Toretto (Brewster). Following Dom's escape, Brian and Mia seek the help of an old friend, Vincent (Schulze), in Rio de Janeiro undertaking a job to steal three cars from a moving train as they wait for Dom's arrival. The heist goes amiss, however, they learn two things, first, they cannot trust anyone and second this is just the tip of the iceberg of the ticket to their freedom. Dom, Brian and Mia commence the biggest robbery the series has ever seen with a 100 million dollar target from the most corrupt and powerful man in Rio, Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Needless to say, they call Roman Pearce (Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) among other franchise favorites to evade the clutches of Reyes and U.S. federal agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).Not many sequels stand up to their first installments, however, after four semi-entertaining sexy action thrillers struggling to create a worthwhile plot, 'Fast Five' does more than equivocating its predecessors. The film's over the top ridiculous scope leaves very little room for slow boring moments. Instead it is full of pointless action scenes including a five-minute foreseeable faceoff between Diesel and Johnson. The battle of the brawny is accompanied by the battle of the sexy between Jordana Brewster and newcomer Elsa Patakay (local Rio cop Elema Neves). And yes there are ego driven car races.The same reasons that make 'Fast Five' better than its predecessors make the film the true mess that it is. A completely flawed grandiose plot combined with ridiculously bad acting and Tyrese Gibson's cliché one-liners and Johnson's childish clever phrases such as 'Now give me the veggies' make the script seem like something a 13 year old thought up while playing Need For Speed with his friends. However, by disregarding plot development and clever writing, 'Fast Five' has broken through the bonds that have always been holding the series back.In the end, nothing stands in the films way as the writers completely shirk their job letting the cast loose through a labyrinth of explosive fun. All that matters is that 'Fast Five' is the epitome of a Hollywood moneymaker. It is entertainment.",7,16,33,3 May 2011
The Social Network," News Feed: The Social Network—Like
","See it Now! My Critical Perspective: A- My Personal Perspective: B+Is the film a one hundred percent factual history about the creation of Facebook? No it isn't, but that's not the point. The film is based on the book 'The Accidental Billionaires' written about how Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and the controversies surrounding its creation. The basic plot of the film is about the proceedings that took place when Mark Zuckerberg was sued on two different fronts; by his best friend and co-founder, Eduardo Saverin and by the Winklevoss twins who thought he stole the Facebook idea from them. The story is told through a number of flashbacks revealing Mark Zuckerberg's programming background and how came up with the idea and developed over time what we all know as Facebook.The Good: David Fincher is an amazing director and has not directed a bad movie yet. 'The Social Network' is very different from his other ventures that include both Fight Club and Zodiac. However, the progression of his directing career is very visible in 'The Social Network' which is by far his best directed film. Fincher always films his movies with a certain contrast of light and shadows in order to create the atmosphere that he wants his audience to feel. He does this once again in 'The Social Network' by filming it in a shadowy light, which slowly lightens up by the end.All of the actors in the film do an excellent job as well especially Jesse Eisenberg (Zombieland, Adventureland), Andrew Garfield (the new Spiderman), Armie Hammer and Justin Timberlake. Eisenberg has grown a lot throughout his different roles and has his best performance in this film with his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg that may even lead him towards an Oscar nomination this year. He creates an egotistical asshole persona with perfection and articulates his sentences so well he can insult someone without them even knowing what hit them. Andrew Garfield shows the audience through his character Eduardo Saverin (Mark's best friend) that he is a worthy Hollywood actor and may surprise us in the Spiderman reboot. Armie Hammer plays the Winklevoss twins who are shot extremely well by Fincher differentiating them enough to create their own two separate characters. Justin Timberlake also makes an appearance and has a very good performance with his character Sean Parker.Despite the acting and directing the thing that stands out the most in this film is the time and effort Aaron Sorkin put into adapting the screenplay from the book 'The Accidental Billionaires.' The story and dialogues are so well put together and rattled off so fast and naturally by each of the actors that the film feels very real. There are also a plethora of one- liners and monologues that almost literally punch the character in the face whom they are directed towards along with the audience itself.The Bad: The film creates a very bad image for women other than Rooney Mara's character (Erika Albright) and Rashida Jones's character (Marylin Delpy). All of the other women in the film are portrayed as drunk, greedy sluts. This may be very offensive to some people, and may be a reason not to see the film if you feel very strongly about it. Also, there are minor discontinuities throughout the film that may have been able to be a little clearer and a couple short scenes that don't seem necessary to the overall storyline of the film. Final Thought: There's a difference between making a movie and creating a movie; when you make a movie you just go through the motions of preproduction, production and post production, however, when you create a movie this is taken to a whole other level. David Fincher takes it to a whole other level by creating the atmosphere and then lets loose. Who knew that a film about Facebook could grasp and keep your undivided attention and send you on a thrilling roller-coaster ride with wellcrafted dialogue and a very relevant soundtrack? Go See it Now and see what all of the hype is about.",9,1,2,1 October 2010
The Fighter," Mickey's Corner: 121 Pounds
","The 'Fighter' has been nominated for six Golden Globe awards including Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Director David O. Russell and not one, not two, but four Best Actor/Actress nominations. It is one of the best films of the year staring Mark Wahlberg (Nominated for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama) and Christian Bale (Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture Drama) as brothers Mickey Ward and Dicky Eklund who embark together on a boxing journey to become 'The Pride of Lowell', Massachusetts. The film begins with the two brother's being interviewed in 1993 and flashing back to tell the story. Before his crack addiction, Dicky was known for knocking out boxing legend Sugar Ray in his hay day. He has always looked out for his younger brother Mickey and has trained him to be a boxer as well. However, Mickey is on a losing streak and is down on his luck. He has a large family that is part of the boxing business. His mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo, Nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama), is Mickey's manager while his father George Ward (Jack McGee) tries to help him get a better manager and make him some more money. Mickey's luck is turned around when he starts dating a bartender named Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams, Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama) dragging her into the family business. Everything comes together as the fight for kinship begins as Mickey, Dicky, Alice, Jack and Charlene work to restore the family name and celebrate in Mickey's Corner. 'The Fighter' is all about the acting performances of the best ensemble cast of the year. Wahlberg, Bale, Leo, and Adams are raiding all of the spots for the acting nominations at every awards show. The four cast members mentioned along with Jack McGee have been nominated as a whole for two best ensemble cast awards and have won one already. With this being said the best part of the movie is Christian Bale's portrayal of Dicky Ecklund. He lost a ridiculous amount of weight for the role for the second time in his acting career ('The Machinist', 2004) weighing the least he has in years at 121 pounds. Bale has always been an amazing actor being able to break away from his strong English accent to play American characters with a flawless American accent. He is completely different than you have ever seen him before and hands down is going to pick up numerous awards this awards season including the Oscar. All of these performances create the originality of the film from a well- known plot line.The story starts out very slow taking 30 or 40 minutes to kick into full swing. The screenplay is very well written and performed, however, the film is still very predictable. The plot has been used over and over again must memorably in the 'Rocky' franchise. The film is very straightforward and does not have any surprises along the way, but in the end does this really matter?'The Fighter' is a very enjoyable movie that is easy to enjoy. Lead by the best acting of the year the film has set the standard for ensemble casts of the future by telling a real life 'Rocky' story that you need to see now!",9,5,9,18 December 2010
