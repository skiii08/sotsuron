Blade Runner 2049," Wait a minute, replicants can do... WHAT?
","In science fiction the viewer must believe in a certain fantasy in order to enjoy the story that will be presented. In Back to the Future you must accept the fantasy that it is possible to travel through time. In E.T. you must accept the fact that aliens from other planets do exist.In Blade Runner 2049 the main story is all about a certain ability the replicants seem to have - and it's a totally absurd and unbelievable one. That and a few plot holes almost wreck the whole movie.In the end Blade Runner 2049 is saved by the incredible visuals and the love director Denis Villeneuve has for the original. There are many big and small scenes that refer to characters and situations in Blade Runner 1. The film brings back two characters from the original (beside Deckard) and the second one is actually very well done. The now famous Vangelis soundtrack also plays a major part at the end. The first encounter between Gosling and Harrison Ford is an absolute delight, just like the performance of newcomer Sylvia Hoeks (who makes us Dutchies very proud). The film is long - almost three hours - and could have used a shorter cut. Blade Runner 2049 certainly does not surpass the original, but it's a courageous effort that's worth seeing in the cinema, especially in 3D IMAX. Only time will tell if it will also become a classic.7,5 / 10",8,10,25,5 October 2017
Iron Man 3," Entertaining, but don't expect more than that
","Ever since I saw the first trailers I was dying to see Iron Man 3. And that's where it all went wrong, I guess. If you expect too much from this film – like me - you'll be disappointed for sure. Well, at least a little. Not that Iron Man 3 is a bad movie. It's entertaining alright. But especially the beginning is rather shaky. The motives of both the hero (Tony Stark) and the villain to join the party are not that strong. It's also a 'been there, done that' kinda thing. Except for Iron Man 'using the Force', his panic attacks and his love for Pepper not much has changed. But let's start at the beginning.After the events of The Avengers in New York Tony Stark is restless. He can't sleep and he gets panic attacks whenever the subject comes up. Enter The Mandarin. In good Middle Eastern terrorist fashion this villain with-the-rather-strange-non-Middle-Eastern accent threatens America with attacks and other misery. This does not affect Tony until The Mandarin puts a dear friend of our billionaire hero in the hospital. And no, the victim is not Pepper (thank god!). Tony wants revenge but makes the mistake of mentioning his home address on national television. The result: the helicopter attack on his estate that can be seen in the trailer (which is pretty spectacular). Of course Tony escapes. Without his lab and with only one Iron Man prototype suit that he could save, Tony begins a quest to find the Mandarin. But very soon he finds out that all tracks lead to someone else, a person he led down several years ago and now wants to get even.Although The Mandarin shows some serious terrorist actions, the tone of Iron Man 3 is much lighter and more humorous than part 2. Tony has to do some hero stuff without his Iron Man armor and this forces him to work together with 'normal' people (and one crazy fan). At the end he and James Rhodes form a nice team and they ultimately save the day. Overall there's more charm in Iron Man 3. At times part 2 took itself too seriously, I think.I liked the fact that Tony had to work outside the safety of his lab and use his wits to come up with a plan to defeat the bad guy(s). I liked the character of The Mandarin, very well played by Ben Kingsley. The twist in his story was a nice one. I'm not familiar with the comics, but this one came as a complete surprise. Is it a spoiler to say that the real villain in this movie is Guy Pearce? Maybe. Fact is that I did not understand his real motives to take a swing at Tony in this movie. Does he want his help? Does he want to destroy Iron Man? Or is he just after the president? Money? Something else? Guy Pearce's character, an inventor/businessman/scientist called Killian, is experimenting with altering DNA in the brain. Somehow he has created this invincible glow-in-the-dark army that can absorb energy, much like Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four. Come to think of it, there's more Marvel déjà vu in Iron Man 3. Lessons from Curt Connors from The Amazing Spider-Man movie for instance. Mutants. And in the end a female character even does a little 'Femke Janssen Phoenix' trick.One last big letdown: the Air Force One scene, which was destined to be one of the highlights of the movie. In the trailer we learn that there was a hole in the aircraft and several people were sucked outside. Iron Man wants to rescue them but he can only carry four or five persons in the air. And there are at least ten victims out there! Holy macaroni, what will he do? Tony Stark's solution is pretty dumb and unrealistic. It reminded me of the space parts from Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Embarrassing, really. The 3D effects also didn't do it for me. But maybe that was because I saw the movie on a rather small screen. If you see it in IMAX it probably is much better.No, Iron Man 3 did not live up to my expectations – and I was really hoping that it would. But that does not mean that I did not enjoy myself. Robert Downey is almost on automatic with his wisecracking one- liners, but his joking around still works. All the actors do well, except maybe Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan. I think what happens to him is a weak motive for Tony Stark to take on The Mandarin. Therefore, his 'This is old fashioned revenge!'-line sounds a bit exaggerated. Watching the end credits with footage from not only Iron Man 3, but parts 1 and 2 as well you can conclude that even the makers of the saga realize that this should be the final Iron Man movie. What's more to tell? Although I love Robert Downey as Tony Stark I think it's a good idea to call it quits. Let's go for some other Marvel meat and let Tony rest for a while. Maybe there's one more big fight in him in ten or fifteen years' time, when he's passed sixty or so, like The Dark Knight who once returned. Or that boxer from Philadelphia who made one last comeback. But for now I would say that three is enough for now. 7,5 / 10",7,12,28,21 April 2013
Kung Fu Panda," Kung Fu + Computer graphics = a winner!
","When you watch Kung Fu Panda you can't help but wonder: why wasn't this done before? Kung fu and CGI make a terrific mix in this entertaining tale of a clumsy fat panda who becomes a true kung fu master. The story in short: panda bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) is a big kung fu fan. He has all the action figures of his idols, Master Tigress, Viper, Tigress, Monkey and Mantis - also known as the Furious Five, and dreams of one day becoming a kung fu master himself. In the meantime he sells noodles. When evil leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes from prison a Dragonwarrior is chosen to defeat him. Yes, our reluctant hero Po turns out to be the one! He gets a kung fu training from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), who - after a few disastrous attempts - discovers that the only way to teach Po real kung fu is to lure him with food. But will Po be strong enough to beat Tai Lung?Kung Fu Panda doesn't start with a bang. The first laughs are results from the slapstick humour. Po is a lovable creature and everyone can relate to a person who dreams of the impossible. When Tai Lung escapes you're really into the story. This particular scene is pretty spectacular. It takes place in a dark cave and the way Tai Lung jumps around really gives you the impression that he's an enemy to be reckoned with.What also works in the movie is the chemistry between Po (Jack Black) and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). The latter easily steals the show as the grumpy kung fu master who doesn't believe in his mission to guide Po. The scene in which Shifu has a food fight with Po is an instant classic. There's also a great action scene in which Tigress, Mantis and the others try to stop evil Tai Lung. They fail, of course... And the down side? There aren't that many bad things in Kung Fu Panda. Hoffman and Black make the movie. The role of Tigress (Angelina Jolie) could have been done by many other voice actresses. Jackie Chan (Viper) only has three or four lines and that's a shame. The final fight is - at some moments - rather violent. That can scare away some of the younger (3-6 year old) kids. Dreamworks wants to turn Kung Fu Panda into a Shrek like franchise. They're right. There's enough material in here to make at least two more sequels. And CGI animated kung fu kicks really work on the big screen! So let them make a Kung Fu Panda 2. As long as they keep Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu in the story!8/10",8,21,28,22 May 2008
Star Trek," This movie rocks! But...
","As a long time Original Series fan the JJ Abrams reboot sounded good to me. I thought it would be a good way to revive the franchise with new young actors in a familiar setting. And when I saw about 20 minutes of the new Star Trek movie a few months ago there was no doubt in my mind: this movie would freaking rock!Having just seen the JJ Abrams movie I'm still very excited. Okay, it isn't the masterpiece I secretly expected, but boy, there is so much to enjoy in this one! The good points: great action (both in space as in the sky), Chris Pine (the new Kirk) does a great job, Eric Bana is a scary villain and all the important Enterprise characters get decent screen time. The movie begins with a bang and especially the first half (about the young days of Kirk) is great fun to watch. The story – in which the old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) accidentally changes history in order to give the new leading characters a new reality – is a smart move to satisfy both old and new fans. Although it's a pity that the writers sacrificed the planet of ******* to achieve that. A big shock for the fans! But what works best in this movie is the relationship between young Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto). In the beginning they don't like each other. Spock still has difficulty to get rid of his human side and Kirk struggles with the Starfleet chain of command. When Kirk discovers that it is Spock who designed the Starfleet Academy test that cannot be won – yes Trekkies, that's the legendary Kobayashi Maru – things really start to heat up. To watch the two get closer to each other is great to watch. While Chris Pine (Kirk), Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Karl Urban (McCoy), Anton Yelchin (Chekov) and John Cho (Sulu) are all doing great jobs, I had difficulty with two characters. First of all Spock. Zachary Quinto seemed to hesitate between imitating Leonard Nimoy and creating his own Spock character. Somehow it took a long time for me to get used to the new Spock. But maybe that was because the original one, Nimoy, was also in this picture. The second character that in my opinion still has to grow was – sadly to say – Simon Pegg as Scotty. In the trailer he was great. But in the final movie his funny moments seemed mistimed and misplaced. His humour misfired. What a pity. What I didn't like in this movie – apart from the new Scotty? The camera-work sometimes resembled the one in Cloverfield too much. At times it was too documentary-like, with lots of flares and strange unnecessary camera angles. At the end of the movie the story may become a bit confusing for viewers who are not used to vintage science fiction, when the results of time travel become clear. Because you don't know exactly what Spock and Kirk are doing, the finale therefore disappoints a little bit.Overall I think JJ Abrams Star Trek is a great movie and a fantastic way to reboot the franchise and - hopefully - produce more Star Trek movies. It almost never has a dull moment and has a lot of references to The Wrath of Kahn. I can't wait to take my 11 year old to see it. As a fan there was only one thing that really really startled me. It involved the relationship between new Spock and well, see for yourselves. It emphasized the fact that Spock was still struggling with his human side, I can see that. But I justdidn'tbuyit. But maybe that's just my nerdy side talking.8.5/10",9,16,44,15 April 2009
Captain Marvel," Why so much hate? I loved it!
","When you go watch Captain Marvel it's best to go in without knowing anything. So if you're smart you'll skip this review, although I promise to keep the spoilers down and tell you only the vital stuff.The story begins on the planet of the Kree, a noble warrior hero race. Vers (Brie Larson) - who doesn't know anything about her past - wakes up early and asks her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) to go into the gym with her to practice some fighting techniques. Here we discover that Vers has special powers even the Kree don't understand. The same day the two go on a mission to rescue another Kree who has fallen into the hands of their archenemy, the Skrulls. Unfortunately it turns out to be a trap and Vers is captured. When the Skrulls search her brain they find important information that leads them to earth. Luckily, after her escape from the prison Carol also lands over there. She gets flashes from her past and learns that earth is actually her home planet and her real name is Carol Danvers. So what happened? How did she (as a human) end up with the Kree? And what about all her special powers? Carol meets a young Nick Fury and he helps her to find all the answers. Too bad the Skrulls can morph into different people. Who can you trust?There is some much to like in Captain Marvel. It starts as Terminator 2 meets Top Gun and it's mainly a buddy movie because Nick Fury gets a lot of screentime. His de-aging is so well done that I think Captain Marvel will set off a trend. Maybe next we will see Michael Douglas in a new sequel to Romancing the Stone? Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies 2?Brie Larson is excellent as the main lead. I mean, she really kicks arse! The fight scenes are much more realistic than for instance in Wonder Woman. The 90s setting is also well done. When you know that era well then be prepared for a lot of laughs and nostalgia.Captain Marvel is more than the birth of a hero. The movie has a true heart because of the human connection that Carol Danvers discovers and it has some great surprises. Most important: there are two aftercredits scenes and the first one is the most important one because it connects the story to what's coming next. Can't wait to see this movie again!8,5 out of 10",8,247,639,6 March 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Could have been great
","The problem with Alien Resurrection is that it could have been great instead of just fine. When I watched this movie back in 1997 in the theater I thought after the first hour: wow, this can't go wrong! The new born Ripley is an exciting character, because you don't know which side she is on. And Sigourney Weaver - 50 at that time - looked great in leather. Back was the hardware, the non-CGI aliens, the fresh ideas and the great action. The basketball scene and Ripley's confrontation with the previous clones were impressive. The look and feel were right on the spot and the story was exciting. The first part of the movie wasn't flawless I guess. But I could live with the things that annoyed me. The miscasting and overacting of Wynona Ryder for instance. The unnecessary swearing and harsh language by both Ryder and Weaver. The scene in which Ripley suddenly talked in full sentences after her awakening. I could live with that. But it all fell definitely apart when the new alien was shown to us at the end of the movie. Man, were they serious? Was this supposed to be the alien of all aliens? The motha of all mothas? Come on, don't make me laugh!The scene that spoiled it all for me had a great start, though. It began like the climax of Andrzej Zulawski's Possession (1981), a surrealistic European movie in which we saw the beautiful Isabelle Adjani making love to a monster. To me that was a shocking scene because it was very explicit. But here in Alien 4 it worked out very well... at first It looked like Ripley came to turns with her destiny. It started well until, of course, you see the final monster.Twelve years later I'm watching the Alien movies again with my 12 year old son. I was 12 myself when I saw the first Alien in the theater so I thought the time was right. We both pretty much enjoyed ourselves. On DVD the first Alien was a little bit slow but still great. Aliens remained an overwhelming sequel. The long cut of Alien 3 wasn't good but better than the first time around. And Alien Resurrection? Well, when you know what flaws to expect it's a good farewell to the Alien franchise. Good but not great. But if Ridley Scott or James Cameron wants to give it one more they both have my absolute blessing!8/10",8,5,8,3 January 2010
The Hunger Games," Am I nitpicking? Probably...
","With The Hunger Games being one of my favorite (young adult) books ever, I pretty much hesitated to go to the first screening of the movie. In the end curiosity won and I did go and regretted it.It's not that The Hunger Games is a bad movie. It isn't. It's actually a good, exciting and very entertaining one. But the ending let me down in a big way. And that puts a big (negative) mark on the overall experience.I think Lionsgate did almost everything right with this movie adaptation. I love Gary Ross as a filmmaker. He wrote Big, Pleasantville and Dave and directed two of them. I love Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna and especially Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. When I read the book I even had Hutcherson in mind for that role, so casting director: well done! To avoid an inconvenient rating Ross uses a lot of shaky camera-work. This gives you some headache in the beginning of the film but once the action moves to the arena it works out fine. You hardly see any violence but you know it's there. Smart move. Ross also makes more use of presenter Caesar Flickerman (than in the book). He watches the action in the arena and gives his comments. He also explains (to the viewer) why certain situations are dangerous for the Tributes, making the stakes more understandable. Unfortunately Ross uses this trick one or two times too many. Great use of music and the singing of the Mockingjay birds is also very well done. Ross also uses some elements of books 2 and 3 to give the viewer a hint at what lays ahead. For instance there is more president Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the film than in the book. He sees that Katniss can be a thread. The reason why suddenly two Tributes are allowed to win The Hunger Games is even better explained in the movie than in the book. And we also see the first uprisings in district 12 after the death of one of Katniss's friends. That's a moving scene. For all this Ross uses a lot of screen time, more than two hours and twenty minutes, paying much respect to the book. Thanks for that!So what really let me down is the ending. That could have been more dramatic. The way Katniss survives The Hunger Games could use a lot more suspense ('What the hell is she doing? What is she doing?!') and the consequents that follow should have been more dark and menacing. That's a big miss. With The Hunger Games Gary Ross delivered a solid, well made and very entertaining movie that hopefully rockets both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson into stardom. But if you're a very very very big fan of the incredible first book – like me – you really should think twice before going. Because usually the best movie adaptations are made in your own mind.8/10",8,10,26,18 March 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Far better than I expected
","To tell you the truth I'm pretty surprised by all the negative reviews I've been reading on the IMDb and elsewhere on the net (AICN for example). I thought X-Men 1 and 2 came close to being masterpieces and that X-Men 3 sucked big time. The Wolverine movie however is well made, exciting and surprisingly effective. But that's an opinion from somebody who doesn't know anything about the comics. To me Wolverine is mainly a movie hero and maybe that can make a big difference. Two elements make this movie really work. Liev Schreiber - a very underestimated actor - does a great job as Wolverine's brother Victor/Sabretooth. It's their love/hate relationship that is the main subject in this story and that really keeps it interesting. In the first minutes of the movie this is well established. The opening credits are really beautiful.Second: the story. I really love the story. It has romance, betrayal, vengeance, action, a touch of immortality... All the good elements are there in the right doses.Yes, I really love this movie. I hope to see more of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the future, because there are a lot more adventures he can and should have. Maybe director Gavin Hood can repair some of the damage that Brett Ratner did with a X-Men 3. Because an X-Men 4 - with hopefully Josh Halloway as Gambit - would be a great spectacle indeed. There's only one big thing that really puzzled me. So the Liev Schreiber character is actually the same Sabretooth we see in X-Men 1? Because the two characters really don't seem the same in the two movies. Everything they have 'experienced together in the past' (in the prequel) seems forgotten in X-Men 1 (when they only fight each other).Anyway, go see this!8,5 / 10",8,265,505,28 April 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pretty disappointing
","Spider-Man 3 was good but not great, Shrek 3 nice but not good and Pirates 3... well, to me At Worlds End is over long, confusing and at most times pretty boring. Too many story lines made the movie so fragmented that I didn't care about the ending anymore. I saw the movie four hours ago and frankly, there wasn't one scene that really stood up. Oh yes, perhaps the surreal Jack Sparrow ones in the afterlife. Well done. Reminded me of the ending of 2001. Keira Knightly looked as pretty as ever. The cameo of Keith Richards was also very nice though not vital to the story. I liked Pirates 2 a lot. That was just no nonsense fun with some great visual jokes. I hope the producers will let the Pirates franchise rest a while and maybe come back with a new chapter in five years. Or better: make something entirely new. But with the billion dollar box office success I expect mr. Sparrow to be back with a new adventure before 2009. Too bad.",5,1,3,2 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Too soapy, too long, but overall okay
","Being a big Spider-Man 1-2 and Sam Raimi fan, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I couldn't imagine that Raimi would be able to surpass the brilliant Spider-Man 2, but was at least hoping for a decent closure. And I think that Spider-Man 3 is exactly that: a decent closure. The first half of the story is heavy on the soapy side. While Peter Parker is getting all the appreciation as Spider-Man, the career of MJ is really going down. She gets fired from her Broadway play and must go back waitering in a jazz café. This causes a lot of stress in their relationship. The movie really kicks off when Sandman arrives at the scene and when Harry starts making plans to get rid of Peter Parker once and for all. Later on there's Topher Grace as well. Him becoming Venom is a great thing. I just wished there was more screen time for Venom. The Harry - Peter Parker relationship (with MJ in the middle) was what really worked in the film. Showing Peter Parker's dark side was well done, but couldn't they stop him from dancing? You know what I mean when you see the film. Of course, the movie is action packed. But frankly, we've seen fight scenes like these before (in part 1 and 2). They don't surprise us anymore. The final fight between the good guy(s) and bad guys is really cool. You really get that superhero-comic book sense of a greatness. Spider-Man 3 is no masterpiece. It's a very well made movie that only disappoints when you compare it to the previous movies. As a stand alone, it's great entertainment! 8/10",8,9,37,20 April 2007
Yes Man," Carrey's return to box office greatness?
","After commercial failures like Lemony Snicket, Fun with Dick and Jane and The Number 23 Jim Carrey could use another hit. Yes Man might just do the trick. It will undoubtedly not only mark Carrey's return to box office greatness (a 45 million dollar opening (when there are no snowstorms around)?), it will also go into history as the first movie in which the Canadian born actor gets oral sex on screen. No kidding. But more on that later.Yes Man is a typical Jim Carrey feel good movie. Like Bruce Almighty (a human becomes God), The Mask (a mask transforms a zero into a hero) and Liar Liar (a man is forced to tell the truth all the time) the film has a strong but ridiculous premise. What would happen if you said yes to every offer that you got? The story features Carl Allen (Carrey), a dull man who got stuck in a dull life. He's living the same life for at least three years now  ever since his girlfriend left him for another. His best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper) tries to draw him back into life, but Carl remains a hermit, saying no to every invitation he gets. When he accidentally forgets Peter's engagement party Carl decides to change his life drastically. He signs up for a Yes Man seminar by philosophy guru Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp) and embraces life by saying yes to any offer that's made to him. Guitar lessons, flying lessons, even a penis enlargement: Carl is your man. And wow, his life does get better. Carl not only gets a promotion, he also meets the charming Alison (Zooey Deschanel), a free spirit who sings in a band and has a job as a photographer. The two fall in love. But what happens when Alison finds out about his Yes Man way of life and begins to doubt if he really wants to choose for her?Ever since I saw the trailer I wanted to see Yes Man. In dark times we all need a laugh and let's face it: there's a lot of truth in the fact that only a Yes opens up new opportunities in life. Luckily, Jim Carrey fans should not be worried: Yes Man delivers the goods. The story is safely predictable and although Carrey carries the movie, he gets help from a strong supporting cast. Terrence Stamp is great as Yes man guru. Bradley Cooper  Carrey best friend in the movie - is a handsome man with some great screen presence. This movie could be his real breakthrough. But the real treat in Yes Man is Zooey Deschanel (The Happening, Bridge to Terabithia) as Carrey's love interest Alison. You can't help but falling in love with her in this movie. She's happily strange and immensely charming. I give her a 9/10 on the Drew Barrymore scale (with Drew having a 10/10 of course). Storywise Yes man starts rather nice. When Carl learns that 'Yes' means progress and 'No' could mean punishment he reluctantly agrees to almost anything  including his 70 year old toothless female neighbor giving him oral sex. I don't know what to think of the scene actually. It is funny, but it's a long way from the Claw in Liar Liar  if you know what I mean. Needless to say, Yes man is not exactly family entertainment. On the other hand, in Transformers there was also a dialogue about masturbating. So maybe Hollywood is growing up. One of the funniest scenes is the one that follows the kissing of a beautiful girl in the bar (as seen in the trailer). Her boyfriend wants to beat up Carl and what follows is a very funny fight between a muscled dumbo and a very drunk Carrey. In this scene Carrey really shows his comedic talent. Pretty hilarious.Overall Yes Man is nice entertainment. Carrey fans won't be disappointed and there are a lot of strong moments. Too bad the ending of the movie seems rushed. All the actions Carl undertakes under his Yes Man spell suddenly all turn out for the better (and that's just a little bit too convenient). The movie is only 82 minutes long and I suspect that there are a lot of scenes cut that could've given the story more drama and suspense. Despite the oral sex scene Yes Man is Jim Carrey's most romantic movie in a long while. Just watch the scene on the Hollywood Bowl stage... Well done!",8,72,95,29 November 2008
The Adventures of Tintin," Nice movie, but surely not the next Indiana Jones
","After Mars needs moms I thought that making computer movies with 'realistic' humans in it, was a bad idea. But here is another attempt, this time by movie legend Steven Spielberg and the Lord of the Rings himself, Peter Jackson. As we all know The adventures of Tintin was a billion years in the making. After Raiders of the Lost Ark someone told Spielberg that there were a lot of similarities between Indiana Jones and a European comic hero called Tintin. So the filmmaker bought the movierights, lost them and eventually obtained them again to make this first Tintin movie.In the comics Tintin is a young reporter who travels all around the world to chase after a good story. He has visited Russia, Tibet, Africa, the Middle-East and even Nazi-Germany. The first comic was published in 1930. And although the kids don't read the comics anymore, almost all European grownups know this hero. Tintin's best friends are a white dog named Snowy and a noisy sailor called Captain Haddock. And he gets a lot of help from two rather clumsy Interpol agents, Thomson and Thomson. In the Spielberg movie these characters also appear. In fact, the director stays pretty true to the comics.After the first trailer I wasn't anxious to see The adventures of Tintin on the big screen. But after the German TV-commercial which showed a lot of action, my hopes for an unforgettable movie event began to rise. Does Spielberg still have the magic to make something incredible and make full use of the computer effects?Unfortunately the answer to that question is no. The adventures of Tintin is good fun, that's true. But I don't think it will live up to the big hype. The story begins when Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn,on a market. Turns out it contains a secret message that will lead to the search of a lost treasure. Tintin gets kidnapped, gets acquainted with captain Haddock, travels to Morocco and finds out what villain is behind all this and why he wants to have his revenge on the Maddock family. The good things first. The visuals of The adventures of Tintin are truly stunning. The story takes place in the 1930s and has an old European city (Brussels? Paris?) with old pittoresque streets, a boat, airplane, desert, palaces and exotic Middle Eastern alleys in it. But even better: the computer animated characters look very convincing. I even think it's the best I've ever seen, although I guess they're not meant to be very realistic. All of them have a caricaturistic face, usually with a big nose or extra wrinkles. Contrary to the comics there's a lot of action in this movie. The best one was already seen in the German TV-commercial, that's when Tintin rides a motorcycle. Well done. There's also a great seabattle with pirates.Okay, then the rest. What I didn't like about The adventures of Tintin was the hero itself. Actually he's quite dull. Unlike Indiana Jones he doesn't have any rough edges. He can fight alright, but you know he will never play it dirty. Tintin has an angelic face that tells you he will never be harmed or injured. There goes the suspense! Thanks to framed newspaper clips on the wall of his living room we get to know that Tintin is a very successful reporter who has written several important stories. But why couldn't Spielberg tells us that with some pre-story scene like in Raiders of the Lost Arc? That would have worked much better. Captain Haddock is much more interesting though. He starts out as a alcohol addict and even stays that way. But he's funny as hell. Great voice performance by Andy Serkis. Even Tintin's dog Snowy is more exciting than Tintin. The story doesn't work either. It keeps being pushed forward by Tintin saying: 'Wait a minute, now I understand' after he has decrypted another clue. The audience can't think along with the characters. They must accept that what they're saying is true and hope that something interesting or entertaining comes out of it. Although the story takes place around the same time as Indiana Jones and also has old motorcycles, planes and Middle Eastern streets in it, Tintin has little to do with our favourite adventurer. And that's bad, because I really was hoping that Spielberg had found a new kind of hero. The movie doesn't end with a bang but instead has some sort of cliffhanger. That didn't satisfy me at all. The Adventures of Tintin is good fun. It has some nice scenes and especially captain Haddock and Tintin's dog Snowy are very funny. But both Spielberg and Jackson are talented enough to give us more than just 'good fun', aren't they?I hope they'll do much better in the already planned sequel.7/10",Null,14,68,11 October 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The best Marvel movie since Spider-Man 2 and X-Men 2
","If you've been watching the internet the last few weeks you may know that most journalists raved about Captain America : The Winter Soldier. And they were all right: the latest Captain America outing isn't only far better than part 1; I even dare to say that it's in the same league as Spider-Man 2 (2004) and X-Men 2 (2003). The Winter Soldier is spectacular in its action scenes and the chemistry between the hero (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is undeniable.One of the strengths of Captain America part 1 was the atmosphere: I loved the fact that it took place during World War II and therefor had some historical and nostalgic flavor. However, after the events of The Avengers it was clear that the second movie would take place in modern day America. How could the makers maintain the same mood and spirit of The First Avenger?Well, directors John and Anthony Russo both succeed in that. Without giving away too many spoilers you can say that The Winter Soldier uses a lot of the elements that was presented to us in the first movie. Hydra returns for example - and does that in a very big way. Another important character from part 1 comes back to haunt Steve Rogers. There are actually so many things from the first movie that I would recommend you'd watch that one first before you see this new movie.The story of The Winter Soldier centers on SHIELD. Steve Rogers and Nick Fury discover that the organization is compromised and must find out who's behind all this. In the meantime Rogers meets the mysterious and powerful Winter Soldier, who not only kills one of his colleagues but also seems to have a familiar face. But who is he? Looks like the only one he can trust is Natasha Romanoff. Luckily he also befriends an ex-soldier called Sam Wilson (The Falcon), who turns out to be a big help.From the first action scene involving a big ship to the last battle between Captain America and the Winter Soldier this movie will hold you in a tight grip. Some of the fight scenes even reminded me of The Raid – and yes, that's meant as a compliment. Can I give away one small spoiler or two? Two of the best scenes in the movie are Steve Rogers visiting an exhibition of himself (both funny and moving) and his meeting with his old love, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell with lots of make-up). These scenes give this great action flick a true heart.I can't wait to see Captain America: The Winter Soldier again! And oh yeah, this time there isn't just one but two after-credits scenes!9/10",9,12,26,23 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A satisfying conclusion to the 42 year old saga
","In 2015 JJ Abrams had the daunting but almost impossible task to come up with a new Star Wars movie that would not only entertain the critical old fans but also satisfy the new ones. His trick? He introduced new characters and made a remake of A New Hope. For me that worked fine.He actually does the same with The Rise of Skywalker.To conclude both the new trilogy as well as the whole Skywalker saga he revisited famous old Star Wars locations and 'copied' some of the most famous scenes from A New Hope, The Empire strikes back and Return of the Jedi. And of course he made a comeback possible of the biggest Star Wars villain around, emperor Palpatine.Cheap? Maybe. But all of Abram's decisions work out very well. With The Rise of Skywalker he made an entertaining and epic conclusion of the Skywalker saga. He wasn't able to please all fans of course, but that's what you get when you tackle a project like this. Too bad a lot of people wanted him to fail and never gave him a chance. Some people even suggests that this episode is even worse than The Phantom Menace - and that's absurd.The Rise of Skywalker is not a perfect film.There's a lot going on and especially C3PO's storyline in the beginning takes a lot of screentime. The 'MacGuffin' in the story seems far fetched, but the film really delivers at the moments when it has to.Because it's best to see the movie without knowing anything here are some things that I think are worth mentioning.<ul><li>The opening crawl of the movie starts with 'The Dead speak', referring to the return of Palpatine who has given the entire universe a terrorist-like message that he's back</li></ul><ul><li>Rey, Finn and Poe are together almost the whole film</li></ul><ul><li>The scenes with Carrie Fisher are well done. If you didn't know that she died you'd think that she filmed all new scenes. Only one shot of Leia seems fake</li></ul><ul><li>The confrontations between Ren and Rey are highlights</li></ul><ul><li>Kylo Ren's character is the most interesting</li></ul><ul><li>There one big WTF moment in the movie that no doubt will be spoilered by trolls on the internet</li></ul><ul><li>JJ Abrams does a lot of fan service (nothing wrong with that)</li></ul><ul><li>Who or what is Rey? I could live with the answer</li></ul><ul><li>In the last scene the thing that you hope would happen actually does</li></ul>Well, that's it really. I hope in time the haters will see what a great JJ Abrams has made. I can't wait to see the film a second time!8.5/10",8,421,885,19 December 2019
Man of Steel," I guess even Superman IV was better than this one
","There are 1400+ reviews of this movie already, so there's no point in writing one extra, really. But I'm doing it anyway because I'm mad as hell. This movie is so bad, I felt robbed and deceived at the same time when I left the cinema.Superman is my hero. I loved what Richard Donner did with the first two movies. Superman III was corny but great fun, Superman IV was a terrible mistake mainly caused by minimizing the budget. Superman Returns had its flaws but at least was a movie with a heart. And it used the original John Williams music (theme) of course. Man of Steel has none of the mentioned things above.Zack Snyder's movie relies pretty much on the special effects and has an ordinary rumble as a finale. What is this? Rocky in space? In Superman II our hero at least tricked general Zod into a trap and then defeated him.There's a lot not to be liked in Man of Steel. Krypton looks like it was stolen from Chronicles of Riddick, there's no spark between Clark Kent and Lois Lane and what kind of hologram is the dead Jor-El (Russel Crowe) anyway when Clark meets him? One with all his memories restored and one capable of properly responding to all the actions of Clark Kent? Not realistic. And if this was the only way for Clark to meet his real parents why was his real mother not resurrected like that? Well, at least Russel Crowe doesn't sing in this movie.People praise Man of Steel for its visuals. The movie costed about 225+ million dollars but somehow they couldn't afford to use a tripod, because most scenes were shot as if they were meant for a documentary. In The Hunger Games the shaky cam at least had a purpose (to suggest violence and avoid a R rating). The movie ends with a lot of action. These scenes look great, but why are there so many of them? Once you've seen one of them you've seen them all. Ever heard of the expression Less is more? Or did Michael Bay second unit these sequences?I guess a Christopher Reeve-like new Superman movie would have failed at the box office. So maybe director Zack Snyder did it right by choosing for this dark but realistic approach. The box office success of Man of Steel proves him right. But this is not my Superman. I miss the nerd Clark Kent. I miss the laughs. Why does Superman take itself so seriously? But overall I miss a heart. Watching the movie I didn't care about Clark Kent, Lois Lane or Superman anymore. It made me even long for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, by far the worst Superman movie ever made.But let us end on a positive note. Man of Steel was humourless and bad, but it's still way better than a turkey Green Lantern. And I must confess that Henry Cavill's body was really super. But wouldn't it be nice if Zack Snyder skipped Man of Steel 2 and focused on Dawn of the Dead part 2? Because that's a movie I would really like to see!3/10",3,8,16,28 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," Robert Carlisle makes it special
","28 Days Weeks Later is not as good as its original, but still very entertaining. Key factor in this one is the very talented (and daring) Robert Carlisle. I don't see that many big American actors (like Tom Cruise, Will Smith or Bruce Willis for instance) taking up a role about a man who cowardly runs away from his wife in order to save his own life, who lies to his kids and at the end is even responsible for wiping out the entire surviving human colony. Even as a killing zombie you still feel sympathy for this man. Robert Carlisle is our man! If he does a villain (Trainspotting) or a sympathetic loser (The Full Monty), you always believe his character.Storywise there are a lot of elements in 28 Weeks Later that secure enough scenes of suspense and action. Again, the deserted London looks great. Even though it's hard to believe that the two children manage to escape from the save zone, the scenes in which they drive through the deserted British capital make a big impression. Yeah, I loved this movie!8/10",8,0,1,14 March 2008
Control," So this is how it really was?
","As a Joy Division fan it is difficult to have an objective look at this movie. Just after Ian Curtis's suicide (in 1980) the real story of Joy Division became a true mystery. Why did Ian Curtis kill himself? How many songs were unreleased? What other bootleg would turn up? And is that really Peter Hook or Bernard Sumner singing In a lonely place? Or was it in fact Ian Curtis's very last studio recording? Questions, questions. Because they were not answered, Ian Curtis became a mystical legend, who - like Jim Morisson - flirted with death long before he killed himself.I don't know which events in the Anton Corbijn movie actually happened. Based on the book by his widow maybe 70% of it all is correct, because even a view from a witness is of course a subjective one. For fans like me it's great to learn about the events that may have happened. In the eighties I always thought that Ian Curtis committed suicide because he was frequently depressed due to his illness. I never knew that he was struggling with his marriage and that there was another woman in his life. I didn't know he worked as a social worker either. Legend had it that he spent his days in a factory; a job so dull that it gave him enough time to daydream, thinking about nice words to put in his lyrics. The beautiful black and white images by Anton Corbijn give the movie Control a poetic documentary feel. The fact that all the actors really played their instruments themselves also helps this.As a fan you really get a chill during the concert scenes. You could never have been there when Joy Division played Leaders of Men, No Love Lost or even Transmission or Digital on stage. I became a fan when their last studio album Closer was released. Ian Curtis was already dead at that time. Watching the movie is the next best thing. The actors playing Joy Division are great. Sam Riley is a great 'on stage' Ian Curtis. He is also convincing in the drama scenes, fiction or not. But is Control enjoyable when you don't know anything about Joy Division? I really don't know. Is there enough suspense and drama in this movie? Hard to tell. I read a review by Ian Curtis's daughter (also featured in the movie) who surely sees Control as a recount of what actually happened. She said that the city of Manchester was lacking in the story. I agree. I hated 24 Hour People, but at least the Manchester scene had a major part in that movie. Also lacking was a good view of Ian's many depressions. Yes! I have never met him myself of course, but watching Control I was surprised by how lively and communicative Ian Curtis was. To me in the movie he was not the depressed man that would later hang himself. I can imagine that the real Ian Curtis would have been more down and introvert. Otherwise he wouldn't have taken his own life, would he?Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this movie. Right afterwards I put on my Joy Division vinyl albums and got lost in legendary tracks like New Dawn Fades, Love will tear us apart and Dead Souls. Joy Division and New Order really defined my teenage years in the eighties. As a fan I think Control is a very well made movie, directed by a person who might have been just as important for the alternative eigthies music-scene as well. Anton Corbijn made beautiful pictures of all the great bands from that time (U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, XTC, Elvis Costello), so if there was one man who could do this, it would be Anton. Control is a grand statue for one of the biggest new wave (or rock) heroes in history. Ian Curtis will never die.8/10",8,2,2,28 March 2008
Captain America: Civil War," Could have been the best Iron Man movie ever (but is still great!)
","Don't get me wrong: Civil War is a great movie and Captain America is by far my favourite Avenger. But actually in the story the real drama and conflict comes from Tony Stark - not Steve Rogers. Captain America goes rogue in order to save his friend Bucky - that's understandable. But it is up to Iron Man to bring his friend in. Adding to this drama Stark has a few ghosts from the past he has to fight as well. So although Civil War is one of the best Marvel movies ever, it could have been even more interesting if the main focus was on Iron Man.But let us not be unthankful. Civil War is a great fun and an exciting ride. First of all Spider- Man gets a great introduction. I liked the fact that he's in highschool instead of being a student like the previous movies. His scene with Tony Stark is brilliant and during the fight at the airport he steals the show - still being in awe of seeing his Avenger heroes for the first time. I also loved Black Panther. His role in the story is pretty vital. Because there are a lot of Avengers seen in Civil War it could easily have been an Avengers film. The Russo brothers did a great job by giving all the heroes enough screen time. So were there any down points? Personally I didn't like Ant-Man becoming the giant that he can be at the airport fightscene. With the Avengers not really wanting to hurt each other, the fight scenes almost became slapstick. Ant-Man becoming the giant was just a little bit too much, I think.But enough complaining. Captain America Civil War is a great action movie about loyalty and friendship. At the end the relationship between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers is changed forever and I can't wait when they will face each other again in The Avengers III. Oh yeah: one spoiler: finally Captain America gets his first kiss. It was about time!Can't wait to see it again.9/10",9,9,22,20 April 2016
X-Men: The Last Stand," Where is Bryan Singer when you need him?
","X-Men 3: The Last Stand is indeed the last chapter in the X-Men saga. That's pretty much the conclusion when you've seen the film. I guess we must be glad that there will be no part 4, because director Brett Ratner came pretty close to destroying the whole X-Men movie franchise. I guess everybody knows the story of The Last Stand. Jean Grey comes back from the dead and turns evil. In the meantime scientists have found a way to destroy the X-gene that turns humans into mutants. In other words: mutants can be cured. Let us begin with the good news. The action scenes in The Last Stand are great. Storm and Beast get a lot of screen time (and Halle looks gorgeous!) and there's one great scene in the middle of the movie in which an important character dies. Wow! The man doesn't just die. He gets crucified! And we're not talking extra's here, it's freaking ******! The bad news then. The music is awful. Looks like it was taken from a bad direct-to-DVD horrorflick. The dialogs are bad. The Dark Phoenix doesn't do a lot until the finale of the movie. And all the people that we learned to love (and hate) make an unworthy exit. Didn't Rattner have more respect for our X-Men heroes? Bryan Singer succeeded in turning the X-Men story into more than just an action movie. How we miss his sense of the characters and vision on this universe. The finale was okay though and the whole experience was - let's say - entertaining. So I give this a 7 out of 10.January 2013 - Been watching the extended fanedit by ADigitalman. This actually works a lot better although all the main criticism remains: the music is so wrong. Bryan Singer would have turned this one into an great epic movie. Unfortunately he did Superman. What a shame. Still looking forward to Days of Future Past though!",7,9,18,16 May 2006
The Mist," Remember the movie Jude?
","Frank Darabont + Stephen King is usually a good combination. Think The Shawshank redemption en The Green Mile. And yes, The Mist is a very well made movie. Unlike most horror stories it focuses on the horror within ourselves, causing paranoia and panic. What happens to the people that are trapped in the store, is understandable and completely human. I liked that part. There's more suspense than gore. The tentacles of the monsters looked fake, though. Those effects would have worked better in black and white I suppose.No, like everybody who's seen this movie it's the ending that puzzles me. Because no matter how dramatic it is, in the story there's no where a clue to be found that the main characters will do such a thing. Or maybe I missed it? Is there somewhere a conversation like: 'Please, don't let those monsters get me? I'd rather be dead...?' And isn't it strange that the group of survivors will head to the unknown, trying to get out of the fog and suddenly give up like that? Up till 'the moment of truth' The Mist is a well written scary ride in the name of entertainment. Nothing more. But the non-Hollywood ending suggests that there is more to this story. It pretentiously claims that 'this horror movie is more than just a horror movie.' But what makes The Mist so different? Was there an important statement to be made, that justifies the ending? Let's face it: it's a good film but really no Oscar material.The Jude-like conclusion reminds me of the alternative finale in I am Legend. In the original version Will Smith dies. But in this version he survives and leaves New York in search of other survivors. That ending was much more positive than the original one and actually worked much better. Let's hope a similar ending will also be found on the The Mist DVD.7/10",7,1,3,29 March 2008
Grudge Match," They blew it
","You gotta hand it to the producers of Grudge Match. They managed to get both Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta into one movie. Unfortunately they were so glad with this achievement they forgot to take care of the most important thing in a film: a good script. The story of two old champions who battle it out to determine who's the best is okay at best, but most of the time you get bored by what happens on screen. The film can't choose between drama and comedy and therefor doesn't hit any target. The only reason you keep watching is the cast: DeNiro and Stallone are okay, but it's nice to see the still beautiful Kim Basinger (who turns 61 this year) and the always brilliant Alan Arkin at work. Kevin Hart as wannabe box promoter is pretty irritating though. On the bright side: at the final fight the movie delivers and as a viewer you can live with the end result. But if the leads weren't played by actors who had a famous movie boxing history like Stallone and DeNiro have, this movie would probably have been quite unwatchable.Oh yeah, there is a sort of after credits scene in Grudge Match and sadly this one is the funniest scene in the whole movie. I guess that says enough...6/10",6,1,2,30 March 2014
Transformers," Entertaining but flat
","To me the talented Michael Bay is a director who should dose his action scenes more. I actually got headaches from watching all the exploding things in Armageddon. Those scenes were very well done, but there's also something like overkill. Less action and more character development and his pictures will be more in balance. Enter Transformers. The trailers looked great, the first screenings were very well received and with Steven Spielberg as a producer this project just couldn't get wrong. It doesn't actually, but to say that Transformers is a flawless movie... I guess the best thing about Transformers is that Bay succeeded in making the audience believe that a toy franchise can actually be the basis of a believable and entertaining movie. The first hour of Transformers is great fun. The movie starts with a bang (the first Decepticon destroys an entire base in Qatar) and introduces the world of the Autobots through the eyes of the character of Shia LeBeauf. He plays a very likable geek who wants to buy a car in order to be more popular at school. That car of course turns out to be Bumblebee. LeBeauf is great. Shia plays his character with a lot of humour and he carries the movie without any problems. The second part of the movie is about the war between the Autobots and Decepticons. Here the usual Bay mistake enters. Although the action scenes and special effects are great, a lot of it should have been deleted. Once you've seen a truck turn into a Transformer, you've seen it all. You know the good guys will win, so why not speed it all up? In my opinion science fiction only works when it has a certain degree of logic and realism. In the first part a military captain (Josh Duhamel) who just turned into a father almost gets killed by a Decepticon. The whole world think his legion is dead. But once he's in the normal world again he doesn't call his wife that he's alive and kicking. In the last part of the movie the good guys lure the bad guys to the big city so they have more ways to hide an important item. That's dramatically a good choice, because there are a lot of potential human victims there. But is it realistic? When you know how much damage the Decepticons can do, a big city is the last place you wanna go. The role of Megan Fox is both a curse and a blessing to the story. First of all, she's so incredibly hot that sometimes you wish that the Transformers weren't there to spoil your view. Wow, she rocks! On the other side she starts out as this unreachable babe (like Kirsten Dunst in Spider-Man). But despite all that's happening to them the love story between Shia and Megan remains hard to believe. But then again, maybe I'm just jealous, hahaha! I would like to end this review with one remark. The Transformers toys aim at children between five and twelve years I guess. I know Hasbro has been hoping that the movie would be 9+ (or something along those lines). If you look at all the Aliens-like violence in the movie you can imagine that 9 year old kids (despite the official rating) might visit the movie if they're accompanied by a father. But why spoil this opportunity by putting the scene in in which they talk about masturbation? If you saw the movie you know what I mean. The scene was very funny, though. Transformers is a great action movie and will without any doubt be a huge success and the first installment of a movie series. The second movie will be the movie of truth. Okay, we know now that Transformers can disguise themselves and transform from a car into a robot. Now show us things they can do that can reach us at a dramatic level!7,5 out of 10",8,14,28,26 June 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Can't believe all the praise!
","When I look at all the positive reviews I can't believe my eyes. I really liked the first part of the movie when the 5 winners are found and presented. But what happens in the chocolate factory itself is visually stunning but very low on a human level. You never have the feeling that the kids are in a real competition and the parents react so strangely unemotional when their children screw up and must leave the party in such a painful way. Too bad! The 2001 joke was very funny, though. Of course there are some great candy ideas presented in the factory. But when you've seen one, two or three, then you've seen them all. The Gene Wilder version was much warmer overall. So I prefer that one when you compare the two.",7,0,2,6 August 2005
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Even with high expectations it doesn't even disappoint!
","Tony Stark wants to invent something that benefits mankind but instead turns out to be the one responsible for the creation of this dangerous self thinking robot, Ultron. The Avengers must assemble once again to fight this menace that wants to kill all the humans on this planet. But Ultron is powerful and the way he is presented makes you wonder how our heroes can defeat him. Just you wait and see...What I liked best about Age of Ultron was the fact that all our favorite heroes get equal screen time to show of what they can do. Although the action scenes are great (Iron Man in the Hulkbuster versus Hulk!) the thing that really makes this movie work is the interaction between all the people involved. Stark and Banner, Banner and Black Widow, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Thor and Captain America... like in real life you can see with whom each of them get along best. It's also nice to see that Hawkeye gets a lot of screen time. He even gets the most interesting background story of the bunch. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch make a great addition to the team (sort of) and there are a lot more cameos in the movie (although I don't think anybody spotted Lou Ferrigno!).The movie runs about two and a half hours and that's pretty long. It could have been a little bit shorter, but overall I didn't mind. With great action scenes (pay attention to the opening action sequence in which he introduces the Avengers in one mighty shot!), nice humor, a lot of cameos and a satisfying finale writer/director Joss Whedon has everything under control and that pays of.This year (2015) The Avengers Age of Ultron will shatter all box office records and that will be a fitting reward for giving most Marvel fans and 'normal' moviegoers this big treat. Even Pixar slipped (with Cars 2 and Brave) so everybody's waiting for Marvel to produce a real stinker. Although that day may come, The Avengers part 2 is not the movie that will be responsible for that!8,5 / 10",8,89,177,20 April 2015
Pride & Prejudice," Where are Colin and Hugh when you need them?
","In 1995 the 5 hours miniseries of Pride & Prejudice, with Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, was a big hit in England and the Netherlands. It even inspired Helen Fielding to write the Bridget Jones's novels. Therefor, whether you'll like the new 2005 movie mainly depends on the fact if you've seen the version that was done ten years ago. If you have, you'll probably be very disappointed with the Knightly movie. If you haven't, well, maybe this romantic flick may be 'amiable' enough for you.For those who aren't familiar with the story: Pride & Prejudice is a romantic costume drama that takes place in 19th century England and is based on the famous novel by Jane Austen. The story is about the Bennet family, a father, mother and five or six daughters. The only way to secure the future of the children is to marry a party that owns a lot of money. Jane, the oldest sister, is beautiful but a little icy. She hopes to marry young Bingley, a rich aristocrat who just moved to a castle nearby. Her younger sister Elizabeth, the main character of the movie, wants to help her conquer his heart, but finds out that Bingley's best friend, the rich but arrogant mister Darcy, sabotages her plans. Elizabeth and Darcy start out as enemies, but as the story progresses they both find out that their opinions of each other are based on wrong information, pride and prejudice.Let's bring the good news first. The new Pride & Prejudice is the big Keira Knightly show. Although she cannot top Jennifer Ehle's performance, Knightly proves that she has real star-power and that she is able to carry a movie. She looks lovely in this flick: she enchants you with her great smile and has the charms of a young Winona Ryder. Dame Judi Dench is excellent as Darcy's powerful aunt who is against a marriage and Donald Sutherland has a both moving and funny scene at the end of the movie when he gives permission to Darcy to marry Elizabeth. The end of the movie is actually better than the one in the miniseries. Okay, then the bad news. I guess the main flaw of this new version is Darcy himself, a role played by Matthew MacFadyen. In the story he is rather dull and generally uninterested in what's going on. It must be difficult to replace Colin Firth as leading man and the Darcy of the miniseries of course had more (screen)time to show his inner struggle. But the new Darcy is so dull that frankly you don't care if he ends up winning Elizabeth's heart or not. There is absolutely no spark between Knightly and MacFadyen. At the end of the movie they don't even kiss and as an audience you couldn't care less. But Darcy isn't the only one that seems miscast. The new mister Bingley is  despite his Jamie Oliver haircut  a real nerd, and mister Wickham, who falls in love with Elizabeth but elopes with her younger sister, lacks the depth to be an interesting villain. Because of the time-frame, the movie is less subtle than the miniseries. There's a lot to be told in two hours and because of that there is hardly any suspense. Problems rise but they are solved within minutes. But what I really missed were the great dialogs. In the miniseries heavy emotions were always masqueraded by politeness. Darcy doesn't say 'Wow, it's great to see you, Elizabeth' but instead asks if her parents are in good health. The things that are NOT said were more interesting than the things that were indeed spoken out. The encounters between Elizabeth and Darcy always turned out to be great fights in which words and sentences were used as swords and daggers. I really missed that in the new version. Come to think of it, I also missed the humor you did see in Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility, also based on a Jane Austen novel. Where is Hugh Grant when you need him?A friend of mine  also a journalist  really liked this movie. But he hadn't seen the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995. So perhaps I'm a little hard on what was presented to me last week, because the film does have its qualities.7 of out of 10",7,391,672,28 July 2005
Avatar," Avatar is not a movie. It's an event!
","Frankly, I didn't think James Cameron would pull it off, but he did. Avatar turned into a groundbreaking work of art... if you look at the visual side of the movie. If you watch this movie in IMAX 3D – as you should – it will be an unforgettable experience. You have the feeling that you've actually been to the planet of Pandora. You'll really think that an alien race like the Na'vi exist. James Cameron did a great job inventing their language, habits and rituals. He also put a lot of detail into the planet itself. The exotic animals do not all convince, but the trees, plants and insects are stunning. Especially the images of the floating mountains are unforgettable. But does Avatar also break ground on a story level? No, it doesn't. Like many visitors have concluded before, the movie heavily relies on a flick like Dances with wolves and borrows elements from a game like Assassin's Creed. This scifi tale is pretty predictable actually, but that doesn't hurt in any way. You know the good side will win eventually and you know the hero in the end gets the girl. In order to see that happen you'll be more than willing to sit through the whole 165 minutes of the movie.Oh, perhaps there's at least one thing that can be considered groundbreaking storywise. To me this was perhaps the first time that a director/writer succeeded in showing a believable love story between a human and an alien. The chemistry between our human hero and alien heroin didn't have Titanic proportions, but it worked.At this point (Dec 20th) it is clear that Avatar is a big hit worldwide. I don't know if it will cover its costs but the hype is there. I only wonder if the audience understands the fact that James Cameron used two major American tragedies to achieve the right sentiment for the story. The first one is obviously the tragedy of the Native American people. Like the Na'vi they were slaughtered by the (white) men in the name of greed. In the story of Avatar they win the fight, but as we all know in real life it was different. Is this a case of alternate history? The second tragedy used by Cameron is a powerful one: the collapsing of the World Trade Centre. In Avatar it translates into an impressive and moving scene, but one could wonder if tragedies like these aren't too sacred to be used in entertainment movies like these. Here they're only used for dramatic effect, not for a (political) statement. But maybe I'm just nitpicking here. Avatar is a impressive and unforgettable movie experience. James Cameron establishes himself as the great moviemaker he is and I cannot think of anyone who can resist his imagining of a this wondrous fantasy world. After 12 years of silence, the success of Titanic behind him and stories of an ever increasing budget, the pressure on James Cameron must have been inhumanly big. But still, the man delivers. Avatar is not a movie. It's an event!9/10",9,3,8,20 December 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," 120% Explosions, 75% entertainment
","When will Michael Bay learn that sometimes less is more? In the Transformers sequel there are so many explosions, transformations and robot fights that you soon reach a point that you almost don't care anymore. I say 'almost', because as a big budget action movie Revenge of the Fallen surely delivers... for the fans.The first 20 minutes or so are plain bad. The story starts out in the past when we see Bionicle-like Decepticons inhabit our very earth. Jumping to the present the movie treats us with some childish humour (a crying Bumblebee? Come on!) before it really kicks off at the university. Our hero Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) has a close encounter with an incredibly hot female student. Too good to be true, of course! But the lady turns out to be a lethal Decepticon and a few seconds later the big chase/escape/adventure begins.When the Decepticon invasion starts invading our planet and something terrible happens to Optimus Prime the movie gets interesting. The special effects are first rate (the sinking of a big marine ship, the Decepticons under water), Megan Fox looks incredible sexy, Shia Labeouf has some great funny moments and John Turturro... well, John Turturro is as neurotic as he's always been.Too bad that the movie is about 20 minutes too long and that there are so many fights and explosions that they cannot make a big impact anymore. The direct confrontations between the Autobots and Decepticons are so unclear that you never know which one is winning or gets damaged. Thank God Michael Bay sometimes uses slow motion.I guess something pretty drastic must happen in the inevitable Transformers part III to keep the franchise alive. Because although this sequel is a great spectacle it showed nothing new. Except maybe the fact that some Decepticons can disguise themselves as humans - like in Battlestar Galactica. If you enjoyed part 1 you will certainly enjoy this one too. But this sequel will not win the franchise new friends...7,5 out of 10",7,1,4,23 June 2009
WALL·E," Funny and engaging, but foggy in the second half
","The guys at Pixar are known not to take the easy road. A world filled with speaking cars? Monsters that scare kids in order to keep the electricity flowing? Their fantasies are not the easiest ones to be put on the screen. Wall-E is also a daring project. It's the story of a lonely robot who falls in love with another robot, follows her across the galaxy and in the end saves mankind. Sort of.The problem with Wall-E is also the challenge of the whole movie. How can you make the audience care for a creature that is a machine? How can you make a love story that revolves around robots? Pixar does it with lots of visual Buster Keaton-like humor. Wall-E is clumsy, strict, kind and... lonely. Although E.T. immediately comes to mind he also shares a lot of characteristics with Mr. Bean. The first part of the movie - in which we see Wall-E doing his thing in a deserted human world - is actually the best. Visually stunning we immediately believe in Wall-E's world. It's dark, stuffy but fascinating.His dull life changes when EVE lands on earth. EVE is a high-tech investigating robot who has to report to a group of surviving humans. The two fall in love but when EVE must go back, Wall-E can't let her go. He follows her to a big spaceship that has been entertaining the surviving humans for 700 years. The ship was supposed to do so until earth was safe again to go back. But are the spoilt humans up to the change?Somehow the second part of the movie doesn't entirely work. The idea of a ship traveling through space is not new. Classic SF writers like Robert Heinlein wrote books about it. Pixar does a nice job by showing a society in which humans don't have to do anything anymore and all become physically supersized. This sarcastic tone is well done. But from the moment Wall-E arrives at the spaceship the story becomes unclear. What is Wall-E's mission? What does he have to achieve in order to save the humans? And do they really want to be saved?The end - where the humans give up their luxury lives to return to earth - seems somewhat illogical. The deserted earth that is presented to us does not seem that inviting. And that's a pity. Because Wall-E remains great entertainment and deserves to be a great hit. But compared to Kung Fu Panda the Pixar movie is maybe a little bit to ambitious to reach its real goal. Wall-E is a great movie, but not Pixar's best.",8,8,20,22 June 2008
X-Men: First Class," The best prequel movie ever made... period
","Normally prequel movies are made because the main characters of the first movie died (or in the end achieved their goals) and the producers still want to make money out of the franchise. Think Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, Psycho, the (still to be made?) I am legend and of course George Lucas's Star Wars saga. X-Men First Class also falls into that category, but I cannot imagine that anybody will be complaining about that. Director Matthew Vaughn created a great, thrilling and sometimes even moving picture that without any doubt will get raving reviews and be a huge commercial success. God knows both movie and director deserve it.What makes X-Men First Class really work is the great story. It tells us about the beginning of the mutants and especially the friendship between professor X (a charming James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (an impressive Michael Fassbender). Although they will drift apart at some time, you know that they will always have respect for each other. In this stage they even become close friends. The movie opens during World War 2, when young boy Erik is taken to a concentration camp (like the opening of the first X-Men movie). There he meets Sebestian Shaw (a great Kevin Bacon), a scary Joseph Mengele-like scientist who likes to experiment on Jews and is especially interested in mutants. In order to force Erik into helping him he shoots his mother. Erik never forgives him for that and spends his whole life looking for revenge. Unfortunately he learns that Shaw is also a mutant. The scientist is even so powerful that it's almost impossible for Erik to kill him. Luckily he bumps into Charles Xavier...What I also like about First Class is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses historical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point. Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation is laid for X-Men 1-3.The performances in First Class are first rate. Kevin Bacon is a brilliant villain. His German is actually quite good and his opening scene can already be considered as a classic. He also speaks Russian in the movie by the way. Michael Fassbender (Magneto) represents the most exciting drama in the story. He's kinda like Darth Vader. You know he will turn to the Dark Side but you still hope that somehow he will stick with professor X.First Class will be the beginning of super stardom for actress Jennifer Lawrence. She plays Raven in the story, a girl Xavier adopts as a real sister/best friend. She later becomes Mystique. Jennifer won critical acclaim with her role in Winter Bone and will play the lead in the much anticipated The Hunger Games movie, to be released in 2012. She is a great, vulnerable Mystique who later on chooses Magneto over 'her brother' Professor X. So what's more to tell? January Jones as Emma Frost is sexy as hell, the special effects in the movie are great and there are not one but two cameos from actors from the first X-Men movie (and no, the second one is not Patrick Stewart). Unlike previous Marvel movies there is no extra scene after the end credits and Stan Lee does not have a small part in this one. Overall First Class makes you think of the Sean Connery Bond movies and the reboot of Star Trek (2009).So... are you convinced? Just go see this excellent movie. Can't wait for its sequel!9/10",8,95,149,27 May 2011
Iron Man," It's the big Robert Downey Jr show - and I like it!
","From the first moment Robert Downey Jr comes on screen as Tony Stark, you know that this movie can't go wrong. We are in some desert in Afghanistan and wisecracking Stark tells something about his playboy life to some soldiers. Yes, this ain't no nerdy Peter Parker or tortured Wolverine. Our hero is a person who generally enjoys life (and women) and has no second thoughts on how he lives it. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! But of course his bubble bursts when Stark is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to reproduce his killing missile, the Jericho. The sacrifice of a fellow scientist makes him humble and after his spectacular escape Stark decides to better his life. No more manufacturing of weapons for Stark Industries. From now on Stark wants to help his fellow men. Although this decision impresses some (like Stark's secretary Paltrow) it also infuriates others (like Stark's partner Jeff Bridges). This all leads to a action-packed finale in which Iron Man must face a deadly enemy...Iron Man is the big Robert Downey Jr. show. Downey not only brings humor and flamboyance to his role, he also manages to make you believe that an egocentric person can indeed change into a real humanitarian. The scene in which he realizes that someone is willing to make a sacrifice in order for him to escape is even a moving one. Well done. Downey is really a great actor with great charisma.But there is a lot more to Iron Man. There are four or five big action scenes. The first four are so great (the escape from the cave and a sequence involving an Afghan village) that the last one - the big finale - disappoints a little bit. But that's okay. There are also a lot of smaller scenes to be enjoyed, focusing on the relationship between Downey and Paltrow and the development of the Iron Man armour. Jeff Bridges is always great to look at, although his role could have been played by several other actors. Maybe his storyline is the weakest of the film. His betrayal is no surprise, but his early involvement in this is hard to believe. Iron Man is a spectacular and funny popcorn ride that not only has great action scenes, but also some great actors. Hopefully it will do very well at the box office, because I can't wait to see Iron Man 2. Enjoy!PS: no Samuel Jackson in this version either!8,5 out of 10",8,102,147,16 April 2008
Blade Runner," I still don't buy a few things
","Just saw Blade Runner (The Final Cut) on my 119 cm LG TV. Wow, doesn't it look great, even 'just' on DVD! Blade Runner I have seen many, many times. I consider it a great scifi classic, but I know that some of the criticism I had when I first saw it in the cinema back in 1983 still exists. For instance, no replicant on the move will agree to participate in the Voight-Kampff-test that the Blade Runners perform. They know that when their true nature is revealed, the Blade Runner will kill them. So why cooperate? And why does it take so long for the Voight-Kampff machine to get results? Wouldn't it be more logical if Blade Runners got a gadget that can recognize a replicant in 5 seconds? For instance by body temperature? Isn't it a little bit silly when you say: 'Okay, I suspect that you're not human but a renegade replicant. Would you mind sitting down with me for 15 minutes so I can investigate whether my suspicions are false or indeed correct?'Another thing that's still hard to swallow: Deckard maybe being a replicant himself. Before the Directors Cut there was no Unicorn dream sequence. Therefor there weren't any indications that Deckard might be a machine. So why think of the idea? If Ridley Scott truly wanted to tell a tale of replicant chasing replicant he should have been more clear on that subject. Last but not least. If you think of Deckard being fully human (instead of being a replicant) I think the love story between him and Rachel is also difficult to believe. Why should a human fall in love with an android, even if she's so beautiful as Rachel? Isn't that... immoral? Wrong? Sick?Okay, it's not my goal to burn down Blade Runner, because I still think it's one of the 30 best films ever made. Rutger Hauer is impressive and Harrison Ford's part of Deckard is a more daring one than the one in Witness. As 'a hero' he only succeeds in killing two replicants... and they're both female. And of course the city itself looks stunning. Even in this age of CGI the images of LA and the flying cars are unsurpassed. Great gadget art by Syd Mead.Blade Runner... yeah!9/10",10,3,9,13 August 2010
Monsters University," Finally and thankfully Pixar does it again!
","Of all the Pixar movies Monsters Inc. has always been my absolute favorite. The incredible story of the remarkable friendship between Sully, Mike and Boo made me watch the movie more than 10-15 times already. When it was released on blu-ray I was the first one to buy it. So when Pixar announced another Monsters movie I got concerned. How could Pixar make a better movie than the original? Or even one that equalled it? But having seen the movie last week I can ensure you all: Pixar is back on top. Monsters University is great fun and it's Pixar best since Up!.Monsters University, a prequel to Monsters Inc., begins with a young and very little Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) still in primary school. After a field trip to Monsters Inc. he has only one dream: to become a scarer. Years later he arrives at Monsters University but soon learns he still has a long way to go. His main problem? Mike isn't scary at all. He befriends his roommate young Randall (Steve Buscemi), who at that time is an unimportant loser (and later gets seduced by the dark side). The first night he makes an enemy out of Sully (John Goodman), a freshman who thinks that his family name (of legendary scarers) is enough to get him through school. A personal vendetta is born.Things go wrong when Mike and Sully accidentally destroy a sacred item that belongs to the devilish Dean Hardscrabble (a brilliant Helen Mirren). They get expelled from all Scare Classes and will not graduate as a real Scarer. Luckily Mike comes up with a plan, a bet with the dean. If he finds a team to compete in the Scare Games and if he indeed wins, he's allowed to follow the Scare Classes until the end. Dean Hardscrabble approves. Now it's up to Mike, Sully and his team of losers to work as a team and go the distanceIn Monsters University the Scare Games are very well done. I can see both kids and adults laughing their socks off when Mike and Sully, in the same team but still enemies, are doing their first race and try not to step on the items that make their body grow. Bizarre, but hilarious! Their next assignment, when they have to steal something in the library, is also a winner. But what really works in Monsters University is that the story is mainly about friendship. We not only see how Mike and Sully turn from big enemies into big friends; they become soul mates for life. To join the Scare Games Mike must find five extra members to form a team and the only ones left are a bunch of nerds that no one pays attention to and a big blue monster that he absolutely hates (Sully). Still Mike succeeds in making it work. Even when you know that Mike and Sully will win the Scare Games (that isn't a spoiler, is it?), this film isn't predictable at all. It doesn't end with Sully holding up the Scare cup but it takes one more great scene to bring Mike and Sully definitely together. I will not spoil it for you, but it involves a door to the human world and a little green monster that's depressed. Monsters University is a great film. It's both funny and sentimental in all the right places. Fans of the first movie will see a lot of cameos in this one (Yeti!). The story ends when Monsters Inc. begins. I will even advise the next generation to see Monsters University first and then go on to Monsters Inc.Yeah, my faith in Pixar is restored. Although I must confess that with Planes coming up, things can change very fast in the wrong direction. But maybe that's because I have never liked the Cars movie.9/10",8,86,102,9 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great film, but... (read only when you've seen the movie!)
","The greatest thing The Force Awakens did for me was that it made me feel like that little kid again. I was transported back to 1977 when I sat with my older sister in a movie theater in Amsterdam and was watching the first Star Wars film. What an amazing experience!Overall I think JJ Abrams did a great job with The Force Awakens. Being able to please the old fans as well as the potential new ones must have been a difficult task. He cast great actors, used some excellent SFX and made a great mix of new elements and Star Wars nostalgia. The first part of The Force Awakens is great fun. In a brilliant way we see how the lives of Poe, Finn and Rey get intertwined and how they're forced into a war between the First Order and the Alliance.Strangely, the pace of the story gets interrupted a little bit when we meet the old cast. Han Solo is the first one. Although his scenes are magical they also divert us a little from the story. Luckily things fall into place very quickly when they join forces and go meet Maz Kanata, a great CGI character played by Lupita Nyong'o. Solo plays a major role in this Star Wars outing. He gets a lot of screen time and when the movie is finished you know why. Carrie Fisher looks great as General Leia.The bad things then. Daisy Ridley is not always convincing in her role as Rey. But she's charming as hell and at the moments she really must perform she really delivers. Well done! The new bad guy, the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is a different story. He looks like a low budget Voldemort and therefor isn't quite as menacing as Darth Sidious. Why does he look so fake? Kylo Ren: he is introduced as this ruthless killer who is very skilled in The Force. He can even freeze a blaster fire in the air! Wow, he makes Darth Vader look like a pussy. But later on in the story he must fight Finn who - as a non-Jedi - has a lightsaber in his hand for the very first time. Why doesn't Ren demolish this boy? He doesn't even have The Force!I was impressed by how Han Solo died. His fall into the fog is both epic and impressive. Although you know it will happen it still comes as a shock. But at that point you know that Kylo Ren can't be turned to the Light side: it's too soon for that. Thanks to Han's death we know that Kylo Rey will go berserk in Episode VIII. Although the scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey are great to watch, it is strange that the girl knows how to use her Force powers so soon. 24 Hours earlier she didn't even know what The Force was. 'Yes, the stories are true. All of them!' That development was not convincing at all.With the prequels we knew how the story would end: Anakin would become Darth Vader and Luke and Leia would be separated. But now with the new trilogy it's a whole different matter. In the next chapter we'll probably witness Rey being trained by Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren by the Supreme Leader Snoke. But what else? In this new story anything goes. Luke can be killed. Rey can be seduced by the Dark Side. BB-8 can marry R2D2 if he/she wants. And that makes this new trilogy so exciting. In the end Star Wars The Force Awakens is the story of an extraordinary family and the one of a great spaceship. Because the way the Millennium Falcon is shown in this movie is pure magic! Looking forward to seeing the next chapter!8,5 out of 10",8,10,43,16 December 2015
Unbroken," Good material, bad movie
","A true story is no guarantee for a good movie. That's the lesson we can learn from Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. The movie is based on the biography of Louis Zamperini, an American Olympic track champion who joins WW2 and experiences near death on the ocean and almost gets killed in a Japanese concentration camp. When the war is over, he returns home.That's the story, frankly. The end credits roll on the screen after he is reunited with his parents and brother on an American airport. No more scenes about being home in the States. Fade out: this is the end.However, thanks to these end credits we also learn that he later went back to Japan to face and forgive his Japanese camp guards and as an old man sees a dream come true when he carries the torch for the Olympic Games in Japan. Especially the forgiving part is exciting. Why didn't Angelina Jolie show us that? Why didn't she use the Saving Private Ryan structure and tell the story as a flashback, showing Zamperini visiting his Japanese opponents in the present while thinking back of his time during WW2? It would have made the movie much better.Unbroken is a well made drama. The war scenes with the airplanes in the beginning of the movie are very well done. The flashbacks to his youth as a problem child are also impressive. But once the bad times begin, the movie falls flat. Yes, it's impressive what the real Louis Zamperini had to experience to survive World War 2. But shown from the eyes of director Angelina Jolie it soon becomes pretty boring.Unbroken is a great monument but a flawed film. With this material Jolie could have done much better.",6,1,3,10 May 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kick-Ass meets Men in Black and 60s Avengers
","With movies like X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass, Stardust and Layer Cake writer/director/producer Matthew Vaughn established himself as one of the most exciting movie makers around. Having turned down the offer to direct X-Men Days of Future Past we were very interested in what he was working on instead. Luckily Kingsman: The Secret Service - again based on a comic - doesn't disappoint. Afterwards we can be glad that he put all his efforts in this incredibly funny but also comic-book violent spy flick. With Bryan Singer again involved as director, the X-Men movie also turned out very fine anyway.The film is about Kingsman, an unknown but powerful British Secret Service. When one of his spies dies, all six remaining agents are asked to come up with a candidate that can replace him. After a dangerous selection only one will remain. Kingsman Harry Hart (Colin Firth) nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton who's also being eyed for the role of Cyclops in X-Men Apocalypse). Eggsy is a small criminal who doesn't know he is the son of a killed Kingsman agent. In the meantime the organization investigates the dubious plans of billionaire and philanthropist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who says he wants to save our planet but doesn't tell the world at what costs he will do that.Three movies pop in mind when you see Kingsman. First of all: Kick- Ass. It has the same humor, violence and over the top characters. Valentine's bodyguard for instance is a girl with no legs but with killing blades. Her action scenes are quite spectacular. Samuel L. Jackson is a crazy disturbed villain. His madness suits the finale of the movie very well. Secondly: Men in Black. Young Eggsy must participate in a very nasty selection process in order to be the chosen Kingsman. The missions they must do are very dangerous. In the first one a candidate even dies (or it seems that way). The third ( and major) title Kingsman resembles is The Avengers. No, I'm not talking about the Marvel one. In the late sixties there was this British TV-series starring the ultimate gentleman John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and the first powergirl ever, Emma Peel (played by the legendary Diana Rigg from On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Game of Thrones fame). These two spies used a lot of (hidden) gadgets to solve crime. But whatever happened, like Colin Firth in Kingsman, John Steed always remained polite and stiff. The Avengers TV-series even got a very bad movie version in 1998 starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery. Kingsman starts of as an entertaining action movie with lots of violence and humor. Entertaining, but not exceptional. Turns out director Vaughn saved the best for last. In the incredible finale the movie really delivers. Absolute highlight is the way the baddies get defeated by the two remaining Kingsman. That scene is so over the top, I think only Matthew Vaughn could have pulled that of.Yes, Kingsman is great stuff and I can't wait to see it again. Especially actor Colin Firth deserves lots of praise. He not only gives us a very likable and funny performance, but his action scenes are also very convincing and must have cost him months of training. The shots in which he does the fighting are also very long with very few cut aways. We hope he didn't have to do that many takes. Newcomer Taron Egerton as Eggsy is also impressive. He's not only believable as a low life street thug, but as a James Bond-like spy as well. No doubt Kingsman will launch his career.In one of the first scenes of the movie we see actor Mark Hamill in the role of professor James Arnold. And that's a nice surprise given the fact that it's 2015 now, the year of Star Wars The Force Awakens and his great movie comeback. It at least gives us a hint of how he will look as the elderly Jedi Luke Skywalker. Kingsman: go see it!",8,32,62,11 January 2015
Shark Tale," Don't believe the cynics, this one's great!
","It's risky to rave about a movie you just saw, making all the expectations that other people may have a lot higher. But in the case of Shark Tale I don't mind. All the journalists who saw the movie with me were very excited about the new computer animated DreamWorks flick. This movie deserves to be a massive hit!Oscar (Will Smith) is a fast rapping streetwise kid who works in a whale-wash (a car wash where they clean whales) and dreams of one day becoming a somebody. When he takes credit of killing a shark (who actually got hit by an anchor) he becomes the Sharkslayer who has to protect the town. Unfortunately, the shark he claimed to have killed, happened to be the son of mobster Don Lino (Robert DeNiro). Soon Oscar finds every shark coming after him.Lenny (Jack Black), the other son of Don Lino, has other problems. He happens to be a vegetarian who doesn't approve of the Mafia way of life and therefore always disappoints his father. Oscar and Lenny become friends and come up with a plan so Lenny can disappear and that can make Oscar the feared Sharkslayer the city needs. Lucky for them the plan works. But they were not prepared for all the consequences...Everybody will compare Shark Tale to Finding Nemo and that would be a real pity: they're entirely different movies. For instance, Finding Nemo took place in the 'country' while the scenery of Shark Tale is a stunning underwater version of New York, complete with a Times Square, yellow cabs and skyscrapers. Most of the characters in Finding Nemo were sweet and adorable, in Shark Tale they all have a dark side (with the exception of Jack Black and Renee Zellweger - she's the girl who is truly in love with Oscar). Not that it's a dark film, but everybody seems to be corrupted in a funny way.The humour of Shark Tale aims more at adults than in Finding Nemo. Of course a lot of jokes are (mob) movie-based. We see glimpses of Jaws, Goodfellas, Titanic, Scarface, Superman 2 and Analyze This. Usually the jokes work out fine but sometimes they're very cheap (how many times have we heard the phrase Say hello to my little friend?). But although children will not understand all these cinematic references, the movie will certainly appeal to them as well. The story is told so fast that you can't even afford to blink your eyes!In Cannes Shark Tale was heavily promoted on the fact that a lot of big Hollywood stars had a speaking part. This time that was really justified. Will Smith doesn't only do the voice of Oscar, the character also looks and moves like him! The same goes for Martin Scorcese (as Oscar's manager), Angelina Jolie (as the femme fatale) and Missy Elliot and Christina Aguilera (who have a small part singing a song).But in the end Shark Tale is really the big 'Will Smith versus Robert DeNiro' show. Smith does what he does best: rapping, cracking jokes, clowning around and be the Fresh Prince. DeNiro gives Don Lino the Italian authority and the humour we saw in Analyze This. I also liked Angelina Jolie. She did a great job as the sexy femme fatale who wants revenge after she got dumped by Will Smith.A fast and entertaining story, great performances, stunning visual ideas (New York looks great! There are even floating billboards like in Blade Runner) and a fantastic soundtrack with songs from the seventies: Shark Tale is a highly entertaining feature that will appeal to both parents and kids. The only thing that bothered me was the moralising ending (but then you can't have it all).My prediction? A 55 million dollar opening week and Shark Tale 2 in 2006!",Null,10,25,17 September 2004
