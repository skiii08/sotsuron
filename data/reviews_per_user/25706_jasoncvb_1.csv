",I am a designer and a Great comic book fan.Since my childhood I was drawing and reading comics. When The movie opened in my country Brazi was so excited to watch it.It was like seeing kids on the garden playing all around and having fun because I remembered the time when I was drawing the Hulk; Captain America; Iron Man and many others.I had fun; had everything good that you can get watching on the big screen Its a great movie and an Epic to remember!U.S.A. people: you gonna love itAssemble,10,2,6,30 April 2012
