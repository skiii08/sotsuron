United 93," A Story Of Heroism, not Patriotism
","That this was by the British Working Title films is a mark of authenticity and one that is deserved.Unoted 93 is the embarrassingly frank and honest witness. It lays bare questions like why were there only 4 planes available to Major Fox? Why Sliney at the FAA couldn't get help from the Pentagon? And just why would not Chaney give the rules of engagement? At best it show the US Administration pf not having the competence to run a bath and at worst of collusive conspiracy. Furthermore, the film shows no aftermath with no comment on wreckage evidence.Whether 9/11 was a put-up job or the result of a co-ordinated terrorist attack is not the centre of the film. It is the heroism of both those in the air - the banding together of the passengers to attempt a feat never done before that could never have been predicted by whoever plans such tragedies. Likewise, decisive action by the FAA's Sliney (on his first day on the job) and the military's Major Fox and the professionalism of their Air Traffic Controllers is a true testimony of how Government OUGHT TO WORK.Its 7 hours since I left the Press Preview and I'm still fighting back the tears - a remarkable feat to do to a newspaper editor. It's like open heart surgery - a painful and unpleasant experience, but one we all need to put the trivia in our lives in perspective and value that that is true and precious.
