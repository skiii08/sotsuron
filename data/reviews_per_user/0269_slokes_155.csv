The King's Speech," Bertie In A Can
","It's good to be king. Unless you have a serious speech impediment and need to make worldwide broadcasts in wartime. Then it helps to have a friend who helps you get the words out.'The King's Speech' presents the true story of Bertie (Colin Firth), second son of King George V who found himself in line to the throne just as Hitler was becoming a global menace and radio omnipresent. To help him through a terrible stammer that grows worse on public occasions, his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) calls upon speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) whose unorthodox methods include complete equality between practitioner and patient.'If we were equals...I wouldn't be here,' Bertie says in response to the idea. He'd rather find less conspicuous ways of national service, but fate has other plans in store.'The King's Speech' is one of those very English movies like 'Chariots Of Fire' that seems edifying if stodgy on a first viewing but opens up on repeat views to reveal engaging drama and wit lying just beneath. The star cast, along with director Tom Hooper, invest a fine David Seidler script with understated brio at every turn.Firth's Oscar and Golden Globe-winning performance is a masterpiece of economy. Yes, he has a stammer, but the drama in his performance is in his rising above it, and, despite his sometimes off-putting manner around the commoner Logue, making you the viewer root for his success.The film plays with the facts in sometimes garish ways, inventing a bit more tension in the Bertie-Logue relationship than existed in reality. Hooper calls it a 'bromance' in the director's commentary, and it feels a bit trite in places. Yet it also makes for a much more forceful drama than reality might have allowed. We are given to understand the stakes involved, both in terms of global politics as well as the psychodrama of Bertie the underloved monarch-to-be climbing his way out of his shell by means of brute force, fits of temper, and even some swearing.'You don't need to be afraid of the things you were afraid of when you were five,' Logue tells Bertie, who wants to believe him but somehow can't.The likability of the film is established early and maintained throughout, especially by Bonham Carter, at ease in her regal skin yet able to develop empathy in various amusing ways. Her eye flashes alone are worth watching. Rush has a tendency toward bigness in his performances which he deftly evades here, giving Firth center stage always. He's easier to appreciate in a second viewing, when you can see him communicating strength through subtle eye contact while his pupil struggles to find, then maintain, his voice.The movie culminates in a speech Bertie gave September 3, 1939, one that meant a great deal as it basically kicked off World War II. One of the features in the DVD is a recording of the actual speech; for all the liberties 'The King's Speech' takes, it's remarkable how well it recreates that moment, to the point where you find yourself replaying Rush's expressions in your head while the real Bertie works his way through every syllable, a speech with ironically or otherwise concludes with the word 'prevail.'As a personal-empowerment story with earth-shaking consequences, 'The King's Speech' uplifts as it entertains, providing one with the rare ability to cheer on royalty in the role of underdog and share in Logue's fatherly pride as to how it works out. A real winner.",8,0,0,28 November 2015
Saturday Night Fever," The Gospel According To Barry, Robin, Maurice & John
","'I got the wings of heaven on my shoes/I'm a dancin' man, and I just can't lose...' More people know 'Saturday Night Fever' for its soundtrack than the movie. Having been one of them, I can speak to how that can skew things negatively seeing the film for the first time. The music of 'Saturday Night Fever' is shimmering, accessible disco music of high sophistication, an aural cocoon of positive vibes. The movie, by contrast, is harsh, nasty, vulgar, and dark.Tony Manero, a kid of good instincts but mediocre intelligence, lives a life of quiet desperation, hanging around his low-life buddies and trolling after sex and various illicit thrills. He blows his small weekly wages for a brief spark of the divine, music that makes him a god, or at least an idol, to the others who come to his temple. 'Can I wipe your forehead?' a woman asks, and as she does so it reminds one a little of Mary Magdalene washing Christ's feet.Calling 'Saturday Night Fever' a religious film feels like a stretch. If anything, the attitude of the film is fairly atheistic, especially in the way it mocks the piety of Tony's mother and showcases the fall of his brother the priest. Yet 'Saturday Night Fever' is completely concerned with the question of transcendence, man's desire to achieve it and his inability to do so, using the grimy streets of Brooklyn as the reality and the music of the Bee Gees and other artists as the fantasy. The result is a cultural touchstone.The music may be the best part of the film, but it works in unison with the narrative, right from the opening when a God's-eye view of Brooklyn descending from the clouds to the train tracks suddenly picks up 'Staying Alive' in midbeat. When we first see Tony, in a brilliant sequence that merely involves him toting a paint can, the song's lyrics are already telling us his sad story, that this tough, chiseled character is struggling to stay alive, 'going nowhere' in a big city with no one to help him. Bee Gees Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb almost merit co-screen writing credit, as they set a mood director John Badham and writer Norman Wexler weave throughout the film.People who complain SNF is foul have a point; in isolation the soundtrack does nothing to prepare you for the language, casual sex, and racism presented matter-of-factly on screen. To me, it points again to the question of religion, and what people have if they don't have God. The answer, it seems, is music, and nothing else. It's either one of the most nihilistic or pro-religious messages ever put on screen. The fact I have no idea which it is makes it more interesting to me.Another reason the film is so very good is John Travolta's breakout performance in the lead role. People talk about his dancing, and he's amazing especially when the floor opens up and lets him do a solo turn to 'You Should Be Dancing.' But his best dancing comes when he's acting. One moment his character is nobly refusing a prize he knows he didn't deserve. The next, he's assaulting a woman because he knows she doesn't want to have sex with him. The dark undercurrents with which Travolta imbues his character make such transitions not only believable but essential to the story.I'm not completely sold on 'Saturday Night Fever.' The family scenes are annoyingly one-dimensional, for example. Like another bleak, pathbreaking film featuring a gang of toughs, 'The Wild Bunch,' it's a film I respect more than enjoy.But there's a lot of color and depth here. Those who say otherwise aren't watching it with both eyes open. I also love the performance of Karen Lynn Gorney, who provides pathos and humor as Travolta's dance partner Stephanie whose aspirations of glory exceed even his, even if she can't pronounce words like 'interesting.' The scene of the two of them in the coffee shop is hilarious.A lot of the film isn't, though. It's quite bleak. But that's the strange source of its power, that and the music. Like its protagonist, 'Saturday Night Fever' is a film that doesn't stand still.",8,1,3,10 September 2005
Moneyball," Field Of Schemes
","How did they ever make a movie of 'Moneyball?' The famous Michael Lewis book is not a human-interest story so much as a sabermetric-centered theoretical treatise on how a small-market baseball club found a way to win by blowing up the game.The answer: Throw us a big star, a couple of name screenwriters, and not much in the way of a working plot.As the 2002 Major League season begins, the Oakland Athletics find themselves 'gutted' of their best players. They can't afford any big free agents, so general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) takes a fresh approach that challenges conventional wisdom.'If we play like the Yankees in here, we will lose to the Yankees out there,' Beane tells his skeptical brain trust of codgers and malcontents.Having read 'Moneyball,' and enjoyed it, I see how scripters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, and director Bennett Miller, tried to make a movie of it: By ramping up conflict wherever they could find or invent it, and pushing sentiment in a occasionally effective but often manipulative way that put me in mind of 'Field Of Dreams' or 'Terms Of Endearment.' Bad guys are clearly defined as people who don't see things Beane's way, while much of the emotional ballast is carried in Gunga Din fashion by little Kerris Dorsey, who plays Beane's daughter Casey, and if there is justice in life if not baseball, will find better films in a long and happy future.I really like Pitt in this movie, too. He wears his signature cool with quiet authority, earning your interest in his deft handling of whip-smart lines and supporting players. He and Jonah Hill as a Yale graduate Beane takes on as his deputy do a lot to make otherwise clunky exposition scenes work.The film also scores with the few scenes it shows of the various players, 'misfit toys' as Hill's character dubs them, who find themselves hired by the A's because of their undervalued ability to get on base and avoid making outs. Stephen Bishop plays aging hotshot David Justice with appropriate swagger, while Chris Pratt brings likability and humor to the character of struggling first baseman Scott Hatteberg.There's a lot of fine talent in front of and behind the camera. They just aren't always put to good use. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays A's manager Art Howe with such a put-upon mien that I was surprised to learn the actor lobbied for the part. The point of Howe is that he sees Beane as the enemy, and acts accordingly, but given Hoffman's talent, it's a shame to see him so ill-used in his handful of scenes. I get that Howe didn't see things Beane's way, but could the script given Howe more to do, or say, rather than just look discomfited?The most ridiculous scene in this regard shows Beane firing his head scout Grady (Ken Medlock) after a nasty confrontation. Medlock plays the role so nasty it's no wonder the guy's always decked out in black when we see him.The film also lacks for a satisfying close. The A's did well in 2002, but didn't make it to the World Series, so much of the story centers on a winning streak. Here, the makers push all the buttons but, as Beane makes clear, the end result is meaningless in terms of what he wants to do. So we get a second, strained ending involving Beane's talent being recognized by a rival club. Here as elsewhere we get a lot of close-ups of Pitt, but little idea what makes him tick beyond flashbacks to his unhappy playing days which are the film's weakest moments.I guess if you follow baseball at all, you already know how this ends. I did, but I don't think that affected my reason for not caring. 'Moneyball' has its moments, but it doesn't really justify its existence by offering satisfying drama or interesting characters. It just puts quality actors through the motions, and left me a bit empty.",5,3,5,12 April 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Better Half
","It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' is better. Let's end the argument right now: David Carradine doesn't even appear in 'Volume 1.' Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of 'Kill Bill,' released only a few months before 'Vol. 2' in the tail end of 2003, we met Uma Thurman, one peeded-off super-assassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time, with the occasional mega-posse thrown in for interest. 'Vol. 1' had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.'Vol. 2' is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie; the tone is such a departure from 'Vol. 1' in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop-fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys, but in 'Vol. 2' he doesn't go as overboard as he does in 'Vol. 1.' He pulls back and lets the plot breathe, rather than filling every spare second with a homage-cum-parody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more, but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence, which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its 'Vol. 1'-style comic-book treatment. Throughout 'Vol. 2' the emphasis is on storytelling and character-building, which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. 'Vol. 1' is okay for what it is, but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of 'Vol. 2.'This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films, which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here, but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly, the opening part of 'Vol. 2' tests the viewer's patience a bit, there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered self-discipline, like with Thurman's graveyard struggle, but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her face-to-face showdown with Carradine's Bill.From that moment forward to the end, this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen, certainly the best Tarantino has directed, playing off the mythology we've been taught in 'Vol. 1' and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual butt-kicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of 'Vol. 1' where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic, not sadistic, and its a powerful revelation, that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing, his pauses, the tired glint in his eye, or the way he says 'Kiddo.' You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part, Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill, and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish, but real human pain.'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is slow-moving, and needs 'Vol. 1' in a way few sequels do, since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits, including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure, Esteban Vihaio, and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen, who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney-Jardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note, there's four or five that hit the right mark, and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman's character and an anonymous hitwoman, at once grippingly suspenseful, hilarious, and life-affirming. Still, it's the final moments of this film that will stay with you, as Bill and his former pupil work out their 'unfinished business' and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.'Kill Bill Vol. 2' may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires, the level of 'The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly' quoted in its score, but it's a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment.

The Legend of Bagger Vance," Pretty But Not As Magical As It Thinks
","Robert Redford is a good actor, but as a director I get the feeling he has never had a real human conversation in his life. Take 'The Legend Of Bagger Vance'.It's about a Georgian named Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) who marches off to World War I one of America's greatest golfers but comes back without his swing. Coaching him back is his ex-lover Adele (Charlize Theron), a boy named Hardy (J. Michael Moncrief) who won't stop believing in him, and the title figure, a mysterious caddy (Will Smith) who tells Junuh that golf, like life, is 'a game that can't be won, only played.'As with other Redford films, there is no real dialogue in 'Bagger Vance'. There are a lot of speeches, as various characters wait for their turn in close-up and for the music to swell before unloading some great profundity. 'Your Dad stared adversity in the eye, and he beat it back with a broom' 'This is my last 18 holes, Junuh, and I can't think of a better way to end it.' 'I like the way we danced.' 'It was only a moment ago'. Those last two lines are each repeated, in case you missed them.I get the feeling Redford treats his actors the way his directors treated him, telling Damon and Theron 'Do that again, only blonder this time'. Beauty is everywhere in 'Bagger Vance', and the camera and lighting work here are exceptional, but there's never a feeling of real life creeping into the corners of the frame.What's good in this film is Moncrief, the one real Southern accent in the cast who has fun and a disarmingly non-precocious way about him. Joel Gretsch showcases a convincingly authentic swing as golf legend Bobby Jones, one of Junuh's celebrated opponents in a big match at the end. Smith is enjoyable, too, making an otherwise annoyingly tricked-up character amusing at times with his sly, subtle delivery, about the only subtle thing in 'Bagger Vance'. It's a shame Redford couldn't have made Bagger's true otherworldly nature more of a mystery, but then Redford isn't one to let a point go by without beating you over the head with it.Jack Lemmon narrates and appears in a cameo role as the adult Hardy. While obviously showing signs this would be his last film role, he makes his bad club swings as fun here as he did on TV at Pebble Beach. Redford's focus on actors does pay off with this old pro, and in some other cases. Everyone acquits themselves decently, anyway, with nice moments evenly distributed here and there among the chaff. The golf action, when it happens, is shot prettily, as is the Depression-era costumes and set design.But everything moves so slow, especially when the game is underway. 'You've got an answer for everything, Bagger,' Junuh says, and so he does. Or else Adele's got an answer. Or Junuh's got an answer for Hardy. These aren't people but fortune cookies with pre-formed messages when you crack them open.Meanwhile, you wonder why no one zaps Junuh with a penalty stroke for all his on-course ruminations. Never mind. It's not really golf they're playing. It sure looks pretty, though, and that's the point.",4,5,10,3 January 2008
Vertigo," Falling In Love...Or Just Falling?
","Alfred Hitchcock made a career movie with 'Vertigo,' one of several career movies of his, but maybe the most enduring. On the surface, it's a love story with a mystery, bright and shiny, maybe his most sumptuous feast of the senses. But it has a cold heart.James Stewart is the key to the film. I think a lot of people misjudge the film by misjudging his character, police detective John 'Scotty' Ferguson. They see him and see the guy who played amiable dipso Elwood P. Dowd in 'Harvey' or noble Mr. Smith or George Bailey. The secret of Scotty is he's no nice guy, though. He's more than a bit of a heel, a hard and greedy man eminently deserving of the roasting he gets in Henry Jones' postmortem. Watch Stewart in Hitchcock's 'Rope' or the unjustly overlooked 'Carbine Williams,' and you see the hardness Hitchcock was after, and got, from his lead here.Scotty does a lot of mean things in 'Vertigo,' actions that feed his illness and lead to his doom. The character of Midge, subtly portrayed by Barbara Bel Geddes, is a key for understanding this. His casual stoking early on of Midge's flames of unreturned desire, especially when viewed in retrospect, burns through their happy banter and demonstrates how miserable a man he is, nowhere more brilliantly or ruthlessly than when he cuts her off from his life over a silly gag. Watch 'Vertigo' more than once, and you may find yourself hating the guy as much as I do. But you still follow his path of doom with total sympathy; because of the elegant, enveloping way Hitchcock draws you into this world of passion, cut off from all bounds of propriety, even space and time.If Scotty was played by anyone other than Stewart, it's hard to imagine 'Vertigo' packing the punch it does. You wouldn't have enough tolerance for the character to stick with his story. In its own day, 'Vertigo' was a bit of a misfire, probably because audiences felt alienation from the Stewart image they were accustomed to. Yet now viewed from a decent remove, you get more of what Hitchcock was after, and respond to it better.Still, it's easy to understand people not liking 'Vertigo' the first time they see it. At least that's true with me. I didn't like 'Vertigo' the first time I saw it. Here's what helps you find the right handle. Fall in love with the wrong person. Become bitterly disappointed. See the one that you loved in the face of passersby, in odd places, and in your dreams. Then you begin to get it. Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes, as Billy Joel once sang, and trying to hold on too long is a recipe for self-inflicted pain.Talking too much about 'Vertigo' is not a good idea. There's too many obvious spoilers in recounting the plot of the film, in explaining why Kim Novak is so flat-out stupendous in her performance, and how you are left feeling by film's end. 'Vertigo' is a uniquely personal film, not only for Hitchcock, but for a broad array of viewers who like me have latched onto its tragic story.That's not to say it's perfect. There's a murder mystery wrapped up in 'Vertigo,' and all the pieces don't exactly fit when you think about them later. Hitchcock called it 'icebox talk,' something to leave the viewer pondering after the film was over, but maybe he left a few more loose ends than he should have this time around.Still, what 'Vertigo' is after is not making sense but magic, and it succeeds wonderfully, nowhere more so then when it bends the laws of reality. Take the moment when the bookstore owner tells the sad tale of Carlotta Valdez while the lights of the room around him dim in eerie, unnatural sympathy. Or the way the flowers in the shop Madeleine visits seem to glow in unearthly splendor as Ferguson, his eyes glowing strangely too, spies on his prey.You may not like this film the first time you see it, but if you are left disturbed and uneasy from the experience, you owe it to yourself to see it again. 'Vertigo' is a film that keeps on giving, with all the power and mystery of unrequited love, but unlike most forms of infatuation, this film has a way of returning the ardor with which it is held. Utterly timeless.",9,26,35,18 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Spectacle Over Sense
","Watching 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' in the theater was an oppressive experience, with its bombastic score, overripe performances, and hyper-long running time. Watching it at home on my new Blu-Ray and high-def TV presented a more entertaining experience.There the film's signature strengths blossom forth, especially John Myrhe's stellar production design as it re-imagines the streets of London in the 18th century or the forecastle of the 'Queen Anne's Revenge' lined with bony balusters taken from Blackbeard's victims. The sound is plenty good, too.I still think the film plods along hopelessly, in service of a barely-there plot that takes too long to pay off. Still, it makes for a nice demonstration disc. That's about does it for raves from me, but it was more than I expected going in.The previous entry in the 'Pirates' series, 'At World's End,' wrapped up what became a trilogy of 'Pirates' movies and, in so doing, carried a lot of baggage to be worked out over three long, convoluted hours. It was the only 'Pirates' film I saw before this one, and I can say the fourth film makes for a slightly better experience. It starts fresh.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) opens the film as a captain without a ship or crew. He does have something to help him get his sea-legs back, an idea of where to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. He soon finds himself a prisoner of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his convent-raised daughter Angelica (Penélope Cruz), in a race with the peg-legged privateer Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and three Spanish vessels. All seek the prize, albeit for very different motives.'On Stranger Tides' lacks for something I'll call 'motive force,' a reason for people acting the way they do. The Fountain is a bit of a MacGuffin, though it serves a purpose in an engaging climax that takes too long to arrive. For the most part, what you get is a lot of Depp's fruity overacting as the verbose Sparrow, along with some mild comedy and action scenes that strain for spectacle while leaving you at a loss as to what is being accomplished or how.Director Rob Marshall comes to this movie having helmed successful musicals, and his choreography background is too much in evidence. So is a subplot involving a missionary and a mermaid that is shoehorned for obvious chick appeal and slows down the already-overladen plot at many turns. (I admit I can stare at mermaid Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey as long as they let me, but I don't think they gave her much to do.)Depp can be entertaining; he's thoroughly committed to getting more out of the material than a paycheck. 'I'm just as bent as ever! Hellishly so!' he tells his faithful sidekick Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally). I just wish Marshall had told his star to take it down a couple of notches, instead of following Depp along for the ride.Well, 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' was a ride, before it was anything else. I guess he felt Depp knew what he was doing, and I suppose a billion in theatrical revenue bears that up. I just don't think this film merits lasting interest. It pushes everything to eleven without explaining much of what is going on, expecting the audience to be swept along. I suspect more than a few were shaking their heads about it a bit later.Zombies? Fire-breathing ships controlled by a sword? The movie seems written to accommodate its special effects, which aren't so much special as loud. Still, the film does generate something positive from its last hour. McShane is a welcome addition to the cast, glowering effectively as the one true villain of the piece, and gives the ending needed panache.Will I want to see another 'Pirates'? Well, this was better seeing cold than #3 was. There are definite signs of the series losing steam. While diverting in short bursts, Sparrow and company have become leaden, unengaging caricatures. With the money this made, there's no reason for the producers to rein in the excesses any further than they already did. But one can hope. 'On Stranger Tides', for all its weaknesses, offers intermittent fun and a sense of possibilities to be explored.",4,0,0,1 April 2012
Scarface," Tony The Blow-Man
","'Scarface' is a useful movie to have around. If you walk into someone's house for the first time, and he quotes 'Scarface' twice in the first 15 minutes, you know it's time to leave.After escaping his native Cuba during 1980's Mariel boatlift, former jailbird Tony Montana (Al Pacino) gets a second life in the land of opportunity, which he takes full advantage of as one of Miami's leading cocaine cowboys. Tony wants it all, including his boss's wife, his sister's devotion, and a mountain of blow to call his own, but once he gets it, he starts on a downhill trajectory with fatal consequences.The fact so many people like 'Scarface' is testament to the intensity of Pacino's performance more than the intelligence behind it. In the DVD documentary, Pacino readily admits to the character being two-dimensional. For some, that's great. He's not too complicated that way. But for me, Tony Montana is worth maybe 20 minutes in a movie about someone else. He blows too hot.Pacino isn't great here. He has some good scenes like at the beginning when he's being questioned by some cops, but mostly he just yells a lot. The supporting performances are uniformly weak, including F. Murray Abraham, who gave one of the great screen performances in the following year's 'Amadeus.' Michelle Pfeiffer does the best work for 10 minutes, but then the script seems to lose interest in her character and she ends up throwing out some random histrionics before exiting stage left.The storyline is simplistic and uninvolving. The score is one of the lamest, especially during the opening sequence showing news footage from the Mariel boatlift. The motivations of everyone from Tony's early benefactor Frank Lopez to Hector the Colombian are at best opaque and at worst cry plot convenience. There's a silly bit of business involving Tony's sister and mother which is dragged out too long. And with Pacino's central character so unlikable, this is all too much to deal with.Is it director Brian De Palma? De Palma makes interesting movies, just not always good ones. He made some very good movies around the early '80s, and 'Scarface' would seem like a prime candidate to be another. But it's like when he has a great actor to work with, like Pacino or Sean Penn in 'Casualties Of War,' he loses the ability to rein them in and just lets them bolt through the fences. At the same time, De Palma often gets great performances from less-heralded actors, like John Travolta in 'Blow Out,' Craig Wasson in 'Body Double,' and Michael J. Fox in 'Casualties Of War.' He's not untalented, just maddening inconsistent.The film does have passion, and some momentum and excitement that carries into the final crescendo. There's a terrific sequence involving Montana and an assassination target that generates some real concern with the audience because you are actually meant to care a little about the people involved, and Tony for once is not acting according to type.But mostly 'Scarface' is an '80s TV movie with marathon swearing and bloodletting, and a performance from Pacino that hopefully got it out of his system for a while. It's cathartic, maybe, but so's running someone off the road after they cut you off. Not exactly reasonable therapy.",4,52,107,16 January 2005
Frost_Nixon," Solid Drama, Simplistic History
","History-based movies often make a deeper impression when playing fast and loose with the facts. Think 'Casablanca', 'Patton', or 'Richard III.' 'Frost/Nixon' isn't quite up there, but it's an entertaining ride with deep resonances - even if it doesn't stick to the facts.In the mid-1970s, disgraced ex-President of the United States Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) is searching for a way out from the shadows of his near-impeachment. Enter David Frost (Michael Sheen), jet-setting British interviewer who sees in Nixon his own way back into the big time, provided he can acquire elusive commercial backing. But is Frost up to the deeper challenge of pinning down one of history's most morally compromised men?'I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees,' says Frost's skeptical producer John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen).'Weren't they terrific!' replies Frost with characteristic misplaced ebullience.While much of the drama of the movie rests on Frost's efforts to take the initiative away from Nixon with tough, unexpected questions, the film itself is entirely Langella's. He's a sad creature of darkness, seen glimpsing Frost for the first time in half-shadow like Dracula, not the one Langella was playing on Broadway when Frost/Nixon was actually going down, but Bela's Dracula. Yet he craves the light, and the possibility is held out that he may even see this interview, 'no holds barred', as a way of making restitution for his failure.That's one interpretation of where the film takes the actual story, with made-up events including Nixon's unfamiliarity with Frost (in life, the two had sat on-camera before, in 1969), Frost's frustration over landing a punch, and, most luridly but effectively, Nixon making a late-night phone call to Frost that never occurred. You can't help wishing it did, though.Credit Peter Morgan's screenplay, based on his stage work, with getting one to not only accept but welcome this imaginative interpretation - to a point. It's not exactly like the Frost interviews changed anything regarding Nixon or his legacy. It didn't even get Frost back his American television series, contrary to the end notes of this movie. Seeing Nixon portrayed as a flawed human being, with warmth and humor, can be gratifying to those of us disposed to cut Dick some slack and resent the show-trial impulses of James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell), but how believable is it for him to joke about sending some Cubans to spy on Frost's research team?In the end, I found my queasiness with the storyline and its direction more than compensated for by Morgan's artful blend of suspense and humor, the lead acting (Sheen is actually more convincing as Frost, and does more to sell the dramatic tension of his scenes with Nixon, but I could never take my eyes off Langella), and a game supporting cast. Ron Howard directs with surprising restraint that suggests a more mature direction in his fine if flashy career; it's not as good overall as his 'Apollo 13' but this time Howard proves a better director.It doesn't surprise me that 'Frost/Nixon' is one movie both Reston and the faithful few at the Nixon Library both seem to bless; it's about hating the crime but not the criminal. Perhaps this is posterity's way of simultaneously catching up with Nixon's wrongdoings and Gerald Ford's controversial pardon. Complicated, affecting, even if it feels somewhat half-chewed; Watergate felt like that then, too.",7,4,7,18 April 2010
Gremlins," It Came From The Eighties
","The sort of film where a good idea suffers from a patchy script and a lot of revisions, 'Gremlins' reflects the time when it was made. The 1980s were a decade of goofy gimmick movies, and 'Gremlins' offers exactly that.While scouring Chinatown to sell one of his many inventions, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is introduced to a cute, furry critter called a 'Mogwai.' He names it 'Gizmo' and brings it home as a pet for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). Gizmo requires special handling: no bright light, no water, and no feeding after midnight. After getting wet, Gizmo produces replicant Mogwai. 'This could really be the big one,' Randall says happily. He is soon proved tragically correct.When it was released in the summer of 1984, 'Gremlins' was a marvel of cinematic wizardry on account of the animatronic puppets that make up the title characters. Much of the talk around the film centered on a sequence in the Peltzer kitchen where Billy's mother (Frances Lee McCain) has to fend off various attacks from the nasty gremlins, and in doing so contributed to the creation of a new MPAA- rating, PG-13.It's a brilliant sequence, the one moment in the film where the special effects (designed by future Oscar winner Chris Walas), the story (by Chris Columbus) and a human performance deliver on the payoff 'Gremlins' promises. McCain is so intense yet so funny you can get as much from watching her face as you do from the carnage on the countertops around her. It's one of the great moments of 1980s cinema.The rest of the time, 'Gremlins' is a tonally imbalanced, under- funny concept film that doesn't do much more than flog merchandise in the guise of a story. Conceived as a straight horror film, 'Gremlins' went through various changes after producer Steven Spielberg took hold of the project, so that when it finally was released, it became a scare comedy without the jokes.Entire plot lines were dropped, but the film is so ineptly constructed that their beginnings remain. We are introduced to Billy's interest in comics, a local pub under threat of condemnation, a poor mother trying to find a way to feed her children for Christmas, an obnoxious co-worker of Billy's played by Judge Reinhold, and other things, all of which vanish when the gremlins take over the second half. None are addressed again; Reinhold, the biggest male name in the cast, disappears entirely once the gremlins attack.Director Joe Dante does what he can to make the filler interesting. I like the Reinhold character's come-on to Billy's girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates), inviting her to his apartment with the tagline: 'I'm talking cable.' It's a very 1980s experience in that and other ways, such as when the gremlins don leg warmers and start flashdancing. But for too long a time, 'Gremlins' seems to be in a holding pattern, doing nothing much at all except presenting these red- herring story lines that never get resolved while the monsters themselves wait in the wings.It's a very goofy film. One secondary character has a consuming hatred for all foreign things, which he talks about non-stop. A science teacher runs late-night tests on a caged gremlin in a middle-school laboratory. Both father and son Peltzer are walking Murphy's Laws, where anything that can go wrong does. Once they run amok, the gremlins often wear fitted caps and coats, as if they happened upon the little people's section of L. L. Bean.'Gremlins' kicks into a higher gear with that attack, though it never again achieves anything like the sustained brilliance of the kitchen battle with Mrs. Peltzer. The film posits at one point that the gremlins are subtle creatures who creep into machinery and make the resulting carnage seem like an accident. This would have made for an intriguing idea, but Dante and Spielberg never do anything with it. They are making a gimmick movie, and striving for audience impact in the cheapest way possible.It's fun for young people, I suppose, and those who first saw it when they were children. Give me the sequel instead, where the comedy is much stronger and the story more engaging.",5,13,27,31 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a Beatle reunion, but no Wham reunion, either
","Okay, full disclosure here. I am old enough to have been alive when the first Star Wars film came out (I saw it in 1977 at age 11) and thus likely to be one of those fogies old enough to hold a grudge against a film that isn't up to snuff in my view for what the saga represents. Except I think this film was better than either the Star Wars film that came before ('Revenge Of The Jedi') or after ('Attack Of The Clones.') More than that, 'Phantom Menace' is good. Not great, but good.Considering this is where the whole 'Star Wars' story is supposed to take off, it could be worse. I like the opening act, which whips by in just five minutes. Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) start out bored emissaries and wind up energized fugitives. Their arrival and subsequent escape from the blockade vessel is not a masterpiece, but it is exciting and propels interest in the film which it manages to sustain for the first hour or so. It's cool how the Jedi dispatch their robot attackers so that we see their decapitated stumps still glowing from the lightsaber cuts, and how the battle droids clatter so convincingly into metal heaps on the floor.We never get much more than this, however. The two Jedi meet a 'local,' one Jar-Jar Binks, who offers some comedy to the proceedings. He's never quite funny, but given the otherwise severe tone of this picture, his goofiness is welcome to me. A lot of people cry about Jar-Jar being where the kids took over the franchise. Actually, the kids began running the franchise in 1977, but that was when my generation were the kids and the 40-year-olds didn't much care about this sci-fi claptrap. Frankly, the atmosphere begins getting uneasily infantile not with Jar-Jar but with his Gungan cohorts, who are as cartoony as Jar-Jar but much harder to take as they become the central focus of the plot, rather than just the goofy sideline spectator Jar-Jar is. Anyway, Jar-Jar's Buster Keaton hi-jinks during the final battle is one of the most entertaining parts of the film.John Williams throws in some solid music, chorales this time, unexpected but nice and in keeping with the best of his previous efforts. At least one `Star Wars' vet was still energized. George Lucas however seems to lose interest halfway through the film, after the podrace, probably the only part of this film anyone will be talking about in five years. There again, you have a little boy winning, and a sense of Lucas plotting-though-demographics. But Anakin is supposed to be a special little boy, and we are told the podrace is his element. More annoying is his role at the controls of a starfighter at the final resolution, saying a lot of corny lines like `Hold on, Artoo' as presumably practiced fighter pilots and expertly crafted droids lose all cohesion and cunning around him. Anakin's antics here feel like a form of heavy-duty blandishment to `Phantom Menace's' core consumer audience, more ingratiating than any the `Star Wars' series offered before. At least the older films pretended to have an adult focus.But forgive me. It's hard to get too angry at a movie that asks you to pay close attention to Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley and notice which is which. Actually, the most beautiful female in this movie is probably Pernilla August, who delivers a note-perfect characterization of Anakin's mother. What a face, and what eyes. August makes you feel the overwhelming nature of material devotion and envy the recipient. The acting in this film is otherwise never great, but not bad, either. Liam is solid in the lead role of Qui-Gon, while Jake Lloyd is an alright mini-Darth, looking alternately sharp and innocent. I like one scene where he explains the price of a slave's disobedience is that 'They BLOW you up,' slamming the table for emphasis. You can feel Imperial generals of the future fingering their collars during that scene.So it's not `Star Wars.' It's not `Empire Strikes Back.' It's not even a real film in the sense you have to know the earlier films, if not actually watched them, to be properly cognizant of what is going on here. But `Phantom' is good entertainment, albeit for a less discriminating age than the one that gave this oeuvre life.",6,3,7,12 December 2003
The Sound of Music," The Sappiest Hound In All The World!
","This movie is the kind that makes people jump up and shout at the screen. Me, too, things like: 'Shut up, already!' and 'Look behind the tombstone, you silly Nazis!'I guess when it comes to 'The Sound Of Music,' you either have it, or you've had it. Count me in the latter camp. Oh, the film starts out strong, on one of the biggest shots in movies, and it has some beautiful camera work to go along with some nice if somewhat simplistic songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But if Julie Andrews' other best-known musical, from 1964, involved a spoonful of sugar, this 1965 release feels more like a truckful of treacle, especially in the second half when the story gets ropier, the songs dodgier, and the acting too staged by half.Except for her singing where she shines, Andrews gives a distressingly one-note performance as a postulant nun, Maria, sent on sabbatical to look after the seven rambunctious children of a stern naval captain in Salzburg, Austria. In time, a remarkably condensed time, she has converted the children into a happy singing group and Captain von Trapp into a sappy velveteen Romeo. But will they find freedom as one big happy family, or else be crushed by the Nazi jackboot?I guess that's supposed to be the drama in this piece, but it's pushed together so haphazardly and drawn out so over the course of three hours that it never feels the least real, with or without the fruity singing. Maria sings about bluebirds and sleigh bells and whiskers on kittens, the kids perform ornate puppet shows and sing their way to bed before a party of admiring guests, and even Capt. von Trapp joins in, singing 'Edelweiss' to an audience of Nazis so solemnly he puts them all to sleep so his family can escape.Even Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplays for 'North By Northwest' and 'Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?', pushes the trite meter past 11. The boys and girls all cry in unison when Maria guilts them over a frog trick or hide under her covers when thunder cracks overhead. I guess Lehman figured with a score that has them singing 'So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, goodnight...I flit/I float/I fleetly flee and flyyyy...' these kids were on something stronger than schnitzel and noodles. The poor captain might have noticed this, except he's played by Christopher Plummer in such a tight-mouthed fog much of the time, you wonder if he's not hitting that wine cellar of his a bit too much.There are good numbers, namely the opening one with Andrews performing the title song on a mountain top in a nicely low-key hands-in-pockets way, and the best song in the score which follows that, 'How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?' well-staged in an abbey courtyard as a dialogue amongst several nuns. One, Sister Sophia, brings an Audrey Hepburn-like quality to her singing. With director Robert Wise's steady hand and cinematographer Ted McCord's nice attention to the stained-glass and groined-ceiling decor, the sequence really sticks with you and is enjoyable to see over again.But Wise makes some odd decisions with other numbers that follow, especially the icky 'Edelweiss' and '16 Going On 17,' a nice song undone by campy staging. 'Climb Ev'ry Mountain,' a showstopper on stage, is performed by the Mother Abbess with a terribly trilly overdub and in such dark shadow you'd think she was a mob informant for the FBI. Actually, Wise says in his director's commentary that he was put off by the bombastic way he felt the song came off on stage, but his solution only makes things worse.Finally, the movie needed to end with the wedding, which while saccharine, is at least a pretty high note in keeping with what came before. The Nazi chase that follows is just silly, an attempt to add some movie drama that comes off as sour bubble gum.Two things to say in this movie's favor. One is lots and lots of people don't agree with me and have made 'The Sound Of Music' a cultural touchstone. The other is the 40th anniversary of the film's release came with a DVD that is a very nice and generous package, chockful of generous add-ons like candid commentaries from Andrews and Wise, a delightful reminiscence by the now-grown actors who played the kids, and even a karaoke feature for those deluded souls who not only enjoy the movie, but sing along to it. If you like the movie, even a little, you probably owe it to yourself to get this DVD.",4,17,48,8 April 2006
Skyfall," Getting Back To Work
","The James Bond franchise celebrated its 50th anniversary with this hard-charging re-examination of the character and the world he inhabits, served up with fierce action scenes, amazingly exotic locales, and the welcome re-introduction of humor.As Bond himself (Daniel Craig) puts it, his hobby is 'resurrection,' and as Craig invests himself more into the role, it seems like he is doing his job.It's a strange movie in many ways. While other Bond films present us with an infallible hero, here we see him making a few mistakes. He fails the opening mission rather spectacularly, then goes to ground to perform some meaningless, unhappy sex and drinking games with scorpions to amuse jaded barflies. But MI6 is in even more serious trouble than usual, and as a battered M (Judi Dench) faces early retirement, an unshaven Bond returns to do what he can. Which we really sense this time may not be enough.'You know we need you,' says M, speaking for all of us.'Well, I'm here,' says Bond, looking none-too-happy about it.It may be pointless to write a positive review in this forum; any nice words said about 'Skyfall' tend to attract 'unhelpful' votes like dead meat does flies. Maybe someone thinks enough negativity on IMDb will be enough to force Craig out and bring back Pierce Brosnan. Well, with all the millions of box office and new fans this Eon makeover has been getting, I can only echo one of Craig's many quips from this surprisingly amusing if dark film: 'Good luck with that!'If there has been a traditional backlash against the new Bonds, it surprises me. Sure, 'Skyfall' plays with our expectations, but it does so by grounding Bond in the same sensibility of fallibility and fragility that Ian Fleming introduced in the Bond books. His Bond didn't enjoy his work, and in the later novels began to fall apart until he was a battered shell of his old self by the penultimate novel, 'You Only Live Twice.' Double-O work takes a toll, and Craig isn't the cocky video game avatar we may be expecting. His doggedness isn't always a plus; it weighed down the last movie, 'Quantum Of Solace,' rather heavily.The screenwriters here, usual suspects Neil Purvis and Robert Wade along with new writer John Logan, still suffer from an inability to devise and develop a sensible plot. It starts terrifically, but the ending is seriously hobbled by an effort to give a major character a proper send-off, and there is also the magic maniac issue around our principal baddie, the renegade agent Silva (Javier Bardem), who just seems too held up by contrivance as the film enters its third, patchiest act.But Bardem does a solid job with a difficult role, injecting his own humor and making the viewer question M's opportunism in quest of mission. The script does fine with sharp dialogue and character development, developing shadings and resonances you don't expect. A great example is the Bond Girl here, Bérénice Lim Marlohe, who plays up her character Severine's vulnerability in a way that surprises one used to just getting eye candy. Watching her try to bandy words with Bond at a bar, one sees in her eyes how shaky her situation is, another callback to Fleming. She wears her doom well.As a film, 'Skyfall' takes its time, a bit too much time in places, but manages to score as a series of invigorating setpieces in a way that give this film a rewatchability I find lacking in the other Craig Bonds, even the thematically stronger 'Casino Royale.' Director Sam Mendes makes his style points, but he's a fan and never forgets the mission here: Let the audience have some fun.I had fun watching this, and think you will, too. It's a half-century milestone that suggests the series has more in the tank than even Craig's prior outings portended. He's had a great run, and it appears he won't be leaving with his dignity any time soon. Which is fine by me.",8,2,6,11 May 2013
The Young Victoria," Games Royals Play
","Emily Blunt displays enough star wattage to light up an Empire, and smart editing and sumptuous production design add to the overall positives of 'Young Victoria.' While not a particularly engaging or stimulating movie, it manages to keep one interested.Blunt plays the title character, a teenager about to inherit the throne of Great Britain at about the time of its world-conquering zenith, 1837. Victoria is to be a constitutional monarch, bound by the strictures of popular will. She is also bound by other forces, including the connivances of a court that doesn't always wish her well. In such straits, she needs the love and support of Albert of Belgium (Rupert Friend), a real prince who also proves a prince of a guy.'I know what it is to live alone inside your head,' he tells her, 'while never giving a clue as to your real feelings.'Friend presents Albert as a likeably awkward man of real depth, a deserving match for the ravishing Blunt. Like nearly every other reviewer here, I'm in awe of what she brings to the screen, beauty and charm in equal measure. I can't say she's a great actress here, just a compelling star with her two killer expressions, Earnestly Pained and Serenely Pleased.That's all she needs, though, in a movie that works more by way of effective montage sequences than dramatic arcs or character building. 'Young Victoria' tries something I haven't seen before, where one scene ends and another begins while both alternately play out on the screen for a minute or so of seamless cross-cutting. Director Jean-Marc Vallée and his editors, Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner, make this costume drama/chick flick an easy experience for those of us outside 'Young Victoria's' target demographic, keeping information on a fast boil and served up with the right amount of energy and easy flair.This helps a lot, considering any lack of real conflict. When you think of it, there's really nothing going on in this film that isn't resolved with considerable ease.{SPOILERS} We are told in the opening moments that Victoria is fighting an attempt by a conniving noble to seize power from her by getting her to agree to a regency, but even before the title credit we see her saying no and pretty much settling that. The nasty noble manhandles Victoria a couple of times and even kicks a dog just so we can hate him better, but winds up out of gas by the time she takes the throne. Then we get a constitutional crisis that doesn't really seem serious, especially once Albert returns to claim his queen. Albert has his own people to get free of back home in Belgium, who want to profit politically from Albert's new love, but he just ignores them and that takes care of that. {SPOILERS END}There is little to distract from the spectacle that seems 'Young Victoria's' main purpose. Given the fantastic locations where the crew was allowed to film, you'd understand a tendency to bask in long costumed sequences with 'Zadok The Priest' playing overhead, but Vallée doesn't stay static. Changing up camera angles and perspectives, he keeps his camera on Blunt and lets her stares and reactions fill the screen.Most of the time she's ravishing. Sometimes she's even interesting. One moment, offering a rill in this otherwise still mill pond, features an argument with Albert where she screams at him about defying her queenly authority, even commanding him to stay so she can scream at him some more. He declines, saying he is concerned for the health of the unborn baby she carries, and leaves her to huff alone.Blunt in that scene asks you to not simply bathe in her beauty, but laugh at her character, succeeding well enough to make you think she has a future in movies long after her cheeks lose their rosy glow. 'Young Victoria' seems mostly about those cheeks, though, and doesn't do badly by them.",6,3,3,16 May 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Going Places
","Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of 'Catch Me If You Can' convinced me I was wrong. Like many great artists, Spielberg doesn't have to swing for the fences to make an indelible impression every time out.Indelible impressions are the sort of thing Frank Abagnale Jr. is good at, especially on the kind of phony checks that fool bank security. After his parents' divorce, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) sets off in the Big Apple, making his way as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an assistant district attorney, all by means of fraudulent credentials and irresistible charm, not to mention the ability to stay one step ahead of the law, as represented by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).A film that owes a debt to Alfred Hitchcock by way of Henry Mancini, 'Catch Me If You Can' zips along on its own kind of sneaky charm, making us root for a character who would probably steal our life savings if given half a chance. At the same time, Spielberg avoids the pitfall of relativism by making sure Hanks as Hanratty keeps some amount of our rooting interest, however much we feel for this crazy kid with his naive belief that, like the mouse stuck in a bucket of cream, he can churn his bucket into butter and crawl out. It's a trick every bit worthy of the subject of this engaging tale.From the opening moments of this film, featuring the best-ever Spielberg titles sequence (courtesy of Kuntzel-Deggas) and a very unusual but entrancing John Williams score that uses shushing sounds and finger snaps in place of his normal bombast, we realize we are in unusual territory for a Spielberg film. Right away, the theme of mistaken identity is introduced courtesy of a 'To Tell The Truth' clip with host Joe Garagiola giving us three Frank Abagnales to choose from. We think we know which one he is, but we don't know as much as we think.'You know why the Yankees always win?' asks Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). 'It's because the other team can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes.' Walken, like Spielberg, works against audience expectations. Sure, he's a criminal, much what we expect from Walken, but he's got a good heart and a beguiling innocence. He believes in the American dream, even if he cons innocent ladies with phony jewelry to get what he wants. Ultimately he's a victim, and a lesson to his son about why the straight and narrow isn't the way to go.DeCaprio gives a solid, impressive performance, the best I've seen from him, playing a consummate conman who succeeds because he believes his cons as much as his victims. He finds the drama in his character, but also the comedy, in a film that shows Spielberg can be funny even when he involves us in a dramatic story. As we watch him fake his way aboard a cockpit, in an operating room, and even in a bedroom with an expensive callgirl played by Jennifer Garner, we shake our heads at what he gets away with but smile because he's succeeding.The film also benefits from an immersive sense of the period in which it is set. Williams' score, along with the costumes and set design, present us with a view of the 1960s in its more sophisticated adult form, with Dusty Springfield and Frank Sinatra providing the music rather than the pop and rock acts we think of when we think of the time.Does 'Catch Me If You Can' go on longer than it should? Yes, I think tougher editing would have made it better. But I don't miss the mawkish attempts at uplift that pock Spielberg's lesser work, and the few poignant moments Spielberg throws in amid Abagnale's ruses ring true, especially a moment involving Frank and a little girl at a window near the end of the film that only Spielberg would try to get away with, because he can and does.No, this is not a great film, just a very good one that might have slipped past a few people on its first release, as it did me. But give 'Catch Me If You Can' a chance, and you may find this as a con you not only enjoy being taken by, but wish to experience again just to see how the masters, Abagnale and Spielberg, make their plays.",8,8,10,17 March 2006
The Hangover," Wedding Bell Blues
","The first time I saw this film, I was in a packed Norwalk theater, the woman next to me was grabbing my arm, and I nearly ripped a gut laughing so hard.The next time I saw it, I was alone with my DVD, the woman had long ago married another guy, and geez, somehow my enthusiasm barely crept into canter mode.So was I at fault, or was it really a 'Hangover' hangover?It's probably the fault of 'Hangover' being such a party movie. If you are having a party, you are only going to enjoy the Vegas decadence, the numbskull wisecracks, the whiplash plot twists. If you are watching this from something of a socially-isolated remove, you might find it more of a laugh-begging lowest-common-denominator comedy that doesn't work hard enough to make you care.The idea of four men celebrating a final night of bachelorhood has been done enough times already. 'The Hangover' shakes things up by making the comedy a bit of a mystery at the outset. Where did the groom disappear to, and why is there a tiger in the bathroom? The groom's two best friends and prospective brother-in-law have less than 48 hours to find out.If there was one thing I was really amused by the first time, it was Zach Galifianakis's turn as the goofy hirsute manbaby Alan Garner. 'Don't let the beard fool you, he's a child,' as Dr. Stu (Ed Helms) tells a would-be attacker. But the next time I saw the film, I stumbled over the previously-overlooked-fact Alan is presented as a child molester with a record.I guess that's the film's way of being edgy, like by mentioning 9/11 and the Holocaust. Other jokes seem less winning, too, particularly a segment where the core trio is picked up by the law and another where they run into Heather Graham, who would be the worst actor in the film if not for a former heavyweight champion.One thing that improved my enjoyment the third time around was the realization, from reading the IMDb comments, that Bradley Cooper's star character Phil is supposed to be a jerk, and not just a cool guy who wears fantastic sunglasses. He actually fits into that part quite well, without delivering an overbearing performance like Dr. Stu's fiancée, who director Todd Phillips makes sure we hate from the first minute she's on.Good things in the film include a speech from Alan about forming a 'wolfpack' and some stray surveillance footage involving a tiger. As I said, the whole opening section develops an interesting story, but the rest of the film lets this slide for cheap laughs. Alan even asks a pretty hotel clerk at Caesar's Palace if Caesar himself really lived there.A good comedy, like any other movie, is a film for all seasons, not just when life is good and everyone is laughing. 'The Hangover' feels too much like the title condition by the end.",4,1,2,21 January 2011
Spartacus," Rome Epic Roams Too Much
","'Spartacus' has its moments but feels for the most part like what it is: An overblown epic with too many cooks stirring the pot.It's shortly before the dawn of the Christian era, and somewhere in the vastness of the Roman Empire, a slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is forced to become a gladiator, providing kill-or-be-killed entertainment for leisured decadents. Alas, he is pushed too far, and leads a revolt that soon threatens great Rome herself. Will Spartacus lead his people to freedom? Or will the vile Crassus (Laurence Olivier) bring him to heel?Nominally directed by Stanley Kubrick, for which this was his introduction to the big-time, 'Spartacus' is in fact a shining example of limitations, both of the Hollywood star vehicle as art form and the ability of a 1960 film to come to grips with the ancient world. How best to condense the social upheaval of the Third Servile War? Why, how about Kirk and Jean Simmons smooching at a pond!The film starts off well enough, with Douglas in fine fettle glowering at the camera and everyone else, especially trainer/tormentor Marcellus (Charles McGraw). In a sequence that obviously influenced the later Best Picture winner 'Gladiator', Spartacus learns the ropes, makes some friends, and begins to want to do something about the injustice he is experiencing. The first hour concludes in the film's only great moment, a duel between Spartacus and the mysterious Draba (Woody Strode) for Crassus's cruel enjoyment.Once Spartacus rebels, however, the film goes to pot. Douglas loses the fire while Kubrick loses interest in Spartacus's story, becoming engaged only when the scene shifts to Rome, where the aristocratic Crassus battles with the plebian Gracchus (Charles Laughton) for the city's soul, and Spartacus's former owner Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) finds himself in the unhappy role of political pawn.Ustinov's performance was the only Oscar-winning one in any Kubrick film, and he's great both as a bridge between the two story arcs and as low-key comic relief, playing off the high dungeon of everyone else. The problem with 'Spartacus' is you also have some Golden Turkey performances, too, like those of Simmons, John Dahl, John Ireland, and John Gavin.Olivier may be the best thing in the film, in those moments when he is at the center of it. Playing Crassus as if he were Roy Cohn in a toga, he plumps quite convincingly as he makes sheep eyes at slave boy Tony Curtis and displays a patriotic narcissism in uncovering his lusts: 'There is only one way to deal with Rome, Antoninus. You must serve her. You must abase yourself before her.'Nothing else sticks quite like that (and that only because the restored version on the Criterion DVD put back an excised scene of Crassus and Antoninus in a bath, which explains what the old Roman meant by 'abase'.) Whenever the movie goes back to Spartacus and company, its hard watching as Douglas smiles a lot and moves through adoring crowds like John F. Kennedy at a campaign stop. We are told a lot of Spartacus's skill as a commander, but the battles all occur off-screen, with the one exception being the final one, a clumsy set-piece that compares badly to the spectacle of less-heralded 'sword-and-sandals' pictures.Not uninteresting, especially as the Criterion DVD includes many commentaries and supplements that enrich the experience of the movie. It's just that for a director of such discipline as Kubrick, 'Spartacus' is all over the map. It's no mystery why he largely disowned this film after its release; it really was never his picture in the first place.",4,39,72,15 July 2007
Casablanca," The Fundamental Things Apply...
","'Casablanca' remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls 'Rick's Cafe Americaine.' Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.'Casablanca' is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: 'The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.' There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is 'trustworthy,' and that, if she does 'a bad thing' to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner ('Go back to Bulgaria'), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like 'Captain Blood' and 'Angels With Dirty Faces.' For my money, his 'Adventures Of Robin Hood' was every bit 'Casablanca's' equal, and he even found time the same year he made 'Casablanca' to make 'Yankee Doodle Dandy.' When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. 'Casablanca' is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and 'Casablanca,' also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it 'the dream factory.' As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, 'You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco.' Nor, for that matter, in all the world.",10,309,366,16 January 2005
Lifeboat," Hitch Ahoy!
","World War II propaganda films say a lot about the societies behind them. Simplistic racial and classist dichotomies abound in Nazi and Soviet films, respectively, because of government demand and audience expectation. In Allied countries, however, democracy required a more subtle, less dogmatic 'Why We Fight' approach, one best exemplified in this American wartime drama by British director Alfred Hitchcock.Tallulah Bankhead stars as jaded newspaper columnist Connie Porter who wears her cynical, relativistic view of life as prominently as her mink coat and diamond bracelet, coming off like a 1940s version of the New York Times' vampy Maureen Dowd with her needling asides and eye-rolling hauteur. CoPo is one of several survivors of a vessel sunk by a German U-Boat, now adrift on a boat with little hope of rescue.Among the others: A smug businessman, a doughty British radioman, a Brooklyn jitterbugger with a wounded leg, a nurse regretting her adulterous past, an African-American steward with a knack for picking pockets, and perhaps most notably, a survivor from the day's other wreck, that of the U-Boat.Stereotypes, yes, but the richness of 'Lifeboat' in large part springs from the fact they don't always behave in stereotypical fashion. Take John Kovac, the black-gang communist played by John Hodiak. Many commentators claim the film's own socialistic sympathies are in evidence when Kovac makes his loaded barbs at the swells in the craft and urges the German be thrown over, which as the film develops doesn't seem so bad an idea. But Kovac often comes off too heavy for his own good, not to mention less than the exemplar of Comintern rectitude when he receives the amorous attentions of Connie.Then there's the black guy, Joe (Canada Lee), outsider among outsiders, who stays on the margins, keeps his head down when others bicker, and manages to help out time and again without calling attention to himself, sort of this film's version of Ally Sheedy in 'The Breakfast Club.' My favorite is the capitalist, Rittenhouse, his name being the film's most obvious Marxist nod. He's full of tiny jokes and deathly banter, used to being appreciated because of his wealth and cloying in his pretenses at commonality, but in general not all that bad a guy. Henry Hull plays him so well you almost think he's the insufferable one, rather than his role. 'Call me Ritt.' Ugh.At one point, when Rittenhouse gives his name to Kovac, Connie pointedly adds 'Junior' to underline his wealth is inherited rather than earned. As one of the others note: 'She certainly has a way of getting at things.''Lifeboat' garners praise for Hitchcock's compositions within a small space, and moments like the heating of a knife before surgery and the shadow of a sail crossing the face of Walter Slezak as the German show how clever and rich Hitchcock's vision could be. (There's also the all-time best example of Hitchcock's most overrated device, the director's cameo.) But the script by Jo Swirling and Ben Hecht is just as intricately probing, pulling back the covers with each of the characters and finding moments of tension and revelation in the smallest comments. There's enough going on here to reward many viewings. For example, the more we learn about Rosie, William Bendix's girl back home, the more we understand why Connie shakes her head after assuring him Rosie is waiting for him.Okay, Hume Cronyn's British accent is on a par with Kevin Costner's in 'Robin Hood,' and the ending does feel ten minutes longer than it should. But 'Lifeboat' is a quiet triumph, not only for its technical mastery and deep characterization, but as a propaganda film that faces head on the underside of a mob mentality, the virtues of individuality, and the possibility that the enemy might have the right idea now and then. Hitchcock made better films, but none make me so proud to be an American, a pretty cool trick for a Brit.",8,5,8,15 February 2006
Erin Brockovich," Raising Her Game
","There are a lot of money lines in this smart drama about a woman directing a lawsuit against a big corporation that poisoned a community. One of my favorites is when the title character, played by Julia Roberts, complains she isn't taken seriously because she didn't go to law school.'Law school!' moans her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney). 'At this point, I'd settle for charm school.'Never mind Masry: 'Erin Brockovich,' at least the movie, has charm coming out of its ears. From Erin's many abrasive wisecracks to her more sensitive dealings with the good people of Hinkley, California, this is a high-impact touchy-feely drama that works familiar territory in unusual ways, making for engaging entertainment.Girl-power enthusiasts will enjoy how Roberts inhabits her role with surprising gusto and some jaw-dropping language, coming off a bit like George C. Scott did in 'Patton,' albeit with a much different wardrobe.The contributions of two women behind the scenes are equally worthy of note: Screenwriter Susannah Grant and editor Anne V. Coates. Grant capably juggles her two key themes, of corporate malfeasance and personal self-discovery by binding them with a common thread of motherhood. There are cute moments and heartbreaking moments; the strength of Grant's writing is they all feel like authentic moments on screen.Coates, who edited 'Lawrence Of Arabia,' keeps the story moving with sharp cuts that invest you in drama without bogging you down in details. Right after Erin first meets Masry, to tell him about her hit-and-run case, we cut to her telling her story in a courtroom (only one of two courtroom scenes in the whole film, both brief.) The whole film moves like that, not rat-a-tat, but alert to keeping scenes tight where they can be, without shortchanging the emotional arc.As far as guys go, Finney is enjoyably easy-going, quite a departure from his Angry Young Man persona of the 1960s sporting a doughy Texas accent. He's consistently likable as Erin's constructive- minded foil. Aaron Eckhart is also effective playing a character far removed from his usual sinister-smoothy roles. And 'Erin Brockovich' contains probably the most clever use of character actor Tracey Walter you'll ever see, a tribute to both his acting skill and Coates' cuts.Steven Soderbergh may be the most consequential director of the 21st century so far, for the way his films manage to both engage and challenge audiences. Here, the emphasis is more on the former. Still, his use of hand-held cameras for small, intimate scenes, and his refusal to overplay the heavy drama represent significant departures from the usual Hollywood treatments.'Brockovich' doesn't make for much of a final statement. It shortchanges the emotional issues it raises, content instead to tout a historic cash settlement that can't help but land a bit flat. The real Brockovich, like Patton, may not live up to the great build-up she gets here. But for at least two hours, Roberts, Soderbergh, and company are too good for you to care about that.",7,1,1,24 September 2015
The Big Lebowski," Making Vit Der Funny Schtuff
","'The Big Lebowski' is proof a screenplay doesn't need a story to make it today. Just create a couple of oddballs who have gloriously fractured conversations about any sort of bizarre thing, throw in a bunch of random stuff and an eccentric supporting cast, and don't worry if the plot doesn't actually go anywhere. Think 'Caddyshack' with more cursing, a perfect film for regurgitating around a water cooler rather than watching on screen.Jeff Bridges is the Dude, Jeff Lebowski, who because of some confusion with another Jeff Lebowski whose wife owes money to a sleazy porn merchant, finds himself the target of two toughs who 'soil' his rug. Trouble accumulates as he seeks restitution and is recruited to help rescue the other Lebowski's kidnapped wife. Complications ensue when the other Lebowski's daughter seeks him out for a sperm donation, a gang of nihilists threaten his johnson, a detective trails after him in a blue Beetle, and stuff keeps happening to his car. The worst part is the constant interference from his bowling buddy, Walter (John Goodman), who sees parallels with Vietnam for everything, blows the ransom delivery, and butts heads with a rival bowler with a sex-offender past.I don't know, that doesn't read funny. But the movie is funny, especially when Walter and the Dude bicker. Getting this across from writing dialogue excerpts is not possible, not because of the profanity so much as the delivery, which is how it comes together. If comedic acting got the respect it deserves, Goodman would have been nominated for an Oscar; his Walter is a brilliant contrast of sudden rage and anal nitpicking ('The chinaman is not the issue here, dude. I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude. Across this line, you DO NOT... Also, dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please.') Even Goodman's presence, wearing pus-colored sunglasses and a perpetual scowl under a buzzcut, is a marvel.But Goodman's brilliance is in how well he walks the fine line set by the Coen Brothers in a typically challenging film for actors. Bridges is very good, too, but Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro and other good actors are so mannered they become annoying.Also, the story lines just kind of meander with no direction, like the Coens are ridiculing you for attempting to care about how any of it turns out. Did the Dude ever get a new rug? Did he and Walter win the match against Jesus the child molester? What the heck was the point of the cowboy narrator? If you care enough to ask such questions, it's like you are just the butt of the Coens' joke? Who's the %$&@ing nihilists here?The film's weaknesses are evident even in the moments that shine, like a trio of musical comedy numbers done to music by Bob Dylan and Kenny Rogers. They are witty, vibrant set pieces that come in out of nowhere and charge quickly into various cartoony bits, but then meander and drizzle away, lamely explained as acid flashbacks the Dude keeps having when he is knocked out. They don't add anything to the story, but in that sense, at least they are consistent with the rest of what's presented.The Coen Brothers remind me of the '70s jazz popsters Steely Dan, two arch standoffish types who are expert entertainers and creative geniuses but somewhat handicapped by their acerbic pose. They don't like being mistaken for someone who cares. The Coens have made some terrific films, like 'Raising Arizona' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and some overrated ones like 'Fargo' and this. It's a film designed to make people laugh, and that's nice of them, but when one of the big jokes in the film involves casually killing off one of the good guys, you have to wonder whether the joke is really on you.",5,9,22,2 December 2004
Star Trek," Warping Good Time
","The past is never dead. It's not even past.William Faulkner's famous words take on new life in this 2009 take on the classic 1960s sci-fi series, not so much a remake or reboot as a re-invigoration. People who grew up loving 'Star Trek,' particularly what is known to Trek fans as 'The Original Series,' may gulp at some of the liberties taken with familiar characters as Spock, Kirk, and Uhura, but they certainly will find much to surprise them, delight them (if they are open-minded enough going in) and certainly rekindle passions that connect with their inner child. Time warping, indeed.In that light, the movie's plot seems quite appropriate. In the 23rd century, a band of tricked-out Romulans angry at the destruction of their planet travel back in time to avenge themselves on the Federation, whom they blame for their loss. Their actions alter what generations of fans have come to know as the Star Trek universe, to the point where the past is indeed not even the past.Young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) finds himself not captain of the U. S. S. Enterprise but a brig-bound renegade, one harboring understandable antipathy for a half-human, half-Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto) who is Enterprise's rigid commander and seems to harbor a decided dislike for the young Iowa hotshot. How much dislike? He maroons the poor kid on an ice planet for starters.As one character tells Kirk in the film's second half: 'Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed.' Translation for hard-core Trekkers: Just relax and try to enjoy the show. Nothing's broken that breaking out the old series DVDs won't fix.The clever concept embedded in Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman's script means the movie can work in all the references it wants to the series while changing things up in high style, celebrating what was great about the show and has lasted in our collective memory without laboring under too much backstory. Director J. J. Abrams facilitates this approach by emphasizing the human connections developed with the original Star Trek characters, as well as welcome shafts of humor that cut through the rousing action sequences and gee-whiz special effects.Given all this, the movie only works as well as it does because of the sterling job done by the movie's principals, particularly the two leads. Quinto carves out some dark and original territory as Spock, understandable given the situation the film's plot puts him in, yet he also connects with Leonard Nimoy's defining interpretation of Spock from TV, both literally and figuratively. Quinto's the film's strongest asset.Pine doesn't try to mimic his TV model, William Shatner, so much as present the same kind of wit and cocksure energy in a younger, less refined package, which comes off terrifically and connects with Abrams' tongue-in-cheek reverence for the material. Spock and Kirk take a long time to develop any kind of chemistry, but when they do, it's worth the wait.I don't think 'Star Trek' is all that great as a straight adventure movie. The central plot about the time-traveling Romulans flying around in their giant metal moth gets old fast. Visually, Abrams likes using flares way too much, and our patience is tested with too much exposition. I didn't care for Simon Pegg's comically broad interpretation of Enterprise engineer Montgomery Scott, while John Cho's Mr. Sulu is a bit dull (though perhaps because he's written too much that way.) The rest of the actors playing the movie's familiar characters really bring it, from Zoe Saldana's tough but emotional take on Uhura to Anton Yelchin's amusingly gonzo turn as Ensign Chekhov. Real fans may be surprised to see the easy gravitas Bruce Greenwood brings as a secondary series character, Captain Pike, who starts the movie as Enterprise's commander.That's not all that will surprise them, of course, which is as it should be. 'Star Trek' will be best appreciated by those with a healthy interest in the franchise going in, but it can be enjoyed by most non-Trek fans to a degree none of those earlier movies could, ironic considering how much more this film consciously hearkens back to the TV show than the earlier movies did (even, especially, those that featured the actors from the original series, which always seemed to try too hard at wholesale reinvention.)The end result: A nice time-warp of an adventure film that gives the lie to a line by another famous writer: 'You can never go home again.'",7,1,4,31 July 2012
Citizen Kane," A Helluva Sleigh Ride
","They say that the Bush-Kerry race is full of negative campaigning, but neither candidate has yet gone so far as to pledge that, when elected, his first act will be to see to the 'indictment, prosecution, and conviction' of his opponent. Charley Kane does, though, so much for political civility, not to mention guaranteeing a fair trial.Re-watching 'Citizen Kane' at any one time is to discover it anew. There are a lot of great films, great because of the way they advanced the art of film, which don't burn their way into your brain and heart the way 'Kane' does, finding new ways to amaze every time you watch it. The wonder of 'Kane' 63 years later is not only its greatness, but how much doggone fun it is.Orson Welles made a film so electric, so outrageous, so simultaneously joyous and sad, it's a wonder it did as well as it did, getting nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and winning the prize for best screenplay. So ahead of its time in so many ways, it's a wonder too RKO ever released the thing, even without significant pressure from William Randolph Hearst to destroy the movie because he believed, not completely correctly, that it was all a big dig at him.'Kane' manages to be entertaining from first to last. Its quick cuts and clever transitions have only benefited from the MTV generation like few films of its time, yet it also retains a certain classic Hollywood grandeur, in its gaslit sets, black-and-white compositions, Joseph Cotten's marcelled hair, and the endlessly quotable dialogue.And it's often hilarious, too. Sometimes in very overt, slapstick ways, like Signore Matiste's music lessons to the impossibly amateurish Susan Alexander Kane. Sometimes in cleverly sardonic ways, like when we see Bernstein examining the alternative headlines the morning after Kane's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. There's more subtle jests, some which require multiple viewings. I just caught one, where Kane first makes the acquaintance of Susan Alexander by taking her up on her offer of 'hot water.' She provides the hot water alright, as Boss Gettys makes sure.Welles performs the rare trick of making intelligence fun, his own as well as the viewer's. It's a magic show that has lost none of its power all these decades later.Welles was only 25 when he directed and starred in this, his first real film role, but he already made his mark on popular culture as something of a trickster in 1938, when he convinced millions of radio listeners the Earth was under Martian attack in his adaptation of 'The War Of The Worlds.' 'Kane' starts out with similar trickery, putting up a fake newsreel of the kind moviegoers were accustomed to seeing back then. Welles himself was quoted as saying the whole identity of 'Rosebud' was a bit of a blind alley, 'dime-store Freud' he called it, but the notion works, not only in setting up an air of mystery to the proceedings (shades of film noir, the genre that immediately succeeded Hollywood's Golden Age that concluded with 'Kane') but asking a question that Welles' own life seems to beg in retrospect. When is greatness enough for its own sake, and when is it just a way people isolate themselves from the rest of humanity?It's a shame that 'Kane' didn't launch a series of Mercury Theatre productions, not just the truncated 'Magnificent Ambersons' and the weird 'Journey Into Fear' but a slew of other films, as Welles and his team once envisioned. It fed a bit of a myth, of Welles as an artistic martyr. Welles did suffer from his vision, but he also suffered from being Welles, impossible, petulant, and mercurial. 'Kane' suffers a bit, too, seen too often as a start not followed through on by its prime creator than as a brilliant individual achievement that has fed so many other great minds since its release.A couple of reviews down, someone calls this 'another boring black and white film,' and I almost peed in my pants. Not from anger, but laughter. People can think what they want about 'Kane,' and they will anyway, but as Matiste would say, 'some people have it, and some don't.' Give it a chance; you won't be sorry.",10,10,14,21 September 2004
Monster," Convoluted Story, Captivating Center
","Aileen Wuornos shattered the glass ceiling on female mass murderers, killing seven men she lured into compromising situations in order to support herself and her lesbian lover. Trust Hollywood to celebrate the lesbian and downplay the murders.Charlize Theron certainly deserved her Best Actress Oscar, playing Wuornos as a dopey but empathetic human sponge unable to process the pain life throws at her, only absorb it. It was a total departure from her glamour-girl image that reads like stunt casting but totally sells you long before the film's end. Her brown eyes burn into you like lit cigarettes.I'm less sold on the film itself. It doesn't glorify Wuornos, and in fact strains at credibility to make all but one of her victims not only sympathetic but, occasionally, noble. But the film never really explains why Wuornos killed, except that the seediness of turning tricks on the interstate finally got to her, especially when she found love, represented here by the fictional character Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).Wuornos is the crux of the story, but Selby's the hinge on which the plot must turn, and it's here the film struggles most. Is she an innocent waif, misunderstood by her straight kith and kin? Or is she an enabler and instigator of Wuornos' crimes? Writer-director Patty Jenkins can't seem to decide, and Ricci alternates between interpretations.One minute she is Wuornos' lonely, loyal buddy, gently, doggedly trying to talk sense to her: 'We can be as different as you want to be, but we can't kill people!' Later she's basically telling her to hurry up and kill someone so they can get a ride out of town. 'This is YOUR plan,' she whines.On the plus side, other than Theron centering things, is a nice attention to lower-class consumer culture, with ugly t-shirts and corporate rock predominating. 'I love this song', Wuornos says as Journey's 'Don't Stop Believin'' plays from the roller rink speakers where she and Selby are enjoying a date. The irony, which Jenkins sets up well, is that believing is just another luxury Wuornos could not afford.I like the opening of the film, too, setting up the despondent mood before Theron even arrives, images of a young girl continually abused until the narration abruptly stops (on the word 'stopped') to show Wuornos under a bridge right after her last killing. The actors playing the various men Wuornos picks up all bring something unique and interesting to the proceedings.But there was a lot that felt thrown up for effect, like an odd pal played by Bruce Dern ranting about 'circumstance' and a Christian woman looking after Selby who is played in the typical narrow-minded Hollywood manner. Like I said, the film is divided in its loyalties. That may be understandable, but it reduces what could have been a more effective and complex movie to little more than a stage for Theron. Thanks to Theron, it makes for a decent bargain all the same.",6,0,2,3 September 2008
Memento," Memorable doesn't always equal great
","Many movie lovers call this a 21st-century return to film noir, and I guess it is. It's a clever, even admirable film in the way it is constructed. Pardon me for not enjoying it more.Guy Pearce stars as Leonard (don't call him Lenny) Shelby, a fellow hot on the trail of his wife's killer...if only he can remember more than five minutes ago. It's an intriguing concept, to what extent personality and identity are beholden to the brain's ability to make new memories, and you have to give mad props to the filmmakers for dreaming this one up, only they didn't bother to create any sympathetic characters for their drama, or a story worth caring about beyond the novel 'story-backwards-through-unfolding-plotting' means of narration. You have to watch the movie more than once, perhaps several times, before you begin to realize what happened. But when you do, it feels like a cheat, because without the gimmick of the constant memory-lapses, the story itself isn't the sort that would hold you very long.All the acting in this film is quite good, in a soulless '90s way. Pearce seems to have borrowed some voice inflections from `L.A. Confidential' co-star Kevin Spacey. He makes for a good anti-hero in many ways, playing his emotions down rather than up, a good choice that makes him a more compelling cypher. His short-term memory loss doesn't seem to have affected his workout regimen, however, nor his hair-treatment routine. But you shouldn't try penalizing movies for small logic lapses, if the movie makes you think hard enough about it after for you to figure out those lapses.The always superb Joe Pantoliano is especially interesting as Teddy Gammell, a sort of helpful or not character who may or may not be a cop, and knows something about the man who killed Lenny's wife, or else maybe killed her himself. He's amusing, anyway, though not always comprehendible in his motives, either before or after you've seen it a few times. Still, a plus. So is Matrix hottie Carrie-Anne Moss, another possible helper or bad guy. Like Gammell, her character Natalie is no easy read, even after repeat viewings, and much of the fun in watching `Momento' again is trying to guess at what's going on inside her head in a given moment. She should keep the sunglasses on, though. Those cold pale blues of hers give me the creeps.A lot to give away here, and I won't do it, even if the backwards-narrative makes such reticence impossible in reviewing the movie. The film plays off so many angles so well you can't help but admire the ride, or not want to spoil it, however much you may or may not actually enjoy it. Suffice to say it's as clever as everyone tells you, but you may not come away liking the bottom-line story as much as you thought. The mystery is hardly that involving (think 'Law And Order Special Victims Unit' if you were watching it on drugs), the characters interesting but nobody you'd care enough to light a ciggie for let alone spend time with, and the final resolution as nihilistic as anything outside a Beckett play.'Memory's not perfect,' Leonard notes. 'It's not even that good.' Especially his, though he still seems able to spring a few traps. If only I cared more about them, or him. Good last line, though, one of the best, right up there with 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship' and 'Tomorrow is another day.' (Which isn't far off point, come to think of it.)Yes it's very good. No, it's not great. It's not in my top 200, let alone top 20. But if you meet Natalie at the bar, be sure not to tell her Jimmy Grantz sent you.",7,1,4,4 December 2003
Inglourious Basterds," Blood And Guts
","The cruelty of various nations in war is measured against their ability to value good international cinema and speak in multiple languages in this frightfully confused, only occasionally arresting offering from Quentin Tarantino.People coming to this movie cold may be surprised to discover the title characters, a group of mostly American Jews, really don't figure too much. One can imagine the film going the way it does pretty much without the help of Donnie Donowitz the 'Bear Jew' (Eli Roth), the anti-authoritarian non-Jewish German Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), and country boy Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), all of whom bring considerable if wasted brio to the proceedings. The central issue is really decided by a pack of brave, cool, cruel Germans and the French chafing under their heel. The Inglourious Basterds themselves just offer a marketing peg.What was Tarantino aiming for here? I think it was an anti-war film of the art-house variety, where the Germans are presented as majestic if nasty adversaries, in several scenes facing death with a singular calm designed to win us to their side. There's a reason why the most intriguing character, SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), pushes us to accept his humanity even as he commits various atrocities, which is to remind us that war is hell no matter who is on the receiving end.How can anyone really hate Landa, especially as deliriously played by the alternately vicious and amiable Waltz? 'I love rumors, facts can be so misleading,' he encourages a Frenchman in his power in a memorable opening scene. 'Rumors, true or false, are often revealing.' The Americans, compared to the quad-lingual Landa, are pretty pathetic characters, so much so one of their German allies moans very understandably at one point: 'I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?' Well, they better, or at least read subtitles. Tarantino presents a Babel of a film, with a multitude of languages on display.The film suffers from serious defects, like an unreasonable need to display the director-screenwriter's cinema knowledge at every turn. One sign of the Nazis' strength in this film is their understanding of cinema, whether it be a German sniper's preference of Max Linder over Charlie Chaplin or a Gestapo agent's ability to grasp the black American subtext in the story of King Kong. Joseph Goebbels even approvingly notes the 'church-like quality' of a theater where he plans to screen a film for his Fuhrer.Tarantino also extends scenes well beyond the breaking point, occasionally with good results but more often exhausting our desire to follow along. Terrific as this film is from an acting standpoint, and as impressive as its last 30 minutes are, one wonders whether Tarantino the screenwriter overrode Tarantino the director too often. Talking-head shots dominate, and the idea of breaking the movie up into chapters suggest either an overlong novella or a series of idly-connected episodes from a miniseries. Focus is too often lacking.'Inglourious Basterds' never bores, but it drains one of their ability, or willingness, to follow along. Tarantino's intentions were in the right place, but did he think people really wanted to watch a bunch of stupid Americans kill stolid Germans? Maybe he wanted to make a point of an American audience cheering on a war movie which features a German audience cheering on a war movie with similar mindless bravado? Impressed as I was at times, I can't say I enjoyed it or felt better from watching it.",5,0,0,25 December 2011
Mississippi Burning," 'The Worst I've Seen'
","In 1966, Martin Luther King visited Philadelphia, Mississippi, seat of Neshoba County and the town where three young civil rights workers disappeared two years before. Leading a procession of 300 people, he was confronted by a mob of angry white men brandishing hoes, broomsticks, and ax handles. One even turned a hose on King's group, which fought their way to the courthouse.There King confronted the deputy sheriff, Ray Price, who he knew had arrested the civil rights workers on the night they disappeared. He turned and told the crowd that there were people among them who had participated in the murder. 'You're damn right,' Price muttered. 'They're right behind you.'King was moved to write later: 'This is a terrible town. The worst I've seen. There is a complete reign of terror here.''Mississippi Burning' aims to give a taste for how bad it was, and just how superhuman the efforts to stop it had to be in order to succeed. It's flawed because it's not terribly functional as a crime drama or nuanced enough as a civil rights story, but its heart is in the right place, its grasp of the situation solid, and its detractors mostly attack it for all the wrong reasons.Like why does 'Mississippi Burning' give all the credit to breaking the murder case to the FBI? Didn't director Alan Parker and writer Chris Gerolmo know FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a racist? Yes, and he hated vigilante groups with a passion, particularly the Ku Klux Klan. Plus he was acting under orders of President Johnson, who was very disturbed about the disappearances, enough to place a phone call to a Mississippi senator asking for help finding the kids (and being told by the senator it was all probably just a hoax). WhiteHouseTapes.org has the phone calls on record, while Doug Linder's Famous Trials website has the full story. The FBI did send hundreds of agents to Neshoba County, they rankled the local authorities big time, they found the murdered workers, and they arrested several people for the crime, including the sheriff and the deputy sheriff, getting relatively light convictions for most, but convictions all the same, a first involving the murder of a black by whites.Did the black population of Neshoba County contribute much to solving the case? I don't know, but King's experience there is telling. There simply was no regard for the rights of non-whites. Blacks were completely powerless there, dealing with a white power structure that was nakedly aggressive about keeping them down. In many Southern jurisdictions, white authorities looked the other way when the Klan did their work. As the FBI investigation in Neshoba County revealed, the sheriff's office and the Klan worked hand in glove.'Mississippi Burning' has great acting, sumptuous period detail, an unflinching desire to show the terrible toll of racism on a society, not only with lynchings but most powerfully, in the story Gene Hackman tells about how his father dealt with a black neighbor's mule. Just the way he uses his eyes as he tells the story, without the slightest attempt at drama, draws you into the terrible dehumanization that racism brings not to its targets but those who buy into it.The truth of the story was more shaded than Parker presents here. He's not a racist, or an FBI apologist. He's a filmmaker who wants to entertain his audience. He unrealistically overamps the Klan violence, to the point where they seem to be burning some black person's building once a week even though the FBI is making little progress through most of the movie. There's an early scene where Willem Dafoe's character (based not on an FBI agent but a Justice Department official named John Michael Doar) sits down next to a black man and starts asking him questions about the murder, in full view of a hundred or so people. No criminal investigator works like that, especially in the FBI.The story of the Mississippi Burning case is so compelling, why fictionalize it at all? The liberties they take, with the exception of the deputy sheriff and his wife, don't really help the plot out much. There's an attempt to make Hackman and Dafoe into fractious partners, but the scenes are ridiculous, especially when Dafoe pulls a gun on his partner after teasing him about his relationship with the deputy's wife.Frankly, the most interesting place this case was fought was in the courtroom, but we see little of that, or of Judge Cox, the bigoted federal justice who passed down the final sentences after heavy prodding from Washington.The movie does go for fireworks more often than it should. Hackman's two big confrontation scenes with the bad guys, at the speakeasy and in the barber shop, serve no apparent criminal investigation purpose and are meant to just make the audience feel good. He doesn't even get a word out of the deputy (played excellently by Brad Dourif) in between punches. But damn it works like hell.After the case was successfully prosecuted, Martin Luther King was moved to say the following: 'I must commend the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the work they have done in uncovering the perpetrators of this dastardly act. It renews my faith in democracy.'Manipulated or not, I feel the same way after watching 'Mississippi Burning.'",6,14,23,15 February 2004
Shaun of the Dead," It's Funny As Long As Someone Gets Hurt
","'Shaun Of The Dead' has been dubbed a 'zom-rom-com', meaning a romantic comedy featuring zombies. Yet it really works only in terms of the zombies, and there less on its own merits than in the way it channels famous past films about the undead. It was amusing, at times impressive, but never engaging.Shaun (Simon Pegg) works a London electronics store, his life as dull and pointless as any other in his sad city. His main problem is reconciling his responsibilities with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) with his other long-term relationship involving layabout buddy Ed (Nick Frost).'Things will change, I promise,' Shaun tells Liz. He soon discovers how right he is, after bumping into assorted people with shuffling walks, dead-eyed stares, and a tendency, as Shaun's mother puts it, to get 'a bit bitey'.Written by Pegg and director Edgar Wright, 'Shaun Of The Dead' is less a send-up than a celebration of the zombie-film culture, playing the comedy less in the manner of a Mel Brooks spoof and more in a way that respects the whole notion of zombies appearing in one's world, attacking loved ones. The laughs come as much from Shaun and Ed's deadpan reactions, and the film's way of teasing the audience with allusions both to other zombie films and to the British television work of the film's stars.That's too many in-jokes for me, not to mention a singular lack of charisma by any of the film's principals. If not as deliberately off-putting as the work of other British comedians like Sasha Cohen and Ricky Gervais, there's a strong whiff of au currant kitchen-sink misery to 'Shaun' that deadens a lot of the pleasure to be had. Ironically, 'Shaun' was shot in part at Ealing Studios, making it an Ealing comedy, though of a different kind than Alec Guinness would have known.But that's my cultural take, from someone admittedly not a part of that culture. I'm over 40, and this film was not made for me. Fair enough. Does 'Shaun' work on its own terms? At times.Mostly, it works as a fairly involving zombie film with real violence and some comic relief. Not as lovable as 'Return Of The Living Dead' or as clever as 'Evil Dead 2', it nevertheless keeps things moving and has a good narrative arc all the way to the final big scene, a showdown at Shaun's favorite bar that rivals the Alamo sequence in 'Saving Pvt. Ryan' for desperate intensity. There, the three principals and their companions must stave off a wave of zombies, and the build-up gives otherwise lame ideas like a pool-cue beatdown in time to Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' a real lift.If only I cared enough about the characters to fret over their horrible fates. Good zombie films manage some emotional remove, and 'Shaun' does, too, but that works too often at the expense of the 'rom' and the 'com'. Pegg and Ashfield play well off one another, and there's a fine turn by Bill Nighy as Shaun's unloved father-in-law, but I quickly tired of Ed and found myself at times bemoaning the zombies' slow-footedness.An okay movie that could have been better, 'Shaun' works at times on its own self-referential terms. But when people weren't getting killed, I wasn't laughing. That's a strange thing to have to say about a comedy.",5,2,5,11 March 2008
Argo," Making It Up As He Goes Along
","Hollywood movies get a lot of flak for messing with the truth. Sometimes it's because people don't appreciate that compromises have to be made to fit in a two-hour window. Other times, like 'Argo,' the compromises wind up compromising what's on screen.November, 1979. In Tehran, Iran, the Islamic Revolution is flexing its muscles. After the deposed Shah goes to the U. S. for cancer treatments, the U. S. Embassy is seized in retaliation, its personnel now hostages to pressure the Shah's forced return. Six Americans who escaped the embassy now hide, their days of relative freedom numbered.It's a tense-enough situation, but director Ben Affleck and the creative team behind his star vehicle 'Argo' can't resist giving audiences extra tension. His superior (Bryan Cranston) warns him of the high stakes if the refugees are discovered by the Iranian revolutionaries:'Standing room only for beheadings in the square...These people die, they die badly.'Did anyone think that was really going to happen? Iran had gone insane, yes, but the hostages at the embassy were still alive. The psychological tortures they endured, outside of being paraded blindfolded for the cameras, wouldn't become public knowledge until much later.It's hard to imagine the Iranian revolutionaries so put out not having six more hostages. For all the introductory talk about the CIA propping up the evil Shah, the real reason for taking hostages isn't addressed in the film; Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, whose embassy sheltered the refugees (who would become known as the 'guests') points out in a DVD extra that there were four major factions in Iran fighting for supremacy. The hostages became a trump card for the radical Shiite faction. They didn't care about having all the embassy personnel, or they wouldn't have let some go in the days immediately after the takeover. What they wanted, and got, was the attention of the international media.This would still make for an interesting film, if not one with totally fictional devices like car chases and an angry confrontation at a Tehran bazaar. You would need a director and screenwriter with more of an interest in the six refugees and their search for help in the days before reaching the Canadians than as simple MacGuffins for the main character, Affleck's exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez, who gets all the big close-ups.The most egregious departure from the truth also makes the least sense within the confines of what's on screen: That Mendez opts to make his play to evacuate the six after being told the operation is a no-go by higher-ups in Washington. There was no such decision made at this late stage of the operation, but I guess Affleck felt he needed it to juice up the plot. Time and again, you sense Affleck just played with the real story like this, to give him an excuse for the heavy music and dramatic close-ups. Here, what you get, in the context of this already compromised story, is a guy who risks the six people on an operation that may never get off the ground.I wish I minded all this messing around less, because I really do enjoy watching the movie. The editing is tight, the comic relief is funny, Affleck plays a cool hero with engaging poise, and the period costumes and set design are first-rate. I finally found out where my childhood collection of Hardy Boys books went.Alan Arkin has a part as an irascible Hollywood producer which is a lot of fun. Many of the film's great lines are his: 'John Wayne is in the ground six months, and this is what's left of America.'The Canadian Caper, as it is rightly known, is a good story. Too bad 'Argo' does such a poor job of telling it. I know movies are like history's second draft, meant to be reviewed and put in the right context, but 'Argo' pushes the entertainment button too often and winds up missing the mark.",5,1,1,24 May 2017
12 Angry Men," Once More Around The Table
","A courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, '12 Angry Men' defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring Henry Fonda.It's a bit of a Trojan Horse, too; screenwriter Reginald Rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la OJ, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. If the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky Mr. Davis (Fonda) and his tireless 'supposing' not much differently than does angry Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb).'It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy,' a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie.But a lot of 'fancy' gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from Juror #10 (Ed Begley) and baseball chatter from Juror #7 (Jack Warden), two solid early votes for conviction. Much of the fancy comes from Davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son.'This kid's been kicked around all his life,' Davis says. 'He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. I think we owe him a few words.'Does anyone really believe this should work? Well, in '12 Angry Men' it does, aided by Rose's clever manipulation, Sidney Lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by Fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. The supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like Ed Binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and Robert Webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents Rice Krispies before our very eyes.The script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding 'them', in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. A Richard Thomas stage production I saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. The music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing.'12 Angry Men' does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (E.G. Marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. Cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. Cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here.But '12 Angry Men', while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom. Maybe he doesn't deserve to die, but '12 Angry Men' stacks the deck too much in his favor to be called high art.",7,0,0,21 July 2008
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Profound Profanimation
","'South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut' aims below the belt from its very title and never stops. I wince at posters here who talk about taking their children to see it as if it were some great First Amendment victory rather than a serious lapse of parental responsibility. But give the Devil his due: This is a very funny film that makes you think.After watching the Canadian comics Terrance and Philip comedy film '@$$*$ Of Fire' with its hit song 'Uncle %@*&er,' impressionable fourth-grade South Park, Colorado student Eric Cartman tells his teacher 'How would you like to suck my *@%%s?' Reaction is swift, as South Park parents blame Canada, and that %#@*^ Anne Murray, too. War is soon on between the United States and its neighbor to the north. Baldwins die needlessly, Cartman's mother appears in a German $^*&%*% video, and Satan and his abusive gay lover Saddam Hussein prepare to conquer what's left of the world.What the %@*&!'BLU' uses the universe of the hit Comedy Central television show to score points against censorship, jingoism, and parental myopia. It also is hilariously funny, in a way that uses the vulgarity on screen not as a substitute but augmentation for a broad range of humor that satirizes everything from race relations ('Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?' 'I don't listen to hip-hop!') to 'Les Miserables.''This is what happens when toilet humor is allowed to run rampant!' says Sheila Broflovski, a mother whose response goes way beyond just saying no.Sheila is one of several characters voiced by the late Mary Kay Bergman, who also gives life to Cartman's anything-goes Mom and pre-teen love object Wendy Testeberger. Not just funny, there's a lot of heart in her work, which feeds off and embellishes the writing by creators and co-voice artists Trey Parker and Matt Stone.Is 'BLU' the apogee of 'South Park'? There are actually funnier TV episodes, and bolder ones, too. But this film has heart to go with its nerve, and works at introducing a larger audience to Stone and Parker's caustic comedy without putting too many people off.Making the film a musical is pure genius that way. It plays at the whole 'kids-putting-on-a-show' thread that has run through children-focused comedies since 'Our Gang', but the songs are catchy and well-composed. 'Up There' would be a classic show-stopper in a legitimate musical, but it kills with Satan singing it after another spat with Saddam. Philip's Anthony Newleyesque vocal stylings crack me up every time.How could those 'South Park' guys create a story where Satan is the most sympathetic character? Well, it worked for John Milton. The movie puts me off with its smugness, though, and a final act that strains too hard for significance.Pretending nothing in this movie is offensive is ridiculous. But pretending nothing in this movie is funny is hopeless. 'BLU' merits consideration with 'Blazing Saddles' and 'There's Something About Mary' as one of the great shock comedies of all time.",8,1,1,23 April 2007
The Great Dictator," First Laughs And Last Laughs
","Charlie Chaplin's boldest film for its willingness to take on Adolf Hitler before nearly anyone else, 'The Great Dictator' was also Chaplin taking on sound 11 years after everyone else. If it had to be the end of cinema's greatest Silent Clown, he did what he could to take down history's greatest monster in the process.There are two reasons to like 'The Great Dictator.' One is that Chaplin was on the side of the angels, at no small risk given his target's ambitions. The other is he didn't forget to make it funny.Essentially a Prince And The Pauper remake, 'Dictator' presents Chaplin as both Adenoid Hynkel, the cruel if inept 'Phooey' (a. k. a. 'Führer') of Tomainia, and a Jewish World War I veteran, poignantly left unnamed as a nod to the Common Man, who only wants to work in peace at his barber shop. While Hynkel struggles with his two great passions, hating Jews and loving war, the barber finds love and a cause to believe in.The comedy here can be categorized into the great and the good, with most of the former featuring Chaplin as Hynkel. He's simply much funnier here as the bad guy, whether playing it broad (jumping secretaries, delivering speeches in hate-choked gobbledegook) or subtle (after shooting dead a man who claims to have 'perfected' a bullet-proof suit, Hynkel simply turns and walks away with a three-word critique: 'Far from perfect.')Hynkel is a character who solves Chaplin's legendary problem with sound, whether dressing down his blubbering subordinate Herring (Billy Gilbert) or struggling to keep his composure when fellow dictator Napaloni (Jack Oakie) rebuffs his attempts at intimidation. Told by his right-hand man Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) that the people are objecting to sawdust in the bread, he huffs: 'What more do they want? It's from the finest lumber our mills can supply!'The comedy around the barber gets more labored. Maybe it's because much of it turns on the oppression of the Jews, though Chaplin here is trying to establish them as underdogs and rooting interest. It's here the film becomes tricky, not because he is mocking the unmockable but because the characters we meet, including the Barber, are fairly bland and the humor patchy. There is some very funny material here, but excessive bits too where people get klonked with pans or splattered with whitewash. At least Chaplin avoided setting a pie fight in a starving ghetto.The famous last scene is a great divider for many; in it Chaplin steps out of character to address us the audience about...what? The world needs more love and less hate, I guess. It's a philosophically strangled message, both anti-fascist and oddly pacifistic at a time when Hitler's legions were swallowing Europe, with Chaplin warning of 'machine men with machine minds' as if he was still making 'Modern Times' and punching the sky at times for lame effect.To me it's a crass way to end a good comedy, if perhaps necessary given the stakes involved. Hitler was real, and calling him out for what he was had real value in terms of rallying those called upon to defeat him. If it doesn't transcend time as well as it could, 'The Great Dictator' is still a fine comedy that delivers strong laughs and stronger historical resonances.",7,11,14,19 May 2013
Ed Wood," Hooray For Hollywood
","'Ed Wood' is about as good as Hollywood gets while perversely celebrating the worst Hollywood has ever offered. Forsaking grim reality for the Hollywood kind, it tells an involving story with a deft mix of humor and heart.Wood (Johnny Depp) is a struggling writer of bad dinner-theater drama who dreams of finding success on the big screen. One day he spots boyhood idol Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) inside a coffin he's testing out for a road-tour production of 'Dracula.' Lugosi, who has seen better days, takes up Ed's offer of a ride home. Soon, he is signed to be in Wood's movie about a cross-dresser. The movie predictably fails, but Wood and Lugosi become unlikely friends in the face of uncaring Hollywood.Wood at least can handle criticism, having practice: 'Worst film you ever saw? Well, my next one will be better!'There is a lot of room for pathos here, and even more if 'Ed Wood' stuck more closely to the facts. The film is a triumph precisely because it plays with the truth in such a genial, gonzo way. Wood in the film is not the dysfunctional alcoholic he was in life but a highly motivated young man bursting with energy. He has a gift for making friends, strange friends but good ones, like TV psychic Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), horror-movie MC Vampira (Lisa Marie), and out-of-work-and-out-of-the-closet actor Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray).Murray alone has so many funny lines in this film I could fill the rest of this review with them and be done. There are a lot of funny lines in this film, some buried so deep you have to watch it more than once. I just caught one, where the owner of the coffin shop responds to Lugosi's complaint ('Too constricting!') by earnestly saying no one has ever mentioned it before.Because the film is in black-and-white, it seems to go by people, which is unfortunate. Director Tim Burton and co-writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski present us with a very accessible story that includes clever shout-outs to bad-movie buffs, not just hilarious re- enactments of terrible scenes from Ed Wood's own movies but left-field moments where Ed is inspired to write lines that will become famous in his movies ('Pull the strings...wait a minute!')I'm not a fan of the cast, with the exception of Murray and Landau, but all do great work here. Depp's artificiality in the title performance initially put me off; then I realized he was playing off the conventions of the 1950s in a way that sets the tone for the whole movie. Sarah Jessica Parker is an actress I can't stand, but she's fantastic here as Wood's girlfriend Delores, the one person who sees how bad his movies are and can't stand it. Her facial reactions when listening to two of Wood's disciples sing his praises are priceless.Watching 'Ed Wood' may be tough for five minutes if you aren't used to black-and-white movies, but that will disappear once Landau makes his entrance. The film just builds from there; it's structurally as strong as it is quotable. The humor makes it enjoyable; the compassion makes it memorable. 'Ed Wood' is a rare movie that can be treasured as easily as it can be enjoyed.",9,1,1,9 December 2014
The Hustler," Born Losers
","A sports movie that focuses on the losing end of the deal, 'The Hustler' is spearheaded by a fine Paul Newman performance in the title role, a killer pool player who nevertheless is snakebit by his own fatal lack of character.Fast Eddie Felson knows the ins and outs of life with a pool stick, but he's a loser at heart, unable to express his deepest longings and find true fulfillment. The same might be said of the three other main characters who discover their own depth of loser-ness when they come into contact with him: pool-room maestro Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), who wastes his days at the Ames pool hall wearing the target Eddie aims at; the nasty manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), resenting the glory of others he lives off of; and dysfunctionally alcoholic Sarah (Piper Laurie), who has the misfortune of seeing Eddie as a ticket to love and a better life.Watching the four actors play off each other is more exciting than the clever shot making and massé action on the table, though it's all riveting stuff. Director Robert Rossen and his co-writer Sidney Carroll plant you in the seedy environs of back-alley pool halls and never let you breathe until it's all over.Rossen also maximizes the potential of his actors. Newman in his opening scenes sells you right away on both his talent and his hunger, but it's not until Gleason shows up some ten minutes in that the film pushes things to another level, the TV funnyman demonstrating awe-inspiring command in a deadly serious role. With him, we know quick that Fast Eddie has bitten off more than he can chew.'I didn't leave you much,' Eddie tells Fats after his opening break in their first game.'You left enough,' Fats answers, going on to show why.Newman was the best in his business when he had a solid script and good supporting actors to play off of. In the latter department, it's hard to imagine better than he gets here. Sure, Gleason is terrific, but even better are the other two. Scott is a grade-A SOB, full of himself in that inimitable Scott way, yet there is the mildest hint of discomfort around the edges, a sense of incompleteness that shows he is a loser, too.Laurie should be the weak link in this movie. I've read others here decry her method acting and sharpness of tone as negatives. But she reminds me of the journeyman pitcher who saves his best game for the World Series. Laurie was not a screen beauty, but she is quite striking here in the way she forms an empathetic center to the proceedings. You need her to reflect the hurt the others shrug off, and in her soulful eyes and quivering chin she makes you feel it to the bone without sacrificing subtlety or believability.What is the weak link? I don't think the film needed to be two hours, 15 minutes long, though I can't second guess any but two or three minutes of Dede Allen's cuts. Also, there are key scenes, one a final confrontation between Newman and Scott, the other between Newman and Laurie in a basement billiards room some minutes before, where the characters spell out what's going on in ways that feel too staged.Rossen may err on the side of telling too much rather than too little, but at least on a first viewing, you kind of want the additional information. I think that's where 'The Hustler' scores best: It hits hard on a first viewing, like any good sports movie should.'The Hustler' is everything a sports movie should be, with some poignant observations on the human condition - when it doesn't lean on them so hard. Most of all, it stands up to repeat viewings as a chance to watch remarkable screen actors practice their craft at its highest pitch. Not much different from the Ames pool hall that way.",8,0,0,20 July 2012
500 Days of Summer," Love And The Frustrated Architect
","Ah, office love. What could go wrong? A lot, it turns out, when one person's notion of a love to last a lifetime clashes with another's idea of the same situation as a like that will last a lunchtime.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a trained architect who has spent his last three-plus years awash in sentimentality, writing greeting cards as he pretends to be satisfied with his life. Enter Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a beautiful receptionist who takes an interest in him, one that blossoms when they discover a passion for some of the same things, like karaoke and theme music from the TV show 'Knight Rider.'As much a launching pad for a thousand debates as a twisted take on romantic comedy conventions, '(500) Days Of Summer' raises a question it never quite gets around to answering about the nature of true love. Still, its ambling quality offers up much pleasure.So does Deschanel, working her usual magic to less gentle affect than normal. It's impossible to dislike her, with her killer blues or the way her nose crinkles when she laughs. But you can't help feeling frustrated by her, a frustration that the film builds upon by presenting their relationship in a series of non-chronological episodes. Tom the frustrated architect is trying to make reality of his fantasy, but Summer isn't really going along. It's here that the film rubs against familiar romantic comedy conventions and carves out some unique emotional territory.'I need to know you aren't going to wake up in the morning and feel differently,' he tells her.'I can't give you that,' she replies. 'No one can.' Especially not her, though.In addition to the two leads, the film is strengthened by the supporting cast, especially Tom's two buddies, loyal office wingman MacKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and the more wistful, happily married Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler). Together they provide a hip Greek chorus to Tom's troubles.Gordon-Levitt is a fine, charismatic center for the film. He's part Ahab and part Cary Grant here, getting into a bar fight one moment, the next trying to cover his embarrassment when Summer challenges him to yell the word 'penis' in a public park as loud as he can. The more he reaches, the more ground he loses, but I think even female viewers will empathize with his concerns. It's funny that the actor himself has said he thinks his character doesn't merit the rooting interest; he may be the only person who thinks that after seeing the movie.The issue here is not one of gender differences, but different takes on life. I go back to him as a frustrated architect, trying to make the rules he understands work in a situation that doesn't allow for them. She's not one to be tied down by anyone else's plans.I realize I'm taking the same approach many others take in regard to this film, by focusing on the dramatic issues and ignoring the comedy. It's pretty funny in places, and well-observed, like when he agonizes over how she answers a simple question about how her weekend was. I love one scene early on when he meets her at a company function, and she tells him she had heard he wasn't showing up. 'You asked?' he blurts out, beaming triumphantly.The more elaborate comedy sequences don't always come off so well, especially when they become street dancing scenes or parodies of Swedish cinema. These are funny moments, but they don't connect to the main story and become distracting. Worst of all is a rather pat ending, though even that works well enough to let you out with a smile.What really makes '(500) Days Of Summer' work is the bracing way director Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber raise questions about the nature of love. They don't do as good a job of answering them, but do leave you thinking, success of a kind most rom-coms never attain.",7,1,1,1 September 2012
A Bridge Too Far," Terrific score, okay movie, lousy plan
","It is a film that might have benefited from a Jayson Blair rewrite: Just as Anthony Hopkins as Colonel Frost and his Red Devils are about to collapse against the might of two SS armored divisions, suddenly a rumble sounds across the Arnhem Bridge as the tanks of XXX Corps dash through. Out of the turret of the lead Sherman pops Tom Hanks as Capt. Miller, asking if Frostie needs a hand with these pesky Krauts.Of course, that's not how 'A Bridge Too Far' ends, and it's that historical accuracy that cost the film at the box office, that and 'Star Wars.' It's a film that hangs around in the public consciousness mostly because of its metaphorical title, and as the curtain-dropper for the argument whether Montgomery or Patton was the better commander. But its downbeat nature, and sometimes scattershot narrative, keeps one from embracing it too closely.That said, its one of the best war movies ever made for about an hour or so. Then the paratroops start to fight for the bridges and the fog of war slips in. Where is XXX Corps? Why is 1st Airbourne split apart? Is James Caan with the 101st or 82nd? What was the real story with the bridge at Nijmegen? These are individually small caveats, but they mount up.Sir Richard Attenborough is often an annoyingly pedantic director, but he's great here despite overselling the Colonel Blimp angle with the British high command. The opening scene, with the Dutch family quivering under a candlelit nimbus straight out of Vermeer as the news of German retreat fills them with an almost unbelieving hope, is sublime setup for all to follow, and the battle scenes around Arnhem have a realness to them that's both painful and rousing.The acting is hit and miss. The Brits have it decidedly better, with a store of great performances. I started out liking Edward Fox best as the plummy and affable General Horrocks, sort of a UK Patton without the killgore attitude. Then I took to Dirk Bogarde's General Browning, who is made the heavy probably because Monty was still alive when the film was being filmed, but carries a real human pathos beneath the smug bluster. Now I really like Hopkins' Frost, especially that wordless scene near the end when Maximillian Schell offers him a chocolate. A masterpiece of underacting from Hannibal the Cannibal, but he's that good all the way through.Who isn't so good is Hackman as the Polish general (strange he is made such a whiner in the script), Olivier's tentative Dutch doctor, and especially Liv Ullmann. Her prayer for the soldiers to have a few moments to die in peace comes across as icky and false, as does her near-tears delivery throughout. Ryan O'Neal seems the first general made entirely of wood, and is outshone by the no-name playing the other U.S. airborne commander.The second half of the film, drenched in blood and chaos, falls beneath the standard set at the beginning probably because it rubs our nose too much in all that went wrong. Historical accuracy without nimble storytelling can be off-putting, as is the case here. It's never a bad movie, and the river crossing at Nijmegen is crisp and intense, but like the Allied advance itself, ABTF kind of pulls up short without an adequate reason why.Incredible score, though. That was something I used to hum in my head for days after seeing it in my youth, and it really carries across the sense of joyous expectation that informed the Allies at the mission's outset. Pay attention to how its cleverly reconfigured during the drop and the Bailey Bridge building; it tells the story as well as anything on the screen.",6,1,3,13 September 2003
Zodiac," Here Comes The Roly-Poly Roly-Poly Man
","An unsolved case doesn't stop director David Fincher from constructing an absorbing and clever puzzle picture around the investigation into the identity of one of northern California's most notorious serial killers, the Zodiac.I don't know who Zodiac was, and I don't think Robert Graysmith does, either, despite the latter's attempt to pin the blame on one suspect. Reading 'Zodiac' the book was like listening to a potty uncle rant about FDR and Pearl Harbor. Though based on the book, the movie is quite different. Zodiac was known to have killed five people and injured two in 1968 and 1969. Most of the attacks are featured in the film, but despite Fincher's reputation for violent fare, his film is more interested in delivering context than bloodbaths, and the murders are depicted in a non-exploitative way.More time and energy is spent on the whirlpool of suspicion around the case, and how it comes to consume what might be called three other Zodiac victims: Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo).All three actors deliver fine performances, especially Ruffalo. His Toschi is a masterpiece of mellow intensity, as his focus narrows gradually to one suspect he refuses to rule out because of a handwriting sample. As the years go by, Toschi can't let go of Zodiac, even though he knows he should, his career suffering as a result.Downey's not nearly as subtle, but riveting all the same, his Avery a grandiloquent reporter who seems as addicted to the electricity around the case as he is to the various substances that keep him going. His scenes with Graysmith the Eagle Scout cartoonist give the film much of its emotional content, his cynicism ('What do you want out of this...This is good business for everyone but you') contrasting starkly with Graysmith's gentle naiveté.The texture of 'Zodiac' keeps me watching the film. It's like 'Mad Men' meets 'CSI' with a touch of 'Boogie Nights' thrown in. Even when you see the film and know where the shocks are, the creepy vibe Fincher sustains is riveting. Also powerful is the soundtrack. I'll never hear Donovan's 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' the same after how it plays over the opening scene, maybe one of the most intense openers since 'Jaws'.What doesn't keep me watching so much is the plot. Fincher does very well with what he has, to a point. But perhaps because he wants to tell the story in a factual-as-possible way, we get dealt a good deal of blind alleys and red herrings, especially with all of Zodiac's most notorious crimes out of the way less than 30 minutes in. To say 'Zodiac' doesn't need to be 160 minutes long isn't to deny Fincher makes it interesting. It's just that a half-hour less would have given what's left a stronger focus.Still, it's good to have a film that puts as much attention on look as 'Zodiac' does, and presents such a fine all-around cast in moments both suspenseful and funny. Anthony Edwards is still a wingman 20 years after 'Top Gun', this time as Toschi's less emotional partner William Armstrong. Brian Cox is hilariously over-the-top as celebrity attorney Melvin Belli, whom Zodiac apparently phones at one point.'He didn't leave a number,' Belli adds.'He's kind of crafty that way,' Armstrong replies.I watched 'Zodiac' the first time expecting Rob Zombie, and found something closer in spirit to Hitchcock. Pretty good Hitchcock at that. Consistently effective, often brilliant, 'Zodiac' is a psycho killer film that does less to scare you than to make you care.",7,0,1,17 October 2009
The Terminator," Lethally Efficient Entertainment Machine
","The police psychologist interviewing Kyle Reese says it just right at one point: 'I could make a career out of this guy!' Make that two careers, that of action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger and blockbuster filmmaker James Cameron.Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is a struggling waitress who has just been stood up for a date. Another date is en route; unfortunately for her it's the proverbial date from hell. He may look like a studly Austrian-American bodybuilder, but he's really a hyperalloy metal chassis wrapped in human tissue sent from the future to kill her before she can give birth to the hope of mankind's survival. Can Kyle (Michael Biehn) save her before Arnold does his job?The title character is really a thing of beauty. As Kyle explains: 'It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever! Until you are dead.'So what you have is 'Jaws' for a new decade. And there can be no doubt what that decade is. From the Walkman worn by Sarah's roommate to the trendy neon sportswear on display at the 'Technoir' nightclub, this is a 1980s movie through and through. And other than some clunky miniatures work set in the world Kyle came from, there's nothing wrong with that.The film has a lot more going for it. From start to stop this is, like 'Jaws,' a pop-action spectacular that never stops. Even the lengthy time-travel exposition scenes are suspenseful, because you are always alert for what might come through the door in the next second. Schwarzenegger makes his most lasting impression in an atypical bad- guy role, while Hamilton convinces with her ruffled beauty and sudden bursts of heroism. Biehn may do the best job, his face suggesting the anguish of his character's plight as well as his somewhat crazy hope for the future personified in Sarah.Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd fashioned a clever script with many brilliant touches that reward re-viewings. There's a scene between Kyle and Sarah that brings 'Terminator's' greatness into focus for me. He's telling her of this photograph he has been holding of her, and spent many terrible nights staring at, wondering what she was thinking. Later, Cameron has a scene where we get to see what Sarah was thinking, and it's a doozy!Then there's the police vehicle the Terminator rides around in trying to get his mark. The slogan on the side of the car reads: 'Dedicated To Serve.' Perfect!Is the Terminator supposed to be from THE future, or just 'one possible future'? Like Sarah says, a guy could go crazy thinking about this. Or at least have to wait until the next sequel. Hollywood can beat good ideas to death, but this film proves it will take a lot indeed to kill the Terminator.",9,7,8,22 July 2015
The Adventures of Tintin," A Fine Mess
","A kidnapping and a mutiny kick off the start of what becomes a dangerous and profitable journey for that most famous of Belgian boy detectives and his loyal fox terrier, Snowy.What you get in the end is minor Spielberg and minor Tintin. At least its heart is in the right place.As a drink-plagued captain with a bulbous nose tells his young friend: 'You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it.'Here's hoping they follow their own advice and come up with a long- awaited sequel!Revisiting the joys of childhood can be a perilous experience, and so it proves here, even if what's good outweighs what's bad. Director Steven Spielberg serves up an enjoyable lark of a cartoon adventure featuring that marvel of European comics, Tintin. If it lacks the cohesion and charm of Hergé's original, it keeps you in your seat till the end.Spielberg's enthusiasm and talent is on bright display. Too bad the film veers more in the direction of his old 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' than Tintin himself. This adventure involves three lost scrolls which together present a key to finding a great treasure. To get them, Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his new friend, Captain Haddock (a note-perfect Andy Serkis) will have to brave the wiles of the evil Sakharine (Daniel Craig), a 'sour-faced man with a sugary name.'I'm not a fan of motion-capture animation, even well-done animation such as this, which is presented with a nod to Hergé's 'clear-line' style. Colors are deliciously bright, with a strong sense of depth and detail in every frame. Yet the adjustment from print to film medium gives the original characters a whiff of the grotesque.After some opening credits that employ the clear-line style as well as a John Williams score and animation that seems a nod in the direction of Spielberg's classic beginning to 'Catch Me If You Can,' we are dropped quickly into our fast-moving story. Hergé himself pops up to say the first line of dialogue, seemingly blessing the enterprise with his presence, before Tintin finds himself in a case of mast distraction involving a search for a missing piece of a ship model.This opening section is so enjoyable you wish it could continue forever. It does last a while, all the way up to the point where Tintin and Haddock fly a seaplane in the desert wastes of Bagghar. There's a couple of welcome appearances from the Thom(p)sons (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), and some harrowing battles that allow the director to recycle old tricks in motion-capture form.Humor, too. Asked if he can fly a plane, Tintin replies: 'I interviewed a pilot once!' Haddock and Snowy later vie for a drop of the hard stuff in zero-G, a film highlight. After that, Indiana Jones takes over. The result is too crowded and chaotic by half. In a March 2015 review here, jc-osms describes his 'battle fatigue' with some of the setpiece action scenes, and I heartily concur. As dams burst and derricks clash, Hergé's gentler approach is missed.But 'The Adventures Of Tintin' did connect with audiences, especially outside Spielberg's native land. That provides motive for a long-promised sequel, hopefully involving second-unit director and co-producer Peter Jackson, who unlike Spielberg grew up reading Tintin and will perhaps invest a film with more of the original spirit, like he did with his Tolkien adaptations.As it is, I don't think the film stands well enough on its own to be remembered. But as a foundation stone, it could yet prove the start of something quite grand and fun for generations of Tintin fans yet unborn.",6,1,1,16 January 2017
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," ...But Once They Ruled The West!
","In the 1950s and 1960s, adventure movies were often Westerns. In later years, they were just as often buddy movies. 'Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid' is kind of where one became the other. It's lasted because it's so good, and also because it did some things that were unusual at the time but became very customary soon after.It's funny to read the comments from people knocking this film as a form of praising 'The Wild Bunch.' They were both westerns made in 1969, and the main characters in both are outlaws, but there's not much else they have in common other than Strother Martin and Latinos dying in slo-mo. Disparaging 'Butch Cassidy' because it's not 'Wild Bunch' is like attacking 'Star Wars' for not being 'Gone With The Wind.'I think 'Wild Bunch' is great, too, but in a much different way, tough, mean, and brutal. 'Butch Cassidy' is a sunny charmer, aimed squarely at the mainstream but with nice touches throughout that surprise you with their understated brilliance. The opening kinescope sequence; the sepia washing into the blue horizon as Butch and Sundance ride away from the card game; the still photograph section during the trip to New York, and especially the powerful last shot. There's nothing crazy or clever about the film, except when you realize it was designed to attract theater goers and did so despite taking so many chances within its conventional form.The music riles some. You can read them all here. 'Bacharach and David were totally wrong for this type of movie, what's with all those 'Dating Game' tunes, I fast-forward through the bicycle part, etc.' As Sundance would say of these criticisms: 'Bitch, bitch, bitch!' 'Butch Cassidy' works because it is anachronistic. It's not cinema verite, it's not trying to seem real for a second. The kinescope bit at the beginning is your clue, this is a western movie that's fully aware of its nature as a movie, and expects the same from the audience.That being said, I'd like to add that the bicycle sequence is my favorite part, because of the great song, the wordless interaction of Paul Newman and Katharine Ross, the way the sunlight dapples the lace curtains and the caramel locks of Etta's hair. It's also something else, too, the one moment of peace Butch gets and an oddly effective grace note in his otherwise miserable life. The look he gives the bull after crashing through the fence is not just cute but summarizes in one priceless instant Butch's approach to life's travails throughout the film.I used to think the chase part went on too long, but now I just sit back and enjoy the banter, and the gorgeous scenery. (I don't know where Conrad Hall shot this picture, but I have a hard time believing it was anywhere on Planet Earth.) Nothing else to complain about with this one, nothing.Obviously the most appealing aspect of this film are the two leads. Its a happy miracle that with all the big names being bandied around, we ended up with Newman and Robert Redford. Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen wouldn't have worked not because of inferior acting skills but inferior chemistry. Newman and Redford work so well with each other because they aren't competing but playing off each other. They are actors, and they have egos, but there's no stench of narcissism connected to this movie. That's why it's so enjoyable even through the slow stretches, and why it's a shame Newman and Redford only did one other movie together after this.George Roy Hill directed that movie, 'The Sting,' as well as this, and it's bewildering how little credit he seems to get for his work. Sure, he won an Oscar for 'The Sting,' and was nominated for one for this, but he's nearly forgotten today. Maybe it's because he was so versatile. Hill made 'Slap Shot' and 'The World Of Henry Orient;' two films as far apart as any in terms of demographic appeal. 'Butch Cassidy' is one of the most inventive, successful mainstream films ever made, and it's inventive and successful because Hill was the man with the plan behind it.One other thing: If you like this movie but don't have this on DVD, get it. If you don't have a DVD player, it's worth having for the 'Butch' DVD alone. It's a generously front-loaded item featuring gorgeous imaging, an informative commentary track, penetrating interviews with all the stars looking back, and most especially a documentary Hill narrated a year after the film came out which details the many challenges he confronted making this movie. Hill's final line in that documentary is a gem!",9,3,5,27 February 2004
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The Lighter Side Of Kingdom Come
","At Burpelson AFB, Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has decided the time has come to rid the world of Communist infiltration of the water supply, and sends his B-52s on a sneak attack against the Soviet Union. Months of drinking nothing but rainwater and grain alcohol, not to mention denying the women in his life his 'essence,' apparently went to his head.On one of the B-52s Ripper sends out, Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong (Slim Pickens) dons his cowboy hat and tells his men folks back home are counting on them to see this through: 'That goes for every last one of you, regardless of your race, your color, or your creed.'As Kong's plane approaches its target, his progress is observed worriedly in Washington D.C. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries diplomacy with a drunken Soviet premier, while Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) suggests going through with a full-scale attack.'I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolph Hitler,' President Muffley says.'Perhaps it might be better, Mr. President, if you were more concerned with the American people than with your image in the history books,' Turgidson replies.'Dr. Strangelove,' like the War Room where much of it is set, is a cold and imposing work of art, impressive though distancing. As a film of its time, 'Strangelove' is arguably Kubrick's most important work, a cultural crossroads between nihilism and pop where anything goes, and everything does at the end. All that, and it's pretty funny, too.Sellers plays three roles, though his antic comic energy is largely tamped down with two of the characters, Muffley and a RAF officer assigned to Ripper's base. His third character, the titular Dr. Strangelove, is a wonderful Germanic riff and the film's zaniest figure, though the farthest removed from events at hand. He's all for war, but whether that's because he's as mad as the others or trying to make the best of a bad situation is left unclear.I don't love 'Dr. Strangelove,' and there are things about it that grate, like the long inventories and protocols we see in the B-52. Scott has his great moments as the unwound Turgidson, but overacts shamelessly in others, which Scott blamed on his director. Keenan Wynn as a colonel named Bat Guano is stiff, too, but Sellers is very good and Pickens and Hayden even better, playing their roles straight with just the slightest sense of irony. (I think both knew they were in a comedy.)For a film about mutually assured destruction, there is a nice MAD magazine sensibility to this film, in the goofy names and outré situations, that fits the mood of the times and makes this an enjoyable black comedy. The jokes hit their targets, and points are made without deference to a particular ideology, as hawks like Turgidson and doves like Muffley both take fire. Kubrick made films liberals love, but he himself wasn't a true believer of any stripe, and it shows here.The best part of 'Strangelove' for me is the titles sequence, showing B-52s refueling in flight. Even after you get the joke behind it, there's still something to those remarkable images, an aerial ballet perfectly synchronized with the Pablo Ferro titles and a violin-heavy rendition of 'Try A Little Tenderness,' that strikes a chord deep inside.Maybe the chord struck by the rest of the film is not so in evidence anymore, but 'Dr. Strangelove' is still a good comedy and valid social commentary worth watching.",7,3,7,30 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Force Has Left The Building
","Does anyone ever watch this movie pure, without any preconceptions? Without seeing the earlier films; without having some degree of personal investment in the 'Star Wars' franchise of movies, books, videogames, and the rest; without having some knee-jerk reaction of contempt about those fuzzy Ewoks?I doubt it. I know I didn't, when 'Return Of The Jedi' was released in theaters in the spring of 1983. By then, I had watched 'Star Wars' on videocassette many times. I fantasized about how I wanted the story to end, who would end up with whom, what would become of the droids, and who got to kill Darth. I wondered if the filmmakers would forget about that guy Wedge that was flying Rebel craft in both the first two movies, figuring they would.I guess I left the theater feeling impressed and disappointed. Impressed because the film played with my expectations some, and managed to bring the story to a satisfactory close. Disappointed because it wasn't more than just satisfactory after all the imaginative aspirations I had invested in the film going in, that the ending felt too neat by half, and that I wouldn't be seeing any more of the characters who pulled me into the world of 'Star Wars' nearly six years before.Watching 'Return Of The Jedi' again reminds me of the title of the Robert Graves memoir, 'Goodbye To All That.' It's a sloppy piece of work when seen with adult eyes, horribly acted by performers who seemed to have lost interest in the franchise that made them stars. The story has none of the sweep of the first two installments, that sense of a band of outlaws riding through the night of space one step ahead of Imperial predators; it's all formal with lots of talking-head scenes. Director George Lucas seems to be carried away by his desire to connect every character through some familial bond, but his new role as an epic-ologist leaves little room for the entertainer I enjoyed. And yes, I STILL hate those Ewoks.Goofy dialogue, too: 'Soon I will be dead, and you with me.' I mean, rilly...But you know what? 'Return Of The Jedi' is not a bad film. It's actually pretty good. It is entertaining, throws all the fans their bones (like Wedge for me), wraps the series up on an up-note after the downer that was 'Empire Strikes Back,' and manages to have its share of funny moments. I love the scenes of Darth Vader hotfooting the construction process of the new Death Star with some of his subtle pricking: 'Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.' Leia in that slave outfit is a hottie highpoint, and the final attack on the Death Star is still an apex of special effects work.Even those Ewoks. Still worse than Stalin with herpes, don't get me wrong, but they do make a nice point about technological progress not being everything. If cute was so bad, why aren't more fans up in arms about the constant presence of R2-D2? It's funny to read that Lucas was stuck for ideas for the first half of the movie. Definitely it's underdeveloped, with various heroes popping up here and there, but the battle around the Sarlacc pit is a terrific thrill-fest, with a line by Lando ('Hey, wait, I thought you were blind!') that still kills me after more than 20 years. Jabba is the one cool new character in this film, a slimy blend of menace and humor. I kind of wanted the rest of the film to keep going like that, but Luke had to seek out his Jedi destiny and break up the team once again.The changes Lucas made to the later editions of the film seem improvements to me, taking out lousy music and bad special effects. Too bad he couldn't do anything about the acting.There's a lot of things that bother me about 'Return Of The Jedi,' but at least it answered the questions I had and sent the series out on a happy note. Now if only I could pretend he never went back to the well and did those prequels...",6,2,7,1 May 2005
MASH," Important, influential, just not that good
","'MASH' broke barriers and defied conventions when it was first released in 1970. It still does today.The pendulum has swung back a lot since 1970, and for that you still get a sense of the pioneering spirit with which the film was made. The overlapping dialogue. The non-linear, character-driven plot. The caustic humor. The attacks on religion (real religion, as the New York Times noted when the film came out, not false sanctimony but actual belief in God.)Yes, in those ways the film is as powerful now as it was when it was first released. But you see something else, something audiences didn't see in 1970, so blown away were they by the newness of it. That is the picture runs out of gas halfway through.You have a powerful beginning, that eerie montage with the strange song 'Suicide Is Painless' playing mournfully while doctors, nurses, and orderlies silently rush to relieve choppers of their human cargo. It's quietly effective, immediately giving you a sense of the 4077th MASH unit (looking much bigger and grimmer than it ever did in the TV series) and coming as close as the movie ever does to delivering an effective anti-war statement. The movie builds from there as we meet the various characters, beneficiaries of their actors' strong improvisational work. It feels like real-time eavesdropping on a community of actual human beings. Scenes like Major Burns and Hot Lips' transmitted tryst and Painless Pole's suicide attempt are not as funny as we are meant to think, but they are well shot, especially the Painless Pole bit, the best thing in the movie for pure entertainment. The way all the guys in the Swamp crack up when Painless tells them he's decided to kill himself may be the film's funniest moment.What happens next feels like a wrong turn. Hot Lips becomes the subject of a camp bet that exposes her to massive humiliation. Call it 'indecent' or 'politically incorrect,' it is just plain wrong, exposing the film's (and its director's) nasty streak toward women and alienating any concern you might have built up for the characters. When she and Burns were targeted before, you had a sense they had it coming because of her overbearing military approach and his blaming orderly Boone for killing a patient. This time, she's a spent force, no threat to anyone, and 'a damn good nurse,' as Trapper says, just doing her job as best she can despite her earlier bad experience. I'm struck dumb at the idea I'm supposed to be laughing when she rushes into Col. Blake's tent in shock and tears.The film never recovers. Instead, it veers wildly off course, away from the camp and into two radically pointless subplots, one involving a trip by Hawkeye and Trapper to Japan where they operate on a congressman's son and a sick infant (some sort of parallel there, though lost on me), the other a football game that apparently was director Robert Altman's comment on the folly of war, but to me just shows what happens when you allow your characters to veer off-script for so long you can't make it back to the ending as written. The game takes up too much time, throws in goofy circus music complete with slide whistles, and features the once iron-willed Hot Lips in the role of outlandishly enthusiastic cheerleader for all the people who tormented her so viciously for the duration of the film. Sally Kellerman's performance in the second half of the film is nothing like it was in the first half; it's embarrassingly, cartoonishly bad. Altman should have reined her in, but you get the feeling he was just rushing by then to get it all in the can before the studio figured out what he was up to and took his film away.Altman was just so much better making 'Nashville.' Obviously he learned a lot. It's amazing how pasty everyone in this film looks, particularly Donald Sutherland, who seems leprous. No wonder he tried to get Altman fired. So much of the supporting players faded away, and though they do good work, it's not a surprise. They all seem so squalid and ugly as Altman shoots them.It's interesting comparing the characters here to their counterparts in the TV series. For me, the TV characters are usually preferable. Robert Duvall mines zero comedy from Frank Burns, playing him very seriously in comparison to Larry Linville's more likeably miserable TV Burns. Roger Bowen had a great voice, but is nearly robotic as Blake, having none of McLean Stevenson's panache. What's worse than a pompous moralizing Hawkeye with Groucho affectations? How about that annoying whistle! Even Gary Burghoff, the one real holdover from film to series, plays a nastier Radar in the movie, meaner, tougher, less innocent.The whole film is mean, tough, less innocent. It gets points from me for that. Altman and his cast develop a magnificent mood right away. But they fail to do very much with it. 'MASH' is a great 45-minute-long movie that just goes on too long.",6,76,145,22 December 2003
Blades of Glory," Nuts On Ice
","If you have ever watched a men's figure-skating routine and wondered how someone could not feel challenged in their masculinity standing in front of thousands of people wearing what amounts to frilly leotards, then 'Blades Of Glory' was made for you.It's the story of Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) and Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell), rival figure skaters who get each other thrown out of men's singles competition. But nothing prevents them from returning as pairs skaters, skating with each other, in fact, as encouraged by Jimmy's former coach (Craig T. Nelson).Before you can say 'Brokeback Rink', it should be said that the homosexual context, with one glorious exception when Jimmy and Chazz perform their first routine, is somewhat minimized in favor of character-based comedy. Jimmy is a hopeless goodie-goodie, while Chazz is described by sports anchor Jim Lampley as 'an ice-devouring sex tornado' claiming carnal knowledge with both Michelle Kwan and Oksana Baiul and filling his programs with crotch grabs and thinly-disguised references to his untamed libido.'That was disgusting,' Jimmy tells Chazz after watching one such performance.'That, young man, is how babies are made,' Chazz purrs.As Will Ferrell comedies go, 'Blades Of Glory' isn't the borderline classic 'Anchorman' was, but it is smart, stylish, and funny all the way through, something that can not be said of many of his other, more highly touted flicks ('Old School', 'Talladega Nights'). Chazz may be a slight variation on the Neil Diamond character Ferrell played on 'Saturday Night Live', but as Ferrell develops him in what appear to be largely improvised scenes, Chazz emerges as a character of enough depth so as to sustain your interest over 90 minutes.Also helping is Heder carrying more than his share of the picture. 'Blades Of Glory' is really as much about Jimmy than about Chazz, and Heder gives his straight-man part enough unique idiocy to sustain and even enhance our enjoyment of 'Blades Of Glory' when Chazz is not around.Add to that Lampley and Scott Hamilton's game impersonations of themselves as skating commentators (Lampley: 'Chazz Michael Michael has dominated this audience like a stack of classic Euro-porn'); the goofy nemesis of rival pairs skaters Fairchild and Stranz Van Waldenberg (Amy Poehler and Will Arnett), who take to the ice dressed as Vanilla Ice rappers, Marilyn Monroe, and JFK; and over-the-top costumes and CGI effects, and you get a film that amuses on multiple levels all the way through.It's not sharp comedy, Will Ferrell plays too much for the cheap seats for that to ever be true, and there are only two gut-buster sequences to speak of (one being Chazz and Jimmy's first pairs performance, the other involving a drunken Chazz at a children's ice show). But you walk away from 'Blades Of Glory' with no thought other than wanting the DVD, thus making it a perfect escape on ice.",7,0,1,16 September 2007
Elf," Needed More Time In The Workshop
","Can a real Christmas movie get made in our cynical, charm-free 21st century? Probably not, if 'Elf' is the best stab at it so far.Up in the North Pole, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) discovers he isn't an elf at all, but a displaced human orphan who found his way into Santa's bag at the end of a busy Christmas and was then raised in Santa's workshop. He undertakes to reconnect with his biological father, Walter Hobbs (James Caan), a gruff Manhattan executive who has found his way on Santa's naughty list.Odd to step back in time and see Will Ferrell in this early starring role, playing so resolutely to PG sensibilities that he almost seems made of gingerbread. Unless you own Keebler stock or have an aversion to watching spaghetti being eaten with maple syrup, there's little here to offend you.Alas, 'Elf' is a film that thinks it's way cuter than it actually is. The idea of hearkening back to the stop-action TV Christmas shows I grew up with back in the 1970s is pleasant enough, and so is seeing NYC all dolled up for the holidays. But the story is a one-joke premise stretched well past its limit: Ferrell doing his man-child thing wearing an elf suit in the big city.One sequence demonstrates for me the limited nature of the film. In it, a children's book author played by another future big star, Peter Dinklage, comes to Caan's publishing house office to help concept an idea. Buddy spots him and immediately calls to him as a fellow elf, thus sparking a WWF rumble in the conference room.Sure, Dinklage is a little person and so the joke gets a bit of a laugh, but not anything to build deeper humor from. Why not, since we know Buddy is an overgrown kid, move past that and have the two get into a spirited disagreement about kiddie fiction, or what weather conditions are like on the North Pole? Instead, it's a short joke, some mayhem, and then cue the next scene.The film has a lot of go-nowhere moments like that, whether it's Buddy getting mistaken for a store employee at Gimbel's or Buddy's stop-motion pals on the North Pole. Caan deserves credit for playing his part with a deft lightness I wasn't expecting, and indeed most of the supporting work is fun. I especially enjoyed Bob Newhart as an especially sedate elf who looks after Buddy.There are also some funny bits for fans of Ferrell's wilder roles. Watching Buddy get into it with a department-store Santa (Artie Lange) who he accuses of being a fraud ('You sit on a throne of lies!') is good for a few laughs, even if it devolves into another rumble. Zooey Deschanel is sweet as Buddy's left-field romantic interest, and the ending actually manages to be rousing, shot as it was literally in the ashes of 9/11.But manipulation is kind of at the heart of this film, both when it's working and when it's not. For all his evident good taste and desire to please, director Jon Favreau seems at a loss when it comes to finding that next gear and giving 'Elf' a sense of wonder or of mission. It's pleasant and light, and often amusing, but still leaves you with the feeling of a misfit toy.",5,4,7,7 September 2016
Capote," The Mendacity Of Success
","Watching Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabit the singular character that was Truman Capote is a triumph of art, even if like with a lot of Hoffman, I find an underlying pain tends to dominate.'Capote' puts us in the Clutter household in Holcomb, Kansas, early one November morning in 1959. The family has been murdered for no clear reason, frightening the community. In New York City, the celebrated fiction writer Truman Capote reads of the crime and decides he must go there, in search of something he doesn't understand. This will eventually both produce his masterpiece and ruin him, not necessarily in that order.'It's the book I was always meant to write,' he tells high-society friends between languid puffs of his cigarette. 'What have you been up to?''Capote' the film may oversell the idea that the strain and emotional toll it took Capote to write 'In Cold Blood' caused him to descend into an alcoholic nullity. But Hoffman's finely-tuned performance does deliver. His voice and manner accurately summon the famous talk-show guest I remember. His eyes alternately suggest aloofness and pain, which is what makes for Capote's tragedy.It seems that Capote is a wonderful one for empathy as something to pull out of his writer's tool box, using it to form a bond with a leery investigator, Alvin Dewey, Jr. (Chris Cooper). But he has more trouble with empathy from the heart, which comes across especially when he meets one of the accused murderers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.).Smith and Capote immediately bond, as both are outsiders. But whereas Smith sees a friend, Capote sees a 'gold mine,' and one in need of mining before the state executioner steps in. Most of what director Bennett Miller and scripter Dan Futterman focus on in the second half is how much of this amounts to a devil's bargain, given the games Capote plays. Capote's lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood) and his childhood pal and researcher, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) provide the moral conscience from the sidelines.I found them to be wet blankets, especially Greenwood, who seems to be directed to communicate seething ambidirectional jealousy in every scene. For all the gambits and head games Capote played, he was also working on a story that would present Smith and his accomplice, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), in as decent a light as two wanton killers ever got.It feels at times like 'Capote' overeggs the morality lesson, and its sepulchral pace adds to the weight. But the visual tone is keenly done, especially Adam Kimmel's serene shots of Manitoba doubling for Kansas. Hoffman's Oscar win is well-earned, as he centers a number of powerful scenes showcasing his character at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum, schmoozing with the cognoscenti and trying to compose himself for a final farewell with Smith and Hickock.Did Capote really go completely silent in print after 'In Cold Blood' as the movie has it? Not if you count his 1980 best-selling collection, 'Music For Chameleons.' But Futterman's script tells a tale that resonates with the compromises writers make in practicing their craft, and Hoffman's searing humanity carries overtones of classical tragedy.'It's the hardest when someone has a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise,' he tells a Clutter friend by way of inveigling some useful information on the family. I have a feeling if Capote was still alive, he'd want use of that same line for Miller and Futterman.Whether it's fact or fiction, 'Capote' the film makes a riveting case study. I think Capote, who made a career out of obscuring the two forms, would have appreciated it.",7,1,1,17 February 2017
Barry Lyndon," See The Pretty Pictures
","The same things that make 'Barry Lyndon' interesting are what make it problematic. Long drawn-out scenes, lingering close-ups of stiff-faced actors, no rooting interest, a sudden personality shift (for the worse) in the lead character, and minute attention to period detail that seems director Stanley Kubrick's main reason for making this.Kubrick shoots his 18th-century costume drama, based on the William Makepeace Thackeray novel, with nods in the direction not of other filmmakers but rather period painters like Gainsborough and Hogarth. His frame, often moving but slightly in the course of a scene, captures moments of wondrous, intense beauty which seem to defy gravity in their not-quite static state, such as a woman in her bath or a man riding across a country path. For that, it is a unique film, one that transfixes many still.Still, it's a hard film to love, at least for me, starting with the main character, a young Irishman named Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) forced to flee his homeland after a duel who gets himself trapped in not one but two armies in the middle of the Seven Years' War. He escapes with a tricky gambler to Belgium where he meets Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) who falls in love with him and offers him an opportunity to rise in the highest realms of society, if only he can control his mendacity and bitter temper.Not a lot to love there, and some say it's either O'Neal's fault or Kubrick's for casting him. O'Neal is in typically wooden form, but this is one film that serves such an acting style, as the cast here converses less in dialogues than colloquies while barely moving so much as an eyebrow so as not to disturb Kubrick's delicately candlelit interiors. O'Neal surprises on occasion, especially late in the film when he delivers a crying scene as powerful as Russell Crowe's in 'Gladiator.' Once you get past his weak Irish accent, you may find him as good a man for the job here as anyone.There's also nice character work by Murray Melvin as the dour minister Mr. Runt, Leon Vitali as Lady Lyndon's son by a prior marriage, and Steven Berkoff, unrecognizable as the same man who menaced Eddie Murphy in 'Beverly Hills Cop', as a foppish dandy who trifles with Barry to his regret. Patrick Magee, often over-the-top on screen, nicely underplays his part of the gambler, Barry's tutor for a time. Kubrick's work with the child actors here showcases his exceptional, undercommented work in that department.This is one Kubrick film where there is little overacting. It's hard to overact when you can't even move. Kubrick is so bent on making with his pretty pictures that any droplets of vitality dribble off the screen. Audience identification, too, is hard, except I think some of the charm of this film is in how alien it is, presenting a world we think we know in an askew but somehow more real-seeming way than ever before.It's a triumph in 'Barry Lyndon' how fine and layered a visual scheme Kubrick is able to put on screen, and the story, especially in its first half when Barry is on the rise, has its compelling moments. A mordant narration by Michael Hordern that carries on for the length of the film seems intrusive at first but gradually turns out a rather sublime counterpoint to the action on screen. You come to need Hordern after a while. At a little over three hours, one feels like one is sitting through Barry's wastrel life in real time. Some may see that as an accomplishment, but you can only stare so long at a painting, even a masterpiece, before yawning sets in. It sets in more quickly here.",6,20,33,31 January 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Hardball World
","The great thing about Stanley Kubrick is that there is no mistaking a movie of his, however diverse they are from one another, as a movie by any other director.The problem with his films, oftentimes, is the same thing. Case in point: 'Full Metal Jacket'.'Full Metal Jacket' is the last movie Kubrick made that wasn't 'Eyes Wide Shut', one big reason I think it has such a strong cheering section on this board. Yes, it's intense, singular, and full of great quotes. It's also threadbare plot-wise and structurally unbalanced, full of one-dimensional performances and an overabundance of Kubrick's trademark shots.Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) is the central character, who we follow on his journey from Parris Island to Hue City, Vietnam, where during the Tet Offensive he becomes 'born-again hard' and acquires the much-storied quality known as 'the 1,000-yard stare.'I like this film, just not a lot. It's what I'd call a Kubrick problem picture much like his 'Barry Lyndon', a good movie of entirely different character that carries much of the same pedantic weight. I can't really get into 'Full Metal Jacket', neither Modine nor anyone else garners my sympathy or lasting interest, but its exciting and arresting in its refusal to play by the rules of a Vietnam war film. In 'The Deer Hunter' or 'Platoon', for example, the loss of innocence is a central theme. Here it's clear innocence was lost long before these guys arrived in 'Nam.For many people, it's the first 45 minutes that make this film great, the boot camp section with the bullying drill instructor Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey) and his rounding on fragile conscript Pvt. Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), a.k.a. Gomer Pyle. 'My orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps,' Hartmann explains at the outset, but his treatment of Pyle suggests a darker motive.'Full Metal Jacket' is a dark film all the way, and for me, the middle section is the part worth watching, in which we discover the war in Joker's eyes, in a series of short, pungent vignettes taken from Michael Herr's twisted and brilliant war memoir 'Dispatches': 'The dead have been covered with lime. The dead know only one thing - it is better to be alive.'Kubrick's camera ODs on carnage, emotional and physical, making us feel as deep in that world of excrement as poor Private Pyle. The unrelenting heaviness of tone brings one to the point where you expect a bigger payoff in the end than you actually get. Joker loses some comrades, gets his stare, and marches on to the tune of the Mickey Mouse Club, a scene that strives for more irony than it actually delivers.But Kubrick's movie is hard where it needs to be, aided much by the vicious comic stylings of Ermey, the subdued inventiveness of set designer Anton Furst (you try dressing England into a jungly war zone), and a terrific musical score of sardonically placed AM pop. It's a film worth having, but I think if Kubrick had bestowed his talent and vision on a couple of other projects in the last 20 years of his life, this movie wouldn't enjoy the somewhat bloated reputation it has today.",6,0,2,14 May 2008
Empire of the Sun," Painful Coming-of-Age Story
","A tough film about the cruelty of war and the death of innocence, 'Empire Of The Sun' seems dedicated to a single point, that Stephen Spielberg can make a serious film. Unfortunately, 'serious' is not the same as 'good.'It's December, 1941. Young Jamie Graham enjoys a life of privilege in western-controlled Shanghai, China. Those good times are about to end, thanks to the very same Japanese war machine Jamie idolizes. After the tanks roll in, he is separated from his parents and forced to fend for his own in a bleak landscape.Based on the real-life experiences of author J. G. Ballard, 'Empire Of The Sun' is a story about human suffering above all. Another review here, more positive, describes it as 'a small story told on a vast canvas,' and that captures it for me, too. It's a painterly film, with vivid imagery abounding. In that way, Spielberg often channels the director originally slated to make this, David Lean. That said, I found myself thoroughly alienated from the people and situations involved.Christian Bale is a stunning actor, able at 12 to deliver the kind of performance as Jamie that raps you on the head like a two-by-four. But he's a handful. Either he's talking a mile a minute or staring off into space in some kind of feral transport. He's also really obnoxious and unlikable. This is noticed by some of the other characters, too.'You're starting to get on my nerves,' says an American scrounger he runs into in Shanghai, Frank (Joe Pantoliano).'Very difficult boy,' is the verdict of Sgt. Nagata (MasatÃ´ Ibu), commander of the internment camp where Jamie is sent.My favorite is the response given by fellow prisoner Mrs. Victor (Miranda Richardson), when Jamie asks why the Japanese closed the schools: 'To punish their parents.'You have to find things to entertain you watching 'Empire Of The Sun,' since this is one time Spielberg won't do that for you. Like Jamie, or Jim as it becomes later, this is serious business all the way through, with starvation and disease gnawing at your elbows and hardly any hope in sight. Don't look for a bright light here; it just may be an atomic explosion.'First one side feeds you, the other side tries to get you killed, then it's all turned around,' Jim is told by his sometime buddy Basie (John Malkovich). 'It's all timing.'Malkovich is in great form, as movie-star ready as he ever looked on screen, and to solid effect, but I never got his purpose here. He doesn't bond with Jim, nor figure much in the outcome. No one does; Jim just wanders around until the scene shifts, after long languors, to something else. There's a desperate need here to trim, especially in the beginning and the end, but Spielberg and screenwriter Tom Stoppard are more concerned with Big Moment Cinema. We watch Jim serenade kamikaze pilots with a schoolboy chorale, and a minute later he's cheering their deaths at the top of his lungs, chanting 'P-51! Cadillac of the skies!' If Spielberg can't engage you, he'll overwhelm you trying.Spielberg has gone on to make other serious movies, and to my mind, done so more successfully even if his tendency to overpush remains. You see moments here that remind you how good he is at scene-setting, but if I said I cared for five straight minutes watching 'Empire Of The Sun,' I'd be lying.",3,4,9,16 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," If only they could have cloned Episode V
","What was it that set Darth Vader off to join the dark side of the force? This film suggests several possibilities: 1) The killing of his mother by Tusken Raiders caused him to channel John Wayne in 'The Searchers.' 2) Getting passed over during the N' Sync tryouts. 3) Discovering the woman of his dreams, upon closer inspection, is a carbonite mannequin. 4) Excess pressure on the back of his head from the so-'90s rattail he wears. 5) The shock of learning his father was evil guy Cole from 'Bachelor Party.'Hayden Christensen reminds me a lot of the character Robert Prescott played in 'Bachelor Party,' and that's not a good thing. Prescott's supposed to be comically over-the-top in his smugness and arrogance. As I understand the story of 'Attack Of The Clones,' young Anakin Skywalker is not comic relief. He is challenged by forces within him he can't control, and a sense of outrage at the way things are. He doesn't like being an apprentice, and he doesn't understand why his love for Princess (oops, now Senator) Amidala is not returned. It's a tough part, not Hamlet, but requires a more nuanced delivery than Christensen seems able to provide. Instead he sort of throws up a series of Tiger Beat poses. He sneers. He smirks. He seethes. Petulance is not a trait that makes one like a character. Before this film was over, I felt like yelling 'Hurry up and turn to the dark side so I can feel better about hating you!'Christensen is just one actor, but he is required to carry 'Attack of the Clones' in a way no actor has before in the 'Star Wars' series. So it's impossible to look past him and say something akin to 'Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?' Here Christensen is the play.Getting another actor would have improved things a little, but not too much. The acting in 'Attack of the Clones' is across-the-board abysmal. We lose the best in 'Phantom Menace,' Liam Neeson and (except for an embarrassingly clichéd death scene) Pernilla August. The remaining actors, Ewan MacGregor and especially Natalie Portman, slide into a state of near-catatonia. Portman's tight white lycra skinsuit means she's not only sexy but unencumbered by the ornate regalia that limited her projection in 'Phantom Menace.' So how come she's more wooden than ever? Obviously the direction was a problem. Lucas is legendarily weak at providing acting direction, but every one of the 'Star Wars' films until this had at least serviceable performances. This was one of the worst-acted films I have seen, and I saw 'Manos: Hands Of Fate.'The annoying trait Lucas has of connecting everything with everything else finally comes a cropper here, after threatening to do so in 'Phantom Menace.' The Imperial Stormtroopers, it turns out, are cloned knock-offs of the father of one Boba Fett, future bounty hunter supreme. Why him? And why is the guy moonlighting as an assassin and not telling his boss about his sideline activity? We discover Anakin's mother was sold to some moisture farmers on Tatoonie with a suspiciously familiar love of blue milk. So why does someone get the bright idea of stashing away Darth Vader's offspring with the Evil One's own stepbrother, on Darth's home planet? The problem was the first time Lucas threw a connection at us, in 'Empire Strikes Back,' it was undeniably cool, maybe the best thing in the series. Now he can't resist four or five more trips to the well with each new picture. Meanwhile, his galaxy is becoming more inbred than a kennel of pugs.The story is more a series of set pieces than any in the saga, with no solid 'through line' as screenwriters call it. Everyone runs off in different directions, and characters act with sudden bursts of motivation ascribed to strange feelings or catch-what-can. Christopher Lee's Count Dooku (or was that Duke Countoo) shows up as an interesting character that Lucas seems to want to make us wonder about, in a scene where he warns an imprisoned Obi-Wan about the influence of the Dark Side at the helm of the Republic and promises to help get him free. In that scene, he sounds like a renegade, even an ally. But then Dooku drops the charade and just sends Obi-Wan off to die. What was the point of having the scene in the first place? And also, if Dooku is a Jedi of such great skill, shouldn't he or someone in his great army have their sensors on when an armada of starships appears in the sky overhead?I like some things in the movie. As video wallpaper, it's kind of neat. The Stormtrooper arrival is fun, and Yoda's light saber battle. But the 'Star Wars' fan in me was bitterly disappointed.I'm sure Episode 3 will explain all these things away, and bring cohesion to Lucas' epic storyline. There's a better way for Lucas to have pulled that off: Stopping the series at 'Empire Strikes Back.' Am I the only one who wishes he did?",3,12,21,13 December 2003
The Godfather: Part II," Family Is Destiny
","The rise of a great man is set against the fall of his son in this powerful second installment of the 'Godfather' franchise. 'The Godfather Part II' is an eminently worthy successor to the classic first film, not nearly as accessible but entertaining and gripping in its own right.When we reconnect with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), he is firmly established as head of the Corleone crime family, now based in Lake Tahoe, Nevada and as lethal as ever. As Michael asserts control over his dominion, we occasionally go back in time to see his father Vito (Robert De Niro) finding his own path to criminal power.Michael speaks with more authority than honesty, we learn right away. 'Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy, but never think it applies to my family,' he says. The irony and tragedy of 'Godfather Part II' is how that hypocrisy is in fact never stronger than when it comes to Michael's family, which is all but destroyed by Michael's iron grip in service of evil ends.As sequels go, few are regarded as measuring up to the magnificence of 'Godfather Part II.' It's everything you expect from the first film, building on the final moments we saw there of Michael accepting his destiny as Mafia don and developing what that all means. Weighing in at over three hours, with lengthy flashbacks, it manages to hold your focus as director-co-writer Francis Ford Coppola plays cards you didn't know were in the deck. The pacing is deliberate, never ponderous.Like the first 'Godfather,' I found I enjoyed 'Part II' more with repeat viewings. Occasionally, as in an opening sequence set in Sicily that is revisited late in the movie, the drama gets a bit strained as the revenge theme is overplayed. Otherwise, the same subtlety that makes the first movie so great is in ample evidence here.Pacino is fantastic as the older, harder Michael. We don't quite root for him anymore, the way we did in the first film (another weakness of 'Part II' as I see it), but his command in the role is startling to witness. In the first movie, we saw him get bloody; this time the wounds are more internal as he plays his scenes with dead-eyed calm. 'I've already made my move,' he tells his brother Fredo (John Cazale), regarding his latest venture in Cuba with a suspect business partner named Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg).Cazale and Strasberg give the most memorable supporting performances (De Niro is more a co-lead even though he has less screen time than Pacino). Cazale is more of a hot mess than ever, entertainingly so until the stakes get too high. Strasberg is so low-key and charming you almost find yourself trusting him, until a key scene when his mask slips regarding a former associate named Moe Greene.Other performances, many by returnees from the first film, are accomplished if somewhat superfluous, particularly Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted brother Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's wife Kay, and Talia Shire as Michael's sister Connie. All of them have big moments, but are also left in the dust, somewhat by design as the theme of this film is Michael's loss of family ties.The Vito sections could have been deadly, but Coppola here is at his peak as a director, working from a section of the source novel by co-screenwriter Mario Puzo that was left off the first film. Taking his cues from Marlon Brando's original characterization, but lending his own unmistakable spin, De Niro plays Vito as coy, gentle, but highly dangerous.I love how Vito speaks almost entirely in his native Sicilian dialect, except at certain key moments when he uses English, depicted here as the language of power. He handles the problem of a don who wants to 'wet my beak' in Vito's business with cold calculation. It amounts to a power play not only against the don, but his buddies Clemenza and Tessio, who soon find themselves taking orders from their former underling.The film climaxes, as the first movie did, with a trio of interconnected sequences showing Michael's brutal effectiveness against his enemies. This time, however, there's no sense of triumph. Michael's revenge is too excessive, his 'enemies' too reduced or ambiguous to merit their ends in our eyes. That of course is the message of 'Godfather Part II.'Ultimately, 'Godfather Part II' is a masterful if muted examination of the price of family, how the ties that bind too often strangle. I don't think it packs the same punch as the first film, but hardly any film does. What it does well is bring the themes of the first film into sharper focus, so sharp they leave one feeling the scars.",8,1,3,30 May 2015
Fargo," Not A True Story...Just Very Depressing
","My lack of enjoyment for this much-beloved murder-comedy story may have something to do with the complete disconnect I get reading positive reviews posted here. They talk about its great humor, its strong sense of place, and the tough way it deals with bad things people really do.I watch this movie and just feel miserable. Not so much with the story on screen, but with 'Fargo's' enormous popularity.Minnesota car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) needs a lot of money. He decides on a plan to have his wife kidnapped so that her wealthy father will pay a million-dollar ransom. He offers the kidnappers, a pair of lowlife goons, $40,000 by pretending its half of a much lower ransom demand. All this comes apart when one of the goons gets trigger-happy on their way back from the wife-snatching, and Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets the call.People liken the humor in 'Fargo' to that of 'Goodfellas', except in 'Goodfellas' the people getting hurt and killed are guys who chose their 'kill-or-be-killed' line of work. Here, the kidnapping and later deaths are treated as a kind of goof, to be larked over by Marge and the other cops. Tragedy becomes a kind of cynical shorthand for audience merriment. For example, the kidnapped mother's poor son is only glimpsed teary-eyed in one scene after the crime so the directors can make the point of his lame musical interests - Whitesnake and accordions.The comedies of Joel and Ethan Coen often deal in broad caricature with a regional slant. 'Raising Arizona' used the Southwest United States, 'O Brother Where Art Thou' the Deep South; both to great effect. Yet here the depictions of the Northwestern people (Minnesota, not North Dakota, is the central setting; Dakotans may be grateful the Coens are not from there) border on the bovine. Big cow-faced people chew disgusting amounts of starches and red meat while talking in monosyllables about the weather and little else. 'Yah', 'Yah betcha', 'Doncha know' and so on permeate their dialogue until the point of their basic moronity is hammered home.One wonders if this is what makes the film comedic to so many: How could you care about people like this being murdered? They're barely alive now! I actually have less of a problem watching the murders - which to be fair to the Coens are not shot in an exploitative manner - than some of the casual dialogue scenes. The Coens as writers seem to enjoy creating one miserably painful conversation after another, using Larry David-style morbid embarrassment as its ultimate purpose, such as Marge's pointless meeting with an old high-school flame or Lundegaard getting the shaft from his too-nasty-to-be-true father-in-law.'This could work out real well for me and Jean and Scottie', Lundegaard tells the old man at one point, trying to sell him on a loan.'Jean and Scottie never have to worry,' the father-in-law growls.To say this film is morally repulsive and insulting to Minnesotans is not to deny its funny or interesting in places, once you make an effort to accept where its coming from. Watching the lowlife crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) argue about pancakes is kind of fun, and certain scenes work in a low-key way. The camera-work by Roger Deakins captures the grimness early American settlers talked so despondently about, where horizon lines are lost between whited-out land and sky.But this 98-minute film with seven murders feels more to me like the Donner Party running on real time. I know people enjoy this film, but man I don't know if I'd feel worse knowing why.",3,4,11,31 August 2009
The Aviator," Overstuffed Biopic Has Moments
","Can the outsized ambition of one of Hollywood's biggest legends smash Hollywood convention and make a picture for the ages? How about two legends, then? Star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese give it a ride, anyway.Howard Hughes inherited a lot of money and a fear of germs. Enjoying the first before the second tears him apart, he sets about making a movie that runs up seven-figure bills in 1927, then scraps it and remakes it for sound. 'Hell's Angels' turns out quite a hit, but Hughes has already moved on to other passions, building experimental planes and bedding Hollywood starlets. Sure it sounds like fun, but can he survive the crash landings?One of his lovers, Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), puts it this way: 'There's too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes. That's the trouble.'That's the trouble with 'The Aviator,' too. Taking a 20-year wedge of Hughes' life that incorporated everything from round-the-world flights to building a transcontinental airline, the movie struggles for a focus. In a five-minute span, we see Hughes design a monoplane, take Jean Harlow to a film premiere, and found a future mega-business, Hughes Aircraft. Scorsese is in a hurry to dazzle you with overlit sequences and fuzzy CGI.DiCaprio's ascension to the ranks of Hollywood's elite seems to have been the true focus of this film. He's fine, too, shedding his youthful image with an eerie approximation of Hughes' Texas drawl that is equal parts authority and anxiety. I just felt there were times when too much of the director's attention was on having Leo do an acting clinic and show the Oscar people something. He's best here working off other people, namely Alan Alda as a nasty senator named Brewster set on bringing Hughes down.Alda was nominated for an Oscar; Blanchett won one, either her first or Hepburn's fifth. It's a clenched, tinny performance, i. e. true to life and hard to take for more than a few minutes at a time. Fortunately, Kate/Cate makes an early exit, albeit not soon enough for me. What was the point of her character, anyway? If she's supposed to represent Hughes' truest object of desire, she doesn't have the air-speed velocity.The film does improve as it goes on, reversing the Hughes experience in life. The climax is a hearing held by Brewster in which both Alda and DiCaprio show how good this film might have been had it cut out the starlets and the flying montages and just gotten to the part where Hughes takes on the country and Pan-American Airways while his growing mental issues gnaw away at him. Watching Brewster switch from wolf to sheep as Hughes finds his footing is a joy.Even in this section, though, Scorsese spends long minutes on DiCaprio raging and writhing alone in the nude in order to let us know he's really suffering, not trusting his actor to show us the same thing in numerous small moments where the story is being advanced as well. The film is never boring, just muddled and straining at a significance it doesn't reach. Like one of Hughes' most famous creations, the giant airplane nicknamed the 'Spruce Goose' which 'The Aviator' climaxes with, what you have here is an overloaded creation that struggles to get in the air, and doesn't stay up long.",5,1,2,13 July 2016
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Madman At The Mike
","At the center of 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is a man sitting at a radio microphone, performing a balancing act of uncommon delicacy as he teeters on the edge of madness and delivers the biggest laughs in the movie.That would be Bruno Kirby playing an obtusely square Army lieutenant who thinks he is actually a comedy cut-up. At one point in the film he gets his chance, after the much more successful DJ Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) has been pulled off the air for reading censored copy. Watching Kirby's Hauk character bug out when the other people at Armed Forces Radio Saigon beg him not to go on with his lame array of bizarre puns and French accents kills me every time I see this film.'If it's not funny, why did I hear you laughing when you typed it?' Hauk demands of his aide.'I was thinking of something else.''Good Morning, Vietnam' is Williams' movie, of course, and most of the attention is on him. It's his best film for distilling the essence of Williams' comedy in cinematic form, basically giving him a mike and letting him rip. Williams' material isn't his sharpest, but it has the feeling of being off-the-cuff (probably was a lot of the time) and for the most part is very specific to the time and place of the film, Saigon in 1965.'Say, Mr. President, why did you name your daughter 'Lynda Byrd'?' 'If I named her 'Lynda Dog' that would be too cruel.'The film does best when it sticks to the radio station, with Hauk whining about not being saluted while Cronauer develops his on-air persona to the approval of the U.S. troops, then still in build-up mode. The scenes with the other radio guys (including Forest Whitaker, Robert Wuhl, Floyd Vivino, and Richard Portnow as the affable but deadly-dull jock Dan 'The Man' Levitan) have an energy and authenticity that sell the realistic comedy director Barry Levinson is after.But like too many 1980s films, 'Good Morning, Vietnam' suffers from an attempt to inject excitement and romance in crassly overt ways. So we have scenes where Cronauer woos a Vietnamese girl, befriends her brother, and tangles with the hard-case sergeant-major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh), whose homicidal hostility is neither developed nor well-explained. All this seems at the heart of the film's message, about the wrongness and destructiveness of war in general and this war in particular, yet the film doesn't need them.Proof of that comes in one scene where Cronauer, during a down moment, is pressed into delivering an impromptu stand-up for a bunch of troops about to ride into heavy battle. They laugh, and smile, and cheer, and in their nervous eyes and Williams' desperation to keep them entertained, you get about as strong an anti-war statement as you'd ever want to make.Too much of 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is burdened by the other stuff for me to recommend it too heartily. But if you're a Robin Williams fan - or even more, a Bruno Kirby fan - who hasn't seen this film, you really want to.",6,0,2,23 August 2010
The Killing Fields," The Ultimate Ugly American Movie
","Oh, this brings me back alright. It was the last days of 1984, and earnest college students like me had much to talk about. Wasn't it wonderful that Walter Mondale had chosen a strong woman like Geraldine Ferraro to be his running mate, and wouldn't the Democrats sweep the Northeast at least for that brave move? Does buying a Coke at the local convenience store signal support for the apartheid government in South Africa? Did anyone else see that amazing film about the human price of American involvement in Southeast Asia?It's nearly 20 years later, and I've managed to shake the ill effects of my youthful liberalism easily enough in most cases. This film, however, packs the kind of punch that isn't explained away by political trendiness.'The Killing Fields' is a great film that tries and succeeds in capturing much of the carnage and tragedy of Cambodia as the radicalized Khmer Rouge and the U.S.-backed regime of Lon Nol controlling Phnom Penh clash in a fight to the death to be/not be the next domino in the Communist rollover in Southeast Asia. By particularizing the conflict to that of the true-life relationship of two men, New York Times reporter Syndey Schanberg and his Cambodian apprentice and aide-de-camp, Dith Pran, the film forces a level of empathy that is at once uncomfortable and absorbing. It is possible to walk away from this film hating the manipulation, the America-bashing, the easy liberal guilt. But it's impossible to walk away from the human experience borne witness to before the movie's done, if one has any pretense of being human, and that's its great strength.Oh, it's polemical alright. We hear comments about how the Khmer Rouge's excesses were the direct result of Nixon's secret bombing campaign. (U.S. Counsel: 'After what the Khmer Rouge have been through, I don't think they'll be exactly affectionate toward Westerners.' Schanberg: 'Maybe we underestimated the anger $7 billion in bombing would unleash.') It makes its point, absolves Pol Pot and condemns Kissinger with the same broad brush, and it feels a bit jaded and hollow for that, but I don't know. Schanberg betrays the attitudes of a knee-jerk liberal, and I outgrew that, and maybe I feel superior for that, but Schanberg had AK-47s pointed at his head by 12-year-old brainwashed boys, and I didn't, so shut up already, know what I mean?The performances are incredible in their verisimilitude, particularly the leads. Sam Waterson burns with righteous anger as Schanberg, and I like his performance for what it is and how he creates that extra level of tension, but he's a butterfly compared to the condor that's Dr. Haing S. Ngor, one of the Academy's most obscure best supporting actor recipients (there was even a joke about it in an episode of 'The Simpsons') but someone who didn't just walk the walk. He relived his experience surviving a holocaust that was, per square mile, even more savage than the Holocaust itself. The fact he won a Best Supporting Actor award (Waterson instead was nominated for Best Actor, and lost to F. Murray Abraham for 'Amadeus') is one of those perversities of film history, given he carries more of the film than Waterson (who slinks to the background two-thirds of the way in) but also that he personalizes the story in a way that makes the incomprehensible immediate and involving.We lost Ngor to a senseless murder a few years ago, and have little left to explain what was going through his mind as he relived an experience that cost him his wife and child when he actually lived through it. Roland Joffe does a nice job in the DVD commentary, though, a commentary I put up there with P. T. Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' and William Peter Blatty's 'The Ninth Configuration' for being worth the price of the DVD and then some by itself. He recalls Ngor's reaction to one child actress whose hard face in enacting a scene convinced Ngor she wasn't just pretending to be Khmer Rouge, and Ngor's request that Joffe participate in one critical scene by muttering real torments Ngor suffered at the hands of the 'KR' as a way of enhancing his performance. At one point, trying to convince him to come aboard, Joffe said something about Ngor owing it to his country to bear witness to his story, and that of Dith Pran, and that did the trick, though Joffe seems to wonder if the same sort of manipulation Schanberg pulled on Pran wasn't going on here, too.It's a great movie because it doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths, because it never loses sight of the human dimension, and because it gave a pretense of understanding to one of the great human traumas after World War II. We never wallow in gore, but the cost of this war is always with us while we watch. The experience is both endurable and humiliating.I just wish they reshot that ending, with 'Imagine.' Joffe in his commentary even notes the lyrics are the sort of thing Pol Pot would have gone along with. It feels forced. Did Yoko Ono give her approval after they explained the scene her dead husband's song would appear in, or after they told her the first nasty execution scene would be shot while 'Band On The Run' issued forth from a soldier's radio?A great movie, of an awful moment in human history. If we have any chance of overcoming man's sorry past, it will be because movies like this one get made once in a while.",9,113,150,5 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Precious Beginning
","{This review is for the 178-minute theatrical version.}The first installment of Peter Jackson's famous fantasy trilogy, 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' may not give you the entire journey, but it's a pretty terrific engine-revving.Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is a hobbit whose quiet, pastoral life in an unregarded corner of Middle Earth changes abruptly when he is entrusted with a Ring of Power which carries with it the power of ultimate evil. To save Middle Earth, he must destroy the Ring by casting it into the fiery pit where it was made â€“ with or without the aid of various companions.'Even the smallest person can change the course of the future,' Frodo is told, and that is the message of 'Fellowship' in a nutshell. Hope is precious, no matter how frail the vessel.Nothing frail about 'Fellowship Of The Ring,' which is designed to impress and succeeds magnificently. The visual design is as splendid as it is varied, not just the lush New Zealand countryside that gets such deserved attention but the snowy mountaintops and grim, bone-laden mine shafts Frodo's party must traverse.Also impressive is the way Jackson and co-screenwriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens recapture the scope and grandeur of the first book in J. R. R. Tolkien's 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, while still delivering digestible cinematic entertainment. There are notable trims from the novel, and some twists, but the focus on Frodo's burden and his quest are if anything stronger than what Tolkien gives you, and makes for a ripping good yarn.The film is not a stand-alone entertainment; you need to see it in concert with the other two LOTR films, and that's not always to its advantage. Often you get lots of exposition regarding entities like 'Emyn Muil' or 'Argonath' which are obviously inserted to please the Tolkien faithful at risk of alienating outsiders like me. Other things annoy me, like a slow opening section introducing Frodo and his shire and Cate Blanchett's too sly and arch performance as an elven queen, but what's good is much, much better.Ian McKellen is splendid centering affairs as the mighty wizard Gandalf, while Wood and Sean Astin as his sidekick Sam showcase solid chemistry. Viggo Mortensen is the glue of the film, and a uniquely capable man of action as Strider. Orlando Bloom and Liv Tyler may be too pretty for me to like under normal circumstances, but here they manage to be load-bearing and brilliant.The score, the CGI, the ugly orcs; there's not a frame of this film that doesn't reflect thought and care. 'Fellowship' proves quite a trip, and the best news is there's much more to come. Frodo's pain is your gain.",8,1,1,28 July 2015
Grease," High School Was Never Like This...Too Bad
","A jukebox musical that redefined its genre and has lasted well beyond all expectations, 'Grease' is easy to dismiss on the basis of its simplistic story and characterizations that never rise above stereotypes. But it is also a galvanizing entertainment that works.Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) are high-school kids who meet at the beach one summer, not knowing that they will be seeing a lot more of each other next fall at Rydell High School. Danny runs with a tough crowd, while Sandy is a sweet and wholesome girl whose affections threaten to hold him down and make him look weak in front of his pals.'I got this image, right?' he tells her. Like many high schoolers, the characters in 'Grease' are all about their image, only few ever looked as good worrying about it as these guys do. The unlikely triumph that is 'Grease' is often ascribed to its soundtrack, which includes a number of recognizable hits still familiar nearly 40 years after the movie's release. But the film's place as a cult favorite is as attributable to two other, related things: tone and balance.Director Randal Kleiser took a fairly rough and raunchy Broadway musical and reinvented it as a paean for Hollywood nostalgia. An opening cartoon, primitively animated, effectively sets up the rest of the film as a gaudy, goofy take on growing up, with plenty of sex jokes that somehow manage to maintain an overarching aura of innocence. Serious topics are introduced, but in a way that never drags down the light tone.The musical numbers are the highlights, mostly ensemble pieces that include two of its biggest hits, the opening 'Summer Nights' and the closing 'You're The One That I Want,' both staged with the kind of lavish choreography and tight camera-work that rewards multiple viewings. Kleiser favors long mid-shots with sharp cuts, which works because there's a lot going on and the syncopation is what sells it.Yet for the purposes of emotional investment, the two best numbers, surprisingly, are solo ballads: Travolta's 'Sandy' and 'There Are Worse Things I Can Do,' sung by the school's make-out queen, Rizzo (Stockard Channing), both of which achieve an intimacy that gives 'Grease' a kind of power. I get a lump in my throat whenever I watch a hot dog jump into a bun in the former number that has nothing to do with the double entendre involved.The dialogue, by producer Allan Carr and Bronte Woodard, offers pretty silly banter in place of story for the most part, yet like the songs it keeps the energy moving and the energy light. 'Grease' is motion, like the Frankie Valli song says, and that's what you get.Even the dead-end scenes that clog the film's middle, regarding a pep rally for a big football game we never see and Danny's varsity sports tryouts only referenced briefly again at the end, don't tax your viewing patience. You enjoy the changes of pace while the scenery is being moved offstage for the next big number. 'Grease' captures a sense of being young, with its heady enthusiasm and eagerness to please. It's a shame the formula seems so difficult to repeat.",8,1,1,31 May 2016
Cold Mountain," Tough Climb
","Some films are like sprints. 'Cold Mountain' is a marathon. It pushes and pulls you a long way from point A to point Z, forcing you to bear witness to a lot of cruelty, devastation, and wildly variant plot lines, all in a sincere albeit misplaced effort to faithfully reproduce the Charles Frazier novel on screen. Oppressive, yes, but at least it's never dull.Inman (Jude Law) is a Confederate soldier, badly wounded, who decides to give up the Civil War and return to his North Carolina home, Cold Mountain. 'Come back to me is my request' writes his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), and he obliges. While Inman meets a deviant preacher, a young war widow, and a kindly goatwoman en route, Ada keeps the house her father owned with the help of a female Huckleberry Finn named Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger).'Cold Mountain' runs nearly two and a half hours, and you feel every minute of it. Because the film compresses everything so much, trying to fit all of Frazier's vision in, it never quite breathes in the way of another longer war epic such as 'Lawrence Of Arabia' (an unfairly great film, yes, but those are the stakes 'Cold Mountain' director Anthony Minghella plays for). While Ruby is running Ada through various farm chores, for example, she's also providing pertinent details on her character and motivation through talky exposition. Everyone in the film seems to have a monologue to deliver, crammed one after the other like air traffic over O'Hare.The other thing that makes 'Cold Mountain' tough is its capacity for sadness. Sure bad things happen to good people, but seldom in so concentrated a form. This is also largely faithful to the book, but it should be pointed out that the novel uses its opportunity to better space out the 'war is hell' theme. Also, certain characters suffer a worse fate in the movie than the novel (i.e. the Swanger family, the girl in the canoe, the war widow if you catch the extra scene on DVD). Usually films lighten up on a novel's content precisely because hard scenes one against the other alienate an audience, but Minghella trusts his audience to bear with him.I didn't exactly, but I did admire 'Cold Mountain' for what it was, a stage for uniformly splendid acting and camera-work. Law nicely develops an understated tone as Inman, man of few words, while Kidman makes the romantic parts sing louder than they otherwise would and plays a good straight man to Zellweger, who gets most of the best lines and delivers them with gusto. The only great performance I saw was Brendan Gleeson as Stobrod, who really faked me out with his accent and with Zellweger co-stars in the best sequence in the film, when they meet again after a long separation.'He's so full of manure,' Ruby says. 'We could stick 'em in the dirt and grow another just like 'em.'Minghella works in some great shots that keep you watching even as they don't lead anywhere, aided by an authentic-feeling musical score that feels at times almost devastating. In this way, 'Cold Mountain' pushes in your face the fact the Civil War was fought by real people, not just played out in the quaint pages of a history book.I was reminded, with that music and Ada's voice-over letter readings, of Ken Burns' famous 'Civil War' documentary. While not as inspiring or commanding as that, 'Cold Mountain' retains the same aesthetic, and on that level succeeds more often than it does not. I just question anyone's ability to come to this movie without doing some serious homework, and when you do the homework, it may prove more interesting to you than the film itself.",6,0,1,5 April 2007
North by Northwest," Smoke and mirrors, without apologies
","The one famous gaffe people point out in this film is when a small boy can be seen plugging his ears just before Eva Marie Saint brings her café conversation with Cary Grant to a sudden end. Another gaffe, just as egregious and apparent but not nearly as commented on, is when Cary and Eva, clutching an incriminating statute, are rock-climbing around a quartet of famous presidential heads until a bad guy suddenly appears and leaps upon him. Whereupon the surprised, backward-falling Cary has the presence of mind to hand the statute to Eva, who takes his from him whilst in mid-scream. Do me a favor and read that last sentence again. What director today would allow such a scene past the editing room?But it just doesn't matter: IMDB voters at this writing have placed the 44-year-old `North By Northwest' ahead of all but 18 movies ever made, including 14 which have nothing to do with Frodo Baggins or Darth Vader. That's pretty damn impressive. What the hell were they thinking? The only Hitchcock movie they rate higher is 'Rear Window;' I can think of at least seven or eight Hitchcocks I'd rank over 'North By Northwest.' [None of them are 'Rear Window.']The truth is this film is so popular because it is so good. Not great, but very, very good, in a way that anticipates a lot of the direction of mass entertainment to come and thus speaks to people in a way `Vertigo' or `Strangers On A Train' do not. People talk about how forward thinking 'Psycho' is, and it is, but more directors took note of the just-as-clever-but-more-mainstream approach of 'North By Northwest.' The last four decade have been chock full of flicks serving up suspense, sex, changing locales, and plot twists that play with viewers' expectations, all the while keeping the laughs coming. It's not like 'North By Northwest' invented this formula, but it perfected and distilled it into an essence that is imitated, with varying success, to this day.Cary Grant plays slick adman Roger Thornhill, who gets mistaken for a fugitive named Kaplan and finds himself on the run from a slew of bad guys, led by James Mason at his smug and oily peak as Vandamme. Martin Landau makes his first memorable appearance as Mason's nastiest henchman Leonard (1959 was good to him, as 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' premiered that year as well), suspicious, ruthless, and probably gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it was 1959 and that was a little daring.Daring also is Eva Marie Saint's Eve Kendall, a woman who uses sex, as Thornhill puts it, 'the way some people use a flyswatter.' Her repartee with Thornhill shows just how erotic two people just talking to each other can be. It also provides further evidence Hitchcock's writers didn't go out on many dates. (Kendall: 'I'm a big girl.' Thornhill: 'Yeah, and in all the right places.' And she KISSES him for it!)The film does chug slowly at the outset, building suspense but also bugging you a bit as the plot gears grind while Thornhill is being pushed through his early paces, right until his moment at the UN. About the time we find ourselves with Thornhill in the cornfield, the picture starts to pick up a serious head of steam, and never loses it all the way to the final, famous tunnel shot. Actually, I like the penultimate scene between Grant and Saint, an elegant and witty way of resolving that most tried-and-true device, the cliffhanger.As with most of Hitchcock's 50s fare, elegance is behind much of what makes this movie so great. `North By Northwest' manifests an elegance in dress, decor, language, music, and lighting that represents the best of its era while giving the picture a timeless character all the same. Hitchcock's camera movements are very subtle yet brilliant, as during Mason's entrance and Grant's hide-and-seek game around the train. Everyone has perfect hair, lounges about in gowns and jackets, and you never think it should be otherwise.Grant isn't my favorite actor, but he's smooth enough for the central role when he's not doing that bad Foster Brooks impression behind the wheel of the car. [I docked the movie one point just for that.] His best scene may be at the auction, though he projects real fear in the cornfield. Saint is simply splendid, nailing every line as she walks a tightrope and plays her character's motives close to her décolletage. Hitchcock seemed to lose his ability to direct female actors, and not merely bask in them, with the advent of color, but Saint is one blonde bombshell that gives us a sense of brains and personality behind her mystery.There's logic gaps in this movie, and bad process shots, but it's an amazing ride all the same, more amazing because it's done with smoke and mirrors and without apologies. You ask the questions and figure out the loopholes only after you walk away, because the movie doesn't let you up much while you are watching it. Hitchcock made other, more challenging movies that attested to his rare vision as an artist, but this is maybe his purest exercise in the craft of good filmmaking. That's why `North By Northwest' has remained so high in people's estimations. Whatever the errors, it's hard not feeling good about that.",8,118,177,10 November 2003
Coriolanus," Anger's His Meat
","As a first-time director, Ralph Fiennes gives a good account of himself in a challenging production, but is under-served by two sources from whom one expects better: Fiennes the actor and William Shakespeare the scenarist.Caius Martius (Fiennes) is a proud Roman, rather overmuch in the minds of many of his compatriots. In the midst of a war Martius is doing much to win, a conspiracy takes root to displace him of his high station in Roman society. Despite counsel of his mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) and patrician friend Menenius (Brian Cox), Martius' knack for blowing up at the wrong time proves his Achilles heel.'Coriolanus' is one of Shakespeare's more interesting problem plays, articulating an elitist attitude that seems designed to annoy inhabitants of future democracies. Either you accept Martius's contempt for the people he serves, or you relish his undeserved downfall as the result of excess pride. Fiennes doesn't try to recast the story in a more populist way, even as he repositions the story in a modern setting and employs the use of hand-held cameras and TV studio sets. A CNN-style network, Fidelis, provides the same role as messengers do in the original play. Combat takes place using automatic weapons in a style reminiscent of a 'Call Of Duty' video game.This all works better than I expected, grounding the play in a way it needs and doesn't have in the writing. Nice work is offered by the supporting players, particularly Cox, who plays Menenius as sage and crafty with a nicely understated delivery. My favorite line in this film is a simple one he delivers over his shoulder late in the film: 'I'll undertake it.'What is wrong with the film is mainly the fact Shakespeare wasn't at his best here spinning the story. There is a rather simple plot, more a character piece where the character in question performs two 180s in two acts. Fiennes and writer John Logan employ some useful trims, but they still leave alone some rare clams from the Bard, like Volumnia's raging cry: 'Anger's my meat!' and Martius's 'O, a kiss/Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge.'Playing Martius, Fiennes ranges between two poles, those of soft-voiced underplaying, such as at his entrance; and hammy, spittle-flecked ranting, like when he has his showdown with the people of Rome. This makes empathy for an already difficult character much harder. 'Bolder, but not so subtle,' is how his enemy Aufidius (Gerard Butler) describes him, and boy, is he not kidding. After a while it kinda grates.The Shakespearean language doesn't add or subtract from the overall experience. It never quite feels natural. If you know what is happening, and Fiennes the director does a good job making it clear, you can glom onto what the various characters are saying easily enough, and enjoy the way they play with their deliveries. It's a good cast, even if no one puts forward their best work. Redgrave's entirely too gentle in the role of fire-eating Volumnia, but she has her moments.It's that kind of film, really. I ended up watching it again for this review in installments because even at just over two hours I found it a bit much to absorb in one sitting. I suggest you do the same; it's a decent time-passer if not something to leave an impression.",5,2,5,9 July 2014
Doctor Zhivago," Very Pretty But A Little Long
","'Doctor Zhivago' is a fascinating touchstone of what made 1960s cinema uniquely great, without ever being great itself. It is unique, though.Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) pursues a happy life as a physician and poet in Czarist Moscow, until fate, war, and revolution drive him from home and family to a woman who turns out to be the love of his life, Lara (Julie Christie). But will those same forces contrive to tear them apart?Directed by David Lean in such grand style as to invite unfair comparisons to his previous masterpiece, 'Lawrence Of Arabia', 'Doctor Zhivago' is about as sumptuous as film-making gets. Whether its the hooded mink on Geraldine Chaplin's Tonya as she gets off a train or the baroque velvet finery of a fancy restaurant where Lara finds herself courted by the consummate political insider Kamarovsky (Rod Steiger), one is continually bombarded with the fact no expense was spared bringing this vision of the Boris Pasternak novel to the screen.The story covers a lot of ground in more than three hours, and though it does drag at times, Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt nourish their production with much of the same visual and verbal eloquence that nourished 'Lawrence'. Maurice Jarre's eerie score, centered by the haunting 'Lara's Theme', works at times like musical heroin, jolting you back into the movie just as your attention starts to drift. Cinematographer Freddie Young uses windows and mirrors as a constant visual reference, as if to underscore the movie's concern with the shallowness of appearances, but at least through the first two hours, what grabs you about 'Zhivago' is its great sense of depth.But 'sense of depth' doesn't exactly equal depth itself, especially when you get to the final hour, and the romance that is supposed to be the fulcrum of the film. Sharif on a DVD commentary suggests 'Zhivago' is a woman's movie the way 'Lawrence' is more for men. It's a sage thought, as one notices the rational side is pushed aside, along with Zhivago's wife and family, in favor of an all-or-nothing romance with Lara. Neither Bolt nor Christie do much to justify this gambit, however, and we are left with more images of windows for Sharif to stare out of, looking poetic.As Sharif himself plays Zhivago as a gentle, uncomplicated soul, there is ample room for the supporting players to outshine the leads. Steiger sinks his teeth in the film's meatiest part, a cagey, brutal man whose passion for Lara is at least as interesting as that of Zhivago's, his lips forming a cruel scowl but his eyes suggesting a secret hurt.'Don't fool yourself into thinking this was rape', he tells Lara after one brutal encounter. 'That would flatter us both.' Ouch!Chaplin is also very good as the other woman in Zhivago's mess of a life, winning your affection with her unguarded smile and uncomplicated love for Yuri, which he is just good enough to know he doesn't deserve. Klaus Kinski pops up winningly at one point as a forced laborer, sneering as only he can. There is great cast work by the smallest players.If you want a film that bears witness to the cruelty of the Communist Revolution, and being caught up in social forces beyond one's control, 'Doctor Zhivago' is all that and more. As a romantic saga it feels hollow at its center, and stretched out too far for all but the most patient of viewers. Yet what do I know? I'm just a guy.",6,19,26,13 September 2007
The Shining," Writer's Block Turns Terminal
","Writing is hard business, and there's a great scene in 'The Shining' which shows it all. If you've seen it, you know it. Jack Torrance is typing away in this terribly non-conducive writing space, huge and imposing. Just then his wife Wendy walks in, asking him if he'd like some sandwiches, maybe let her read what he's written.Jack Nicholson is a marvel in this moment, letting her have it with both barrels for 'breaking my concentration.' Whether she hears him typing, or doesn't hear him typing, she's not to walk in and disturb him, he tells her, not putting it nearly so pleasantly.As a writer, I laugh with recognition. But it's kind of a problem moment because it kills dead any concern I have for Jack Torrance 30 minutes into the movie. He's a bully as well as a deadbeat, who has cooped up his wife and kid in a snowbound old hotel with bad mojo leaking out the vents and then springs some heavy 'tude on the old woman for simply trying to offer him friendly company.'The Shining' is the horror film by Stanley Kubrick, a mega-talented but overrated auteur of several very well regarded films, five of which are in the IMDb Top 100 list (and a sixth, 'Full Metal Jacket,' hovers just outside.) 'The Shining' is the fifth most popular, but next to 'A Clockwork Orange' my favorite, and probably the most enjoyable.It's a very disturbing and violent film in parts, more a mood piece than a gore fest but with some scary moments. Kubrick never had much of a sense of humor, and the film sleds quickly over a lot of territory author Stephen King explored more compellingly in his great novel. Certainly Jack Nicholson, who seems to be doing some kind of Bruce Dern imitation here, doesn't really give us a character so much as a caricature, and of the three principal actors, his manages to be both the weakest and most memorable.But 'The Shining' is a great film once you realize Kubrick's vision here is to create an absorbing entertainment. For all his faults, he was a master of control, and demonstrates that here with shots that have become indelibly etched in cinematic history, like little Danny riding his Big Wheel across carpeted corners, Jack taking an axe to a door, and Wendy cowering in a corner screaming. It's a bitter story, and while I miss at times the humane angle King brought to the book, it's probably good that a movie version was helmed by someone as legendarily hard-hearted and unsentimental as Kubrick.I think 'The Simpsons' have raised this film much higher in general estimation with their many nods and parodies in 'The Shining's' direction. But 'The Shining' speaks well of its creator Kubrick on its own terms, kind of as his goofball effort amid heavier-themed pictures and kind of as his demonstration of supreme technical craft. There's a great documentary attached to the DVD of this film which shows Kubrick setting up scenes, coaching little Danny Lloyd as Danny, and arguing with Shelley Duvall, who for my money gives the best performance as the only relatively normal denizen of the Overlook Hotel. It's really something to watch Kubrick so in his element.'The Shining' is all about Kubrick in his element, isolated, cold, squeezing the viewer's field of perception from every angle. It's a memorable ride from its opening fish-eyed tracking shot of a river road to the final black-and-white image, and a masterpiece that is impossible not to love on its own, unembraceable terms.",8,2,4,14 December 2004
American Beauty," Ultimate Suburban Freak-Out Flick
","The clock is ticking on the life of hapless advertising journalist Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) as events in his screwed-up upper-middle-class neighborhood conspire to deprive him of his wife, his daughter, his job, and ultimately his life. Yet such is his situation that he finds peace and even humor in his predicament, and so will many a viewer in what is one of the 1990s' greatest films.'American Beauty' is one of those rare films where everything works. The acting, especially Spacey but also Annette Bening, Mena Suvari, and Peter Gallagher, all perform incredible balancing acts between drama and comedy while keeping their feet planted in a sense of reality. Sam Mendes' direction manages to find new visual ideas at every steps, compelling ones that lift our appreciation of the story; while Alan Ball's arresting script sets a fast pace that never lets up even as it pauses to 'look closer' into the minds of its characters. Set direction, camera-work (by the late, great Conrad Hall), editing on a mission from God, a terrific vintage score, this is one film that never feels tired.Definitely a surreal film, with its dream sequences and outrageous moments of character and action, 'American Beauty' still feels completely representative of its time and place, Clinton-era blue-state America. Carolyn lives the life of a Martha-Stewart wannabe, trapped in a myth of human perfection, while Lester is a dehumanized corporate drone, living a life of profitability but zero richness. The dialogue is brilliant, not only because it averages one quotable line every minute but because it is grounded in the kind of casual conversation we hear around us every day.It's also a very bold film, from its opening montage of Lester's morning ritual to its proposition that the one healthy protagonist in the whole film is a drug-dealing former mental patient. Spacey's lust for teenage Angela Hayes (Suvari) is presented in such a way to not only invite sympathy but even a sense of triumph when he seems about to achieve his dream. (By the way, I'm convinced people miss a comic highlight by focusing on Suvari's exquisite body and missing her eyes, which flash and roll at all the right moments like a nymphoid Carol Burnett channeling Joan Crawford.)I don't like everything about this movie. The reveal of Col. Fits' big secret is too pat and typically knee-jerk Hollywood, and Lester's handling of his job situation feels excessive even within the rubbery confines of this film. But these are creative disagreements that further one's thinking about the movie, and appreciating it more. You can find yourself at odds with 'American Beauty' in its philosophy, and its conclusions about the state of our society, but still relish its vibrancy and conviction of purpose.Finally, there's a nice metaphysical construct to this movie, a post-Christian transcendentalism that may be as empty as a doughnut hole but offers some interesting food for thought about the unexamined life. You may not think a bag fluttering in a breeze represents true beauty, but you can enjoy how it calls into question our materialistic, self-centered way of life. It works in large part because it's never pressed too hard, never connected to the story points in a concrete way, but it works.I agree with other posters here who say 'American Beauty' is one Oscar winner for Best Picture that only gains stature with the passing years. Everyone should see it once. Most of those that do will want to see it again.",9,0,1,6 June 2004
Apocalypse Now," The Jungle Is Giving The Orders Now
","'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most exciting classics in American film, a singular work of art offering both benediction and indictment. Benediction for those who found themselves suffering and dying through the futility that was the Vietnam War. Indictment of those like me who watch its vividly horrifying yet magnetic depiction of man's inhumanity to man and come away asking: 'Yes, but what about that poor puppy?'Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is an airborne intelligence officer holed up in a Saigon hotel room, his life a wreck as he awaits an order, any order, to rouse him from his soul-killing lethargy. One comes in the form of a mission to track down renegade Special Forces Col. Kurtz, no longer taking orders from the Pentagon as he prosecutes his own war.'Terminate the colonel's command, sir?''Terminate with extreme prejudice.'Everyone talks about the killer beginning, with good reason. Everything from Willard's opening remarks about still being in Saigon to a scene aboard a sampan 90 minutes later is simply remarkable. Every time I watch it, I'm blown away again by some element of it. The great dialogue ('Charging a guy for murder in this place was like giving out speeding tickets at the Indy 500'), the hellacious acting (Sheen is so outstanding in his opening breakdown scene that he hardly needs to twitch a face muscle for the rest of the film and we're still with him all the way), the editing (the attack on the Vietnamese village is so intense it makes the accompanying Wagner music sound like the Archies.)None of the three elements mentioned above won an Oscar. Editor Walter Murch did win one for the sound of the film, but otherwise this was something of a Waterloo for director Francis Ford Coppola, at least at the time. It took a while for people to recognize 'Apocalypse Now' for the masterpiece it is.Two reasons for that, I think. One is that the film is incredibly dense and ambitious, really requiring video and cable for its greatness to sink in, as was the case with 'The Right Stuff'. The other is an ending that, while good by itself, is a marked letdown from all that came before. When we meet Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), it's clear he's not equal to the build-up. No one can be, but he decidedly isn't. After hearing him billed as the one American officer successfully outfighting the Viet Cong, we meet instead an overweight pundit who holds court in a kind of Woodstock with weaponry, reading high poetry and declaiming the use of napalm as if Brando hijacked his character with his own legendary leftism.But there are too many majestic sequences to carp about that very long. Coppola and co-screenwriter John Milius set up the helicopter attack in such a way we root for the Americans though we are painfully aware that the village they are attacking contains women and children. Robert Duvall, sensational as an Air Cav commander named Kilgore, calmly sips coffee as ack-ack flies around his copter cabin. The first time you see it, you're amazed at his cool. Then you realize why shouldn't he be cool? He's holding all the chips. The real heroes are the ones shooting at him.The sampan scene (that introduces the puppy) shows the Americans in an even worse light, yet the anxiety of the Navy personnel in the sequence is understandable. Nothing is glorified, but the liberal anti-war message is more subtle than we are used to seeing from Hollywood, and thus more effective.Everything about 'Apocalypse Now' is more effective. So what if it didn't win any Oscars, or hold its singular greatness all the way up to the end? What it gives us is more than enough. It's probably too much for many people even today. But that's what's so great about it.",9,0,1,18 August 2007
Being John Malkovich," Never Give A Puppeteer An Even Break
","Craig Schwartz is a puppeteer who toils in obscurity, adapting medieval love stories for street-corner performances in the hope of making it big like that Christo of puppet masters, Derek Mantini. Then he stumbles onto a portal that leads him inside the mind of a real-life puppet, none other than the famous screen actor John Malkovich.Oh, and he and his wife fall in love with the same woman, who is carrying a baby that's also the only portal to future earthly existence for a dirty old man and his aging friends.'Being John Malkovich' is a high-concept comedy alright. Like Craig the puppeteer, it wants to raise issues in its askew way. I see it as a meditation on selfishness, puppetry being a metaphor for one imposing their will upon another. Craig selfishly throws his wife over for another woman, his wife throws him over for the same woman, and that woman is more selfish than the two put together. Of course, none of them get what they want. Meanwhile, the selfishness of the old man and his friends is homicidal since it involves the obliteration of another human being mind and soul.Whatever the big idea, it is well-developed with help from a cast that includes John Cusack, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich, who plays himself as well as Cusack's Craig Schwartz when the latter is inside of him. Malkovich doing Cusack doing Malkovich is some fine acting.While too high-concept to reach for its laughs, 'Being John Malkovich' doesn't forget to be funny. The Mertin-Flemmer early-80s orientation film is as great a send-up of bad acting as 'Inside Amber Waves' was in 'Boogie Nights.' In addition to Malkovich, who is complemented warmly on his performance as 'that retard,' Charlie Sheen and Sean Penn have goofy cameos as themselves; Penn admitting he worries his own move into puppetry will be seen as slavish imitation of Malkovich. Brad Pitt throws in a single facial expression that slays me.It's also amusing how the film plays up the ordinariness of Malkovich's life. He doesn't do much more then eat toast and order periwinkle bathmats, yet as Craig sells people tickets inside Malkovich's mind his customers emerge invariably joyous at the significance they've experienced. When Craig completes his hostile takeover of Malkovich, he decides to remake the actor as a puppeteer, and thus we are treated to a People magazine cover of a brooding Malkovich and the headline: 'I will act no more forever.' Somehow I don't think that would happen in reality, but of course playing with reality is where the fun is here.Cameron Diaz is a real find in this film, as she plays the frowsy wife in a style akin to Louise Lasser's Mary Hartman. While Diaz's roles often play off her incredible beauty alone, 'Being John Malkovich' is the one time she is called upon to really act, and she pulls it off, so much so it distracts from the fact her character is the most underwritten in the movie, more of a gag than anything else.The resolution of the story feels contrived as well, not as amusing or coherent as the rest of the film, though the ending itself is solid. Seeing Craig's state in the end is a nice comment on his chosen career, though he doesn't do as badly as poor John.One great thing about this movie is Orson Bean as the old man. Here's a guy I haven't seen in 20 years, and that was in a Q-Tip commercial, yet here he plays a central role and gets most of the laughs in a pretty funny film. 'I don't want to be your link to history, boy, I want to feel my naked thighs next to Floris.' 'Being John Malkovich' is a big film about big ideas, but it draws some of its biggest light from the smallest stars.",8,1,2,24 May 2005
Cross of Iron," Bloody Sam's Last Hurrah
","By the time he got around to directing a World War II movie, Sam Peckinpah was a shell of his old self. Yet even in his advanced state of alcoholism and mental collapse, Peckinpah could find moments of glory, especially when the subject rallied his attention. Such is 'Cross Of Iron'.It's the spring of 1943, and in a southwestern section of Russia near the Black Sea a platoon of German soldiers struggle to stay alive. Leading them is Steiner (James Coburn), a crusty but sympathetic non-com who quickly finds himself on the bad side of his new commander, the incompetent, glory-seeking Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell).'Men like Steiner are our last hope, and in that sense he is truly a most dangerous man,' observes another, more reasonable officer (David Warner).He certainly kills well. Working for both Hitler and Peckinpah, you expect nothing less.'Cross Of Iron''s agenda isn't clear. 'Anti-war', yes, but with Germans as a nominal rooting interest and Russians storming the front, it's also a world where warfare is the only reality. There's a lot of idle banter about the ugliness of conflict, uttered by men we can only assume were happier about it when they were winning. We see a lot of death while Steiner looks on in stoic agony, a representation of the Peckinpah ideal in all its stark nihilism. He even turns his back on a tryst with the gorgeous Senta Berger to return to the front, this despite the pains Peckinpah and Coburn take to register Steiner's distaste for the cause of the Third Reich.Peckinpah has a way of turning weaknesses into strengths on screen. The film is so sordid in its life-is-cheap aesthetic it becomes more visceral even as it becomes less coherent. Peckinpah embraces the ugliness of his surroundings here, of bad teeth and bodies pancaked under tank treads, until the very pointlessness of the visuals becomes a kind of point that resonates long after film's end.In his Hen's Tooth DVD commentary, Stephen Prince makes many sharp observations. One regards the blurred, muddy look of the film, realized by cinematographer John Coquillon. Coquillon and Peckinpah worked together on the similarly grim 'Straw Dogs', and Prince notes how well Coquillion brought out the chilly, expressionist side of Peckinpah just as Lucien Ballard captured something more lyrical.Two sequences show Peckinpah's still-sharp editing prowess. The opening scene features Steiner and his platoon taking out a Soviet mortar position with quick cuts that seem to catch moments of death on the off beat; later we see similar dispatch in a stealth attack on a bridge.Except in these smaller moments, though, the film never gels. Often the film goes too far in search of random profundities. One hospital-based scene cross-cuts between convalescents attacking a bowl of salad and Steiner dancing with a nurse. Warner and James Mason are wasted as a kind of Greek chorus bemoaning the tide of war between slugs of Mosel. A Russian prisoner is gunned down while Steiner cries out in overplayed anguish. I don't even want to begin trying to explain a sequence where Steiner's squad face a group of female Russian soldiers; it simply doesn't work on any level and runs ten long minutes.Enough does work to keep you watching. Coburn is a rough diamond, maintaining a fragile cool that gives this film a solid center. Its look is hard and surprisingly authentic considering its legendary budget problems. 'Cross Of Iron' isn't great, sometimes it's not even good; but its sordid sensibility and ruthless aesthetic resonate with the power of its one-of-a-kind director.",6,7,12,17 November 2009
Ocean's Eleven," So Much Fun It Ought To Be A Crime
","Watching George Clooney and Brad Pitt battle it out for smoothest cat in Vegas shouldn't be this much fun to watch. 'Ocean's Eleven' is a smart, breezy caper comedy that glides along on enough wit and cool, jazzy energy to make you enjoy getting snookered by the pretty boys.Clooney is Danny Ocean, a con man who just lost four years and his wife to a term of confinement in the New Jersey penal system. Now he wants to get even, with interest. He plans a scam involving himself and ten confederates, including right-hand man Rusty (Pitt), targeting three of Las Vegas's richest casinos in a single evening for a nine-figure haul.Asked why, Danny shrugs and says it's because 'it's never been tried.' Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack would say otherwise, but this 'Ocean's' is cooler, funnier, and more suspenseful than theirs. Normally I'd rather watch Frank and Dino than George and Brad, but the latter two made the better film.Ted Griffin's script and Steven Soderbergh's direction do a lot to sell you on a clever if shaky plot. When Danny asks his wife Tess (Julia Roberts) why she dumped him, she responds with a line that keys in on the way the picture operates: 'You've met too many people like you.' Danny, Rusty, and their merry criminal associates seem to communicate mostly through nods and one-liners, not wasting time explaining things.'I owe you for that thing with the guy in the place,' is how one of the Eleven, money man Rueben (Elliott Gould), puts it to Danny. This in-the-know argot works for everyone else, too.A lot of movies try for the big ensemble cast, but this one finds the right balance between star power and character performances. My favorites: Andy Garcia as a standout bad guy and Carl Reiner as the oldest, most sympathetic member of the Eleven.While there's not a lot of depth, you hardly mind when what you see and hear gleams and purrs the way 'Ocean's Eleven' does. 'Eleven' is both a puzzle picture and a love letter to Vegas at the turn of the 21st century, with its dizzying array of gaudy monstrosities and gyrating dancing girls. The music is a frothy stew of Elvis, Perry Como, Berlin, and Debussy. It pulls you in, and keeps you from thinking too hard until long after the credits roll.Yet I find 'Ocean's Eleven' more enjoyable on re-viewings. I say this despite the plot holes in the way things work out. Plot holes or not, 'Ocean's Eleven' puts care into how it works. You get to actually enjoying how the film sets up its misdirection plays and basks in the impossible smoothness of the lead characters. And the dialogue is hilarious.**SPOILERS BELOW***** SPOILERS Everyone has noted one thing I missed, the stacks of flyers that magically appear inside the vault. But about Danny spending all that time being 'beaten up' in that guarded room, especially when the lights go out? Aren't there too many witnesses to trace Danny and the others to the scam? And what about the mini-scam played on young Linus (Matt Damon), when he is told Danny has been taken out of the operation, only to be surprised when Danny greets him inside an elevator? Why pull that on your youngest, least experienced team member? Well, it was a fun reveal, and I guess that was the point. SPOILERS END ***",8,0,1,22 March 2012
Duck You Sucker," Confused And Overlong, But Memorable
","James Coburn is John, an Irish revolutionary in exile in Mexico whose specialty is blowing things up with nitro and dynamite. Rod Steiger is Juan, a local bandito who wants to break into a bank, and thinks John will help.'You make the holes with the holy water, and then I walk in and do the dirty work,' Juan pleads. 'John and Juan...Can't you understand it? That is...destiny.' And so it is, though Juan has no idea what kind of destiny. For John, the fire of revolution still burns, and its flame is a deadly thing, for Juan and those he loves.'Duck You Sucker' is the last western of Sergio Leone's career, though far different in content and tone than his other westerns set north of the Rio Grande. Politics takes center stage this time, specifically the radical kind that inflamed both Mexico in the 1910s and European movie houses when this film came out.What is Leone trying to say? Sir Christopher Frayling, the Leone scholar who provides a DVD commentary for 'Duck', describes its agenda as anti-revolutionary, that people who get caught up in it only get themselves hurt to no good end. But the film is rife with scenes of capitalist oppression, from an opening stagecoach ride where Juan endures the company of some snooty bluebloods to a long-pan scene where right-wing troops massacre civilians in concrete ditches, My-Lai style.The movie does open with some pointed words from Chairman Mao, declaring 'The Revolution is an act of violence', followed by a scene of Juan urinating on some ants. The camera seems to hold on one staggering ant, and you can argue Juan is that ant. But Leone seems to answer the bigger question, is revolution worth it, with an emphatic yes. The cause of overthrowing Mexico's ruling caste seems entirely righteous as depicted in 'Duck You Sucker', and Juan is no gentle Gandhi type going in. So I'd take Frayling with a grain of salt.As a revolutionary, however, Leone is not satisfying. 'Duck You Sucker' struggles with a very long and convoluted story. There are two notable story jumps that are never explained, one in which Juan fools John into blowing up a church containing John's employer, and another when a sudden setback puts Juan in need of rescue. A rough and ugly tone predominates, as if Leone was trying to show the other makers of spaghetti westerns he could be as raunchy as them. Finally, the minor undertone of humor goes out of the movie halfway through, leaving you with a lot of unrelievedly heavy scenes.Fortunately, there's a saving grace found throughout 'Duck You Sucker': The majestic Ennio Morricone score. It's one of his best ever, even more inspiring than the music for 'The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly'. Surprising light and graceful in places, it suggests an influence from Burt Bacharach's work on 'Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid' just as Leone's tonal direction takes cues from another 1969 western, 'The Wild Bunch'. The melodies and themes work wonders at giving 'Duck You Sucker' a richness and ballast the script seems to labor toward.Steiger and Coburn make a terrific team despite a pair of dodgy accents. Leone gives us so many close-ups you begin to feel like Coburn's dentist, but the actors merit the focus by rising to each other's level, Steiger showing us as much charm as Coburn and Coburn as much intensity as Steiger. Alas, unlike the other Leone westerns before this, there is precious little in the way of interesting supporting work except for Antoine Saint-John as a Mexican SS officer.Frayling calls 'Duck You Sucker' a sign of Leone 'growing up', but I see it more as the great director bending down to the level of filmmakers around him. Still, in its lead performances, in its dazzling musical score, and in moments of isolated wit and grandeur that pop up especially in the first half, you get a feeling for Leone's uniqueness.",6,2,7,10 July 2009
Tropic Thunder," Well, I Laughed Anyway
","Ben Stiller as an actor annoys me. He's too one-note and often shallow, making a poor fit for the derivative concept movies Ben Stiller the scenarist devises. Fortunately, Ben Stiller the director seems to have enough talent and good comic sense to bail the other Bens out sometimes.Such a film is 'Tropic Thunder.'Tugg Speedman (Stiller) leads a cast of coddled stars acting in a Vietnam war movie who have run their production a month behind schedule...in just the first week. Director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), facing dismissal, opts to plant his actors directly in the jungle, away from their handlers and expensive distractions. Everything, of course, goes wrong.What exactly goes wrong is something I don't want to spoil, except to say that viewers of 'Galaxy Quest' and 'Three Amigos' will recognize the situation. It's neither original or freshly delivered, though the fate of the frantic Cockburn did surprise me. As is the case with other Stiller films I've seen, we get a plot that exists only as a minimal structure for laugh lines and sight gags. Judd Apatow and Adam McKay make the same kind of comedies, but they seem to go for more audience engagement and character development than I see Stiller doing.Stiller's strength is that he's a funny guy, and, in this movie, does a solid job developing an ensemble feel with his fellow actors. Robert Downey Jr. got most of the notice (and an Oscar nomination) as Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus who opts to play an African- American with the help of a special operation that amounts to blackface. He's so committed to his part he vows not to break character 'until the DVD commentary.'Actually, in reality Downey didn't even do that until the commentary was nearly over. He presents a very funny character who talks entirely with lines lifted from a 1970s Blaxploitation thriller, like 'Ain't nothing but a thang.' He takes offense when someone says 'you people' to him, meaning of course annoying method actors.'What do you mean, YOU PEOPLE!' he demands, eyes glaring.'What do YOU mean, you people!' asks the one actor on set who really is black, Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson).The back and forth between these guys is really well delivered, with Jack Black getting in some fine lines and reaction shots as the strung- out star of a series of obnoxious fatty 'Klumps'-style comedies. There are some first-rate bits throughout, particularly an over-the-top opening action scene where the ample bloodletting is played for laughs and a discussion between Kirk and Tugg about the merits of not going 'full retard' when assaying a mentally challenged role.This, like Kirk's racial identity issues, could have stuck Stiller in Mel Gibson Land but instead comes off as successful satire. It's really the dog-eared story and Stiller's struggle to justify his star billing with a Derek Zoolander retread that make 'Tropic Thunder' just a fun time-waster rather than an absurdist comedy to remember. You will laugh, but you may not remember a thing about this film a week later.",6,1,1,12 February 2013
Quantum of Solace," Bond Goes Pulp
","It's not the best of the Bonds, but 'Quantum Of Solace' does manage to disprove one common knock against the series: If you've seen one Bond, you've seen them all.A gritty, tense little pulp-fiction thriller as far removed from a Roger Moore globe-jaunt as you can get, 'Quantum' pits Bond (Daniel Craig) against his boss, his country, and even the CIA as he battles the people who killed his lover at the end of the last film. With its gray morality, fast cutting, and noir-ish shadings, it borrows less from other Bonds ('License To Kill' being the closest) than it does from the Jason Bourne series.'When one is young, it seems very easy to distinguish between right and wrong,' Bond is told. 'But when you get older, it gets much more difficult.'Okay, so we're all a little older, and so you can accept Bond movies getting more complicated. It's easy enough with Craig in command. His signature jaw clench is getting to be as familiar and welcome to me as Connery's smirk and Moore's eyebrow. And since he's continuing the plot line from 'Casino Royale', he has to be a hard-charging type. In fact he's even less humorous than he was there, dwelling as he does on past hurts, reinventing Bond as a man who feels.The problem with 'Quantum' the movie is it doesn't have much going for it beyond Craig's deepening of the role. Like a pulp-fiction tale, the emphasis is on action and speed, and the plot - something to do with resource-theft in Bolivia - is just an excuse for betrayals and hidden-body reveals. It's endearing to see a Bond movie that tries to be interesting for something other than being a Bond movie, but the quick-cutting approach works against any clear narrative flow.Olga Kurylenko does stand out as the main Bond girl, a woman on a mission like Bond's so there's little time for dalliances. Giancarlo Giannini has another plum turn as Mathis, 007's suspicious ally. Judi Dench grows more into the role of M now that she has a sincere actor in Craig to play off of and isn't pushing the girl-power vibe so hard. It's hard imagining this film playing as well without her as Bond's disapproving yet sympathetic mother-superior.Craig's electricity and economy with dialogue and motion ('There's something horribly efficient about you...') reminds me of Steve McQueen, and 'Quantum' works best when it leans on that. But if Craig is truly to grow in the part - hoping Bond will return someday as there is some question about it now - he may need to ease up a bit, and offer occasional displays of humor and charm.All work and no play could make Jim a dull boy. But it beats the other extreme any day.",6,0,11,14 June 2010
Man on the Moon," Wrestling With Andy
","There's a scene in this biopic about the life and career of comedian Andy Kaufman when Kaufman and his creative partner Bob Zmuda tell their agent, George Shapiro, about a prank they played years ago, hiring actors to run around a zoo yelling that a lion had gotten loose, and watching everyone run.I can see the headline now: '12 Killed In Zoo Stampede Panic; Comedy Frontiers Extended.'Andy Kaufman was a very brilliant comedian. He wasn't always funny, and sometimes was just weird for the sake of it, but he had an amazing talent that created something remarkable in show business, a way of reaching the audience for something more than laughter or sympathy. He wanted complete engagement, a shared sense of purpose, even hatred or childlike awe. Laughs were fine, too, but he really just wanted to break down the wall between entertainer and audience, and give people something to take home and think about.A lot of people took Andy home and thought about him. That's what was so great about him. You really don't need 'Man On The Moon' for that. Yes, Jim Carrey captures him in all his guises, such as Latka the star of the TV sitcom 'Taxi' and Tony Clifton the bitter lounge singer. You have to marvel at Carrey's talent. Even the way he uses his eyes is spot-on Andy. But everything worthwhile Carrey does in this movie you can see Kaufman himself do in documentaries and video clips.The main problem with 'Man On The Moon' is the story around Carrey, which is a very pedestrian retelling of the various outrageous public moments in Kaufman's career. Carrey as Kaufman introduces the film in a funny bit, telling us they played around with the facts for dramatic purposes and that he doesn't approve. But there's nothing organic or involving in the rejiggered storyline, just a lot of set pieces people already know from seeing the two Kaufman documentaries that did the rounds at Comedy Central back in the day.There's a 'Taxi' montage where we see many of the real cast members playing alongside Carrey, but it doesn't say anything about what Kaufman did on the show to connect with a mass audience for the only time in his career. The assumption going in is everyone watching this film knows we are watching a master at work. Throughout the film, there's a sense of homage being paid which grates.'You're insane, but you might also be brilliant,' his aspiring manager George Shapiro tells him in one of many groaner lines.Danny DeVito plays Shapiro. DeVito worked with the real Kaufman, and I guess that's a plus, but I don't get why a guy so well-known for playing 'Taxi's' Louis DePalma is filmed hovering around the 'Taxi' set playing someone else. It's distracting.Nobody else clicks in the supporting cast, either. Paul Giamatti feels awkward and forced as Kaufman's writer and friend Bob Zmuda. He's too smug, and not enough of a doorway into what makes Andy tick. Courtney Love is awful in the role of Kaufman's squeeze, never really giving us any sense of why she's there and loves him after all the misery he puts her through around the wrestling ring. Does she know if Andy is playing with her? Does she care? She did a good job in director Milos Forman's previous film 'The People Vs. Larry Flynt,' and you get the sense he either enjoyed working with her or fancied she was a critics' darling.The film does work more near the end, especially with a giddy Carnegie Hall performance starring Kaufman where the Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and Santa Claus close the show and Andy takes the audience out for milk and cookies. That's a good moment; it would be a great moment in a better film.",4,1,2,3 February 2005
Saving Private Ryan," 'Quite A View'
","Is 'Saving Private Ryan' the greatest war movie ever made? I don't think I've seen one better. If there is one better, I don't think I could manage to sit through it, anyway. Though it is intense, violent, and bloody, it is also entertainment, albeit of the profoundest kind. Even those viewers who normally pass up opportunities to be shocked and appalled by on-screen violence should not deny themselves the chance of seeing this great film at least once.People discussing this picture tend to agree on one thing: The Omaha Beach sequence that starts the story proper is the high point of the picture. I concur. It throws some awful imagery at the viewer, making you feel like you are a part of the landing. As bullets rip into the innards of men around you, you almost feel like you are in mortal danger. But the sequence works not because of the bloodiness, but because of the pacing. Despite the objections of some, director Stephen Spielberg doesn't push your face in gore unrelievedly, but creates a story in this sequence that has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Spielberg makes you feel the human cost of the battle in some small way (he never pretends to be capturing all of it) but keeps the camera focused on characters like Tom Hanks's Cpt. Miller and Tom Sizemore's Sgt. Horvath who you feel are going to make it through at least this fight. Much of the carnage is shown in small flashes, or in the corners of the frame. At the risk of trivializing the actual conflict, the result is like a rollercoaster ride, a mighty daunting one that you feel some measure of achievement after you sit through it once, and actually grows more powerful with repeat viewings, which is not as horrible once you have seen it once and gotten a good idea who lives and dies.The rest of the film can only pale in comparison, and is often unfairly dismissed for losing some of the momentum of Omaha. But how could any director, however great, sustain such momentum? And who would want to?Instead, the film goes into a section that I think is even more affecting, when we see the typing pool where female clerks rattle out pro forma letters from 'Joes' who speak in male voices about how each casualty was the finest and best soldier they ever had the privilege of serving with. Then one woman notices her letter is addressed to the same mother as another she just finished typing, and the central plot is set in motion. Three brothers have been killed in action, it turns out, and a fourth is missing in action and must be found. Harve Presnell as George C. Marshall, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recites from memory a letter sent by Abraham Lincoln nearly a century ago, in the process giving one of the most powerful performances in a movie full of them, and then we get a sequence that visually quotes Norman Rockwell as Mrs. Ryan wordlessly gets word of `the sacrifice she has laid on the altar of freedom.' Watching her collapse on her porch as the priest emerges from the black sedan is not easily done with dry eyes, because we understand by then how commonplace this sort of thing was.There are moments of humor in 'Saving Private Ryan,' too, much of it from Tom Hanks' central performance. His laconic comment when a German on a loudspeaker announces 'the Statue of Liberty is kaput' is priceless, and even as the body count mounts, there is a sense of this somehow being made endurable by the company of Miller and his men. Hanks keeps his schtick in harness most of the time, but when he does allow for some jocularity, we are actually grateful.The film slips a couple of times, but not in any major way. The biggest misstep for me was when Miller goes off and cries after losing one man. It's the one episode of actorly indulgence in a film that otherwise steers clear of such theatrics, though it may work for others.Even the final battle for the town of Remmel, though fictional, is done in a realistic and committed way. Some of the most violent and gruesome moments occur here, and they are all the more difficult to endure because we now know the soldiers fighting and dying in a way we didn't at Omaha.The music by John Williams and the cinematography by Janusz Kaminski are simply brilliant, neither calling your attention as they serve their scenes in an efficient manner. The sound, the editing, all are of a high order and will no doubt inspire moviemakers for generations to come.People who say `Saving Private Ryan' is not war but Hollywood are right, but miss the point. This is an example of Hollywood getting it right, and creating something enduring. I will always be thankful I managed to sit through 'Ryan' once, because it made me want to see it again. Give this film the same chance, and I bet you will agree.",9,1,2,1 January 2004
1941," Superstar comedy falls flat
","'1941' was a film that carried great expectations when it was released at the end of 1979. The two most versatile stars of the season's biggest TV comedy hit, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of 'Saturday Night Live,' were brought together for the first time on the big screen. The subject, LA panic in the days right after Pearl Harbor, promised trendy iconoclastic fun at the expense of the War Years generation and their uptight, stuffy values in a 'Tora, Tora, Tora' meets 'Animal House' kind of way. And the director, one Steven Spielberg, was coming off two of the biggest films of this, or any other, decade: 'Jaws' (1975) and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1978). What could go wrong?Everything.Like 'Casino Royale' the previous decade, '1941' is the sort of comedy that defines the excesses and exaggerated stereotypes of its audience. It also manages the same ratio of one decent joke per name actor. Aykroyd does okay in the role of a tank crew commander, with his big spiel about whether a crowd of maniacs want to put Tojo in the White House. Belushi is just embarrassing in a bigger role with no laughs, as a pilot who smokes a never-extinguishing cigar stump and can't seem to sit in his cockpit for five seconds without going ass over feet. Aykroyd and Blutto don't even meet, a bit of a cheat.The whole gimmick of the War Years gone loco seems just stupid. You could probably make good fun at the expense of the Greatest Generation if you had a decent script, but this is a hackneyed slog through the Big Muddy with pointless crashes; monotonous explosions; and strange, mid-punchline editing and pumped-up orchestration that positively screams flailing desperation. Consider that Americans had every right to feel war nerves as they recovered from the gut kick of Dec. 7, and the forced laughs of '1941' feel doubly inappropriate. The Japanese weren't Nazis, but the distinction would have been lost on a number of U.S. and Allied POWs in Bataan and other places, not to mention countless Chinese and Koreans. Yet this film treats them as if they are the best kind of people on the planet, Pearl Harbor or not. Simply put, I hope I'm not around by the time someone decides to make a movie with Al-Queda operatives in the role of cute, fuzzy Ewoks running rampant through Seattle.Which leads to Spielberg. Yes, you get the famous director from such films as Jaws (self-referential opening), Always (fascination with planes), Empire of the Sun (fascination with the Japanese warrior spirit), along with the suffused lighting (Close Encounters, ET, Saving Private Ryan) and nasty Germans (entire opus) that, among other things, distinguishes Spielberg's work. His work isn't just subpar here, it's bad, strangely so given he obviously put real heart into it, and that, despite his commercial success, he's a truly great director worth knowing and celebrating for the whole of his work, even crap like 'The Color Purple' and 'Jurassic Park II.'I guess what annoyed me most about the movie, as an American, was the moronic treatment of my own (and Spielberg's) nationality, especially as it is contrasted with the noble Japanese (whose quest for honor is about the only thing this film sees fit to honor). In a very good documentary that accompanies the DVD, Spielberg reveals that both John Wayne and Charlton Heston declined the role of Joseph Stilwell, complaining the movie was anti-American. Bless those boys. Having my country bashed around isn't so awful in itself, it's a strong nation that's withstood worse, but if you want to take on Old Glory, the material better be a mite better than the likes of 'My name's Wild Bill Kelso, and don't you forget it' or a house falling into the Santa Monica coastline.Hey, I did like the dummy, however.",3,10,21,25 April 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," Lean's Grandest Spectacle
","To watch 'Lawrence Of Arabia' is to be refreshed anew with the power of film, a visit to a pleasant oasis of perfect delight and contentment after crossing the arid desert of today's movie scene.I don't blame modern movie makers. I blame David Lean. He set an impossibly high standard with this film, an epic that plays like serial adventure, with rousing action sequences, multi-layered dialogue, gorgeous camera work, a deep-bodied musical score that feels at one with the desert, and a cast of exceptionally good actors all working at their absolute peaks, led by then-newcomer Peter O'Toole in the title role.His Lawrence is both bigger than life and quaintly eccentric, rubbing his fellow British officers the wrong way when we first meet him as a humble mapmaker in Cairo.'I can't make out whether you are bloody madman or just half-witted,' says the general who sees him off on his new assignment, 'appreciating the situation' among Bedouin warriors fighting the Turks in a World War I backwater.'I have the same problem, sir,' is Lawrence's reply.O'Toole plays him as a consummate dreamer, unhappy in his Western skin and desirous of challenge and change, and for that ultimately no small risk to himself and others. This is soon revealed when he generously presents a revolver to his Bedouin guide Tafas (Zia Mohyeddin does a lot to establish the film's early exotic tone before bigger names arrive to play the Arab parts). Later, Tafas is killed by the gift when he attempts to use it on a strange figure approaching him and Lawrence across the mirror-like horizon. As time passes, we discover how dangerous Lawrence's gift of military power can be for other Arabs, too, and how that doubles back on Lawrence. 'Lawrence is a sword that cuts both ways,' observes Alec Guinness's sly Prince Feisal late in the film, at which point Lawrence himself is about cut to ribbons.Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are very, very good playing off Lawrence and each other. Sharif is a revelation as Ali, shifting from dangerous adversary to calming ally and finally disaffected brother of Lawrence, the moral center as Lawrence strays into bloodlust and self-deification. Quinn provides much of the comedy as rival chieftain Auda, yet also the embodiment of Lawrence's unstable situation as he seeks to make a nation of Arabs. Auda doesn't understand the concept of 'Arabs.' He just sees rival tribes to chivvy with.One thing you are struck with watching 'Lawrence' is it runs nearly four hours but feels more like 90 minutes. That's of course testament to a lot of things, but the editing by Anne V. Coates is not pointed out enough. No scene feels too long, and while that is a product of Lean's direction and a story by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, Coates' clever cutting sets a standard for epics by working 'off-the-beat' as it were, anticipating a scene change by making it a half-second early, as in the famous one where Lawrence blows out a match and leads us into the desert. Coates had great fabric to work with, of course, but tailors it perfectly. It's a wonder and a shame she and Lean didn't work together again.Some films, very good ones, start strong and fade in the stretch. Others build momentum as they go along. 'Lawrence' is different. The film grabs you right away, and even as we lose some things we miss, we gain other elements we enjoy, creating an ever-changing spectacle that defines the Hollywood epic in its purest form (made by a Brit in Morocco, I know.) It keeps building like a symphony, unfolding with patient vibrancy like some perfectly realized life outside nature.Picking the best parts of 'Lawrence' may be difficult, but it's easy for me to name my favorite scene. It's whatever part of 'Lawrence' I am watching whenever I watch the film. Which isn't often enough!",10,2,5,8 March 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Rooting For The Dinosaurs
","The first 'Jurassic Park' was all about the science of bringing dinosaurs back to life. 'The Lost World' is about the ethics of same. Ethics have always been tricky territory where Hollywood is concerned. That's true here, too.Four years after InGen populated an entire island with dinosaurs, the company finds itself on the ropes. Wrongful death suits are expensive; so is bad publicity. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) goes from horrified onlooker to potential hors d'oeuvre when he travels to Isla Sorna to persuade his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) to come back home with him.Director Steven Spielberg called this film 'my first pure sequel,' noting his Indiana Jones films are more like installments in an adventure series. But 'The Lost World' fails miserably as a sequel, offering none of the joy of discovery while doubling up on carnage. It is a weird, grim spectacle film where logic in thrown out and characterization reduced to the broadest strokes.The question I am left with: Are we supposed to be rooting for the dinosaurs? The pro-forma good guys are a motley crew of SJWs whose constant virtue-signaling is about the only thing audible over the raptor roars. In between snuggling up to a baby stegosaurus and bringing an injured T. Rex into her trailer, Dr. Harding lectures a photographer not to smoke a cigarette on the island. 'We're here to observe and document, not interact,' she tells him.Spielberg could have made a good movie out of this if he dispensed with the idea of making Harding his hero, rather than a big part of the problem. The photographer turns out to be a Greenpeace operative, and we watch him and Harding release some captured dinosaurs which then trample through a camp of fellow humans. They are hunters, so this is apparently positive behavior, even if this 'ethical' sabotage winds up killing most of the people we see.The CGI is more active here than it was in the first film, and much more artificial-looking. Spielberg's A-Team, composer John Williams and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, plod through the motions in delivering a lot of mood and odd triumphant tones which feel hollow even as they are delivered. The whole film fails as a transportive enterprise, reminding you of past glories while adding nothing new.There's one performance I really liked in the film. It's not Pete Postlethwaite as Roland the hunter, which everyone else including Spielberg loved; he's a cipher too hemmed in by the silly script. Rather, it's Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow, nephew of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who as acting head of InGen is trying to use the dinosaurs to repair his shattered business, and doesn't care who gets hurt in the process.Howard is so smoothly smug and mean, I found myself seeking him out in group scenes. He's really not much of a villain, since his motives are less evil than capitalist (the same thing in Spielberg's world, maybe, but not mine), but he adds the right notes of conflict whenever given the chance, like when Malcolm grabs his arm in an early scene to make a point: 'This suit costs more than your education.'Howard doesn't do much villain work, so I was happily impressed enough to give him my 1997 Doe Avedon Award for great performance in a bad movie.What passes for a plot involves watching the various name characters try to avoid the same brutal fate they bestow on those who meet them, and then try and save an angry T. Rex storming through San Diego. This latter piece is so tacked on it betrays 'Lost World's' focus on being an effects film. The original 'Jurassic Park' was that, too, but the storycraft was good enough to keep you watching.No luck here. 'The Lost World' is as much a slaughterhouse of ideas as it is of people. We can argue about whether Spielberg ever made a worse film ('1941,' perhaps), but this stands supreme as his most disappointing.",2,59,101,1 November 2017
Cars," Wheel-Spinning Exercise
","Of the several Pixar movies I've seen, 'Cars' was the only one that left me flat. It's not an unpleasant or stupid film, just a clear dip from an otherwise very high standard.Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a rookie race car en route to contend for the all-important Piston Cup when a highway miscue leaves him stranded in a near-ghost town along desolate Route 66. McQueen is hot to move on, but the town's resident judge Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) won't let him until he fixes its main street. As the days to the Piston Cup dwindle, McQueen loses his temper but finds his soul.'Cars' looks great, and there are some warm and funny digs at the world of NASCAR its fans will enjoy. The voice talent, including Pixar regulars Bonnie Hunt as love interest Sally the Porsche and John Ratzenberger as the truck who drives Lightning around, do their usual solid work breathing life into the characters. The visual design is hard to criticize; even the road textures and the chrome reflections appear perfect.What's wrong with 'Cars'? It doesn't really have any of the ingredients I expect from a Pixar film. It's not laugh-out-loud funny like 'A Bug's Life' or 'Monsters Inc.', it's not uplifting like Toy Stories 1 or 3, or wondrously engaging like 'Finding Nemo.' It's sort of like watching your little nephews playing with toy cars, diverting until you think about the scotch you could be drinking instead.'Cars' is a movie for ten-year-old boys. As Paul Newman's last movie, it has that in common with his first film, 'The Silver Chalice.' Newman's film career nearly sank after 'Chalice' while 'Cars' would be his highest-grossing film. Too bad his presence made little difference to most of his audience.Newman brings a cranky brio to Doc Hudson, the vintage sedan whose gruff exterior toward Lightning conceals a secret. You can hear a scratchy frailness in his voice, but there's a lot of game, too. Newman the car-racing buff even has two credits in the movie, the second as a 'Special Racing Consultant.' It's not Butch Cassidy, but Newman would have enjoyed going out on four wheels.The big problems for 'Cars' is that it's not that funny and way too long at two hours. Plot lines involving Lightning fixing the road or worrying about landing a big new sponsor play as dull as they sound. Prior Pixar films worked a lot of witty humor into their basic concepts. How could you not laugh with 'A Bug's Life' when a mayfly at a sad flea circus whined 'I got only 24 hours to live and I ain't wasting it here!' This time you get such wan efforts as a double entendre about the 'gas' being served at the local cafe and Sally leaving behind 'life in the fast lane' for small-town life. It's funny because she's a car, I guess.The flash and glitz of cars on the go is all this movie ends up being about. No deeper riches await additional viewings. It's a pleasant timewaster from a studio capable of much more.",5,0,1,27 April 2012
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," 2000: Year Of The Cat Fight
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is one of two Ang Lee movies I've seen. One, 'The Ice Storm,' takes place a couple of towns up the parkway from where I live. This one is set half a world away, yet watching it makes China feel closer than New Canaan. I have a feeling a lot of people get a similar sensation.Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) is tired of kicking butt; he only wants peace, and perhaps a new start in life with the woman he loves but keeps a wary, correct distance from, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Matters are complicated with the theft of a great sword, the Green Destiny. Lien's investigation quickly centers on a bored rich girl named Jen (Zihi Zhang), who hides her skills under embroidered gowns but is ultimately as much about rebellion as Lien is about conformity. When the two women square off, sparks will fly, literally. Yet Jen has goodness in her. Can Bai and Lien save her from becoming 'a poison dragon' in the service of her murderous master, the Jade Fox?I never really got into martial-arts movies, probably because of the culture gap but also because until recently they didn't get much respect from critics, at least here in the West. That was already beginning to change by 2000, but 'Crouching Tiger' was the clear tipping point, Oscar-nominated for Best Picture and praised to the skies for its beautiful cinematography and gravity-defying fight scenes.Those fight scenes are amazing, each in a different way. One resembles a dazzling lyrical ballet on a lush bamboo forest; another is a grand goofy bar fight which is played for laughs. The best fight is between Jen and Lien, a cinematic centerpiece every bit as great as Rick and Ilsa's last scene on the tarmac in 'Casablanca.' No doubt it got PC points among Western critics for featuring two women in battle, it also is a nice way of bringing out the central tension in the film's deceptively simple narrative, which is that between cultural obligation as embodied by Lien, and individual happiness as sought by Jen.Earlier in the film, Jen lays her cards out on the table for Lien, with whom she hopes to be friends: 'I'm getting married, but I'm not happy about it,' Jen says. Lien's wooden reply: 'I've heard. Congratulations.' Much later on, after Jen has run out on her wedding and stolen the Green Destiny, Bai talks about taking Jen as his student, to save her from being corrupted by evil. 'What if her husband objects?' asks Lien. Bai gives her a look which says it all: What planet did you beam down from? She's Patty Hearst now, and about to become Darth Vader. Her husband's wishes are the least of our concerns.Not to Lien. While oddly liberated by her single status (which in turn is due to her self-restrictive attitude about being in mourning for a long-dead fiancé), Lien is the cultural touchstone, or rather millstone, of this drama. She and Bai are clearly meant for each other, but she resists. Oddly, while this puts her at loggerheads with audience expectations, Lien is also the movie's most empathetic character, more so than the remote Bai or spoiled Jen. As played by Yeoh, Lien offers us a passionate center who both embodies the code she and Bai live by, and betrays that code's limitations.Getting all that on screen is a great triumph for Yeoh, and one I needed to watch the film more than once to pick up on. She's so remarkable in her fight scenes and running up and down walls (yes, I know wires were involved, but even so the athletic skill necessary to sell such action is impossible to imagine) people miss the consummate acting of her performance, the aware inertness of her eyes, the expression of sad longing that she allows to poke through her bland facade. Chow is great, too, and Zhang beyond that in a star-making performance of beauty and rage, yet I wouldn't feel the warmth I do for this film without Yeoh inhabiting so much of it, not just body but soul.The DVD which I found for under $10 has not only both the dubbed and subtitled versions of the films (which are radically different, and both worth viewing as they bring out different aspects of this deep film) but a funny commentary track by director Lee and co-writer James Schamus, which is remarkable in and of itself for its tone. You'd think they were Joel and Crow having at a Roger Corman flick on 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' for all the potshots they take at their masterpiece. I guess you can be humble when you make a film as good as this, easily the best film of 2000 and a cinematic milestone that will inspire generations yet unborn, whatever future film technologies dish out.",10,40,65,9 January 2006
JFK," Paranoid Chic
","The fact I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone doesn't reduce my sincere admiration for this involving, brilliantly packaged indictment of the processes used to affirm his guilt. As a movie, 'JFK' rises above any duty to history to develop what director- writer Oliver Stone calls a 'countermyth' to what he calls the myth of the Warren Report.In short, it became a template for inculcating what I would call 'paranoid chic,' a desire to question comforting ideas that goes beyond all rational objections to fashion a mesmerizing if flawed piece of entertainment. 'JFK' is, in more than one way, revolutionary.New Orleans, November 22, 1963. While news of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy filters through barrooms and reaches the office of district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), an argument between right-wing hothead detective Guy Banister (Ed Asner) and his alcoholic gopher Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon) over strange goings-on in their office escalates into a violent assault. In time, this becomes the lynchpin of an investigation Garrison undertakes that becomes a re-investigation of the Kennedy murder, one that will lead to the only indictment of anyone accused of the president's killing.Garrison spends much time trying to unravel the 'tangled web' at the heart of the killing, with much attention paid to the unique character of New Orleans, a city where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald spent much of his life. With a flair for detail and a pregnant line, Stone puts us at Garrison's side as he closely questions a bizarre character named David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) who drove to Texas on that fatal day, he says for some ice skating and geese shooting. Big Jim shakes his head.'I find your story simply not believable,' he says.'Really?' Ferrie responds amiably. 'What part?'It's a welcome moment of levity that demonstrates Stone's complete command of the material. For more than three hours, he brings up a slew of bigger-than-life witnesses who either convince us with their honesty or repel us with their sinister indifference to what happened. In time, Garrison is mocked on national television, betrayed like Jesus by one of his closest aides, and faces divorce before getting the chance to make the case he has built to a jury in a lengthy yet gripping courtroom sequence, one of the finest ever made.The sequences work as vignettes, many of them worth watching over and over. Lolita Davidovich shines in a brief turn as Beverly Oliver, a self-described 'two-bit showgirl' who once saw Oswald at a club with his future killer, Jack Ruby (Brian Doyle-Murray). Tommy Lee Jones oozes southern charm as the man Garrison eventually brings to trial, Claw Shaw.Only a couple of sequences hint at a larger truth, that Stone is throwing up a lot of clay pigeons in his attempt to fashion his countermyth. One witness, Jean Hill, is ridiculously dragged screaming from the murder scene to be told by officials in a ludicrous scene that she didn't see or hear what she, and we, just did. There is also some misdirection thrown in the direction of three tramps picked up at the scene, which Stone in his 2001 director's commentary admits turned out not to be the assassins the movie paints them as being.But in the main, the film holds together very well by keeping the focus on Garrison, who speaks forthrightly about what he believes. As in his performance in 'The Untouchables,' Costner is a master of understatement who saves his passion for the final summation in court. It's hard to keep a dry eye watching him go.After, you can shake your head all you want. I surely do. But 'JFK' has left a mark on the American consciousness that feels well-earned when watching it. By enshrining skepticism as not only patriotic but a citizen's duty, the film successfully pushes a less comfortable view of what life is really all about that has become its most lasting legacy, and does so in a way that makes three and a half hours feel like a handful of minutes. Truly epic, however mistaken.",8,3,7,30 December 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Taking A Deeper Journey
","{This review is for the 179-minute theatrical release.}The quickest way to burn three hours from your life is to sit down and watch this crisply structured, breathlessly paced, yet thematically rich dose of cinematic CPR. You will come out feeling refreshed, revived, and wondering where the time went.It's a bleak time for the denizens of Middle Earth, the evil powers of Sauron and Saruman forming a union against the beleaguered forces of good. While a small army of men from Rohan make a forlorn stand in a mountainside redoubt, two hobbits, joined by a nasty critter who answers to the name of Gollum (Andy Serkis), make a lonely, harrowing trek into the heart of enemy territory, on a mission that seems unlikely to end in anything less than their doom.'Do not trust to hope,' is a characteristic piece of advice offered to another party of good adventurers. 'It has forsaken these lands.'Director Peter Jackson reshapes the problematically structured middle novel in J. R. R. Tolkien's 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy into a stirring centerpiece for his own epic cinematic adaption. Each shot has almost a painterly quality, a classical shape and texture that informs every frame.While Tolkien's source novel is the weakest of the saga, Jackson's film is the best of his own trilogy. Instead of long narratives, Jackson and his editors, Michael Horton and Jabez Olssen, present a triple-track approach where something is always happening, often very fast. At the same time, the script by Jackson and his writing team plumbs story elements for drama and tension that Tolkien at times barely limned. Gollum's story is the film's emotional arc, as we see in him a tortured soul not quite beyond the reach of redemption, however dangerous. His mad lust for the Ring of Power is not only dramatic in itself, but ominous for the lead character, Frodo (Elijah Wood) who now carries the Ring and sees in Gollum the potential for similar madness in himself.'The Two Towers' does an effective job reintroducing the characters, good and evil, we met in 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' and investing all of them with qualities of deeper interest and humor to extend our investment in them. At the same time, 'The Two Towers' broadens things with a slew of new characters, most especially Gollum (Serkis is never seen on screen, but he was both a voice-actor and a motion- capture artist on screen) and Faramir (David Wenham), brother of troubled Boromir seen in 'Fellowship.' Both Gollum and Faramir find themselves tested by the very same thing, and their different reactions help drive the rest of the film.There are minor weaknesses in this film, most particularly a needless detour where the brave human leader Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) temporarily goes missing. Some lengthy exposition elements featuring my least favorite characters, the Elves, grate on my nerves. But the spectacle and storycraft overall are brilliant in the main, and even better, become more enjoyable when the film is watched again.'The Two Towers' is a one-of-a-kind thrill ride that keep you as mentally stimulated as it does visually ravished.",9,0,1,2 November 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," Moving Right Along, Folks
","Al Pacino never had a role as tailor-made to his gift for over-the-top, on-the-edge histrionics than he did in 'Dog Day Afternoon.' His Sonny is unique for the way he mixes comedy and pathos, screaming profanity one moment, quietly sympathetic and almost soulfully gentle the next. 'I speak what I feel,' he tells a teller who asks him to watch his language, but he's obviously sensitive to what people think of him, even when he's pointing a gun at them.'Dog Day Afternoon' is really Pacino's baby. The film exists to serve his art. The fact he's great in it is almost incidental. Of course he's great in it, he's a great actor in a movie that puts all the focus on him. But how good is it otherwise?Pretty to very, depending on which part of the movie you are watching. The film is better at the outset and in the middle than in the end, where it gets sloppy in its emotions and reaches beyond the bank for its storyline, dulling the focus. The central premise, a holed-up duo of ne'er-do-wells taking on the city, works as underdog formula for a while, especially when Sonny faces down the police by screaming 'Attica' and making them put their guns down. The bank employees are fleshed out nicely with the help of Sully Boyar as the bank's manager, Penny Allen as the head teller, Marcia Jean Kurtz as a gum-snapping teller, and Carol Kane as the 'squirrel' who gets a call from her husband asking what he should do for dinner while she's a hostage.Pacino's 'Godfather' mate John Cazale, in a velvet suit of fire engine red in case you were wondering what decade this was made in, is there as buddy Sal to provide steely backup as Sonny holds up the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. When John Cazale is the muscle man, your plot is definitely in trouble, and Sal and Sonny quickly find themselves surrounded by about four thousand members of New York's finest.The dialogue has a very improvisational feel to it, which along with the strong characterization and frequent humor gives 'Dog Day Afternoon' much of its watchability. You really feel like you are seeing this botched robbery happen as it goes down, in real time.There's a nice use of suspense, too, the first time you watch it. Sonny's so out there that you never know what, if anything, will set him off in a homicidal rage. And you know Sal really wants to start dumping those bodies out the door. So even though you can count the number of gunshots in this movie with one hand (and have enough left over to snap your fingers with), you are nervous all the way through.It does feel like the New York Police Department are a little too much out in force; was August 22, 1972 a good day to commit a crime in one of the other four boroughs? The police and the FBI are seen as unreasonable heavies, but Vietnam veterans and homosexuals probably come off worse, not to mention former Goldwater campaign activists. As far as the gay thing goes, it comes across as a bit silly when we see a group of over-the-top drag queens show up at the police barricade to cheer on sister Sonny, but the phone conversation between Pacino and Chris Sarandon as his lover Leon is among the movie's most affecting scenes. Sarandon is really good at playing a total human mess who actually is a voice of relative reason in Sonny's world.Can't get over how young Pacino looks. He reminds me of Matthew Broderick in 'WarGames.' Funny that one of the FBI agents here is played by Matthew's father. Matthew's father is in another classic '70s New York crime movie, 'The Taking Of Pelham One-Two-Three' which has a similar feeling to 'Dog Day' but a much heavier vibe. No question the 1970s were a great decade for crime dramas, and 'Dog Day' is one of the best.",8,3,5,2 October 2004
School of Rock," Something For The Kids
","'School Of Rock' is cute for what it is, a kid-friendly starring vehicle for emerging comic actor Jack Black. It contains its share of engaging moments, real chuckles, and formulaic moments. The weakness of the central premise keeps SOR from being especially memorable or engaging, but it fills time well.Director Richard Linklater was my main reason for wanting to see this; he was the guy that made the ultimate youth comedy, 'Dazed And Confused,' and some other top films I've heard much about. Also, Jack Black was clearly making a sequel in spirit to another great film with rock music at its core, 'High Fidelity,' which also featured Joan Cusack. Black got many of the big laughs in 'High Fidelity,' so giving his clueless type-A persona a movie of his own seemed a cool idea.Black plays Dewey Finn, a struggling musician who believes in the power of classic rock music, i.e. hard rock post-Beatles, pre-MTV. He finds both a job and a prospective vehicle for his musical ambitions as an impostor substitute teacher at a hoity-toity elementary prep school where the students are being loaded down with their parents' transplanted ambitions and are dying for an excuse to cut loose, especially after Finn injects them with his gospel of 'sticking it to the Man.' Finn has what they need, and they take it and try to run with it, but will the Man come down on him before they get the chance to strut what they got?Watching this film, I've come to realize I enjoy Black more in smaller doses, like in 'High Fidelity' and in 'Saving Silverman,' where he's either a second banana or has a partner to play off of. His shtick is funny in bursts, and I think he's generally good in this film, but in his scenes with the kids, he grinds his teeth, flaps his arms, and works his eyebrows to the point of distraction. By trying to fill every moment of screen time with some silly business, Black too often comes across often as a physical comedian with nothing to say.That's not to say Black is bad, just wearying and a bit one-note. He does a better job playing off his young charges than Bill Murray did in his first starring vehicle, 'Meatballs,' and Murray's gone on to better things. The script leans too heavily on Black to provide the humor, and while Black delivered enough to make this film his career breakout, I suspect it won't have quite the shelf life in five years' time.The central problem is the story. We are asked to believe that this substitute could really mold this class of yuppie offspring into Led Zeppelin wannabes over a period of weeks without their parents or the school brass catching on. There's no attempt at surrealism, like you might get in a Will Farrell comedy, because the comedy's focus is squarely on pre-pubescent audiences. I admired the film's lack of rudeness, but sometimes it's Olestra-soft. Everything happens too easy.At least the kids are bright and charming, each in his or her own way. I sense we will be hearing from some of them for a while. And Joan Cusack shines as the stiff-spined school principal with a secret affection for Stevie Nicks music. Her telling a roomful of already-angry parents that she just lost their children is the biggest laugh in the movie.It's scary realizing the music I grew up with is now as passÃ© as swing with the present generation, and 'School of Rock' could have done more with that concept. It could have done more with a lot of things, but for what it is, it's better than a stick in the eye.",4,2,8,28 September 2004
Amadeus," Classic Film Worthy Of Classical Score
","'Amadeus' cleaned up on Oscar Night, 1985, and in its time was as much an event as a film. It even spawned a #1 worldwide hit, the silly but infectious 'Rock Me Amadeus.' Then the movie kind of disappeared. You didn't hear about it much when people discussed great cinema, even from the 1980s. The actors, all hailed when the film came out, seemed to slip back into relative obscurity, except for Cynthia Nixon, the future 'Sex And The City' girl unrecognizable here as an innocent housemaid. Maybe that's why director Milos Forman and the film's producers decided on releasing a special Director's Cut when it was time to make a DVD.The result, as Salieri might have put it, is breathtaking. The film breathes with new life, shaking whatever period-film shackles held it back in 1984. We see Mozart struggling to make himself an instructor for rich, untalented girls; enjoy with the common people of Austria a rousing farce of 'Don Giovanni;' and finally get a satisfying reason for one of the original film's few problems: Why Mozart's wife Constanze angrily sends Salieri away from her husband's deathbed. The end result: What was great before is perfection now.Its brilliance is not in its costumes, its set design, its bravura performances or crafty plot. It's not even the music, though classical-music snobs I encountered claimed that was the only thing in the movie worth noticing, though in its hacked-up state it was more 'Hooked On Mozart' than anything truly edifying. No, what's great about 'Amadeus,' what makes it rise to the utter top, is how all these brilliant elements are brought together in a way that carries the viewer with it from beginning to end. Even if you don't get it all the first time you see it, your appetite will be stoked enough for you to wish to see it again, and that's where the film really makes it mark.Like other landmark movies, 'Citizen Kane,' 'Psycho,' 'The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,' and 'Jaws,' 'Amadeus' hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard, the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constanze, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.That's a good way to describe 'Amadeus,' as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.Is this a film about the folly of seeing a religious design in the patterns of life, in thinking some divine being guides all and decides who is great and who is not? Some would say so. Others might incline to Salieri's own belief, that God is a being not of mercy but of caprice, striving to undo those who strive to be better than He intends. Finally, there is the idea, which I go with, that Salieri's great loss was not in being there when Mozart came to Vienna but to be so choked with jealousy as to not help him, despite the many opportunities to do so, and to suffer the consequences of seeing Mozart's posthumous reputation rise to greater heights while his own music 'grows fainter.' The brilliance of that last scene, of Salieri helping Mozart write the Requiem, is realizing that with a different, more positive and truly pious outlook, Salieri could have been Mozart's champion, and shared some of his boundless fame.Of course, this is all fiction. Salieri didn't drive Mozart to his death. Ironically, he was more a devoted servant of greatness, as history records him being the chief teacher of the one composer whose reputation arguably eclipses even Mozart's, Ludwig van Beethoven.But screenwriter Peter Shaffer doesn't let this get in the way of a great story, and so we have a great movie, and Salieri, a measure of notoriety his own music never brought.",10,4,7,25 July 2004
The Man Who Would Be King," The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of
","A classy John Huston action yarn that melds high adventure with an abundance of belly laughs, 'The Man Who Would Be King' stands high because of the brilliance of its two leads and Huston's undeniable craft.Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) and Danny Dravot (Sean Connery) are former soldiers in Her Majesty's army who dare to dream big on the Indian subcontinent. Making the acquaintance of a newspaper reporter named Rudyard Kipling, they hatch a plan to travel across forbidding mountains and appoint themselves rulers of a distant, fabled land - then rob the place four ways from Sunday. They expect it will be all in a day's work for two enterprising Britishers.'We're not little men, so we're going away to become kings,' Peachy tells Kipling.'We hear they have two and thirty idols there, so we'll be the 33rd and 34th,' adds Danny.Of course, it's Huston directing, and co-writing the script with Gladys Hill, so they may want to bone up on how 'Treasure Of Sierra Madre' turned out before venturing forth.Watching Connery work here is a revelation. Gone is much of the suavity he made his name with playing James Bond. He presents us with Danny as a bit of a dunce, caught up as Danny is in the role he is playing until he literally plays out his string. Connery sings, he dances, he even forswears women, until meeting a beauty played by Caine's real-life wife who proves his undoing.You really shouldn't root for these guys, con-men that they are, except for the way they interact. Peachy's the brains of the outfit, the one who says they should 'pull stumps and run,' but your heart is with Danny, who wanted to be another thieving king but gets caught up with bigger dreams.Caine's performance is every bit as good as Connery's, though he plays more in tune with his typical screen character. The banter between them, like that of Butch and Sundance in another film, really makes this work, and it's Caine who pushes most of the tension. His reaction shots throughout the film, especially as Danny begins to spin out of his control, are subtle but solid, giving Connery the room to carve out one of his greatest character performances.There's a wonderful moment, among many, when they find themselves in a treasure trove that's theirs to take away. The look in their eyes tells you this is no happy occasion, but a moment of real fear. Peachy licks one golden bauble and tells Danny, very tentatively, that 'it ain't brass.'There ain't much brass to be seen here, with the amazing scenics and compositions on display. Making a film in the fabled age of the auteur, Huston nevertheless works from an older school that prizes storytelling over vision. The result is a film out of time, and one of the best in this great director's career.It does run long, and the story gets thin as it gets to the end, spun as it is from a Kipling short story. 'The Man Who Would Be King' doesn't have the rewatchability of many great films. But it has its own kind of greatness, and may leave you at the end with a lump in your throat.",8,0,4,26 March 2014
Ghostbusters," The Dead Vs. The Deadpan
","What happens when a guy finds himself losing the woman he loves to a bloodthirsty Sumerian god? Can a trio of determined men capture a Class-5 full-roaming vapor without destroying a hotel ballroom? Is 'crossing the streams' dangerous to one's health?If you are like millions of other people, you already know the answers to these and other questions. A giant comedy smash in its day, 'Ghostbusters' is still a lot of fun, and perhaps the most successful cinematic showcase for veterans of 'Saturday Night Live' and 'SCTV.' While not as hilarious or as scary as its reputation suggests, 'Ghostbusters' is clever and amusing and goes by fast.The star of the show, Bill Murray, plays Peter Venkman, a university professor we meet playing a shady psychic shell game in order to score some time with a young lovely. When forced to relocate, he and his friends Egon (Harold Ramis) and Ray (Dan Aykroyd) set to work as freelance spook catchers, fortunately for them just as the the Big Apple is about to be swallowed by the gates of hell.'We could really bust some heads, in a spiritual sense of course,' Ray notes.The casting really brings out the best in the movie. Sigourney Weaver as the imperiled love interest Dana brings the right snark to her role, comparing Venkman to a 'game show host' with a withering stare as he attempts (hilariously) to put the moves on her. Rick Moranis, like Ramis from 'SCTV', is a nerdy accountant who chases after Dana like a dog, then as a dog. He throws tax-deductible parties, then brags to his guests: 'I'm giving this whole thing as a promotional expense...that's why I invited clients instead of friends.' And then there's William Atherton's nasty EPA official Walter Peck, sneering wonderfully at it all.As a fan of the old 'Saturday Night Live', I guess I wanted more chemistry from the classic SNL cornerstones here, Murray and Aykroyd. Instead, Aykroyd doesn't do much to establish himself. Even though he concepted and wrote the film, his character is even less interesting than the fourth Ghostbuster, recruit Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), who is a bit of a bystander in this film though he does have one great line. 'If someone asks you if you're a god, you say 'Yes'!'Murray of course gets all the best lines, delivered in his signature deadpan style, like 'Back off, man, I'm a scientist' or 'Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.' Director Ivan Reitman leaves Murray plenty of space in-between the special effects to establish a 'Ghostbusters' voice; even if to me it seems at times more of a collection of catch phrases, I see Reitman giving the film enough shape and subtlety to make those catch phrases click.Yes, the effects are dated, and there are odd moments that don't connect (Ray being seduced out of nowhere by a ghost, for example). Still, 'Ghostbusters' is a smart genre-bender with the ability to fly through generations like that Slimer ghost goes through walls.",8,4,6,20 July 2010
The Longest Day," The Dead, The Crippled, And The Lost
","'The Longest Day' is unquestionably a product of self-important Hollywood bloat, but it is also a noble attempt to do justice to one of then-recent history's most singular moments, the Normandy landings of June 1944. For the price of sitting through clumsy expository dialogue, misplaced comedy, and thumb-in-your-eye cameos, you get some terrific cinema and a decent war story.As an opening title tells us, its the fifth year of the German occupation of France, and on both sides of the English Channel, warriors await the inevitable clash of arms. RAF pilot David Campbell (Richard Burton) notes ruefully he is now the last member of his squadron still left from the Battle of Britain. American paratrooper 'Dutch' Schultz (Richard Beymer) decides if the landing is on tonight, he'll gamble away his sizable winnings and 'jump clean.' An unnamed German officer sleeps comfortably in a French farmhouse, his boots off and carelessly arranged.Much later in the movie, the three men will be found together in a scene that summarizes the film's philosophy at its most pungent: War confirms our universal brotherhood, even with those we kill.Little moments like that are sprinkled throughout 'The Longest Day'. Every now and again, you get something more sustained. There's an attack by Free French commandoes at a casino in Ouistreham that sustains a bird's-eye view of the running battle for far longer than any other film I've ever seen, overall by far the best sequence in the movie. The British glider troop assault on Pegasus Bridge comes off effectively by being played in real time, while a botched U.S. parachute drop on a German-occupied village makes for a harrowing sequence.But 'The Longest Day' has its share of misfires; too. A lot of times in the movie, we are taken to a meeting room somewhere so the directors can tell you what is happening. The huge all-star cast is about a few stars too many, either unnecessary (Henry Fonda, Eddie Albert, Rod Steiger) or playing themselves instead of their characters (John Wayne, Red Buttons). By the time the beaches are hit, the film is two-thirds over, and a lot is skimped, especially the most effective of the D-Day landings, the Canadian assault at Juno Beach.But the overall quality of 'The Longest Day' is high, reflecting its big budget as well as a passion for telling the story. Even more than its three sure-handed directors (Brit Ken Annakin, naturalized American Andrew Marton, and German war vet Bernhard Wicki) and numerous screenwriters (including James Jones and Cornelius Ryan, who wrote the book upon which this is based), you have a masterful editing job by Samuel E. Beetley, which sustains the film's galloping pace by keeping less important scenes to the barest minimum. Few films are as long as 'The Longest Day', but many feel longer. Too bad for Beetley he was up against 'Lawrence Of Arabia''s Anne V. Coates come Oscar-time; any other year he would have won.It's not a great film otherwise, but it manages to hold up more than not, leading up to that winning wistful moment when Beymer, Burton, and the German come together. 'He's dead...I'm crippled...You're lost. I suppose it's always like that. I mean war.'",7,0,0,15 June 2008
Slap Shot," The Goon Show
","Man, I needed one complete viewing just to get a load of Paul Newman's wardrobe! Checkered pants. Fur-lined jacket. Buff leather jacket and matching pants. Great artists sacrifice for their art, and Baby Blue Eyes certainly does so here. Dropping a few F-Bombs must have been nothing to him after dressing up like that.It's for a good cause. 'Slap Shot' is an enjoyable, one-of-a-kind sports film. Like many other sports films from the 1970s, such as 'North Dallas Forty' and 'Rollerball,' there's a strong focus on how athletes are used and abandoned in a capitalist society, but the message here is leavened, and largely bypassed, by the over-the-top humor, courtesy of Newman, Strother Martin as a shyster owner, and a team full of colorful misfits led by three brothers named Hanson whose thick Dilbert glasses and love for toy race cars doesn't distract them from committing felonies on the ice against their fellow men.'Slap Shot' is about as much a guy's movie as can be, so naturally the screenwriter was a woman, Nancy Dowd. She wallows in all the profane banter, casual misogyny, and random acts of brutal violence in a way that might play a bit on the page like 'Clockwork Orange' but is saved by the film's amiable humor and sense of fun.The darkest thing about 'Slap Shot' is the premise. The Charlestown Chiefs, a minor league hockey team, are about to fold, and player-coach Reggie Dunlop schemes to turn his motley crew into winners by getting their blood up, along with their fans, by transforming them into thuggish winners to attract the attentions of an outside buyer that might keep the team running in friendlier climes.As played by Newman, Dunlop is very likable in his rascally ways, even while taunting a goalie about his lesbian wife for a cheap score. Newman throws up some vivid detail in this scene and others that must have caused a few people to blanch when 'Slap Shot' hit theaters in 1977, but his banter is perhaps a bit less scandalous today and the movie as a whole seems to be improving with time. It's about the only thing out there, other than maybe 'Youngblood' and 'Miracle,' for hockey-loving moviegoers, and it remains the most popular, perhaps even best take on one very odd sport.The film is disjointed, though, with a strange subplot about one player named Braden who resists Dunlop's 'gooning it up' and Braden's long-suffering dipso wife. The story here seems to strive for pathos a bit, and to give us something other than jokes, but as the pair are played by the unlikeable Michael Ontkean and Lindsay Crouse, it's hard to care much about them or how they turn out. They only slow down every scene they're in.The film scores better in the dramatic department with Dunlop's attempts at winning back his estranged wife. Dunlop's sincere in this, but easily distracted both in his machinations to save the team and by all the easy quail he finds on the road. One of the best things about the film is that it doesn't tie this plot thread up so neatly.'Slap Shot' works best as a comedy. Like when Dunlop blackmails the owner's identity from Strother Martin, or how one mild-mannered player transforms himself into a guy named 'Killer' who shows up at the big game wearing a Dracula cape. There's a driver who takes a sledge hammer to the team bus to 'make it look mean,' assorted opponents who look like they escaped from 'Oz,' and especially the Hansons, who are used very well because they are used sparingly.Director George Roy Hill was never wedded to any one style, and this is as far as you can get from other films he made that same decade, like 'A Little Romance' and 'The Sting.' He does very little to dress up 'Slap Shot,' even the credit sequences are perfunctory, but he knew how to make a good movie, and did so here. If you don't mind sports films that are a little raunchy and mean of heart, you will be entertained by this one.",7,4,6,13 December 2004
Patton," The Ultimate Warrior, By George
","Like many Americans, George C. Scott had divided feelings about George S. Patton. In an interview with Rex Reed shortly after 'Patton' came out, Scott called the general a homicidal madman. Yet later Scott spoke of his deep admiration for the World War II commander and his warrior mettle, and even returned to play the character again 16 years later in a mawkishly eulogizing TV miniseries, 'The Last Days Of Patton.'Both the great and the nasty Patton are up on the screen in Scott's original, 1970 portrayal. The result is one of the finest one-man shows in Hollywood history. Just the scowl on his face as he first appears, in front of a giant American flag that sets a scene both patriotic and slyly satirical, is an assay of theatrical command, one that builds by shadings and degrees as the film progresses.'Patton' derives much of its dramatic tension not from war scenes or arguments, but its central character's inner turmoil. Patton was a student of military history so enamored of the past he claimed to have been reincarnated 'across the travail of ages.' Yet he was also a dynamic tactician of the era's most advanced form of combat, armored warfare. He could schmooze his superiors in cultured French, but was prone to childish tantrums. He demanded unquestioned loyalty, but had a hard time following orders when his own grabs for glory were overruled.A lot of the tension here comes from the audience wondering if Patton is going to lose it in this or that scene and blow a chance at the brass ring. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't, and sometimes, as with a speech he innocently delivers to some English ladies, he is undone in a way he can't be blamed for. Patton is presented to us as a sick man ('by God I love it so' he says of war at one point), but a necessary one, rated so highly by his German opponents that their high command withholds valuable troops from the front thinking Patton's about to attack them far to the rear in Calais.Through the first two hours of the three-hour movie, we often see Patton at his worst, for example putting entire regiments in danger just so he can beat Monty to Messina. But the film subtly manipulates us to side with 'ole Blood and Guts' despite his faults. When he slaps a soldier, it comes right after a tender moment with Patton decorating a grievously wounded GI. He clashes with his superior Gen. Eisenhower, but the film shows this in the form of arguments between Patton and Ike's brusque envoy Bedell Smith rather than Eisenhower himself, who had just passed away in 1969 and who would have made a less likely target of audience antipathy.The last hour is kind of glorious resolution, the 'Ordeal and Triumph' which was the title of one of the film's source books. Patton plows through France and single-handedly wins the Battle of the Bulge for an encore. The fact that this is historically accurate makes it easier to appreciate and rally around, along with Scott's subtle shadings of humor (he eases back on the gas and lightens up) and a score by Jerry Goldsmith which is one of the great movie themes of its era and should have gotten the film its ninth Oscar.I'm less sold on the rest of the film, especially the actors around Scott. They are stiff and wooden. A couple are quite bad. The only recognizable actor other than Scott, Karl Malden, plays a stolid and dull counterpart to Patton in Gen. Omar Bradley, too nice to be believable. I guess since the real Bradley was working on the film as 'senior military adviser,' it was hard for Malden to play it up more.Clearly Scott wasn't likewise inhibited. The result gives us an excuse to sit back and watch one of America's most gifted actors breathe life into one of its most brilliant and conflicted generals, and offer quiet thanks there are really guys like crazy George steeling the martial mettle of our liberal democracy. You wouldn't like Patton much if he lived next door to you, but you'd be glad for him in the tank beside your foxhole.",8,2,4,25 March 2005
The Illusionist," Icebox Games
","Lovely but inert, 'The Illusionist' stands and falls on the basis of its trickery, both in its story and its visuals. If you aren't the questioning sort, you may be entertained, though not too deeply.The film opens on a provincial stage in the old Austria-Hungarian Empire, where a police chief inspector named Ulm (Paul Giamatti) is about to arrest a magician named Eisenheim (Edward Norton) in mid- performance. A lengthy flashback then shows us how Eisenheim's love of the Duchess von Teschen (Jessica Biel) caused him to create a unique show involving the promise of life after death that threatens the stability of the empire and the heir to its throne.A term credited to Alfred Hitchcock, 'icebox scenes,' come into play a lot in 'The Illusionist.' Basically, they are scenes that you take at face value the first time you view the movie, but wonder about after, maybe while getting a glass of milk at the fridge. As the subject in 'The Illusionist' is visual trickery, you are meant to wonder after at how what you see comports with what actually happens.It doesn't quite gel, though. Trickery in 'The Illusionist' is often of an artificially-enhanced variety that adds to an already-yawning distance between audience and characters.Part of this comes from a story which never takes off. There is a stuffy, 'Masterpiece Theater' vibe about 'The Illusionist' with its fancy décor and costumes, as well as its focus on class and overall sense of restraint. The cinematography takes advantage of beautiful Czech locations, but overdoes the sepia tones; while a Philip Glass score is alternately hypnotizing and soporific.The performances also keep you at a distance. Norton is very slick and assured in the lead role, but as usual with him I found myself disengaged. Giamatti is similar; a game performance but a bit too stiff. Biel wears the mantle of her gorgeousness with accomplished grace, but her character's romance with Eisenheim is the film's weakest element. 'The only mystery I never solved was why my heart couldn't let go of you,' is what passes for love talk between them.The one standout element of this film for me was Rufus Sewell's dynamite performance as the film's heavy, Crown Prince Rudolf. Sewell plays his part with an understated arrogance that blends deftly with the ambiguity of the character as written, a political progressive with an imperious air and a reputation for hurting women. He also gives an otherwise too-quiet Norton a chance to draw sparks from someone else.There's much potential for icebox talk with Rudolf, yet whenever he's not on screen the film contents itself with gaudy demonstrations of Eisenheim's trickery, prompting icebox talk of another, less happy kind. You wonder after at the improbable string of coincidences that seem to fall into place, the way Eisenheim's magic is pulled off so flawlessly in unlikely ways. It puts more attention on the CGI and director-screenwriter Neil Burger's story contortions than the film can safely handle.Burger does offer a smart film here, and deserves credit for keeping a potentially outsized story from getting out of hand. There is a lot of charm on offer, and worthwhile moments. But the emptiness at the center is hard to ignore. As illusions go, this won't keep you wondering at the icebox very long.",5,0,0,12 April 2015
Kelly's Heroes," Battle Of The Network Stars
","'Kelly's Heroes' works, to some degree, as a war movie not for the 'Greatest Generation' of World War II but the Woodstock/Vietnam mentality of its day, released as it was the same year as 'Patton' and 'MASH'.It's 1944, and as an American infantry unit is about to be pulled out of the line of combat in France, a soldier named Kelly (Clint Eastwood) discovers Wehrmacht troops have stashed a fortune in gold bars in a town still days ahead of the Allied advance. He proposes his comrades join him in a commando-style raid designed to take the gold away from the Nazis and pocket it themselves, before the rest of the American Army can.Eastwood and director Brian G. Hutton, who collaborated two years before in the near-classic, more straight-laced World War II adventure yarn 'Where Eagles Dare', lend 'Kelly's Heroes' much of its polish, but it's Eastwood's C-list co-stars who give the film its character. You could call this 'Battle Of The Network Stars' for all the future American TV series mainstays on hand for this enterprise.Telly Savalas ('Kojak') is Big Joe, a sergeant and nominal leader of Kelly's group. Don Rickles ('CPO Sharkey' and a ton of Dean Martin roasts) is Crapgame, a conniving quartermaster. Stuart Margolin of 'The Rockford Files' is one of the soldiers, and Carroll O'Connor, Archie Bunker himself, is the meathead U.S. general who thinks Kelly's boys just got a burst of patriotic spirit.The TV mojo is harder to ignore when one realizes there was a series on CBS at the same time as this movie's release with a very similar name: 'Hogan's Heroes'.I especially enjoyed Savalas' performance as the one guy in Kelly's outfit, including probably Kelly himself, with thoughts for the men's larger welfare. A better film would have made more of this tension, instead of deferring to the bigger star. Savalas so often played the heavy, yet he does compassion well here, in small, Sgt. Rock-like doses.'You're pressing these guys' luck and they only got so much of it left,' he tells Kelly. 'It's a long, long way to Berlin, and they're going to need every inch of that luck before this cockamamie war is over.'Many of the other actors, namely O'Connor, Margolin and future 'Love Boat' skipper Gavin MacLeod, play their parts very broadly, contributing to the confusion of whether 'Kelly's Heroes' is comedy or war drama. On the one hand, people do get killed. On the other, there's a lot of jokey dialogue. 'That nut has got to be nuts', Big Joe says of Kelly. Or when Crapgame finds a mine and is asked what kind: 'The kind that blows up!'Donald Sutherland (also a sitcom star, indirectly, via Alan Alda) is especially off-the-charts as Oddball, a hippie tank commander, preening and mugging for the camera with odd abandon. Yet he entertains with his kooky relish, and in that way becomes something of an avatar for the charm of 'Kelly's Heroes' itself, a subversive vehicle for delivering the visceral thrills of cinema combat while questioning the reasons for war in the first place.I'm not sure that 'Kelly's Heroes' is supposed to be subversive; Eastwood and Hutton apparently say it was until the producers reworked it. Perhaps the producers had the right idea. 'Patton' was the subversive antiwar film of its day; 'Kelly's Heroes' is a just an amiable caper film that never pushes its luck too far.",6,1,3,7 October 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Rocky: The Debbie Downer Version
","'Million Dollar Baby' is a lean, mean, fighting machine of a movie, pulling no punches and throwing no towels. It stars Clint Eastwood as a ringside 'cut man,' Morgan Freeman as his gym manager buddy, and Hilary Swank as a struggling waitress who seeks glory in the sweet science.I wish I could say I loved it. I think I liked it, because the acting is awesomely good and the story has its moments. It's a film with merit. But there are people in the world who like movies like this and 'Terms Of Endearment' and 'Rocket Gibraltar' because they like movies that make them feel. 'Million Dollar Baby' made me feel, too, feel confused at what the dialogue was on screen in the latter part of the picture with all the sniffling in the theater.Eastwood as a director has a definite style, one that complements his acting métier. Terse lines, acerbically delivered. Some laughs, preferably dry ones. Camera-work that tends to the dark and monochromatic. 'Million Dollar Baby' as a story suits his direction well.Eastwood as an actor has never let go the way he does here. He's awesome in several scenes, quietly breaking apart. He has to give it all he's got, though, because he's working opposite Hilary Swank, who just tears your heart out with those eyes, that big-toothed grin, and the way she delivers lines like 'You gotta do me a favor, boss.' There's a scene with her just sitting in a car, making eye contact with a little girl and her dog from across a gas pump, and that wordless scene is probably the best piece of acting in any film this year. Freeman is good, too, reading comic books and working on getting his friend to warm to the girl with the gloves.The rest of the supporting cast is disappointingly one note. Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald has a trailer-trash family who wear their nastiness like tourist-trap T-shirts. No subtlety. There's a priest that glowers at Eastwood's Frankie Dunn and his wry questioning in such a way one wonders how he handles hearing confessions, and one nasty German boxing opponent who does everything short of don a swastika in the ring.The story is kind of rote, too, all very montage and quickly edited to discourage deep thought. Just what does this boxer find in 'Boss' Frankie to make her suddenly so powerful in the ring? I know, you say the power of love. But there has to be something more, and it's lightly explained.So is the run for a boxing title, which is handled in a way that feels like Cliff Notes, with a series of one-punch knockouts from Fitzgerald that neither ring true nor set up the dramatic tension needed to propel the story past the rags-to-riches cliché. There's also some business with some characters around the gym, like a mentally retarded man who gets picked on, but it's so truncated with the focus on the Fitzgerald story it feels like the padding it no doubt is.I think the main performances are so incredible, they carry the rest of the film with them. In time, though, people may not be as wowed with 'Million Dollar Baby' as they are now.'Million Dollar Baby' is good, solid entertainment through the first two thirds, then takes a very challenging turn that probably cost it some admirers. It's very engaging, and then it tears you up, and you will carry the experience of seeing the film for a long time, longer than maybe you want to. You can't fault a film for making you sad, or for being manipulative. But I think the films that endure are the ones that don't forcefeed you with emotions the way you are fed them here.",6,2,5,5 February 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Iconography, Not Hagiography
","Edward R. Murrow is presented as hero and prophet in 'Good Night, And Good Luck', but also as a scold and an emotional eunuch. It's a double-sided portrait that reflects the open-ended nature of this atypical docudrama.David Strathairn's performance as Murrow is the film's standout achievement, a man who has all the right things to say even as everything around him slides down the wrong path. Two of his CBS News employees are forced to hide their marriage from management's prying eyes, while the newshound himself is oblivious to their plight. One newscaster, a longtime friend and wartime colleague, seeks his solace when a columnist attacks him, yet Murrow can't offer up anything worthwhile.Sure he can upbraid his colleagues about sitting on their 'fat surpluses' while television is turned into a damn amusement park. But called onto the carpet himself by his boss, William Paley (Frank Langella), he does a good job of rolling over and playing dead. Of course he will be dead soon enough, thanks in large part to those cancerous weeds he's been helping sell across the nation.That's probably not the film George Clooney wanted me to see. Yet the movie he directs allows enough space and dimension for that interpretation. We see Morrow as the crusading journalist who took down Sen. Joseph McCarthy and anti-communist hysteria, straightforwardly with humor and contemporaneous news footage. It's not a bad story, and Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov tell it well. But there's something more interesting to me around the corners of the frame.'I simply cannot accept on every story there are two equal and logical sides to an argument, call it editorializing if you will,' says Morrow. That suggests a slippery slope from his lofty perch to ideological bag carrier, but only his unliked supervisor Sig Mickelson (Jeff Daniels) points this out to him.Because Clooney's film focuses on the positive aspects of Morrow's career, it is accused by some of being too glowing. Of course, Morrow's skill on camera is well represented, and we do get bolts of surprising humor, as when he tells Sig his producer, Fred Friendly, will have to forego Christmas this year.'He's a Jew,' Sig replies.'Don't tell him that,' Morrow responds. 'He loves Christmas.'But Strathairn doesn't crack a smile, and there are signs of strain throughout. The smoke he relentlessly inhales. The morose stare as he hangs out at the bar after a show. His painfully phony smile as he asks 'Lee' Liberace about his wedding plans.I'm impressed but not blown away by the movie on the surface. Clooney gets the tone and the iconic nature of Murrow just right, but he also inserts a superfluous story (CBS's secret couple) and allows a couple of weak performances, Ray Wise as the dejected newscaster and Clooney himself as Friendly, too much time.But Clooney gives you just enough of a sense of this other Morrow to make the film come alive for me, especially on re-viewings. It's not historically 100% accurate, but it's solid where it most needs to be and presents Morrow, warts and all, as a newsman worth remembering.Who can you say that about today?",7,1,2,6 May 2008
The Evil Dead," The House Is The Star
","While it's not the first film in the 'Evil Dead' franchise to recommend to a non-seasoned viewer, 'The Evil Dead' has pride of place for being the first of the films, as well as for being so visceral and intense.Five young people journey to a mountain cabin near the Tennessee border for a weekend getaway, only to accidentally awaken malevolent spirits of the dead by flicking the 'play' switch on a recorded recitation of 'ancient Sumerian burial rituals and funerary incantations.' One by one, they are done in by the grisly ghouls, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left to deal with the supernatural menace – or die trying.Billed as 'The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror,' 'Evil Dead' is markedly different from what you expect having seen the first two sequels. There's no 'groovy' catch-phrase in this one, and the terms 'deadites' or 'Necronomicon' aren't mentioned. (The 'Book of the Dead' here is called 'Naturon Demonto.') Humor is mostly in the eye of the beholder; on the surface this is a 'video nasty' that lives up to its name with exploding heads and a straight-faced, unforgettable depiction of tree-rape.I'm not on board with the idea of this being a classic. But it is a good horror film, directed by Sam Raimi with real flair and engaging depth-of-field camera-work. After a slow opening 22 minutes, the film kicks into high gear and never lets up all the way to the end.The film proved a bit of a slow-grower. A sluggish box-office performer when released in 1981, it has since become a bigger deal culturally than 'Chariots Of Fire,' the year's Oscar-winner for best film, as well as other big 1981 hits. Great, no, but it has a kind of greatness about it.'Why are you torturing me like this?' Ash cries out at one point.'We're going to get you...' the spirits answer, singing tauntingly.What makes the film work so well as I see it is not the acting, which is frill-free minimalist work to put it kindly, but rather the sense of location. The strange house, more a shack really, is a thing of wonder, with various rooms tricked out with odds and ends that suggest more than we see. There's a bit of a 'Snoopy's doghouse' effect going on here, as the house interior seems way too spacious and crammed with accouterments to match the exterior we see. There's even an attic visible in some exterior shots which never comes into play in this movie.Why are the kids so insanely willing to stay in the house when things start to go so wrong? The car steering wheel suddenly acts on its own, the bridge they drive on to the house gives way as they pass over it, a pendulum clock stops in mid-swing, a woman's hand becomes possessed as she sketches, and a trap door bangs and flies open by itself. Perhaps it's some moonshine they drank that was lost in the editing, or some pot-smoking which was scripted but never filmed. The end result is you never really care about these dumb characters, who seem more like lab rats than people. Without the same level of humor that buoys 'Evil Dead 2' so brilliantly, you don't care as much as you should.But that's more a quibble than a fault. The positives outweigh the negatives, especially in terms of the brilliant sound design by Joe Masefield (which adds immeasurably to the spooky mood throughout). They are further enhanced on the DVD thanks to dueling commentaries by Campbell and by Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, who play up their different views of what went wrong and right with what apparently was a grueling production.The end result was worth the struggle. 'Ultimate Experience,' maybe not, but 'Evil Dead' is a solid stab at shock horror that will leave you breathless, and quite possibly wanting more.",7,1,2,11 November 2014
Shrek 2," Okay Followup, But Why?
","There's plenty to delight the eye in 'Shrek 2,' a solid, amiable outing with some amazing graphic sequences that must even make the folks at Pixar jealous. But the finding-the-beauty-within-ugliness formula is starting to run thin, and the makers seem in danger of taking their creations too seriously.Is it just me who feels annoyed by a kids' movie really geared to adults? I'm sure your typical eight-year-old is all over the subplot of in-law strife. The in-jokes and movie references are getting more obscure. I mean, even 'The Simpsons' don't riff on Shirley Bassey.The storyline here is more of the same. Shrek had his hands full in the first film dealing with how people misinterpreted him. Now he has the same problem with his new wife Fiona's mother and father. Given they locked her away in a tower after she reached puberty, never to be seen again, you'd think they'd not be trying to micromanage their child's affections, but it is a cartoon.The fact is the filmmakers seem to think this isn't a cartoon at times, filling the screen with long bits where the characters, once apart, gaze silently into space while some pop drivel comes over the speakers. This is supposed to be meaningful, in case you haven't seen an episode of 'Friends,' but it's not funny, and it slows up the action.Even when the focus turns to amusement, it's a kind of half-run thing. Take Puss In Boots, the fresh new breakout character of this film. He's funny for about five minutes, but as a would-be adversary, he's over with way too quickly, and then he just kind of hangs around the corners of the frame.I don't want to bash too hard, because the film does work more than it doesn't. I didn't flip over it, but maybe that's because it's kind of a date film I went to see with Mom. I did enjoy parts of it, when the manipulation didn't seem too intense. And it may be the best-looking animation you ever see on video. But it's a significant step down from the first film.",6,0,1,21 November 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Too Cool To Rule
","'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is so cool it hurts. Really. It's so cool, the coolness gets in the way of it being a good film. Instead, we get an empty stylistic spectacle with cardboard caricatures, lame segues, and a weird snuff-porn schematic. How on earth Quentin Tarantino went from this to the solid cinematic achievement that is 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is beyond me.A bride is left for dead in a Texas church with eight or nine other victims after a visit from her former comrades in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. After a four-year coma, she suddenly recovers and sets about getting her bloody revenge.It's cool the film opens with the Shaw Brothers logo, telling us this is a homage to the chop-socky films Tarantino grew up with. It's cool Tarantino manages to stick in so many obvious homages to directors legendary and otherwise. But copious epigramming don't make for high achievement in film any more than in literature, and after a while the exercise becomes more obvious and annoying. There's no glue here, just a lot of winks and nods in scattered directions.Uma Thurman does a serviceable job as The Bride, but she presents nothing close to the nuanced, sensitive character we see in 'Vol. 2.' She just runs around in a Bruce Lee jumpsuit killing people. David Carradine, who gives 'Vol. 2's' best performance, is mostly MIA, and quite a different personality in his little voice-over bits here. The villains seem to do things for effect, rather than reason. One assassin allows her minions to get creamed by a single attacker without jumping in to lend a hand, perhaps thinking about the pension savings but hardly helping herself down the road, when she must fight her attacker all by herself. Another sequence has an assassin being called up at the last possible minute to cancel a murder, because he feels he owes it to the comatose victim not to be a 'rat' about it, though that didn't stop him before from shooting her while she lay defenseless on the floor. Beautiful people merrily subject themselves to dismemberment, disembowelment, and assorted mayhem, because it's cool.After a while, it all just feels like a massive put-on, something to go with the cool music and cool costumes and everything else. Even the dialogue, which usually shines in Tarantino films, seems perfunctory. Everything is subsumed by image.There are some good moments. Sonny Chiba delivers a funny and poignant performance as a retired katana maker of great repute from whom The Bride seeks help, in a rare sequence not belabored with blood or film references. There's some laughs amid the violence that show Tarantino hasn't lost his gift for balancing action, suspense, and comedy.But the fights go on too long, and feel pointless. Can anyone look at The Bride's battle with the Crazy 88 after watching 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' worked on by the same fight coordinator, and not see how hokey the former looks by comparison? The anime sequence is also overlong and bloody, not to mention self-indulgent.Maybe it was intentional on the filmmaker's part to have such a comic-book introduction, with broad strokes galore, and leave the human dimension for 'Vol. 2.' If so, it certainly works. 'Vol. 2' is a terrific film, perhaps more. But 'Vol. 1' is so cool, it left me frozen.",5,1,3,19 December 2004
Jerry Maguire," Touchy-Feely But Fun
","The best thing in the DVD of 'Jerry Maguire' is not even the movie itself. It's the complete text of the title character's controversial 'Mission Statement', invested by writer-director Cameron Crowe with the same passion, humor, and character-consciousness that drove his Rolling Stone profiles and script for 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High'.The movie is pretty good, too.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a high-flying agent about to sign the most-prized NFL recruit in the country when a crisis of conscience forces him to write and distribute the aforementioned mission statement. Summararily canned by his agency, he's forced to scramble to save his career, with the help of his assistant Dorothy (Renée Zellweger) and their one client, head-case wideout Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.)With this movie, it becomes clear that Cameron Crowe took the ball from John Hughes and ran with it. The kind of films Hughes used to make, of weepy love scenes and whipsmart wisecracks set against an esoteric pop score, are the kind of films Crowe makes, only with adults. In that way, 'Jerry Maguire' satisfies.What grates about this movie, and more with other Crowe films like 'Almost Famous', is the way people speak to each other in the form of taglines rather than actual human speech. 'Just jump right into my nightmare, the water's warm!' 'I'm her disapproving sister.' 'I've had three lovers in four years, and all of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath.' 'That's more than a dress. That is an Audrey Hepburn movie.' 'Help me help you!'At least Crowe has the good sense of turning the last line into a running joke. He also is helped, unlike 'Almost Famous', with the kind of top-notch cast that can make the most of groaner lines like the almost-infamous 'You complete me'.Cruise is electric on screen, finding the perfect channel for his high-energy persona in the always-on Jerry. Zellweger has a lot of gooey moments, but extracts every ounce of rightness from them to make for a compelling emotional center. Jay Mohr as a rival agent is a wonderfully hateful foil. I can hear him say 'Whatever' now.Gooding won an acting Oscar for 'Maguire'. Watching him, you understand why. Every time the film seems ready to sag into some touchy-feely moment, his Tidwell is on hand to keep things hopping and real. I can't say I understand why exactly Jerry is constantly questioned about the honesty of his feelings for Dorothy, though it is a major theme of the film's last hour. It's probably why 'Jerry Maguire' is not a guy film despite the sports setting. When people talk and talk so openly about their feelings, I feel like a nun at a Sam Peckinpah double-feature.This film didn't quite have me at hello, but kept me watching longer than I expected. Give Crowe credit for investing his chick flick with enough humor and energy to keep things from getting too soft. Give Cruise and the rest of the cast praise for strong performances around the horn. And give Dicky Fox a big salute for that fabulous final line. I wish you the same thing he did.",7,6,8,9 November 2009
Rudy," The Stone The Builders Rejected...
","Sports figures seem to have taken the place of saints in our culture, figures of veneration and inspiration who show us by example that nothing in life is impossible, that we can achieve transcendence by pure will. Witness 'Rudy', a moving film based on a true story of a runt who won't take no for an answer in chasing his dream.Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger (Sean Astin) lacks the grades, the size, and the social status to realize his dream of playing for the fabled University of Notre Dame's football program. What he has is heart, lots of it, enough to save up tuition, attend a community college, transfer to Notre Dame, and work on Notre Dame's practice squad, the human tackling dummies which the Blue-and-Gold scrimmage against between the big games.'Having dreams is what makes life tolerable', one of Rudy's friends tells him early on, when encouragement is otherwise sparse.Calling 'Rudy' corny is missing the point. Sure, it plays with your heartstrings, but the script makes its points deftly and manipulates by subtle degrees. What makes 'Rudy' more than tolerable is the broad, muted palette of cinematographer Oliver Wood; a serene yet surging Jerry Goldsmith score; and winning performances across the board, particularly by Astin as the slow-but-doughty title character.People who argue 'Rudy' is a recruitment ad for Notre Dame ignore an important point: The school doesn't come off too swell for much of the film. It's an imposing, elitist place, where with the exception of one priest (Robert Prosky) who tells Rudy the admissions board is 'a tricky bunch of squirrels', no one has much time for Rudy. Touchdown Jesus looms in the background of some scenes, a stiff, unwelcoming presence to contrast with Rudy shuffling off slump-shouldered in the foreground.All this is to set up 'Rudy's' great trump card, that Rudy the reject is going to accomplish something important before the film is over, that Rudy, like the stone the builders rejected, will become the cornerstone of the Fighting Irish football program. Maybe that's a bit far-fetched, but the Rudy story probably gets more play now than any Notre Dame legend short of the Gipper.Speaking of George Gipp, his attributed dying words to Knute Rockne are recited by Astin, and there's also a marvelous sequence where a subdued choral version of the Notre Dame Victory March is sung over violent images from scrimmages where Rudy is pummeled and pounded into the turf. Director David Anspaugh uses such tools sparingly but effectively: We never see an actual play in a football game until very near the end, which maximizes its impact.'Rudy' starts slow, remains a tad ponderous, and gets more than a little free with the facts (Example: There was no older brother 'Frank' ragging on Rudy about his Notre dream.) Astin's perfect coif amid otherwise direly authentic '70s hairdos always grates, but 'Rudy' is a winner, another in a long line of sports movies that present a case for man's transcendence in an otherwise dreary plane of existence.",8,0,1,12 May 2009
Quiz Show," Much Ado About Nothing
","Do you ever watch a movie wishing all the main players could just take a cold shower and get over themselves? That's the way I feel watching 'Quiz Show.'As a depiction of the famous 1950s scandal that revealed contestants of the NBC quiz show '21' were being fed answers, 'Quiz Show' brims with pretentious portentousness, from the opening scene where a car radio is switched on just as a report about the new Sputnik satellite is broadcast (an excuse for someone to actually say 'All is not well with America') to the end credits where we hear a way overwrought performance of 'Mack The Knife.'Many of the acting performances are very good, especially Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, the golden boy of '21' whose erudition is enhanced by pre-show prepping; Paul Scofield as his proud father Mark, who travels the lofty circles of intellectual society with admirable rectitude and the privilege of not having to worry about how to earn a living; and David Paymer as Dan Enright, the producer of '21' who justifies his shell game by talking about how his program advances 'the cause of education.'There are some terrific scenes in 'Quiz Show,' most involving two of the three actors mentioned above, like when Enright first broaches the idea of feeding a shocked Charles the answers to the questions, and a gorgeously shot picnic at the Van Doren home in Cornwall, Connecticut, where the extended Van Doren clan throws obscure Shakespeare quotations at one another, basking in the beauty of their Updike lifestyle. Director Robert Redford displays an engaging subtlety in these and some other moments that reminds you why people were so impressed when he made 'Ordinary People.'But there's a reason why Redford made that instead of 'The Chosen,' which becomes clear with his depiction of the film's Jewish characters. They are actually caricatures, and central to the story as the script puts a lot of weight on their distance from the aristocratic Van Dorens. One caricature, the jealous low-class Herbie Stempel played by John Turturro, rails about his intellectual prowess and the fact he was forced to take a dive as '21''s top contestant for 'Van Moron.' More obnoxious still is the assimilated caricature of Richard Goodwin, a congressional investigator of quiz-show corruption as played by Rob Morrow, so pushy he feels the need to tell even the guy selling him a car that he was first in his class in Harvard.When Goodwin hesitates to put Charles on the stand, his wife, an obnoxious caricature herself played by Mira Sorvino, accuses him of being an 'Uncle Tom of the Jews.' Actually, it seems an odd moment of understandable mercy from Goodwin, who otherwise ruins lives to improve his own in such a way its no surprise he wound up working for Bobby Kennedy.The Jewish issue keeps coming up, in the most heavy-handed contexts. When Goodwin tells Van Doren about being first in his class, Van Doren says he's surprised Goodwin doesn't wear it as a tattoo. Shuttered in a glass booth, Stempel wonders when they will drop the cyanide in. I almost wonder what kept '21' host Jack Berry (Christopher McDonald does a nice job with the role) from pressing Stempel with 'Is that your final solution?'It's just a quiz show, folks. Like Enright's assistant (Hank Azaria) tells the committee in the last lines of the film: 'We're not exactly hardened criminals here. We're in show business.' That Van Doren and others played fast and loose with the public trust is a matter for their own consciences, and hardly merited government interference. Because they were the only victims of their own crimes, the movie seems to implicate NBC and sponsor Geritol of the ultimate crime; frankly I see Goodwin as more blameworthy.Maybe Redford did, too, which is why Morrow comes off so obnoxiously in his film. But such divided loyalties do not help bring off a complicated story that is already overlong, nor explain why it is we are supposed to feel so sorry at the end for Van Doren and not Stempel. Is it simply because Stempel has bad teeth and a sidewall haircut? Or because Van Doren's ancestors came off the Mayflower rather than Ellis Island?Even when 'Quiz Show' questions such elitism, it doesn't really puncture it, nor does the film explain why I should be so up in arms about what went on here. I just see a group of people on different power trips colliding into each other, and while it makes for some nice fireworks, it doesn't leave much to chew on.",4,13,29,19 February 2006
Annie Hall," Woody's Last Laugh?
","It took 'Star Wars' to get the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to acknowledge Woody Allen's contribution to film.In 1978, the A.M.P.A.S. had a problem: What to name best picture of the year before? High-art dramatic pictures like 'The Turning Point,' 'Julia,' and 'Equus,' didn't really capture anyone's fancy the way previous winners had. And the films that did grab people by the throat were too mass-market for the elite's comfort: 'Saturday Night Fever,' 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,' and especially 'Star Wars.' Out of duress, the Oscars were then forced to do something it rarely did before: Choose a comedy.It was thus a perfect year for 'Annie Hall,' Allen's latest comedy, of a more serious bent than his past comedies but still laugh-out-loud funny. Woody plays Alvy Singer, a stand-up comic who starts the film telling the audience he just turned 40 and is feeling down after breaking up with his latest girlfriend, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The film then goes back to examine that relationship from its beginning through their development as a couple until a fateful moment aboard a plane when they realize what they have on their hands is not love but a dead shark.I like 'Annie Hall,' a lot more often than not. It's not a terribly engaging story, but it contains brilliant comic episodes. You feel immediately affected by Annie as Alvy is, seeing in her not the typical Diane Keaton of past Allen comedies, but someone more vulnerable and alert. The acting is stupendous, very real-feeling line readings that come across like spying on our part. And there is the rare gift of seeing a relationship end, not with recrimination, but a sense of mature grace.A lot of people say 'Annie Hall' is Allen's best film. I don't. For pure comedy, 'Sleeper,' made before, was funnier and a better story besides. Later on, I'd choose 'Zelig' and 'Hannah And Her Sisters' over this, and others who have seen them mention 'Manhattan' and 'Crimes And Misdemeanors.' It was just that 1977 was a good year for a comedy, and Woody Allen had a good comedy out. If it didn't go to him, it would have been Neil Simon's 'The Goodbye Girl' instead, at least according to my theory.People say this was the last time Allen made a real comedy, and I agree more with that, but not completely. What happened was that this was the last time Allen made a comedy for everyone, albeit one about the cultural elite. After 'Annie Hall,' he made films for the cultural elite alone. He later made films more for laughs than 'Annie Hall,' but not before shedding most of his wider audience with films like 'Interiors' and 'Stardust Memories.' 'Annie Hall' is about relationships, with which we can all identify. It contains five or six of his best-known quotes, and funniest situations. Some parts of the film have aged better than others. I still get a big laugh out of the lobster incident and the his/her dichotomy over 'three times a week.' I keep my opinions to myself in theater lobbies out of fear someone will drag out Marshall McLuhan. Parts of the movie, like Keaton singing 'Seems Like Old Times,' appeals to me more now than it did then.It would be a better film if the relationship with Annie had as much of a window on her life as it does on his, if there was more done with the Tony Roberts character other than a handful of droll conversations, and if Woody's social commentary was more spot on, rather than revealing how isolated he was getting. Witness his takes on rock music or West Coast culture, which feel horribly narrow.But you have to love a film that sets up Paul Simon as the other guy, draws laughs from 'The Sorrow And The Pity', and plays with narrative structure in such an accessible style. I don't think 'Annie Hall' the best film of 1977, but have no problem with its selection. Woody and comedy got their due.",8,0,1,14 March 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Brilliant Experience, So-So Story
","Watching '2001: A Space Odyssey' is like being run through a washing machine. You come out feeling a bit cleaner, a good deal more jumbled, and all wet.It is a film in four parts. 1) A gang of prehumans discover how to defend their waterhole from a rival band by using bones as weapons. 2) An executive from the National Council of Astronautics visits a base on the Moon to investigate an incredible excavation find. 3) On the first manned flight to Jupiter, Astronauts Bowman and Poole have trouble with their computer assistant, HAL. 4) Bowman goes on an incredible journey beyond the known solar system and comes out the other side looking both very old and very young.Behind all these elements is the sometimes invisible, often active presence of a flat black monolith, inert in itself but capable of producing powerful reactions.What it all means, other than an often confusing 2 hours and 20 minutes, I don't know, but you have to give it up for director Stanley Kubrick. He made a film unlike any ever made, dealing with vast cosmic themes and philosophies, and it connected both with its own time and on to the present day. '2001' is still ranked the greatest sci-fi film of all time in many quarters.The images of '2001' remain powerful in isolation, and the overall story captures the evolutionary nature of man's existence in an often gripping way. But between the long shots of spacecraft docking and the odd Gregorian-style portentous chanting, the self-importance of this movie does grate, not to mention the thinness of the story.The part of the film that gets the most attention, the standoff between the astronauts and HAL, is alternately fascinating and labored. HAL seems to be ready to do to man what we saw man doing to those pig-like tapirs in Part 1, and it's up to Bowman to avoid being left behind by the evolutionary tide, not to mention being marooned in space. Long sections of astronauts moving in slow motion showcase the brilliant special effects but go on too long.What's good is very good, though, a terrific standoff between Bowman and HAL, brilliantly dramatized by actor Keir Dullea and the eerily dispassionate voice of Douglas Rain, with a chilling, powerful finale. There's even some humor. 'Take a stress pill and think things over' is pretty funny when uttered by a killer about to get his.My favorite part of the film is the second section. Again, this features long slow-moving scenes, though used to better effect. The Strauss waltz accompanying the station-docking sequence still blows you away. William Sylvester as the Council executive, Dr. Floyd, has a striking cool efficiency about him that comes as quite a transition after the apemen in the opening. This sequence moves slowly but well to the mystery at the center of the story: I was disappointed to have it over with as quickly as it was.Some may wish Kubrick dropped Part 1. I wish he had dropped Part 4, which just throws a lot of half-baked concepts in the air and doesn't bother resolving any unless you happen to read post-film interviews with Kubrick or Clarke. One long visual sequence suggests what it might be like to be trapped in a Guitar Hero game programmed by H.P. Lovecraft.The last image is supposed to be triumphant, somehow, but winds up looking lost and sad. 'Going up or down?' Dr. Floyd asks earlier in the film. Down was what it felt like to me. '2001' is great for what it is, a brilliantly thought-out and arrestingly executed enigma. For me, the enigma is this: How can a film be so great without also being that good?",6,1,5,27 November 2009
Toy Story," The World Of Andy's Room
","Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.'Toy Story' is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when 'Toy Story' came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that 'Kelly's Heroes' was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines ('I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school'), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated 'Galaxy Quest.'While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. 'A Bug's Life' seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, 'Toy Story' could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of 'the claw.' If it reached for pathos a little less often, 'Toy Story' would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones.",8,61,81,10 May 2004
The Graduate," Benjamin is really me (and you)
","'The Graduate' is a timeless classic about the perils of growing up as experienced by one Benjamin Braddock, an accomplished graduate (a letter athlete AND newspaper editor) from a college back east stuck about what to do with the rest of his life. About the only things he manages to do is have assignations with the wife of his father's business partner and float around the pool at his parents' upper-middle class estate. 'I'm just drifting in the pool,' he assures his father, when the old man asks what's up. 'It's comfortable just to drift.'We never really get an idea of what Benjamin's childhood was like, which might account for his reluctance to move on. We see glimpses of his bedroom, an aquarium, and some model planes tethered to the ceiling, but not much. Dustin Hoffman plays him for the most part as a cipher. This feels at first like a bit of a mistake. Who is he? Why should we care? But then it dawns on you, as it did on me the first time I saw it, just after I graduated from college: The guy is me! By making him a blank, Hoffman and director Mike Nichols invite the viewer to pour his (or her) own suppositions into this affable but conflicted character.The supporting actors are also terrific, especially Anne Bancroft, who on repeat viewings is more the heart of the film than Hoffman in her heartless way. Every scene with her in it commands your attention, and it's a sign of advancing age when you watch more for her reactions than his. Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson has a couple of great scenes, and his last confrontation with Benjamin in his Berkeley apartment is right up there with Hamilton's final scene as Amity's mayor in 'Jaws.' Wish they made more use of him in Hollywood. I love William Daniels, too, who is both honestly affectionate and facile as Mr. Braddock, especially when he coaxes his son outdoors in his scuba suit for the film's ultimate 'lost-in-a-big-world' metaphor, featuring Hoffman standing lonely in the center of a suburban swimming pool. It's a key image in explaining the crisis behind Ben's inertia, that he doesn't only NOT know what he's supposed to be doing with his life, but more importantly, why he should care. ['Knight Rider' fans should know upfront that Daniels didn't do double-duty as the voice of Benjamin's Alfa-Romeo.]The whole feeling of late 1960s suburban culture is pretty immersive here, and put to fantastic use. As a child of the '70s, I can pick up on a lot of residue references. 'The Newlywed Game' plays in the background TV as Benjamin appears to pick up Elaine Robinson for the first time, and Simon and Garfunkel are effectively sprinkled throughout. The cocktail music not by S&G that accompanies the famous 'Are you trying to seduce me' scene is pretty great, too, an effective jaunty counterpoint to the tension between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson that helps underscore the humor and render the moment a true cinematic classic.",10,1,2,1 September 2003
Singin' in the Rain," It's The Cat's Meow!
","'Singin' In The Rain' is a musical for people who don't like musicals. Fast, funny, self-aware, and chock full of the best singing and dancing you can cram into 105 minutes, it might as well be the best movie musical since the entire genre peaked here, never to be effectively revived.Fittingly, the movie focuses on the birth of the Hollywood musical. It's 1927, and the silent-film romantic pair of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) find themselves suddenly wired for sound after 'The Jazz Singer' inaugurates a new era. While there are a lot of problems for the pair to overcome, including the fact he hates her for the nasty witch she is, the only real problem is that Lina's Godzilla-like ego comes with a Godzilla-like voice. Making their new movie into a musical might then seem a bad idea, except that Don's new girl Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) can sing like a dream, and doesn't mind dubbing Lina.Knowing humor abounds in this classic, clever film. 'You have to show a movie at a party. It's a Hollywood law,' says Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Lockwood's buddy. An opening sequence features a Hedda Hopper announcer introducing vogue-ing celebrities at a red-carpet premiere. 'They've been married two months now, and happy as newlyweds,' she coos as a catatonic couple stroll past.Even the musical numbers are done with a wink, like 'Beautiful Girl' and 'All I Do Is Dream Of You.' This would be a great film even if the most famous of those numbers, Kelly's 'Singin' In The Rain,' was left on the cutting-room floor. There's still 'Make 'Em Laugh,' the funniest song-and-dance routine ever done (by O'Connor and a mannequin) and 'Good Morning,' with some of the most intricate tap dancing ever performed times three.But 'Singin' In The Rain' IS there, and it fully deserves its place in the pantheon, not only with Kelly's wonderfully irrational exuberance but some incredible camera work that pans over and around him to maximize the uplift in this goose-pimple number.If only they left out (and not just trimmed) that Broadway musical number near the end, the pseudo-ballet with Cyd Charisse. It pulls us away from the story for 20 minutes, apparently so Kelly could have a section with his favorite dance partner. No one ever looked better on the big screen, or projected such natural-seeming charisma, as Genial Gene, but apparently he could throw his elbows with the best of them. It's obvious how much this film owes to the other director, the playful and creative Stanley Donan. If Kelly stuck to the on screen stuff, this would have been a better film.But what am I talking about? It's 'Singin' In The Rain'! I can't dock this simply because Kelly had a big ego. He earned it with this great film, a movie milestone. If you never see another movie musical, see this one. You'll be glad you did.",10,6,9,5 May 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Tangerine Dream
","A serio-comedy about love, 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' winds up being a lot like love itself. It's hard to explain just why it sticks with you the way it does, beyond some obvious surface charms. Unless you are one of those people who don't get it, in which case, you just need to give it another chance.A typically offbeat Charlie Kaufman script presents us with three days in the life of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a scruffy, despondent man so intimidated by life and love that he has walled himself up emotionally. On a seemingly unmotivated ride on the Long Island Railroad, he meets a woman named Clementine (Kate Winslet) whose blue-tinted hair and orange sweatshirt make her resemble the love child of Pippi Longstocking and Mr. Met. Is Clementine the one for Joel? And why can't he remember the song 'My Darling Clementine' or Huckleberry Hound?The answers to these and other mysteries are the content of 'Eternal Sunshine', which takes a headfirst dive into how memory and love constitute one's identity. Director Michel Gondry has a field day pulling the rug out from under the audience every five minutes, but he's working to advance the plot, not complicate it. Starting the opening credits 20 minutes in may seem pretentious, but watching it a second time, you realize how perfect a fit that is, just as you do the many other seemingly random threads woven through the fabric of the film.The richness of 'Eternal Sunshine' can really only be appreciated on multiple viewings, but give Kaufman, Gondry, and the rest of the crew and cast credit for constructing a film that hits one the first time with enough depth, humor, and mystery to make a repeat viewing intriguing enough even to those who aren't immediately swept away. It not only becomes a clearer film the second time you watch it, but a funnier one, too, where seemingly bland lines like 'Okay', 'Can I help you?' and 'You think I'm nice?' click like Legos that together make up a splendidly elaborate castle.'Don't make any jokes about my name!' Clementine warns Joel at the outset of the film. This is one film where Carrey is a safe bet not to do that, playing Joel as intensely low-key, alternately fascinated and repelled by Clementine's high-energy antics. It's a great performance that goes against everything you expect from Carrey, and adds to the film's wistful mood of love's bitter afterglow.There are parts of the film I still don't get, and parts I still don't like. Maybe I need to see it more than four times, but there are moments that feel extraneous. One, involving a trick Joel plays on Clementine with some ketchup, is described by Gondry in a DVD commentary as something he pulled from his own life, which shows his emotional investment in the product. David Cross can be funny, but he just seems wasted here for some weak pot jokes.Overall, this is a film that reminds me of why movies are such a touchstone of life for me. It plays the same kind of tricks as 'Momento', but with a Preston Sturges heart that belies such shallow trickery. If you want to see a movie that sticks with one like this does, I suggest Sturges' 'The Lady Eve'. Love may be a pointless game with guaranteed heartbreak of one sort or another, but the richly humanistic 'Eternal Sunshine' dares to make a compelling case that the game's only real losers are those who never play.",9,0,4,22 November 2008
This Is Spinal Tap," Band On The Run
","The gritty, unpretty reality of rock music is on display in director Marty DiBergi's unsparing rockumentary 'This Is Spinal Tap,' which chronicles the British metal band's tour through the United States in the latter part of 1982.Cold sores, drugs, late-night debauchery, and the brutal snubbing of a Sinatra-loving chauffeur are just some of the antics on display, in what could be the most penetrating and uncensored examination of the rock n' roll lifestyle since 'Gimme Shelter.' Whereas that movie features one grainy, out-of-focus killing, this film actually shows the band's drummer spontaneously combusting on stage! And apparently this was the second time that happened (or maybe I'm thinking of the drummer they lost to an unexplained gardening accident, I'm a little unclear.)DiBergi hasn't made a movie since 'Spinal Tap,' which is a shame. No chance he'll make a sequel though. In the 2000-issue DVD, band members Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls make clear that they feel betrayed by DiBergi's work, calling it 'a hatchet job' and hinting that his jealousy about not being the sixth band member caused him to show only the band's bad side. For example, we see in the movie Spinal Tap backstage at Cleveland's legendary Xanadu Star Theater wandering fruitlessly through a warren of back corridors trying to find their way onto the stage. Nine times out of ten the band found their way on stage without problem, as they point out on the commentary track, but DiBergi has to show the one time they don't.Murphy's Law seems to predominate elsewhere, too, like when Nigel's back gives out in the middle of a blistering solo, or Derek is trapped in a giant peapod prop for an entire song. Viewers of a particularly cruel disposition may even find some cause for amusement when a misunderstanding in Austin, Texas leads to the band performing their legendary number 'Stonehenge' in front of a model of the ancient monument that barely comes up to the drummer's kit. Maybe they could have gotten away with it if they didn't let the dwarfs come onstage and dance alongside it, but the result, as St. Hubbins notes, is almost 'a comedy number, and I didn't bloody appreciate being part of the comedy.'The band struggles on, and perceptive viewers may detect a slight note of friction between Tufnel and Jeanine, St. Hubbins's girlfriend, for example when Tufnel throws his guitar down on stage, stares at Jeanine accusingly for a minute, and then quits the band. Misogynists will say Jeanine is the kind of rock wife that 'puts the yoke in Yoko,' but they shallowly ignore her tambourine-playing, or her fearless use of red satin as a pant fabric.Admittedly, Jeanine is less on point as a manager, as an early gig under her control at an amusement park finds them billed under their opening act. 'If I told them once, I told them a thousand times,' she muses. 'Put the band's name first, puppet show after.'But the band soldiers on, and by the end, you will be glad you stuck around, too, rough as it is to see the harshness on screen. It's the kind of documentary that demands periods of quiet reflection to take it all in, to register the pain, sweat, and unpleasant odors behind the entertainment we too often take for granted on the radio.Sadly, the film doesn't feature a complete version of Spinal Tap standards 'Hell Hole' or the big-in-Japan 'Sex Farm.' We do get a full-throated version of the classic 'Big Bottom,' a power ballad which examines the seat of female beauty with a wry Steely Dan-type lyrical subtlety: 'Big Bottom/Big Bottom/Talk about mud flaps/My girl's got 'em.'Why don't they make songs like that any more? I give this film a 9 out of 10, but with the DVD commentary, you gotta boost that to 11. Rock on, Tap!",9,115,147,13 January 2004
Toy Story 2," Solid Sequel Lacks Some Fun
","In addition to pushing the envelope in what animation could do, 'Toy Story' was such a crowd-pleaser it was a no-brainer to make a sequel. To their credit, the creative team at Pixar used their brains anyway. 'Toy Story 2' is enjoyable, at times rousing entertainment the whole family can enjoy, but the sometimes clumsy attempts at injecting seriousness into the first movie have become much more overt and annoying.What's right with 'Toy Story 2'? A lot, beginning with the eyepopping improvements to the animation technology just four years brought. In 'Toy Story,' in 1995, the human characters like Sid and Andy's baby sister looked more cartoonish than the toys, while Sid's vicious pet Scud looked like an escapee from a late-'80s Commodore computer game. By 1999, the humans are so lifelike it hurts, especially if you are fat and balding like Al (and me.)Add to that a clever story arc that allows Woody the cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks) to leave Andy's room and discover his true origins, which turn out to be a great deal more impressive than he imagined. A Howdy Doody-like relic of the 1950s, Woody turns out to be quite a prize antique, especially when paired with fellow members of his old Roundup Gang, as assembled by Al, the owner of a giant toy retailer who has stolen Woody from Andy's mother and plans to sell the set to a big-money collector in Japan.The revelation of Woody's past is pretty clever, especially when we see excerpts of his old show with hilariously bad marionette work. The comedy involving the greedy, porcine Al (Wayne Knight) is well-done, as is the emergency work back in Andy's bedroom to get Woody back where he belongs. The once-acidic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) turns out to be quite the whipped spud now that there's a Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) in the room. 'I packed your angry eyes, just in case,' she says, and it's dynamite voice casting, like so much in the first movie.I never quite got into the Roundup Gang, however. Joan Cusack tries too hard as the spunky cowgirl Jessie, while Kelsey Grammer, terrific in his work as the Simpsons nemesis Sideshow Bob (an obvious inspiration here) brings nothing new to his role here. They are so dull that you wonder why Woody would even think of spending his time with them.It's ironic that the creators said the story was designed in part to deal with the limited availability of Tom Hanks, because I missed Tim Allen more in this one. Actually, he has a dual role, as two different Buzz Lightyears, one being the space action figure we saw in the first movie, the other being an upgraded version freed from Al's Toy Barn who joins the rescue mission. But the original Buzz, now that he's with the program, is a pale echo of his old self (which was more of a friendly, fair-playing rival of Woody's than a second banana) while the new Buzz recycles a lot of the fish-out-of-water lines old Buzz had in the first film, because, like old Buzz in the first film, he's just out of the box and doesn't know what's what.The movie goes off into some strange existential territory for a while, about the futility of a toy's existence which takes itself very seriously. Woody decides to leave Andy, seeing clearly a future where the boy will chuck him for more grown-up pursuits. One comment I read here asks if this is right; that many children, seeing this movie, might be reluctant to give a toy to charity, which is what we see happen to Jessie here. Worse crimes have been committed in the name of art then discouraging toy donations, but it does feel like this film is advocating an unnaturally backward position upon its core audience.Yeah, okay, enough dime-story philosophy. You will have a good time watching 'Toy Story 2' if you liked the first one, and most people did. It's funny, fresh, and exciting, especially with the rescue mission, and the animation is spectacular. But why do people say this is the better film? Other than the technology, it's in every way a lesser product.",7,1,3,12 May 2004
Chariots of Fire," God And Country
","A vivid, exciting testament to man's spirit and will to succeed, 1981's 'Chariots Of Fire' belies expectations one might have about a film set in fusty, honor-bound post-World War I Great Britain and featuring perhaps the dullest of sports disciplines, track and field. With the possible exception of 'Rocky,' I can't think of a more thrilling, satisfying sports film.At Cambridge University, Harold Abrahams runs to exalt himself and force his acceptance in a society he admires but at the same time resents for the way it holds him at bay for his being Jewish. Meanwhile, on the other end of that same sceptered isle, a Scottish athlete preparing for a career as a missionary in faraway China emerges as Abrahams' nearest rival, though Eric Liddell runs for quite different reasons, feeling God's pleasure in his speed and a way of using his athleticism to promote his faith in an increasingly Darwinian world. These twin, competing drives, each exemplary in its own way, find their common culmination at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris.'Chariots Of Fire' was the surprise winner of the 1982 Best Picture Oscar, and unlike other Oscar winners from that decade and others, it seems in its own quiet way to gain in stature with the passage of time. A lot of what makes 'Chariots Of Fire' great is immediately apparent, like the sumptuous period detail and the Vangelis score, including the engaging title music that had its own remarkable underdog run to the top of the U.S. pop chart. A source of ready, recognizable parody, the opening scene of the British runners striding across a windswept strand in slow motion is as gripping today as it was 25 years ago, when it inspired a generation of overweight middle-aged people to put on their Nikes and give jogging a try.Some other things that make 'Chariots Of Fire' great become a little clearer with multiple viewings. Take the Oscar-nominated editing by Terry Rawlings. 'Chariots Of Fire' is epic in scope, and seems to take its time developing in much the same encompassing way as 'The Right Stuff' would do with the Mercury astronaut program a couple of years later. Yet while that later film is over three hours long, 'Chariots Of Fire' weighs in at just over two hours, slow motion and all.Oddly, neither Ben Cross as Abrahams nor Ian Charleson as Liddell were nominated for Oscars. Both would have been deserving nominees. Cross provides an empathetic center as Abrahams, really the nominal star of the film, and a source of tension as he deals with the contempt of his social superiors both for being Jewish and for hiring a professional coach, Sam Mussabini. (Ian Holm, the only acting nominee, though he lost to John Gielgud, who plays one of the disapproving Cambridge dons here and won for his engaging if one-note performance as the butler in 'Arthur.')Cross gives a great, layered reading, but I'm simply in awe of Charleson's quiet embodiment of the Christian ideal as Liddell, especially the rainy scene after a meet where he addresses a working-class crowd about faith: 'Then where does the power come from, to see the race to its end? From within.' The way the sun pokes out as he finishes his address is spine-tingling, but not any more so than the commanding yet humble gaze with which Liddell takes in his audience.That's the message of the film, really. It helps to have a good pair of legs, but the greatest bodies are nothing without being infused by true spirit. When Liddell refuses to wilt under the pressure of his country's prince, who asks him to break faith with his beliefs and compete in a Sunday meet, it's the film's greatest moment of triumph, underscored by the words of a sympathetic noble: 'His speed is a mere extension of his life, its force. We sought to sever his running from himself.' So instead we see Liddell address a church congregation while the games go on, and his words are mixed with scenes of triumph and defeat. One single image frozen in my mind shows the film's narrator, the likable Montague, losing his big race, his face contorted in rage and pain, while Liddell's voice intones: 'They shall run, and not be weary. They shall walk, and not faint.'There are some dry moments in the film, and the romance between Abrahams and a young singer feels tacked on for female appeal, but given that women compete as much as men do these days, in sports and elsewhere, the overall message of 'Chariots Of Fire' feels more welcome and enveloping now than ever. Winning is a great thing, but reaching your true potential is the real race worth running.",9,0,2,12 January 2006
There's Something About Mary," Funniest film since 'Blazing Saddles,' only sweeter
","Did you ever see those annoying pop-up online ads about looking up old high-school friends? Did you ever stop to think that this movie is probably responsible? Really, there could be no other impetus for people to want to revisit the horrors of young adulthood then this sterling advertisement for reaching back and reclaiming the best of your past.Ben Stiller is a sad-eyed magazine writer named Ted who never got over the girl of his high school dreams, Mary, who vanished from his life after a single date in which getting horizontal meant being carted away in an ambulance. Ted has seedy detective Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) investigate a lead in Miami. Healy finds her and reports back that she's a walrus in a wheelchair. Ted thinks maybe he should check up on her anyway, to see if he can be helpful to her, but Healy explains she's now en route to Japan as a mail-order bride.Ted: What are they, desperate! She's a whale.Healy: It's a sumo culture. They pay by the pound.Actually, Healy is not being entirely truthful. Mary is single, ambulatory, and quite the fox in the form of Cameron Diaz. By the time Ted learns the truth, Healy's already putting on the moves on Mary with the help of a fake identity and a pair of gargantuan dentures. To counter this, without himself being exposed as a `stalker,' Ted has to reintroduce himself under similarly false pretenses. Will Mary go for this old near-flame? And what will happen when she learns the truth?A winning romantic comedy with gut-busting boundary-breaking bathroom humor and a sly sense of what makes people tick, `There's Something About Mary' is impossibly optimistic and reassuring even as it buries your head in the gutter for cheap laughs. That's probably what redeems it and makes it such a joy to watch over and over again, the fact that this proto-`American Pie' has a real heart. The makers of the film, Peter and Bobby Farrelly, reveal in their DVD commentary that Ted's reaction to Healy's news of Mary's condition is the key to making the film work, and they are right.Frankly, I could live in a world without `American Pie' and so many other stupid raunch-fests of its ilk, but `Mary' is pure gold all the way through. Not only is the comedy saved by virtue of its brilliance (I never heard a theater laugh so hard all the way through as I did seeing this in a stuffy Greenwich, CT cinema), it's also a very cleverly put-together film, with a lot of plot twists that hold up as well as the humor during repeat viewings. It's interesting to read people's comments and see them say that it would have been a good film if they had held off on the bad-taste stuff. That was kind of what put it on the map in the first place, the `hair gel' scene and Magda's breasts and Ted's zipper problems, but I see what they mean. You almost could make this film into a Hallmark romantic film, with minimal comedy of any kind, and it would still be interesting. I don't think I'd watch it 23 times like I have this version, however. The film never stops upping the ante on the ick-meter, a large part of what makes it brilliant.Diaz and Stiller blend very well together, with special kudos to Diaz for being so utterly wonderful and charming in the title role. You understand what the title means without ever having it explained. Also terrific are the supporting players, major ones like Matt Dillon and Chris Elliott as well as Harland Williams as the six-minute abs guy and, of course, Puffy the dog. Jonathan Richman and his drummer are especially valuable in their cameo bits that bookend the various acts in the movie, with songs that manage to be as funny and affecting as the show they are built around. And the end credit sequence is the all-time best. I still smile when I hear `Build Me Up Buttercup' on the radio, don't you?",10,42,60,4 December 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Malcolm In The Middle
","People sometimes call 'A Clockwork Orange' their favorite Stanley Kubrick film. Me too, except higher praise in my book is that it's my favorite Malcolm McDowell film. McDowell's portrayal of a vicious young hood up against a system every bit as cruel is what draws me in, and keeps drawing me in, time and again.McDowell is a young fellow named Alex, who in a vaguely futuristic society goes gallivanting off on assorted crimes with his equally nasty mates until he finds himself in the hands of justice. To get out of prison, Alex volunteers for a new mind-altering technique designed to rid him of his antisocial impulses. But is the cure worse than the crime?One of only two X-rated films ever to be Oscar-nominated for best picture, 'Clockwork Orange' has lost none of its ability to shock in the more than 30 years since its release. It still attracts hard-core fans while offending others. I used to be a bigger fan, back when I was a college boy. I even took a first date to see this. Needless to say, there wasn't a second date, though it's not only for that 'Clockwork Orange' hasn't aged for me as well as some other films I can mention.It's a very good film all the same. Kubrick's perversity and his structured style of storytelling are well tailored to an Anthony Burgess novel that operates like a boomerang cuckoo clock. The music by Walter Carlos, re-fangled classical melodies served up electronically, works very well with the slightly putrid color scheme and odd lighting to create a sense of prevailing unease throughout. In his other works, Kubrick too often tended to elicit either mechanical or hyper-emotional performances from his actors, but with the exception of Patrick Magee's embarrassing turn as one of Alex's victims, the approach actually works here because the film itself is something of a satire, boldly comical even in depicting brutal crimes like the murder of a cat-loving woman with a giant ceramic, um, sculpture.But what makes 'Clockwork Orange' worth repeat viewings, more than Kubrick's cleverness, is McDowell's lead performance. Though we get an education right at the beginning just how terrible a person little Alex is, McDowell invests him with such charisma, wit, and even grace that we kind of gravitate to him despite ourselves. 'Don't sing that song in the bathtub, Alex!' 'Watch out for that milk bottle!' There's no reason we shouldn't wish Alex his instant karma, yet the lively McDowell gives us someone to perversely root for. His narration, like Richard III's, is a marvel of mordant sympathy-stealing.While the film raises questions about the necessity of being able to choose good or evil in order to be human, and how society casually corrupts the individual, I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of people gravitate to this film because it serves up generous helpings of nudity and ultra violence under a decorous umbrella of deep thought and even a vague spiritual dimension courtesy of the prison charlie. Kubrick knew how to make a trip in the gutter seem elevating.However absorbing it is in all its parts, 'Clockwork Orange' is a one-man show, and for me that man is Malcolm McDowell. The way he smiles so menacingly yet with real allure, wipes a smear of spit off his face, screams out how he's seen the light while undergoing the Ludovico treatment, and maintains his weird bond with us the viewer is a marvel of morality-warping brilliance. McDowell had other great roles, but Alex is one for the ages. Is there anyone else who could make corruption seem so refreshing?",8,1,3,1 March 2005
Where Eagles Dare," Putting The Fun In Funicular
","'You ARE pointing that gun at me, aren't you?' Richard Burton's archly posed question reveals much of the secret to enjoying 'Where Eagles Dare,' the fact it winks at the audience even as it thrills them with the sort of derring-do fiction most people outgrow at the age of 15.I was lucky, being 14 when I thrilled to this singularly entertaining film. Burton plays Major Smith, a British commando sent into the heart of Bavaria to rescue an American being held in a Nazi fortress, Schloss Adler, who is expected to spill the beans about Allied plans for opening a Second Front. With Smith are several British soldiers, a mysterious woman only Smith knows about, and an American named Schaffer, who as he is played by Clint Eastwood, is one of those shoot-first, ask-questions-later types.Eastwood and Burton was one of those movie partnerships that absolutely should not have worked, except here it does to remarkable perfection. While Eastwood squints as he hurls dynamite and fires his machine pistols into the torsos of unsuspecting Germans, Burton shows off pyrotechnics of a different kind, bearing a brandy glass as he confronts a group of Nazi officers with the evidence that their prize double agents are not what they seem to be. Burton calls Eastwood a 'second-rate punk,' while Eastwood suggests that Burton keep it 'an all-British operation' next time out, and you smile not just because they are winning but keeping you entertained all the while.The plot is fairly sharp and challenges you more than you expect, enough to appreciate the film's two-and-one-half-hour running time because it takes that long to sort out all its twists and turns. Screenwriter Alistair MacLean, working from the same story he made into a novel the previous year, 1967, doesn't insult your intelligence as much as he takes liberties with your indulgence, and that is the difference in why this film is so well regarded. I read somewhere that Quentin Tarantino is inordinately fond of this film, and I can see why, because the humor and thrills are kept in steady, logic-defying supply.There's also a vibrant sense of atmosphere, not only with the mountain fortress and the Bavarian village beneath it but the funicular which connects it, and where Smith must face his most rabid adversaries in a sequence that is the most thrilling in this very thrilling film. As Smith, Schaffer and their companions wend their way through twisting corridors, dodging bullets and each other's quips, you feel yourself running alongside them, in a way few films manage to pull off.A lot of what makes 'Where Eagles Dare' special is the fact it does pull you alongside the heroes, making you feel their panic and elation first-hand. The back-handed compliment many offer here is that it is a 'Boys-Own' adventure in the classic British tradition, forgetting that such a story requires as much if not more subtle brilliance than the 'kitchen-sink' dramas more commonly embraced.Is it better than MacLean's still slightly-better known film yarn, 'Guns Of Navarone'? That earlier film does ask some interesting questions about man and warfare which 'Where Eagles Dare' ignores, but given that the latter film is more entertaining and amusing, I feel at a loss to say one is better or worse. Maybe if there had been a film version of his greatest book, 'H.M.S. Ulysses,' the question would be moot. Let's face it, if World War II was good for anything, it was good for giving us a world that allows us to ponder such questions.Why an anachronistic Nazi helicopter, especially when it adds nothing to the film? Why the annoying Gestapo officer, only slightly less superfluous? But even the weaknesses of this film lend a certain atmosphere to the proceedings, which one wishes were more common to such fare. Action films don't have to be low-brow when made with such care and joy.Nice work also by Patrick Wymark and Michael Hordern as the overseers of Smith's mission, stiff upper lip and all that to the end. Hordern is every bit the mordant narrator he would be in the later 'Barry Lyndon,' while Wymark's plummy turn reminds me of Robert Osborne getting ready to introduce another Turner Movie Classic. However played with one feels watching this film, one never feels cheated with all the talent and intelligence on display.",8,2,3,25 February 2006
Groundhog Day," Forever In A Day
","A wonderful, deceptively smooth blend of contemplative metaphysics and laugh-out-loud comedy, 'Groundhog Day' is a defining film for Bill Murray lovers who admire the actor for his touchy-feely side as well as his deadpan wizardry.Murray is Phil Connors, a Pennsylvania TV weatherman who travels to Punxsutawney to cover the annual Groundhog Day celebration. In just the first minutes, his boredom and misery about his situation quickly becomes a drain on everyone around him.'Some day, somebody's gonna see me interviewing a groundhog and think I don't have a future,' he quips. This proves to be an unfortunately accurate prediction when Phil wakes up every morning thereafter finding himself in the same place, reliving the same day. No future indeed.It's a perfect Murray comedy in many ways, one being how it hearkens back to past glories. Just like in 'Caddyshack,' his character appears locked in a struggle with a large rodent. The same wake-up line he hears every morning, 'Rise and shine, campers,' calls us back to Murray's film debut, 'Meatballs.' But then as the film goes on, you get the depth and tragic sensibilities in tune with later Murray, of quieter art-house comedies like 'Lost In Translation' and 'The Life Aquatic.'Later Murray is a mixed bag for me, but I enjoy this one a lot. He's so terrific playing Phil at various stages in a long path. It is a path, even if it feels more like a treadmill to Phil: 'I wake up every day, right here. Right in Punxsutawney. And it's always February 2. And there's nothing I can do about it.'The repetitive nature of 'Groundhog Day' throws not a few viewers, but I enjoy them the same way I do Murray's early work on 'Saturday Night Live.' It's like getting a series of short, black-out sketches, with the added benefit of each building to a larger whole.Director Harold Ramis, no stranger to this approach from his own glory days on 'SCTV,' frames many of these bits in a clever way. We see Phil go through the same motions again and again, like trying to pick up his luminous producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) by repeating the same basic lines with tiny adjustments to allow for her varied reactions. Repetition becomes the joke, and it's a good joke because it feeds the brilliant try-and-try-again story of life lived in microcosm as written by Danny Rubin and Ramis.What is the film's message? It's not easy to explain. Phil alternately becomes opportunistic, despairing, accepting, and ultimately responsible. You can see it as a spiritually focused but devoutly ecumenical sermon for achieving personal growth. Or, like me, you can see a black comedy of a man's miserable inability to achieve perfection, even when he has an eternity to play with. But maybe that's because I'm a 'glass-half-empty kind of guy,' as one of Phil's new local friends puts it.The negatives here are minor. As a Chris Elliott fan, I wish more had been done with his cameraman character than a few reaction shrugs. Some of the sillier comedy moments, like Phil dressing up as Clint Eastwood, plays like cutting-room fodder to me, as does an extended, maudlin sequence with a homeless man. At least that part ties into the acceptance idea, which is key to Phil's turnabout late in the film.But taken as a whole, which is the only way to take it, this is a classic comedy, worthy of the love it gets. Why don't the Academy Awards people take these films seriously? I guess it doesn't matter when the results shine through the ensuing years as powerfully as 'Groundhog Day.'",9,2,4,20 September 2013
Total Recall," Solid Arnold, But Not A Classic
","Now that Arnold's acting days are on indefinite hiatus, maybe its time for an in-depth appreciation of his cinematic work. No, wait a minute, I'm serious. He was in some damn fine action flicks, movies which in many ways helped establish the popular culture of the 1980s and early 1990s. He has a body of work now, with a primitive beginning of Cannon cheapos and the first Terminator, a fruitful and successful middle period (including this film, T2, and 'True Lies,') and a kind of flabby but still energetic late period. What's it all about?The problem is Arnold was never much of an actor, and even though he did get better, exuding real charm and some humanity as he went along, he was never going to be John Wayne in 'The Searchers,' or even Charles Bronson in 'Death Wish.' 'Total Recall' shows much of the limitations of his performance, like poor diction, unconvincing 'heartfelt' dialogue ('C'mon Cohagen, give dese people AIR' always cracks me up) and a wooden over-reliance on his brawny image. His wisecracks are hit-and-miss, like Roger Moore's in the 007 series, only Roger kind of knew when he had a real groaner and played it for what it was worth with those eyebrows of his. Arnold delivers lines like 'You think this is the real Quaid? It is!' like he thinks he's Noel Coward with an Uzi.I go along with much of what the previous poster from Saffron Walden U.K. said, but I don't think Schwarzenegger was quite as bad as that. He did have a definite something to offer, and when he wasn't required to project too much, he could deliver, at least until he started demonstrating real flair and subtlety with 'True Lies' and 'Last Action Hero.' Here, he isn't quite there yet.None of the acting in this movie is great. Ronny Cox looms over the proceedings like Olivier despite his one-note bad guy simply because the rest of the cast, especially Mel Johnson Jr. as the cabbie Benny but also Rachel Ticotin as Melina and Sharon Stone as Lori, are so obviously uncomfortable in the relatively undemanding roles they are given. Michael Ironside I'll give a pass to, he has presence, but I'd be much more impressed if I saw him portray a social worker for once, or St. Francis.But Cox is good, and has some juicy lines, especially when he tells Melina she'll be reprogrammed to become 'what every woman should be.' That's funny and menacing work. 'I'll be home in time for Corn Flakes,' too. I don't know how he figured on that, but at least here's one screen villain with an appreciation for a well-balanced breakfast.Also, the script is quite clever, and worth likening to 'The Game' and 'Momento' in the way it plays with reality and perception, by characters and audience alike. Like those films, it's somewhat handicapped by a lack of heart, but it's an engaging mindtrip when you ponder to think of the three different hypotheses it offers.[Slight spoiler alert] People differ strongly on whether Quaid is experiencing the real thing or a botched memory implant that ends with a terminal lobotomy, but it could also be simply that the program worked as advertised and Quaid is on the verge of safely waking up at the end of the film. That scenario has logic problems, of course, as do the other two, but at least this third possibility comes with the silver lining that no one is really ever hurt in the entire movie. [End of spoiler alert.]The mixed bag of 'Total Recall' continues with the special effects. There are some amazing shots of the characters' faces as they run out of breathable air (done with puppets, not CGI), and clever visual cuts like the blood-drenched computer screen that turns into a Martian landscape. But the sets are dreary, claustrophobic, and full of cheesy '80s neon. The mutants when we see them, especially the sad Yoda-wannabe Kuato, are from hunger. Comparing this to that other Philip K. Dick adaptation, 'Blade Runner,' shows how less-advanced FX can be more than made up for by a director with depth in vision. I for one don't see much of an improvement here over 'The Running Man,' which Schwarzenegger made three years before.What was amazing about this film, and still is now, is the rapid-fire pacing, the way the violence and gore mount with comic timing and at the same time carry the story breathlessly from one plot point to another. I remember seeing this in the theaters in 1990, and how people were exiting shaking their heads and smiling in amazement at what they just witnessed, the pure adrenaline rush it had given them. It still delivers on that count, and it's got that clever story arc besides. Even if you accept what happens here at face value, it offers up some brilliant twists, like the revelation of Quaid's true identity and Lori's part in Cohagen's scheme. Good films often work on multiple levels, and 'Total Recall' is a good film in that respect.So while I'm not wild about this one, I respect it. I like Arnold's choice in scripts. I just wish his acting skills at that time had caught up with his tastes.",7,0,0,12 July 2004
Rocky," Best Sports Film Ever
","The 1970s was a great decade for movies, maybe the best ever. People note two kinds of movies were getting made at an unprecedented success rate; big popcorn action thrillers like 'Jaws' and 'Star Wars,' and individual cinematic statements of artistic purpose, like 'Mean Streets,' 'Nashville,' and Godfathers I and II.Then there's 'Rocky,' a film that combines the best of both. It's an unrepentant crowd pleaser, with visceral boxing scenes and the tale of an underdog's rise to glory. But it's also a very personal, lived-in little movie, written and starring a struggling actor named Sylvester Stallone no one heard much of before (and refused more than $300,000 to give his role to an established star) and shot in an uncompromising and gritty way.'Rocky' today is a prisoner of its success. The first things about it most people remember are that it spawned a lot of weaker sequels (though Rockys II and III are still good films) along with Sylvester Stallone's career, which has had its share of misfires ('Cobra,' 'Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot,' 'Rhinestone'). They forget just how good the film is, how truthfully observed and comically well-pitched it is on the grim reality of life, mainly that most of us will die never realizing our deepest ambitions and desires.'Rocky' doesn't wallow in despair, though there is a sadness about the film, especially early on when we watch Rocky Balboa shake down losers for money and stop on the way home at the pet store window to wave at the sad little puppies who press their noses against the cold glass. Or the opening sequence, which is composed like a Depression-era painting, of Rocky and another boxer named Spider beating each other's brains out for a winner's share of $40.55. Spider's idea of post-fight conditioning is guzzling a beer, but when you're going nowhere in life, why bother? It's the kind of situation Paddy Chayefsky would breathe life into, and it's sort of ironic that 'Rocky' beat his 'Network' for the Best Picture Oscar in 1977.But 'Rocky' has humor and humanity that compensates for the misery, even before a cracked third metacarpal robs Apollo Creed of his opponent for the New Year's fight and forces the champ to improvise fast. Like the scene where Rocky asks his friend Paulie (Burt Young) why Paulie's sister Adrian (Talia Shire) won't give him the time of day:Paulie: Forget her! You're better than her...Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian's a freaking loser...She's gonna die alone.Rocky: Hey, I don't see no crowd around you neither.Rocky's courtship of Adrian is at first funny, then endearing, and finally intense. Their wordless makeout session at Rocky's doorway is all the better because it doesn't look pretty. Adrian is such an ugly duckling through the first half of the picture, you like Rocky all the more, loser that he is, for sticking with her through her painful shyness. (Her transformation into a more conventional beauty in the later Rockys is a key weakness of them.)The second half of the film is the better half, though, because of the build-up to the fight, then the fight itself. Nothing is played the way film convention dictates. Rocky walks into the fight promoter's office thinking he's being offered a job as a sparring partner. When the promoter tells Rocky he's offering a shot at the title, Rocky is so incredulous he turns it down. Stallone underplays and underwrites this scene masterfully. His best line in the movie is probably a single word, when the promoter asks him if he believes America is the land of opportunity: 'Yeah.' And he half-swallows the word. But it's hard for this lifetime loser to believe his luck has changed, even if it means exposing himself to the world's most legally dangerous human.There are some weaknesses, but very minor ones, like when we see Rocky tell Adrian he can't fool around with her before Mickey tells a protesting Rocky to lay off the kissyface. Most of what I see on repeat viewings are classic scenes that just get better, like Mickey's visit to Rocky's apartment and Paulie and Adrian's big yelling match after Paulie accuses Rocky of 'busting' his sister. Meanwhile, the smaller moments get bigger also. I like the late Joe Spinell's performance as Rocky's loansharking boss Gazzo very much, as he invests the character with real charm and likability. He's patronizing, menacing, and you want better for Rocky, but if he is a villain, he's one in Rocky's corner.'Rocky' also introduced us to the steadi-cam and some dynamite orchestral rock theme music that topped the charts in 1977. Mainly, though, it gave us one of the great film performances by Stallone, an actor who could play hungry because he was hungry, but could bring depth and warmth to bear as well, and a film that tells us the only real losers are those who give up on their dreams.",9,0,0,14 April 2004
The Untouchables," Making The Most Of Blood, Smoke, And Fedoras
","At the heart of the matter, 'The Untouchables' is a comic book put on screen: Its characters are one-dimensional; its storyline abounds with convenience and cliché. But the full commitment of its principals on both sides of the camera makes this riveting all the same.Chicago in 1930 is a 'city at war.' A gang boss named Al Capone (Robert De Niro) holds court in a barber chair, explaining he is only supplying a need. 'What is bootlegging? On a boat, it's bootlegging. On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality.' But Prohibition is the law of the land, and when Capone's ways of breaking that law include blowing up buildings and killing little girls, it's time for U. S. Treasury Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to step in.Director Brian De Palma was slumming when he made this film, according to a DVD documentary. Maybe that was the secret; he didn't press so hard. The film exists as a series of set pieces, much like other De Palma films, and the attention to stylistic visuals and atmospherics are there. But this time he lets the story breathe a bit more, giving you something to care about or laugh at between what amounts to an exhausting amount of carnage.How bloody is this film? There's one cast member listed in the credits as 'Gunned Head.' Good luck finding him, too.Iconography is everything in De Palma films. Here he not only quotes from other directors, but develops some iconography of his own, like a famous moment when Capone expounds at length about his love for baseball and another when Ness is told about 'The Chicago Way' by an older cop named Malone (Sean Connery): 'He sends one of yours to the hospital, you sent one of his to the morgue.' One shootout scene in a railroad terminal managed to both quote a famous film ('The Battleship Potemkin') and become uniquely famous on its own.The body count is matched only by the cliché count. Every pavement is slick with rain. A dying man imparts important information to a friend with his last breath. A couple of bottles happen to be standing on a building ledge just so they can explode in sequence in the middle of a gun battle. Ness actually tells someone he'll see Capone in hell.Many reviewers here criticize Kevin Costner as Ness. Actually, I think some of them criticize Costner as Costner, which would be fine with me except for the fact he's very good here playing Ness as unblinking straight arrow with a touch of vulnerability. Connery won an Oscar for his role here, and while he's quite good, I think Costner delivers a better performance. He has to stand up to the star power of both Connery and De Niro and does so, allowing them the big moments their characters require but keeping himself at the center throughout. I even like Costner's smaller moments here, like eating a sandwich and trying to make small talk with a young cop during a stakeout.I do wonder why screenwriter David Mamet has him talking like a robot at times, but I like how Mamet keeps the story focused on the action, which De Palma supplies brilliantly. There's some questioning of the wisdom of cracking down on something as uncontrollable as people drinking booze, and even a darker thread involving Ness's being tempted to pursue extra-legal methods in pursuit of his aims. Still, when you have such wonderful bad guys as De Niro's Capone and Billy Drago's ultra-creepy button man Frank Nitti, it's hard to stop and ponder the deeper philosophy at work, which is part of 'The Untouchables'' strength. You just want to see these guys die nasty.Also great in this movie is the music by Ennio Morricone, which stirs you up before you see a single character and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Yes, there's something simplistic at the heart of 'The Untouchables,' but it works so well I was left wondering if that stripped-down quality isn't the secret of its success.",7,3,4,21 May 2013
Die Hard," Monkey In The Wrench
","Sure he shoots people and blows things up, but there is only one moment in 'Die Hard' where smooth criminal Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) loses his cool: When a woman realizes what he is up to, and tells him he is nothing but a 'common thief.' 'I am an exceptional thief,' Hans says after vaulting a desk to get in her face. 'And since I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.''Die Hard' likewise may be just an action film, but it is an exceptional action film, an entry in an already overcrowded field of cinematic bloodbaths that dared to be more than a little clever and insightful about the human condition even as it upped the ante on the on screen violence.Hans and his Euro-goons help matters considerably, by projecting real personality along with the menace. You understand their motivations, enjoy their humor, and still relish their comeuppance at the hands of a New York City cop played by Bruce Willis who finds himself alone against the bad guys in a Los Angeles skyscraper.Willis became a movie star from his performance here as John McClane, and it is very good. Willis projects his usual smugness, but manages to ingratiate himself to the audience early on in a key scene with his limo driver, Argyle, who presses him on what he's doing in L.A. if he's from New York. McClane says he's here to see his wife, who works here, and alludes to some trouble in their marriage, saying he couldn't also move to LA because of his responsibilities to the NYPD.Argyle won't let up. 'You mean you thought she'd come running back before you packed your bags,' he laughs. McClane winces, but smiles. 'You're very quick, Argyle.' It's not a major moment, but it points up a key strength of this film. Everyone in it matters. Whether it's Argyle, McClane, Hans, a cop doing what is supposed to be a routine drive-by, a cokeheaded businessman, or a gunman with a sweettooth, the brilliant script by Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza and deft direction by John McTiernan gives everyone a certain weight and presence that adds to the proceedings.For most of the film, McClane doesn't have Argyle to talk to, so he talks to the audience instead, in a series of monologues made believable by the pressure he is under (he seems to be in the habit of talking to himself anyway) that give McClane a humanity and humor unique for action films. 'Now I know what a TV dinner feels like,' he says when crammed in a vent shaft. It's not that his one-liners are so clever, but that they come at the right times. Willis crafts a hero viewers can relate to, which makes his heroics more satisfying.The film also succeeds as a straightforward caper film, since the caper itself is intelligently designed and presented in such a way we sense we know where everyone of Hans' dozen underlings are at every given moment, even when the camera isn't on them. Also, the action scenes are incredibly well-done, grittier than anything else on screen at the time yet still entertaining.Okay, the picture is too glib at times, and shows Willis' hunkitude off more than I care to see. The phony business with the walkie-talkie chatter (you can't cut in on other people's transmissions the way everyone does here) is annoying, and the business with the TV reporter should have been left on the cutting room floor.But 'Die Hard' is a film every bit as brilliant now as when it came out, influential, never equaled, and incredibly fun. Rickman is a great villain. And what can you say about a musical score that encompasses Vaughn Monroe, Run-DMC, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Christmas music? This is a film that leaves nothing out in its ambition to entertain, and succeeds wonderfully.",9,6,7,9 April 2005
Psycho," Movie At The Crossroads Of Time
","What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, 'is not herself today.' I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that 'Do-Not-Disturb' sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word 'falsity' or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up 'Mother's' misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for 'Psycho.' Certainly 'Psycho' looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with 'The 39 Steps' and 'Strangers On A Train' and 'Sabotage' and 'Shadow Of A Doubt.' He only once again came close to making as good a film, with 'The Birds,' while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, 'Psycho' still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",10,212,256,10 August 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Sodom On The Hudson
","Anyone else play with the name 'Ira Levin' and come up with 'Evil Rain'?'Rosemarie's Baby' is so clever and audacious a film, it makes you want to come up with your own twists on its tightly-knotted storyline, a tale of a young woman named Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) who finds her idyllic Manhattan lifestyle shaken by a series of strange goings-on, not least of which involves her expected baby. Director Roman Polanski channels the best of Hitchcock and French New Wave cinema to come up with a new, ever-so-perverse, retelling of the Greatest Story Ever Told.That Rosemarie's baby has something to do with Evil Incarnate is what everyone knows about this film going in. But as so many reviewers here note quite well, the film is not your conventional horror flick, but something quite different, that uses atmosphere and mood to weave an eerie spell to stay with you long after the film is over.Seeing the film once is enough, but seeing it again really brings out the humor and pathos in this strange tale. Lines like the one Rosemarie says to her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), when she feels her baby kicking and notices he's shy about putting his hand on her belly: 'Don't be scared, it won't bite.' Or the strange girl Rosemary meets in the laundry room of the 'Black Bram,' full of gratitude to the couple that took her in. 'Real grandparents,' the girl calls them. 'They picked me up off the sidewalk.' The sidewalk is where she ends up, though, a few minutes later, one of the first signs something's wrong.Minutely faithful to Ira Levin's novel, Polanski nevertheless frames his film in such an imaginative way as to make it feel alive, and thus more chilling as it goes on, with its attention to Upper East Side decor, summer dresses that resemble paisley sofa covers, and of course the baroque architecture of the Bramford, i.e. the real-life Dakota apartments, whose own unhappy history give this film a guilty kick.That's too bad, because the film would stand up as well without any tragic real-life subtext. Farrow's performance (shades of Jean Seberg) is an amazing display of an actress in complete control as her character spins farther out of it. Though she was deprived of so much as an Oscar nomination (at least the Golden Globes weren't as asleep at the wheel), Ruth Gordon did win an Oscar playing a neighbor whose amiable kookiness conceals nasty depth, the best of a supporting cast that doesn't miss a trick, whether it be Ralph Bellamy as an unorthodox obstetrician or Elisha Cook as a fey doorman.The only performance many have caveats about is Cassavetes. Would not Robert Redford had worked better in the role of the struggling, amoral actor? Yet I find myself liking Cassavetes better the more I watch this film, his guilty laughter as he urges Rosemary to finish her chocolate 'mouse' and wear her smelly charm. He really nails a deeper sense of evil on offer, with his callous comments to Rosemary and his nasty way with a joke, at peace with a world that can ask, on the cover of Time magazine: 'Is God Dead?' Existential dread is at the heart of this film, and Guy presents a post-Christian figure that Cassavetes nails down from beginning to end.Polanski and Farrow give the best work. He frames every shot with the kind of depth and focus that reminds you of Hitchcock at his peak, while she, eerily resembling Twiggy, sets a standard for '60s glamour and acting prowess that makes you wonder how she failed to find worthy projects in the next decade. It wasn't really until the 1980s, as Woody Allen's muse, that she had the opportunity to develop a real body of work. It's like this film had some kind of curse on it.Of course, talking about curses and 'Rosemary's Baby' makes you realize Mia got off rather lightly in comparison. My random music machine just played selections from John Lennon and Frank Sinatra in tandem, and now I really have the creeps. So will you, when you give this a chance. Creepiness is a harder trick to pull off in movies than raw shock, and here is a film that sets a standard few, if any, have come close to matching.",10,3,4,17 November 2006
Ice Age," Fun With Fossils
","If you want a showcase presentation for your big-screen Blu-Ray TV, 'Ice Age' is a good way to go. It's brilliantly animated, with amazing texture and detail. As a story, it's more than a bit sloppy, and the humor is hit-and-miss, but it does get better as it goes and makes for painless companion viewing with the little 'uns.Long before the dawn of modern man, we join a migration of prehistoric mammals – heading north instead of south. For Manfred (Ray Romano), a mammoth, and Sid (John Leguizamo), a giant sloth, it's less a marriage of convenience than the fact they have no one else. They meet an abandoned Neanderthal baby and a saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) with an unhealthy interest in taking the kid for himself. The three work out a deal to deliver the kid to its missing father. Diego's true motives are just the start of their trouble.Basically an animated, kid-friendly version of the John Wayne cowboy flick '3 Godfathers,' 'Ice Age' presents a harsh winterscape of high imagination. An early example of a fully computer-animated movie produced not by Pixar or Dreamworks but the smaller Blue Sky Studios, 'Ice Age' is remarkable for its tactile depiction of snow and water as well as the strange beasts long extinct that make up its cast.It's not all that funny or engaging on its own. The banter is merry but tends to be unmemorable.'How do we know it's the Ice Age,' we hear one critter ask.'Because of all the ice!' answers another.The best things about the movie, beyond the sheer spectacle of it, are the voice work of the main actors and David Newman's infectious musical score. Co-directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha seem more amused by the plight of 'Ice Age's' luckless critters than they have a right to be, particularly a poor sabre-tooth squirrel named Scrat whose attempts at securing an acorn unleash a lot of Chuck- Jones-style mayhem without the twisted joy of those classic cartoons of yore. Any time the action shifts to Scrat, I wince a little, but the kids will like it if they are anything like the twisted brats I know.The film does get better as the relationships between the characters develop. The Diego story arc, as predictable and hokey as it is, pays off rather well. To enjoy 'Ice Age,' you have to believe in the threat behind the story, and Diego provides much of that. Leary is very good at working the menace into the jokes, and vice versa, though Leguizamo is easily the funniest of the trio, while Romano makes for a solidly enjoyable center.Some things are not well explained, like the reason Manfred is so determined to journey north in the first place and why he puts up with the annoying Sid for so long. The film moves a bit too slow, even after it brings together our core foursome but especially before that. An emphasis on sentimentality, like multiple close-ups of the spritely Neanderthal baby and Manfred's backstory as revealed in some cave drawings, give 'Ice Age' a weightiness it doesn't really earn. You just know the directors want to get the theater sniffling, as they admit in their DVD commentary.The best scenes do have the power to bring out the kid in anyone. If Blue Sky ever opens their own Magic Kingdom, I hope they offer an ice-tunnel ride or Sid Slalom of the kind we get to enjoy here. The film plays too much to its core demographic that way, but I found it preferable at times to the more adult sensibility of snarky Shrek or the Pixar factory.",6,0,1,25 November 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Col. Nicholson's Private War
","Disguised in the garb of a boy's-own adventure film, 'The Bridge On The River Kwai' succeeds in being one of the most cleverly subversive films ever to capture mainstream success. As adapted for the screen by two then-blacklisted writers, Michael G. Wilson and Carl Foreman, 'Kwai' sends up Western notions of heroism and race identity and dares to question not only the needfulness of war but the very value of winning it when weighed against the cost of one peacelover's life.It's a simplistic, perhaps off-putting message, but a unique one for an action-adventure film from the 1950s. As presented by director David Lean and four terrific lead actors, William Holden, Jack Hawkins, Sessue Hayakawa, and Alec Guinness, the film is not one you want to pass by.The focal point, especially in the movie's first half, is Guinness's Col. Nicholson, who leads his ragged troops to a Japanese prison camp after being ordered to surrender in Singapore. Camp commandant Saito (Hayakawa) wants to break the morale of his charges through forced labor, turning them into either productive slaves or else cheap corpses. Nicholson of course wants his troops to be neither. So intent on keeping order he won't even allow his men to discuss escape, he rigidly follows a by-the-book code that winds up getting him shut up in a tin shack.Nicholson may be admirable, but as Saito says, he is too proud. At one point, when told he is beyond the markers of civilization, Nicholson breezily replies: 'Then we have the opportunity to introduce it.' Later on, he talks up the idea of building a bridge for his captors. 'We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods of efficiency that will put them to shame.' Saito's no barbarian, though, just another soldier trying to do his job by a code even more stringent than Nicholson's.Pride is not a bad thing when it helps keep your men alive, and this Nicholson manages to do. But that same pride becomes all-consuming, to the point where he allows himself to forget his duties to his country and bends himself to a task designed to help his enemy win the war.Another British soldier, completing a triangle with Nicholson and Saito, is Hawkins' Maj. Warden, a commando of almost casual heroism as he totes a sleeve full of plastic explosives around his neck. Seeking to blow up the bridge Nicholson is so intent on building, Warden presses into service an American (Holden) who only wants to go home and chase women. As Holden's character says, Warden would prefer to 'die by the rules when the only important thing is to live like a human being.' Yet Warden isn't only willing to risk his life, but the American's, too.The movie's philosophy of disengaged pacifism and the 'madness' of war gives it much of its strength, though for my money it goes on too long making the same points. The subplot with Holden feels tacked on and detracts too much from Nicholson and the rightful center of the story. Saito slinks to the background too quickly after his face-off with Nicholson, hardly mattering by the end despite the fact he is a critical player throughout the first half.The point of Saito's character seems to be that he becomes disillusioned as Nicholson helps him accomplish his mission, his sense of honor offended by the prisoners' help it is his duty to accept. Here's another example of the limitations of a warrior's code, especially as we witness Saito's preparations for hari-kari and his admission he really wanted to be an artist.'Kwai' may be one of the most visually perfect films ever made, every scene framed and set with a jeweler's care and taking full advantage of a lush Far Eastern landscape. Add to that the unusually complex storyline, and Lean's first epic proves a very good one, a classic to many. If it isn't everyone's cup of tea, well, neither is war.",8,3,5,11 September 2005
A Hard Day's Night," Pipers At The Gates Of Dawn
","What can you say about the film that started it all? Where popular culture as we know it took shape in a 'let there be light' Genesis kind of way? Where pop rock became worth listening and not just dancing to? Where John, Paul, George, and Ringo became firmly established as individual personalities as well as the premier entertainment troupe of the 20th century?Only this: 'A Hard Day's Night' is good, yes, and significant, but it's fun, too. Still, and above everything else, it's a lot of fun.'A Hard Day's Night' is probably more responsible for the Beatles' enduring image in our culture than any single song they made. It came out in 1964, within a few short months of the Fab Four's sensational appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show that truly launched them globally, though they had been making great pop music for more than a year which was all the rage across Europe. 'Hard Day's Night' captures the band when they were still relatively provincial and innocent, not yet in the 'marijuana for breakfast' phase they were well into the following year when they made the zanier 'Help!' LSD, Yoko, and the Maharishi were not even on the radar, nor was the psychedelic era the Beatles would usher in less than three years later. Finally 'Hard Day's Night' clicked not only with the kids but the adults, who previously viewed the band as a motley band of overplayed haircuts. It gave all the generations of the time something they could agree on. These guys were good.The story of 'Hard Day's Night' is thin by design. We see the Beatles in slightly fictionalized form, with a manager named Norm and a roadie named Shake, traveling by train across England and ducking into a studio to make a TV appearance. Paul has his grandfather along, a codgy old troublemaker who nevertheless is 'very clean.' The irony of the movie is that the old guy, played by British TV star Wilfrid Brambell, is the one that continually ruffles the feathers of society while the Boys themselves play things fairly straight and legal.Grandpa has the best take on the meager storyline: 'I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery, and so far I've been in a train and a room and car and a room and a room and a room!' Brambell works very well in the film, a needful focal point in a film that requires some bearings in order to work. Of the Beatles themselves, Ringo makes the strongest single impression by showcasing his vulnerable side while John probably has the best moments with his wacky, caustic humor. George shines, too, in a scene with a trend-happy fashion maven, and married one of the girls on the train in real life, so he did pretty well here, too.Is it the best Beatles film? I think 'Yellow Submarine' is better for what it's worth, but 'Hard Day's Night' is the best film actually featuring the Beatles for who they were and what they were about.Great music, too. The sequence on the train with 'I Should Have Known Better' still works as a video, with all the baggage-car bric-a-brac thrown in for ambiance. Then there's 'Can't Buy Me Love,' which shows the Beatles in full-tilt boogie mode after momentarily escaping their studio confines. 'And I Love Her' has some of the film's greatest camera work, very moody and intense in its focus on how well the Beatles worked in a TV studio setting.As a film, 'Hard Day's Night' lacks a bit of heart. Not that it's cold or cruel, just a trifle too detached to get enveloped by, the way one does with great cinema. I don't really miss the fact that 'Help!' wasn't a true sequel; 'Hard Day's Night' works for its 90-plus minutes but doesn't leave you wanting more. The relationships between the band members, and with Grandpa, Norm, and Shake, are left unexplored, and you don't really miss that as much as you maybe should.But as a collection of small, witty moments interspersed with great music, 'Hard Day's Night' is a pleasure through-and-through. Like the scene where John cuts the tailor's measure ('I now declare this bridge open') or has that absurd corridor chat with Anna Quayle ('She looks more like him than I do.') Or when Ringo tells the crotchety train passenger who complains he 'fought the war for your sort' that 'I bet you're sorry you won!'",8,53,63,26 October 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Flower Power's Last Hurrah
","'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' feels like a movie lost in time because it is, a 1970s release set in the early 1960s, influenced by the late 1960s and, if the IMDb is an accurate measure (and I think it is) as popular today in a culture drastically different from those eras mentioned above.Why is it ranked below only 11 other movies all-time as of this writing? I have no idea. It's an incredibly well-acted film, by a cast of no-names who would go on to popular careers (and two who didn't, Brad Dourif and Louise Fletcher, give the best performances). It masterfully builds tension, unfocused at first, to a point where it is barely endurable. There's nice bits of comedy to leaven the proceedings.Jack Nicholson, whose lead performance as inmate R.P. McMurphy is also something of a title role, tells the director of the mental institution where he is being admitted that he got into trouble because he liked 'fighting and f---ing' too much.Normally a Nicholson film would leave it there, letting you soak in his rude, rough nature. Here the official gives the expected embarrassed nod, then raises his eyebrows. 'In prison?' he asks, and it's McMurphy's turn to blush.Ken Kesey's novel 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' came out just as the Camelot period of the 1960s was ending, and signaled the start of the 'do-your-own-thing' ethos that permeated the rest of the decade and which Kesey himself preached. All that was just about over by the time the movie came out, and the message of doing your own thing had found widespread acceptance only in its mutated, discofied, coke-addled form.The film is so committed to its gritty, realistic aesthetic that it never makes clear who to root for. McMurphy, more in the movie than the book, is out for himself, his interest in shaking up the inmates having less to do with any humanistic urges than a desire to have more interesting people around him to steal cigarettes from. Fletcher's Nurse Ratched is widely accepted as one of filmdom's great villainesses, except Fletcher's nuanced performance suggests someone more blinkered than bad, sincere in her concern for her charges, even McMurphy. When she does commit a rather harsh act late in the film, it's so out of character it feels like a cheat.Maybe I'd like this film more if I was a bigger Nicholson fan, like everyone else. Especially in the 1970s, he always seemed to play variations on the R.P. McMurphy character. I'd be more impressed with Nicholson's career if he played Nurse Ratched. But it's a good film, very tough in the way director Milos Forman plays off the texture of the famous documentary 'Titicut Follies.' The acting is so naturalistic it's like the actors never knew when the cameras were rolling and just improvised.It reminds me in that way of another film made in 1975, 'Nashville.' Me, I would have given 'Nashville' the best picture Oscar over this. And I would have given 'Jaws' the nod over both of them. But according to the voters of IMDb, the 'Cuckoo's Nest' Oscar was one of the most deserved in history. Agree to disagree; it's a good film, whatever era it's supposed to be about.",7,2,6,1 May 2006
Army of Darkness," Needs More Nikto
","(This review is for the 96-minute director's cut.)A film that aims to please as much as 'Army Of Darkness' does shouldn't be too hard to enjoy. But a weak story and flat characterizations did limit my enjoyment of director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell's signature inventiveness.The last of Raimi's acclaimed 'Evil Dead' films that all featured Campbell, 'Army Of Darkness' marks a major tonal shift for the series, as the horror elements that dominated the first two films are replaced by humor, and the eerie original setting of an isolated cabin is swapped out for an unconvincing medieval Europe.Ash (Campbell), deposited in the Middle Ages at the end of 'Evil Dead II,' makes an uneasy peace with Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and his people. Ash goes out to find the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, which has the power to send Ash back to his own time. Ash finds it, along with much trouble, all because Ash forgot the last word of an intonation he was supposed to deliver when taking the book. Leave it to Ash.'Did you speak the exact words?' Ash is asked by Arthur's bearded wise man (Ian Abercrombie), whom Ash calls 'spinach chin.''Look, maybe I didn't say every single little tiny syllable, no,' Ash replies. 'But basically I said them, yeah.'At the head of the evil horde roused by Ash's miscue is a familiar looking character, Evil Ash (also Campbell, in heavy make-up.) The series premise didn't start out being about Ash's stupidity, but that was what it became by 'Army Of Darkness,' now doubled by Ash's cruel-but-equally-dim doppelganger.Watching the two trade macho quips and get fooled by each other is fun for a while, but as 'Army Of Darkness' goes on it becomes obvious Raimi doesn't have much else on offer this time. He's still got that ingenious hyperkinetic style, with POV shots of flying arrows and catapult boulders, but as a story it seems oddly artificial. The other 'Evil Dead' films were artificial, too, but their accent on thrills and gore made this easier to accept.Here Raimi and Campbell double down on the comedy. Sometimes, it works, as when Ash and Evil Ash first meet and we find out why Evil Ash gets to wear such over-the-top make-up for the rest of the film. Yet the reliance on catch phrases gets annoying, as every action scene seems an excuse for a close-up of Ash saying something like 'Come to Pappa' or 'Gimme some sugar, baby.'There are bits of story that seem to get away from Raimi and his brother/co-screenwriter Ivan Raimi, like an alliance between Arthur and a rival lord which comes out of left field. And why is Bridget Fonda in this movie? She's gone after two minutes in a non-speaking role, yet was at the time by far the most recognizable face in the cast. If it was an in-joke by Raimi, I didn't get it.The director's cut also suffers from a lame trick ending, which I won't give away except to say it is both too obvious and too heavy. I would have minded it even more if I had cared about the characters.Mostly, the problem with 'Army Of Darkness' is that it both requires familiarity with the other two 'Evil Dead' films to understand at a basic level, yet pulls away so dramatically from what you expect going in as to make that backstory not only unnecessary but counter- productive. It's a strange film on its own, often funny and exciting, yet on the whole disappointing, too.",5,1,3,28 April 2015
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Lighter Side Of Sexual Harassment
","'Anchorman' is stupid, sexist and sleazy. And it has a lot of other great things going for it, too. Will Ferrell is a comedy genius, but he has never had the chance to realize his true potential on screen before this, a deftly-realized no-holds-barred laughfest that may well be the best thing in cinematic silliness since 'Airplane.'Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, anchorman for a San Diego local news program circa the 1970s, who finds his position and his masculinity challenged when newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) breaks the glass ceiling to become his co-anchor. As sportscaster and Burgundy buddy Champ Kind (David Koechner) complains, 'It's anchorMAN, not anchorLADY, and that's a scientific fact!'Koechner and Applegate are both terrific, part of a stellar supporting cast that includes Fred Willard as the station manager, Paul Rudd as a roving reporter whose idea of wooing females involves a pungent black-market cologne called 'Sex Panther,' and Steve Carell as a brain-dead weatherman who hangs with the boys without understanding much of anything. He even has to be coached by Corningstone when he tries to make a lewd come-on. 'Would you like to come to the pants party?' 'Are you trying to tell me there's a party in your pants, and I'm invited?'There's many ruder moments, like Ron's hair-trigger reaction to Veronica's acceptance of his date, which some of us will laugh at more than others. But it's hard to imagine people getting genuinely upset with a film as goofy as this. Nothing happens quite as one expects in a script written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay. Like when Burgundy takes Corningstone to a bar and impresses her by playing jazz flute. Or when, during an intimate moment together, Ron and Veronica are joined by a cartoon panda (bears and pandas are a recurring motif in 'Anchorman,' for some reason.)The best thing about this movie is Ferrell, who plays Burgundy like a polyester, Scotch-soaked combination of James Lipton and Robert Goulet, clearly channeling the late Ted Knight in his Ted Baxter role. He's a man in love with himself, embarrassingly unaware, yet somehow endearing. When he makes love to a woman, he declares: 'I'm storming your castle on my steed, m'lady.' When he falls out with later on, he asks her to go back to her home on Whore Island. That and throws her into a typewriter when she insults his hair.There's a couple of sequences that don't work, though other people like them. One is when Burgundy and his buddies break into song, specifically 'Afternoon Delight,' which slows things down and doesn't really add to the '70s ambiance which is otherwise kept subtle and on-target (like with an opening pool party that cleverly quotes from 'Boogie Nights' without calling attention to itself.)The other is a big brawl featuring several rival news teams, which swiftly escalates into something out of 'Gladiator.' This is a sequence a lot of other people like about this movie, but again for me it goes on too long and is too strained. At least it gets out of the way the obligatory Ferrell-film cameos from Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller.Overall, though, 'Anchorman' is a comedy that 100 percent of the time works 90 percent of the time. There's a lot of great lines in this film people will throw at each other around the water coolers, but it also holds together from beginning to end, a rare achievement for films like this. Every time I watch it, there's something else I like best. Right now, what's coolest about this movie may be the fact we get to hear real TV newsman Bill Kurtis tell us: 'Ron Burgundy was the balls.' That goes double, or quadruple, for 'Anchorman.'",8,2,5,21 March 2005
Jaws," A helluva fish
","Is this the ultimate popcorn thriller or what? It's maybe the greatest Hitchcock film Hitchcock didn't direct, mixing elements of 'Psycho' and 'The Birds' and even a little 'Vertigo' when the camera closes on Sheriff Brodie as the Kitner boy explodes in a smorgasbord of red foam and flailing limbs.It's not Hitchcock who directed this film, but some other guy who has gone on to do some other stuff. It's probably true that other stuff has sometimes been deeper ('Close Encounters'), more exciting ('Raiders of the Lost Ark'), more gripping ('Saving Private Ryan'), or more fluid in mixing humor and horror (the first 'Jurassic Park'). But 'Jaws' was the most perfect movie Steven Spielberg ever made, as perfect and efficient an entertainment vehicle as Bruce was an eating machine.When this movie first came out, I wanted nothing to do with it. I was all of nine, and liked swimming on the beach. I saw the effect this movie had on kids who didn't want to swim out with me at the beach anymore. It wasn't until many years later that I saw the movie, and I was blown away. Not so much by the nasty shark attacks, though there are some shocking moments in this movie. I was shocked rather by the excellent acting, the absorbing plot, the whole story, even the spectacle of life in New England in the 1970s with all the bad bathing suits, ridiculous hair, and beach music like 'You're Having My Baby' and 'I Honestly Love You.' Oh, yeah, okay, those shark attacks are pretty special, too.There's some very good things in this movie, some great things, and then there's Robert Shaw, who's beyond everything. He manages to be both the dramatic heavy and comic relief, the glue behind the male bonding that centers the final third of the film. If Shaw wasn't so good, the whole finale would seem illogical (Why did he smash that radio? Why is he gunning that motor when the boat is clearly failing?) As his WWII story makes clear, he's wrestling with major league survivor's guilt, not to mention a desire to go mano-a-mano with the monster of his nightmares. He almost wills himself into the shark's maw with nothing but a machete in his hands.What a master of detail Spielberg is. He's like John Ford, so bored in on the humanity of every character, big and small, as epic in his scope, protean in his range, and even faster with his pacing. Every time I watch this movie, and I do so a lot, usually in the summer, I pick up on something else I really like. Maybe it's the vignettes of small-town coastal life, the anatomy lesson of a rickety vessel in distress, Mrs. Brodie's subtle goading of her husband, or Polly the slope-shouldered old lady and Brodie's receptionist who thinks a community crisis is when the nine-year-olds are 'karating' the picket fences. John Williams' score is rousing and brilliant, not just during the shark attacks but the moments in between when he references sea chanties and the like. Killer cinematography, too. Did waters ever look so blue, or skies so brightly azure, as they do during the voyage of the Orca? Murray Hamilton's mayor is a wonderful minor character, right up to the moment he suddenly realizes the waters around him are too deep and bloody to negotiate any more. ('My children were in that water, too.')But it always comes back to Shaw and Quint. Great lines, great moments, great shots, quiet ones of him standing in the pulpit with his rifle, noisy ones of him laughing with Hooper and Brodie, even goofy ones of him using the chalkboard at Town Hall to make a point. Even Richard Dreyfus's nasal, cutsey whining becomes effective counterpoint when set against the barnacly bluster of Capt. Quint. Shame Shaw didn't survive the decade; he and Peter Sellers were the two most missed actors in the 1980s.This is as much a movie for the summer as 'It's A Wonderful Life' is for Christmas. Even if you live in Nebraska, do yourself a favor one evening, pretend the cornfields outside are the raging Atlantic, and pop 'Jaws' into your video machine. Forget Moby Dick. There's no better fish story on the planet.",10,2,4,12 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Darth's Draggy Debut
","I checked out of the 'Star Wars' target demographic long ago, and can only look at the newer films with disengagement. Is it me, or is it writer-director George Lucas?The third installment in the now-complete six-film saga, 'Revenge Of The Sith' puts into place the backstory of the 'Star Wars' series's best-known character. We see young Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) fall away from his Jedi teachings and friend Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), pledge allegiance to an evil emperor, and become a Sith Lord named Darth Vader.The great thing about the first three Star Wars movies, the ones known now as Episodes IV, V, and VI, was that they were fun. That element has been largely missing in the later prequel trilogy. 'Revenge Of The Sith' is a case in point.Things begin messily but promisingly as Anakin and Obi-Wan sneak into a starship in the middle of a battle. The banter is stale, and the CGI and blue-screen effects make for an artificial feeling. Yet as the pair wiggle in and out of elevator shafts and cut through battle droids, I recalled some of the excitement and energy of Luke and Leia in the Death Star.After that, thrills are few. Convoluted politics and unconvincing dialogue dominate the film, along with pitched battles never lasting more than a few seconds on screen. Lucas doubles down on the weakest element of Episode II, Anakin's romance with Padme (Natalie Portman). For long sequences, the two stand like statues delivering wretched lines like these:'You are so beautiful.''It's only because I'm so in love.''No, it's because I'm so in love with you.'It's not the actors' fault. In Lucas's hands, all the characters, except the distinctively different Yoda, speak with the same wooden voice. McGregor does carve out something interesting this time, an approximation of Alec Guinness's voice and acting style. It's a touching tribute, but a bit off. 'Revenge' works harder at setting the stage for Episode IV than at forging an identity of its own.Anakin's transformation into Darth is what 'Revenge' is about, and where it fails most. Fears of Padme dying cause his fall from grace, tapping childhood abandonment issues. Never mind that Padme is healthy enough at present, or that the Sith Lord seducing Anakin is so transparent most of us had him figured out in Episode I. We see Anakin sulking at Jedi council meetings and killing a helpless prisoner, yet when he finally switches into Darth it's too sudden to convince.We do get a decent light-saber battle between Darth and Obi-Wan on a volcanic planet. Any 'Star Wars' fan will enjoy the first appearance of Darth in his signature helmet and gear. But it's a long wait, and the portentious, pretentious 'Revenge' doesn't reward your patience as much as test it.'Revenge' deserves credit for attempting to tie together two sets of loose ends, those from the prequels and from Episode IV. But on its own, it's just not enough fun.",4,2,6,23 February 2010
Ray," Art Of Darkness
","'Ray' the movie, like Ray Charles the man, overcomes seemingly impossible odds. Jamie Foxx playing Ray? That's like casting Chevy Chase as Abe Lincoln. Sentimental flashback sequences every 15 minutes? Check. Sudden songbursts out of a 1930s Busby Berkeley production. Why not?Yet because of and not despite those elements, 'Ray' works quite well, playing to the legend rather than the reality of Ray Charles' incredible life yet allowing for both vitality and complexity. If director Taylor Hackford can't avoid his standard pitfall of a dodgy script, at least his talent for marrying music and glitz is on fine display, and in Foxx he finds his best lead performance since Ray Sharkey in 'The Idolmaker.''You have any idea how it feels to go blind and still be afraid of the dark?' Foxx as Charles cries out. 'And every day, you stand and pray just for a little light, and you don't get nothing.'Well, he did get a few gold records, thanks to an incredible talent not only to make compelling R&B music, but to refashion the face of pop by effortlessly crossing over into jazz, country, and especially gospel. Ray Charles' blindness gave him a perspective sighted people missed, on how music is music regardless of boundaries. At its best, 'Ray' allows you to visualize this as we see many of his best-loved songs mimed brilliantly by Foxx to Charles' vocal tracks, both period recordings and performances especially for the film cut just before Charles' death.That Foxx won the Oscar for Best Actor in 2005 is no shock. He not only looks the part, but emulates Charles so well you get confused when photos of the real Ray run with the end credits. The way Foxx dominates every scene from first to last is like seeing George C. Scott in 'Patton' or Laurence Olivier in 'Richard III', an acting clinic from someone known previously as a sketch comic.That 'Ray' was nominated for Best Picture is more of a surprise, at least to me. I liked it more than the film that did win that year's Oscar, but it's overlong and more than a tad manipulative. The bus that drove Ray 3,000 miles has scarcely pulled off the curb in Seattle when Ray makes the acquaintance of a hustling street musician named Quincy Jones. Exposition disguised as conversation abounds. There's a long, trite bit of fakery about Charles being banned in Georgia for refusing to play in a segregated venue, and another showing him confronted about mixing gospel and blues.But as long as the camera stays on Foxx, something brilliant is happening all the time. Hackford and his team do their part, too, with amazing simulated performance footage that gets across just how gut-wrenching, and even criminal, this now golden-oldie-circuit music was in its time. There are terrific supporting performances, too, like Clifton Powell as Ray's conscientious right-hand Jeff Brown, Wendell Pierce as a gruff road manager, and Curtis Armstrong (Booger from 'Revenge Of The Nerds'!) as an effectively low-key Ahmet Ertegun, signing Ray to Atlantic Records.One standout moment featuring C.J. Sanders as the young boy Ray going blind and Sharon Warren as his mother dares you not to blubber as her tough love is rewarded with a cricket's chirrup.At two-and-a-half hours, this film is too long and tries to cover too much ground. Yet some of the deleted scenes in the DVD should have stayed, like Ray dressing down a trumpeter in mid-show. Whatever its flaws, 'Ray' is highly entertaining, visually exciting, and worth watching just to witness an actor at the peak of his art, playing a musician at the peak of his.",7,1,2,29 June 2007
The Terminal," America, America
","'The Terminal' is the kind of film a director can make only when he owns the studio. A small-scale single-person story about waiting in an airport featuring big stars on a giant set, it is neither the best nor worst film Steven Spielberg ever made, but interesting despite its flaws.Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional central European republic of Krakhosia who finds himself stuck at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City when a civil war breaks out back home, effectively stranding him at the airport itself. There he makes do as best he can.'You have no legal right to enter the United States, and I have no legal right to detain you,' explains the head of JFK's security force (Stanley Tucci). 'It seems you have fallen through a small crack in the system.'Tucci plays the film's heavy, one of several key elements of the film that doesn't really work. Yet this is not a bad Spielberg film like '1941' or 'The Lost World.' 'The Terminal' at its best showcases Hanks' engagingly odd Latka-esquire character and Spielberg's bold attempt at melding French New Wave to Bill Forsyth at his early-80s whimsical peak. Even when the film veers into a logic-defying romance subplot between Hanks and an adulterous flight attendant played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, it never entirely loses you, and there are nice moments throughout that show why, even when operating at less than full steam, Spielberg is the greatest filmmaker of his kind since Frank Capra. He excels at pushing buttons his audience doesn't even know are there.I first saw this movie in a theater with a woman from Russia, who found the film much funnier than I did. An immigrant herself, I think she responded to Navorski as a doughty representative of the immigrant spirit of American culture though no immigrant himself (he plans to return to Krakhosia eventually.) As Navorski sets to work carving a life in the airport terminal, he wins support from a veritable melting pot of ethnic and racial types who find common cause in his welfare.There are some virtuoso moments from Spielberg, like a long crane shot that pulls to reveal Navorski as the small cog he is at JFK, but for the most part he keeps things simple. The script overplays its hand throughout, however. Navorski isn't just well-regarded by the airport workers; they stick photocopies of his handprint at their work stations and follow him like the Pied Piper as he walks to the front gate. Tucci's Frank Dixon comes unglued as he is lectured by a superior about learning from Navorski. The romance with the flight attendant drowns under a sea of artificial dialogue.The ending is rather weak, too. Though it references a cool bit of real cultural history, discovering the reason behind Navorski's visit doesn't really pay off for the story.Yet I'm a sucker for any film set in New York that references Tony Randall, Yeoman Rand, and 'Strangers In The Night,' and finds the value and comedy of life even when stuck in an airport. 'The Terminal' doesn't hold your attention like classic Spielberg, but it does reward it now and then.",5,0,2,25 February 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Scheme Of Hope
","'The Shawshank Redemption' isn't only a movie these days; it's a statement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped underfoot by a system they didn't understand. Yet watching the film with that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying emotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that 'salvation lies within.' Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.'Hope can drive a man insane,' Red warns Andy. 'It's got no use on the inside.' Andy doesn't agree.It's true what other commenters say: You can't pass two-and-a-half hours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough cleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood blockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players. Based on the Stephen King novella, 'Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption,' it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the powerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who uses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast, his quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film 'Harvey' Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing 'the guy who can get it for you' with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict ('fresh fish') is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne.'Shawshank' is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile, justice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too on-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true and natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details, that you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to. It's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message touches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of Shawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the idea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its belief that 'a warm place without memory' is not out of reach pulls us in. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so inclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other levels, too.Finally, it's a great story, well told. People will always have a need for such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine and noble as they are here. Andy wants out of 'Shawshank' bad, but for viewers it turns out being a fine place to serve time in.",9,1,1,1 May 2011
Paths of Glory," The Enemy Is Us
","Stanley Kubrick reportedly said 'Paths Of Glory' was not anti-war so much as anti-idiocy-in-power. Yet it's hard to tell when the idiocy begins and the war ends, one of many striking impressions left by this singularly striking film.It is World War I, and French and German armies are stuck in an entrenched stalemate. Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) is ordered by his overbearing superior Gen. Mireau (George Macready) to take a German high position known as the 'Ant Hill'. Mireau is eying a promotion, so when Dax's soldiers are pushed back, he takes it personally and orders soldiers under Dax's command executed for cowardice. Dax takes their defense.There are those who say director Stanley Kubrick had difficulty in his films with brevity and human feelings. I'm one of them. 'Paths Of Glory' proves me wrong. It's less than 90 minutes from beginning to end, shorter than some R. Kelly videos, and packed throughout with a kind of raw emotion that tugs at you without slipping into sentiment or hyperbole. This is best displayed in the film's jawdropper of an ending, but always present, whether it's Dax leading his doomed command across No-Man's Land or two soldiers the night before asking each other earnestly if it's better to be shot or blown up.You never glimpse so much as one German soldier in the entire film, even during the big attack, shot from the side at waist level as if the stricken Frenchmen are going to fall in your lap. The underlying of the movie may be war is hell, but it doesn't help when you are led by those with their own selfish agendas foremost in mind. As Pogo once said around this time: 'We have met the enemy and he is us.'Douglas is the one star of this film, of course, and in impressive command throughout, whether bucking up his men or bandying words with slick Gen. Broulard (Adolphe Menjou). But Macready is the one who leaves the strongest impression, a character actor memorably parodied in his time by Lenny Bruce as a diabolically fast-talking airplane-glue addict. Clearly nuts at the start, Mireau seems utterly blissful in his ignorant selfishness, proclaiming himself 'the only completely innocent man in this whole affair'. The shame of it is, compared to Broulard, he is.'If those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones,' Mireau screams after witnessing the near-decimation of Dax's command. But Broulard knows the men gave their best effort, and backs the executions anyway for 'morale'.Great supporting performances, too, by Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel, and especially Timothy Carey as three condemned soldiers; Wayne Morris as a slippery lieutenant; and Richard Anderson, later Steve Austin's tan boss on 'The Six-Million-Dollar Man', as Mireau's unctuous chief of staff, dedicated to seeing the men executed yet showing some understated remorse at the end.No attempts are made by any of the cast at French accents; the only accents audible here are Brooklynese. Like another screen classic, 'Amadeus', this makes the story feel less exotic and more natural to American ears, and hence less easy to dismiss as 'other people's problems'.Ultimately this is Kubrick's film, though. In shot after memorable shot, he serves up a classic of economy and raw emotional power, and if you click on the 'trivia' feature here, you find he got the girl besides. Kubrick made more celebrated films, but this is his best film ever, one of the best ever made.",10,0,1,25 October 2007
Shrek," Green Power
","'Shrek' is fun. People who haven't seen this movie, and are wary of seeing what's popular, should give it a try. It's worth watching, and will probably win you over.Taking a Fractured Fairy Tale approach to a 'Beauty And The Beast'-type plot, throwing in a few mild profanities, flatulence jokes, and Michael Myers' over-the-top faux-Scots accent, 'Shrek' shows off a very snarky humor, full of jokes that will likely go over the heads of a cartoon's target audience while registering with their parents. 'Sure it's big enough, but look at the location,' Shrek observes upon seeing a giant castle in the middle of nowhere. The kids, though, will love 'Shrek' every bit as much. It's impossible not to be carried along by its merry madness.Myers, as the title character, is certainly easier to take than he was in his last Austin Powers movie, his voice work registering real tenderness as well as the expected laughs as a misunderstood ogre who would rather tell a group of frightened villagers about the cruelties he will inflict on them and their dead bodies than cause those villagers any genuine harm. He's a bit of a softie, actually, and scared to let anyone know it.Cameron Diaz is as beautiful to listen to hear as she is to look at in her other films. Her character, Princess Fiona, doesn't have as much room to shine as Shrek (the balance turns out better in the sequel) but she does well with what she's given.The comic highpoints in terms of voice characterization is Eddie Murphy as Shrek's donkey companion and John Lithgow as nasty Lord Farquaad, who wants to rid his domain of Duloc of all fairy tale creatures. Murphy never stops being funny even as he helps set up key plot moments; in fact he's never been this funny since the first 'Beverly Hills Cop' movie. 'We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles,' the donkey tells a much put-upon Shrek, and you still laugh the fifth time you hear it. Lithgow just makes you smile whenever he opens his mouth, like when he grills a hapless gingerbread man in such a convoluted way it turns into a nursery-rhyme recitation.Why exactly Farquaad is grilling this gingerbread man so closely isn't clear, and there are similar plot holes throughout the movie. Shrek may be too tame a character; we never really feel any worry around him. The donkey falls into a relationship with a dragon that screams 'plot convenience,' and there are strange little bits of cruelty, like turning a frog and snake into balloons, which just is thrown out there and let be.But the central story, about how Shrek and Fiona struggle to overcome the odds and find true love, is really sweet and well-rendered. The animation is spectacular, a revolution for the eyes in its deep-dish panoramas and remarkable attention to textures. And the jokes keep flying, the major ones as well as hilarious bits of filigree you won't notice the first or second time but reward you for paying attention.This is not a Disney movie, something 'Shrek' makes very clear not only with its PG-13 humor but its knocks at Disney characters like Snow White and at the Magic Kingdom in the form of Duloc, where an array of 'It's A Small World'-type dolls lecture Shrek and Donkey on all the things NOT to do. Frankly, 'Shrek' could use a little injection of Disney heart, but Disney could use some of this picture's freshness as well. A very charming movie worth your time.",8,62,80,10 June 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," Good Cutting Makes For Great Slasher
","'The Silence Of The Lambs' is famous for being Hollywood's finest slasher film, a masterpiece of unblinking psychological gamesmanship, but its best cuts were made in the editing room.Time is running out for psychopath Buffalo Bill's latest kidnappee. Trying anything, the FBI sends a young trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), to chat up an especially diabolical serial killer now in custody, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). The hope is the two will hit it off well enough so that Lecter will help with nailing down Bill's persona. But what starts out unsettling enough for Starling soon becomes a real journey into fear.'Silence Of The Lambs' has a great story, diabolical atmospherics, and a stark visual template that pulls you in. But two things work for it beyond these elements.The first, which is widely commented upon, is how everyone in this film is working outside their comfort zones, all the way through to the audience. Director Jonathan Demme did quirky, humanistic comedies centered around redemptive themes. Foster didn't play cops. Hopkins didn't play psychos or big-screen villains, unless it was a historical figure like Hitler. Handing such creative people different hats and making them work allowed for fresher, vital impressions.Second, and more critical, was the way 'Silence' was cut. Looking at the 'Collector's Edition' DVD reveals scenes trimmed or edited out entirely, employing plot elements from Thomas Harris' source novel. A couple of dropped scenes between Starling and FBI lead investigator Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are particularly involving, but the overall subplot they work to establish, about Crawford's dispute with a nasty superior and Starling's own line-crossing of FBI strictures, only obscure what the audience cares most about, which is the relationship between Hannibal and Starling and also the ongoing case of Buffalo Bill.The first of these is really where 'Silence' best delivers. So much of the movie's cultural legacy rests in the exchanges between Starling and Lecter as written by Ted Tally and delivered by Foster and Hopkins.It's a tense cat-and-mouse situation, not devoid of humor or pathos but focused relentlessly on the core issue of stopping Buffalo Bill. What motivates Lecter is not sympathy but his interest in Starling, both as someone he rather likes and as a worthy opponent. 'People will say we're in love,' he jokes at one point, and it's funny because it's kind of true in a twisted way the movie is not afraid to develop, even if the idea of an actual relationship between the two seems absurd, at least in this iteration.While known as a slasher film, violence is handled very well. We see as many murders actually take place here as we did in 'Psycho,' which is not that many. More is done by showing less. Hitchcock would have approved.Some aspects of the film keep me from declaring it perfect. The way Hannibal makes his big play in Tennessee is too much of the Hollywood- magic-villain variety, while Demme emphasizes Starling's discomfort as a woman in a man's world in a way that comes off dated and pedantic today. Howard Shore's music adds to the atmosphere but never gels as anything with a character of its own.But when you watch the movie, all you care about is what happens to Starling and what Lecter could do to her. And that is exactly what should happen. The end result is a very involving, one-of-a-kind experience.",9,1,1,19 July 2014
Casino Royale," Extending The License
","Daniel Craig would seem as likely a match with classic Bond like bratwurst with caviar, what with his broad apish shoulders, bull neck, and perpetual scowl. Yet Craig's 007 in this film represents one of the singular high points in Bond franchise history, not just by shaking our expectations but by centering a well-balanced entertainment.Bond in the opening scene is still working on earning his double-0 status. Since this requires he kill two enemy operatives, we get a highly energetic opening that accentuates Craig's hard physicality as an actor. As the film develops, and Bond is called upon to defeat terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), Craig showcases a broader palette, especially when Bond becomes entangled with gorgeous but prickly MI6 accountant Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).Craig's acting journey mirrors that of Bond in the story, evolving from being a 'blunt instrument' (so-called by his boss M, played by Judi Dench) to something akin to 'half-monk, half-hit man'. Knowing Bond is going to survive the film is a given, but Craig's rawness and intensity keeps you from taking too much for granted.Taken from Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, and adhering more closely to Fleming's plot than almost any other Bond movie before it, 'Casino Royale' pushes the spy into new terrain without leaving old fans adrift. There's still time for a lame Bondian quip, and many familiar elements from earlier incarnations are either nodded to or vigorously added to the mix. Dench's M is the one holdover from the Pierce Brosnan Bonds, but instead of being a mere PC sop, she offers something akin to the distant but parental figure M became in the Fleming novels.Even the look of the film is a revelation, crisp colors and natural light abounding. Director Martin Campbell finds ways to keep advancing a sometimes baroque story while serving his new star. A shower scene between Bond and Vesper manages the feat of being incredibly intimate but not sexual, and her hold on him is revealed in small moments. Asked by his contact René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) if Vesper has 'melted your cold heart yet', a wordless, sheepish half-shrug by Craig tells us more than words could ever say.People complain the movie is too long. In pure minutes, it's the longest Bond movie; other 007s like 'A View To A Kill' and 'Die Another Day' only felt longer. Green may overplay Vesper's hauteur early in, but as the film develops she nails the character's more complicated and transformative scenes and emerges as one of the series's best Bond girls. There's a speeding car scene late in the film that makes no sense when you reflect back on it, but other story elements taken from the original novel are actually improved upon.And then there's Craig, whose utter awesomeness as 007 can't really be overstated. I'm more of a Roger Moore man, but Craig displays more intensity flipping cards at the poker table than Moore did scaling cliffs or clinging onto funicular cables. He's so convincing in the action scenes that his moments of humor and empathy come across even more strongly than you'd expect.This is simply the best Bond movie since 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. Craig captures something no other Bond actor has, Fleming's original hardened loner who might have more going on inside than he's willing to admit. Whether he can maintain that intensity or not, he manages here to give us a Bond for the ages, and at least another decade's extension on that license to kill.",9,2,5,15 August 2009
Toy Story 3," Metaphysics By Mattel
","Is there Life after playtime? Can you handle a film in which the toys are playing with us, the audience? The third chapter of the Toy Story saga asks some tough questions of viewers, but the rewards of seeing this remarkable film outweigh the emotional toll.It's the last week of summer before Andy heads off to college, and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the other remaining toys in Andy's bedroom find themselves in fear of what's to become of them. It looks like the attic, but events conspire to throw them a day-care center called Sunnyside. It looks swell enough, at first...'You'll never be outgrown, or neglected,' the toys are informed by the chuckily plush play bear Lots-O (Ned Beatty). 'Never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means - no heartbreak!'It's odd to see a film series that started out as an animated lark turn into 'Watership Down', but there's always been some existential angst at the heart of the enterprise, c.f. the fragile buddy system employed in the first 'Toy Story', Sid's hapless victims, and talk of rummage sales. The second film pushed these buttons a bit harder, to the point of losing the humor.This time the drama is stronger than ever, yet the film amazingly manages to stay refreshingly clever and hilarious. We meet Ken (Michael Keaton), who introduces himself to Barbie saying 'We were made for each other'. Ken must deal with wisecracks about being a girl's toy, or as Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) puts it, 'an accessory, a purse with legs.' The daycare center is also fabulously realized, a cacophony of misfit toys all showing signs of wear from constant play. Every now and again we break away to see Woody in his new situation, being played with by a girl named Bonnie who is very nice but has a left-field imagination. 'We do a lot of improv here,' another toy tells him.All this is very funny, and director Lee Unkrich and the Pixar writers and artists find brilliant ways to keep humor close to the center of things throughout. Yet this movie is no lark. One of the funniest scenes the first time I saw this movie three weeks ago, involving a cutaway to a clown staring at a window, got hardly a laugh when I saw it again tonight. I think it was because the rest of the audience, like me, knew what was coming; a sad story about cosmic indifference and cold-hearted abandonment which sets in motion the real emotional undertow of the film.Set against this is Woody's firm if shaken resolution to 'be there for Andy', even when it seems he and the other toys are no longer wanted by their owner. It's a message of faith you relate to, yet it also brings out another point, the notion of change, even painful change, as needful. The toys know they'll be neglected, perhaps forever, if exiled to the attic, but prefer it to the unknown. This actually makes sense. What can happen out there isn't very nice, but even in the face of extinction the film suggests a certain nobility through acceptance can be still possible. It's a pretty heavy message to take away from watching a G-rated comedy.The film doesn't leave you on a down note, but it's a funny thing. In the past, I always looked forward to the post-credit goof scenes as something to laugh at on my way out of the theater. This time, I appreciated it just as much as a chance to wipe my eyes before I got out of my chair. It still felt good, though.",9,5,5,8 July 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," From Art-House To Playroom
","A pleasurable children's film sometimes over-infused with adult sensibilities, 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' gives us plenty of charm and character, as well as a sense of director Wes Anderson poking a little fun at himself as noted art-house auteur.Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a retired fowl-thief who feels rather restricted by his new life as a newspaper columnist. When he moves to a new tree with his wife (Meryl Streep) and cub Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the prosperous farms of three mean humans prove too fat and juicy for him to ignore. But a life of crime has a downside, even for a fox as fleet and sly as the Fantastic Mr. F.As a director of wit and sophistication, Anderson may seem an unlikely candidate for bringing Roald Dahl's children's novel of forest- animal hi-jinks to screen. But Anderson has always had one foot in the water of lost childhood, and his treatment of the source material is clearly a labor of love.The film also benefits from the stop-action animation employed, giving it the feeling of one of those Rankin/Bass productions from the 1960s and 1970s. The film veers occasionally into twee territory working this vibe, but Anderson's usual directorial style of static compositions and tight close-ups seems a perfect match. At times, Anderson seems to play this up deliberately, pausing on a mealtime scene for one of Anderson's pregnant pauses, followed by the characters devouring their meals in wild-animal mode.The exchanges scripted by Anderson and Noah Baumbach also reflect this congruence:'They'll kill the children!''Over my dead body they will.''That's what I'm saying, you'll be dead, too, in that scenario.''Well, I'm arguing against that.'Anderson's predilection for casting more actors than he has parts is evident here, too, but it kind of works. The usual gang of suspects, i. e. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wally Wolodarsky, etc., all provide sterling support as various animal characters, while Michael Gambon shines particularly as Mr. Bean, the nastiest of the human farmers.It's a more overtly comical offering than you usually get from Anderson. The school Ash goes to has a sign reading 'Co-Ed, All Species.' The word 'cuss' is used as a substitute for a popular profanity, as in 'This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everybody.' The humor may play a bit above the heads of little ones at times, but the message of accepting one's differences as strengths rather than weaknesses is cleverly developed. As morals go, it's a pretty good one.So is 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox.' At its best, which is often, it brings out the kid in you with its easy charm and pervading sense of wonder. It's not Anderson's greatest film, but it shows why he's worth watching.",7,0,0,12 February 2015
The Sixth Sense," Some Twists And Stuff
","'The Sixth Sense' is the first horror film I know of that also works as a tear-jerker. A 'creepy weepy,' you might even call it; the darnedest thing about that combination being how well it plays here.Child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is trying to recover his professional equilibrium after one of his most traumatic cases came to a fatal end. Enter Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy who struggles with his peers, is called a 'freak,' and draws horrible images until he is called into a meeting about it. Now he just draws pictures of rainbows, not because his heart's in it, but because 'they don't have meetings about rainbows.' Underneath the surface, it's anything but rainbows for poor Cole.'The Sixth Sense' has become a prisoner of its popularity the same way 'Titanic' and 'Jerry Maguire' have, marked for ridicule by those who think themselves better than the hoi polloi who made it such a hit. Even people who haven't seen 'Sixth Sense' know its catchphrases and storyline, and with that familiarity comes contempt, especially as its director, M. Night Shyamalan, has struggled in recent years to repeat his success. In such an atmosphere, it's easy to overlook that the one thing that makes 'Sixth Sense' so popular is that it's so incredibly good.The art of storytelling is at the heart of the film, the way it quietly unfolds at its own pace, pulling you in with eerie moments and occasional shocks to a place that gets deeper as you get closer. Cole explains at one point to Dr. Crowe that the trick to a good story is that it have 'some twists and stuff.' People who downgrade 'The Sixth Sense' do so on the basis of the twists, which was what got the film so talked about in the first place. But it's the other 'stuff' that makes 'Sixth Sense' so lasting and compelling for its fans.Take it from me: I watched 'Sixth Sense' for the first time just over a year ago. By then its much ballyhooed 'secret' was out of the bag for me, just as it probably is for you even if you haven't yet seen this film. The film took me for a ride anyway, because of Shyamalan's soft-yet-penetrating eye; incredible acting led by Osment, Willis, and Toni Collette as Cole's mom; and its sentimental-yet-spooky atmosphere.Every scene is shot with a certain style that makes it compelling not just as horror but as a slice of life, and this constant balance makes the film such a marvel. Even as it slips out of everyday reality into the utterly fantastic, it does so in a way you never notice your feet leaving the ground. Moments of fright are alleviated with humor and warmth.Something else needs to be said of 'Sixth Sense,' that despite its horror theme it's a positive, inspirational film, one that on its own terms gives 'Passion Of The Christ' a run for its money in terms of connecting to the deepest feelings of many of its viewers.Yes, Shyamalan does gild the lily too much at times, tying up things that don't need tying up, and you can feel your heartstrings being tugged at a little too much at points. There may be a couple of minor plot holes visible on a second viewing. But still, at the very least the end result is one terrific piece of entertainment, and probably very much more.",9,2,3,8 February 2007
Rear Window," Doot, Doot, Doot, Looking Out His Backdoor
","While recovering from a nasty leg injury, James Stewart finds himself looking out the back window of his apartment. Grace Kelly just wishes he'd look at her. Thelma Ritter wonders what's so special outside worth looking at. Raymond Burr wishes James looked at Miss Torso a little longer.Alfred Hitchcock's directorial prowess is on full display in 'Rear Window,' a film that IMDb viewers have made the 14th best in movie history. Not to burst your bubble, but Hitch made better flicks than this, like 'Psycho,' 'Vertigo,' 'Strangers On A Train,' 'The 39 Steps,' and my all-time Hitchcock favorite, 'Shadow Of A Doubt.' But 'Rear Window' is a hard film not to like, especially after you've seen it once or twice. The format is special, if not unique by Hitchcock standards, where we have a very controlled, limited setting, a man's Greenwich Village apartment that faces a courtyard and a number of apartment windows into various neighbors' lives. Think 'Lifeboat,' 'Rope,' or 'Dial M For Murder,' only more varied. Instead of the people on the main set facing danger, they see apparent danger in a neighbor's dwelling, and sip adult beverages and chew fancy dinners while contemplating how to respond.Making it more special is the fact Stewart and Kelly do much of the thinking. Stewart's L.B. Jeffries is the main character, a bored photographer of some repute laid up by an injury he suffered while covering an auto race. Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont is the high-profile, haute couture model used to wearing $1,100 gowns (in 1954!) and dining at Manhattan's 21 Club, but somehow willing to settle for Stewart amid all the Prince Rainier and Zoolander types she undoubtedly comes across.However absurd, the central relationship is cemented by an apparent murder Jeffries thinks he witnesses, and Fremont comes to believe he did, involving a neighbor and his nagging wife. It's a bit of an irony, and a pretty marvelous one, that has Hitchcock celebrate one impeding marriage by making them apparent vultures in the untimely demise of another. Such was Hitchcock.Great Greenwich Village ambiance, circa the early 1950s and 'My Sister Eileen/Wonderful Town' rather than the drag queens and Stonewall riots of the near future. Boho artists co-exist with Miss Lonelyhearts-spinster types and costume jewelry salesmen that may be up to something more sinister, or not.I wasn't a fan of Grace Kelly until that shot of her in Thorwald's apartment looking out the window while holding the purse upside down. Now I think she's swell. Thelma Ritter seems to have dropped in from a Neil Simon comedy next door, but she totally rules the scenes she's in. The set design, and the peeks at the neighbors, is especially well-wrought. That scene when Stewart and Miss Lonelyhearts share a silent, sad toast across the courtyard is one of cinema's finest moments.While the mystery itself is kind of hokey and patly resolved, there's something special in the way it comes together on screen. It's one of Hitchcock's best meetings of comedy and suspense, and a great romance besides despite an early handicap (a beautiful, successful woman totally devoted to the leading man.) There's nothing to really dislike in this film, and while it's still not Hitch's best despite what all the IMDb voters say, it's a good-enough standard bearer for the best director cinema's ever known.",8,5,11,22 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Solid End To A Fantastic Trilogy
","**This review is for the 201-minute theatrical version.**'The Return Of The King' seems to divide audiences. There are those who love it, and those who really, really love it.I'm in the former camp. While I share the overall satisfaction with the way Peter Jackson wound up his epic adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien saga, I do find myself squirming a little more while sitting through this three-hour-plus entertainment than I did with the prior installments.After opening with a flashback on the origins of Gollum (Andy Serkis), we join the war for Middle Earth in a new phase, as the evil armies of Sauron move on the city of Minas Tirith. The surviving members of the Fellowship from the last two films have a two-fold mission: Save Minas Tirith, and buy time for their comrades Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) to get to Mordor and destroy the Ring that lies at the heart of Sauron's plans.'Things are now in motion that cannot be undone,' warns the Fellowship's leader, Gandalf (Ian McKellen).The third time is seldom the charm for great franchises: Godfather; Star Wars; Matrix; heck, I didn't even like 'Goldfinger' that much. Here, Jackson seems to finally get caught up in the snares of backstory he so deftly danced through in the first two films. But it's hardly a fatal flaw, and what's good-to-great here outweighs the rest.The storytelling is as immersive here as it was in the last two chapters. In terms of raw narrative flow, 'Two Towers' was the best, but this is nearly as good. I love how effortlessly we are moved back and forth from the three major story arcs; something George Lucas in my opinion did not do nearly half as well in 'Return Of The Jedi.' There's plenty of humor and action, and precious little elves, all of which pleased me.The acting here is fine, too; this time more from the second-tier players who carry more of the burden with ability. Serkis sells you on Gollum's evilness even as he works your sympathies. David Wenham's Faramir and Miranda Otto's Éowyn dominate their scenes with a quiet authority that lingers after the film is over. Apparently their characters pair up in the extended cut; I'd happily sit through more of this film if it meant seeing more of them.The film does feel more CGI-driven than the others, and much more emotionally self-indulgent. The final 20 minutes are an endurance test for me; swelling music and slow-mo shots of various characters crying and hugging. The rest of the movie has moments, and at times, entire scenes, that run longer than necessary. The Minas Tirith battle is a high point here; but however well-crafted and imaginatively engineered, it plays for me like a lesser remake of the Helm's Deep battle we got in 'Two Towers.'I'm done carping. In the main, this is a fine film that grabs you and rewards you for time spent watching the other films. Even if it's not the film from the series I'd most happily watch again, I'm glad it won a Best Picture Oscar in recognition of the Lord Of The Rings series. Jackson gave us quite a ride, and here brings us a satisfying way of celebrating 'the end of all things.'",7,0,1,18 April 2016
The Truman Show," Reality...What A Concept
","Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like to be the star of your very own 'Truman Show'? Have you ever wondered if you in fact are?Imagine for a moment a documentary, featuring one Debbie Samuels who you remember as that girl you liked in the ninth grade and once thought she liked you. Only here she is a disgruntled ex-actress named Morgana Windemere, who complains about how the writers once told her to give you significant glances, then suddenly decided to 'go in a different direction.''I thought I was going to be the co-star, you know, the girlfriend, but then they said I wasn't working. Even though HE liked me. They made me snub him in the cafeteria and then said my family moved to Canada. Not even a farewell episode.' Elsewhere on the show, onetime childhood bullies complain about the unlovable characters they had to portray. 'All the writers ever did with that guy was have us beat him up,' one complains. 'They said it was good for the ratings.' The concept of 'The Truman Show' is a lot of fun. Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, who gradually comes to realize he is in fact being watched by everyone in the sheltered community of Shorehaven where he has spent all his life. Indeed, there is a reason why Truman's wife approvingly holds up household products in the middle of dinner conversations, and why the travel agency features posters showing planes struck by lightning: He is the unknowing star of his own sitcom.I wish I enjoyed the movie as much. Though funny in parts, it is more of a wet-eyed spectacle featuring an often-serious Jim Carrey staring upward in one of those 'what-does-it-all-mean' poses that has marked too much of director Peter Weir's work since 'Dead Poets' Society. Aiming for maximum uplift, the film sometimes forgets to keep its feet on the ground.The film is in many ways like 'Being There,' the fragile but brilliant Peter Sellers comedy with a similarly minor key classical music score. But 'The Truman Show' is less sure of what it wants to be. At times, it's a broad satire on modern life, like when Truman watches people walking by his house and figures out they are on a loop. At other times, it goes for a more realistic bent, with a group of people who advocate Truman's release (including Natascha McElhone as Lauren, Truman's version of my Debbie Samuels) and a headstrong director with a God complex, named Christof naturally enough and played by Ed Harris.'We know how jealously you guard your privacy,' a smug TV commentator (Harry Shearer) begins a rare interview with Christof, ironic of course given Christof's treatment of Truman.More comedy could have been mined from the concept of Truman, but comedy is not Weir's forte and except for that travel agency and a scene where Truman watches his wife in surgery, the film plays it straight.Still, Truman makes you think even if it doesn't make you laugh, and there's a satisfying conclusion that teases out the metaphysical concepts the movie has played with all along. It's manipulative, yes, but genuinely clever. If it doesn't make you look extra hard in your bathroom mirror the next morning, maybe you're just looking into the wrong camera.",7,1,2,5 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Your First Step Into A Larger World
","It's hard to remember a time before 'Star Wars,' even for those of us who were there when it came out. For teens and pre-teens like me, this was like cosmic compensation for missing the Beatles, a singular entertainment event that crystallized the era and reverberates still. I've gotten the same reactions telling young people about seeing 'Star Wars' in its first run that men of past generations got telling what they did in the war.Since the film has come to serve as a cinematic yardstick of popcorn greatness, it's easy to overlook its considerable merits. People often attack the film because they don't like the way Hollywood followed up on it by pushing for dice-rolling blockbusters rather than the smaller, personal films of modest but dependable box office which went out of vogue after 'Star Wars' and made the 1970s the last great decade for movies. Frankly, though, I can't see the 1970s being as great a decade without the joy of 'Star Wars,' just as the 1960s wouldn't have been the same without 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band.'The story is simple, cleverly so: In a distant galaxy, a farm teen with big dreams stuck in a rut finds himself holding intelligence that could help overthrow an evil galactic empire. He seeks the advice of 'a crazy old man' who tells him it is his destiny not only to get the information to rebel forces but become a member of a legendary group of powerful fighters, thought to be extinct, and restore justice and mercy to a seemingly uncaring universe with the aid of a metaphysical power called 'The Force.'I frankly don't care how much consultation director-writer George Lucas did with myth-scholar Joseph Campbell, or how often he read 'Beowulf.' The results speak for themselves. 'Star Wars' is a tremendous thrill ride, serving up butt-tightening action sequences and extravagant special effects that have lost none of their power.People today see 'Star Wars' as one of a six-film saga. That saga was a worthy enterprise of varying quality, but 'Star Wars' is the only film that stands on its own. You can't watch any of the others without seeing 'Star Wars'; you can however watch 'Star Wars' without seeing any of the others.In his DVD commentary, Lucas points out the risks he took spending the opening 15 minutes focusing on two droids and never trying to explain the strange world we find ourselves in (other than it being 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.') It's an amazingly successful strategy, especially in how it pays off, plunging us into a dream world we accept for what it is because there are no handholds of conventional familiarity and even fellow humans are scarce.The opening sequence also pulls you in, remarkable not only for its composition but for the way it is so little commented-upon by 'Star Wars' fans. The sense of doom in the squad of white-helmeted men, as their ship is swallowed up by a Star Destroyer and they wait for an attack they know they can not hold off, is presented in a short sequence of images that gives early notice of the film's stellar editing as well as direction and photography. It's a vision of hell we are happy to escape in the company of the two droids, R2-D2 and C3PO, and tablesets the rest of the adventure grandly by giving us a sense of the stakes and the cruelty of the foe. Darth Vader's 'inquisition' of the ship's commander a little later on is likewise an ingenious introduction to one of filmdom's most frightening villains.The special effects made 'Star Wars' important, but the acting is what makes it entertaining. Alec Guinness sells the concept as the aged Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi; while Harrison Ford as the acerbic smuggler Han Solo and Anthony Daniels as C3PO give us most of the laughs, but the film would not work nearly so well without Mark Hamill's performance as the naïve farmboy, Luke, or Carrie Fisher's regal beauty and sense of purpose playing the heroic, noble, and ever-so-slightly-snooty Princess Leia. I even like George Lucas's oft-maligned script. The lines may come across as stilted, but in a way that plays to the unearthly setting, and there's a clever balance of comedy and intelligence in the dialogue that distinguishes it from other like films.Not sure what to say about Lucas's later tinkering. There are things I like and don't like; much the same others already noted, and for the same reasons. However altered, though, and perhaps reduced slightly, 'Star Wars' has lost none of its magnificence or ability to instill awe. I still get a rush of adrenaline at the line 'Let's blow this thing and go home!' Doesn't everyone?",10,1,2,29 July 2005
Apollo 13," Astrophysics Meets John Ford
","I've seen 'Apollo 13' a few times now, and even with two sets of DVD commentary and a fine documentary under my belt, I can't exactly say what took place. They call it a 'Main Bus B Undervolt,' but whatever the case, it cripples the spacecraft Apollo 13 just as it is about to reach the moon, forcing the crew to abandon their mission and undergo some hasty improvisations in order to make it back to Earth alive.There's a lot of technical jargon spewed in this film, not as much as was actually uttered on the spacecraft and at Mission Control in Houston, but enough to befuddle those of us who dozed off in science class back in high school. Still, I enjoyed this film, even when I didn't quite understand it.Tom Hanks stars as steady-in-zero-G Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, successfully underplaying the heroics without losing the dramatic urgency of the moment. Early in the movie, we see him joke with his wife, Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) with the sort of easy banter those of us who have followed him since 'Bosom Buddies' are accustomed to. There's a funny scene early on, as he watches the Apollo 11 landing with a roomful of simultaneously proud and jealous fellow astronauts, all yelling at the television to abort seconds before Neil Armstrong takes his one small step for man. It's funny because they all wanted to be first on the moon, and also, in a ghoulish kind of prefiguring way, because aborting the mission is exactly what is going to happen to poor Jim.There's also an early scene between Lovell and his youngest son, when the father is asked if he knew the crew of Apollo 1, who perished in a capsule fire scene in an opening sequence. Hanks answers matter-of-factly, with a mesmerizing combination of steely control and compassion for what his child is experiencing. There's a lot going on under the surface, and while it's my favorite scene, it's easy to miss. Many good moments like that are sprinkled like stardust throughout the picture.The movie is a fine, solid piece of entertainment, a little loose with the facts but essentially true to what Apollo 13 was about, but what makes this especially recommendable is the DVD, particularly the commentary track by the real Jim and Marilyn Lovell (SPOILER ALERT: He did survive.) At one point, when the film has Hanks imagining himself landing on the moon, the real Marilyn Lovoll audibly breaks down as she describes her sadness that her husband would never have this moment in reality (though what he got instead, however harrowing, turned out to be far more memorable than merely being Moon Man #5.) Jim himself is laconic as he fills in gaps in the storyline and explains where the film took liberties, meanwhile giving us a sense of where Hanks got his character from. For that, and many other reasons, this is a prize DVD for anyone's collection.A good feeling for the period abounds. We see smoking in the control room, miniskirts, floral upholstery, and ugly shagwall sideburns. The Lovells' oldest daughter has a conniption the day of the launch because the Beatles have just broken up, one of the things the Lovells address as a liberty in their commentary (she wasn't that much of a Beatles fan) but does make sense, because April 1970 was the month Paul McCartney announced the end of the band.Director Ron Howard piles on the technical detail. He wants us to understand just how tough it was to get Apollo 13 back, on enough power to barely run a coffee machine. He doesn't shirk from showing us a control room that is stacked to the rafters with what Howard himself calls 'techno-nerds with pocket protectors' who emerge as real heroes in one of NASA's darkest hours. You have Todd Louiso from 'High Fidelity,' Val Kilmer's buddy from 'Real Genius' (Gabe Jarrett), even Clint Howard, Ron's brother, perhaps filmdom's uber-nerd.Nepotism is a good thing here. Not only does Clint have a good scene explaining to flight director Ed Harris that the moonshot is kaput and they will have their hands full just bringing the crew home, but their late mother Jean Speegle Howard shines as Jim Lovell's stroke-addled matriarch, delivering two of the film's best lines.I'm not crazy about 'Apollo 13,' but I like it a lot, and I find myself liking it more the more I watch it. Ron Howard movies tend to push for maximum uplift, and the manipulation can be annoying, but here he seems to pull back on that while focusing on the human equation at the heart of the story. Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese and especially Harris and Quinlan give excellent support for one of Hanks' best star vehicles, all the more a vehicle because Hanks serves the story rather than tries to make the story serve him.Hanks was inspired enough by this experience to do a series of critically-acclaimed mini-films documenting the Apollo program. You might be inspired enough to visit your local library, or do some Googling online. It's not `Gone With The Wind,' but as a history/science lesson, `Apollo 13' is a damn fine piece of work.",8,1,1,31 December 2003
The Thin Red Line," War Film With More Brains Than Blood
","Life is good. Life makes man. Man makes war. War is bad. What's going on here?That's my attempt at summarizing the basic concept behind 'The Thin Red Line', a film that defies summarization as it probes nature's dense duality in the vast jungles of Guadalcanal. In 1942, American forces arrived there to check the Japanese advance during World War II.Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) wants to prove his ability to win victories in combat to his superiors, for whom he holds a grudge. Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) wants to know he won't betray the men of the company under his command, and protect as many of them as possible. Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) and Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) are locked in their own struggle over the meaning of life, Welsh avowing his nihilism while Witt maintains a greater purpose and meaning.'You're gonna be alright,' Witt reassures a hit comrade at one point. 'Even if you die.'There's many other subplots in this dense film. Terrence Malick returned from 20 years' hibernation with this adaptation of the classic James Jones novel. It's overlong and ponderous, but surprisingly rewatchable and full of the visual poetry that makes Malick so beloved by film buffs.Actually, I was amazed by the sound on this film, too, especially a sequence where Army soldiers make their first advance on the summit of Hill 210. The sound of Sgt. Whyte's (Jared Leto) rustling fabric and snapping gum as the breeze rustles through high grass is about as suspenseful as any musical background, knowing gunfire from Japanese entrenchments will soon follow.Malick puts together some incredible combat sequences, including one led by Tall's prize underling Gaff (John Cusack) about as viscerally exciting as anything from a John Wayne movie. But the action sequences aren't really what 'The Thin Red Line' is about, nor is camaraderie, though both are addressed. It gets back to a kind of questing philosophy, the nature of man, of war, and of nature itself.Other reviewers here discern conclusions as well as questions, in the way Malick handles things. I think it's pretty open-ended, another reason 'Thin Red Line' stands out. Tall, for example, appears at one moment a nasty piece of work whose orders suggest a total remove from the suffering of his men. (Tall telling Staros to advance into heavy gunfire for me is about as stomach-turning as 'Thin Red Line' gets, and testament to Nolte's overall brilliance.) But his frontal approach to command is not without merit.'Nature is cruel,' Tall says, and, for his purposes, he's totally right. It's just we still understand and appreciate Staros' hesitation as more than soft-heartedness.I think the film gets away from Malick a couple of times, and have little interest in seeing the six-hour director's cut people talk about here. But it's a terrific overall experience, one that will only grow in stature over time. Caviezel's later turn as Jesus in 'Passion Of The Christ' invests his performance as Witt with greater meaning. Even the long voice-over narrations fell more on point with re-watchings.'You ever get lonely?' Witt asks Welsh. 'Only around people' he replies.'Thin Red Line' is a film where the questions provide more insight than the answers. In the end, you feel enlightened somehow all the same.",8,3,7,17 February 2008
The Great Escape," McQueen's Breakout Role Lifts Muddy Film
","'The Great Escape' is okay popcorn fare, a 'true-ish' World War II movie that serves the facts of the real story of Stalag Luft III decently and serves the film's stars better. That's particularly true of one star, Steve McQueen, who had his most famous five minutes on screen cycling across Bavaria and never looked back.McQueen is Virgil Hilts, a 'hotshot pilot' from the U.S. Army Air Force who makes for one restless POW. 'I haven't seen Berlin yet, from the ground or from the air,' he tells the commandant of his prison camp, Col. von Lugar (Hannes Messemer). 'I plan on doing both before the war's over.' Hilts isn't the only one in the camp with big plans. The British, led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), plot a breakout involving no less than 250 inmates. 'You're crazy...You oughta be locked up,' Hilts tells Bartlett, pretty funny given their situation.Was Bartlett's scheme really such a good idea, even if you factor out the Nazi propensity for brutal overreaction? I can't say I think it was, and maybe that's one mark I'd make against a film that pretty much celebrates the real-life episode as a majestic sacrifice rather than a glory-hound escapade that backfired horribly. The success rate certainly didn't justify the supposed benefit Bartlett speaks of, tying up a few German troops who were on garrison duty anyway and hardly shoring up the Dnieper River Line.There are other issues I have with 'The Great Escape'. At two hours, fifty-two minutes, it's way overlong, with all but the last 45 minutes concerned with prep work. A script that was famously being written on the run creates various dramatic subplots involving the many characters which come and go as abruptly as James Coburn's Aussie accent.What director John Sturges and his team do bring to 'The Great Escape' is undeniable texture, a feeling for prison-camp life that feels real even as it plays at Sgt. Fury-style heroics. A cast who knew World War II all-too-well but were willing to pretend it was more adventure then nightmare also contribute. The one standout besides McQueen is second-billed James Garner as Hendley 'the scrounger', whose scenes with both Donald Pleasance (as a fellow inmate, a 'forger' going blind) and Robert Graf (as German guard Werner) account for much of the film's erratic charm. The rousing Elmer Bernstein score is instantly recognizable and hummable, and there's McQueen, in what seems the third and most significant stage of Sturges' star-making program, after 'Never So Few' and 'The Magnificent Seven.'Hilts is a strange center of gravity for 'The Great Escape', spending most of his time away from the action, stuck in a cooler bouncing a baseball to himself while Attenborough directs things. Attenborough is a bit stiff; one senses his heart wasn't in the role. McQueen does get more involved in the plot as it rolls along, collecting bunk slats to buttress the tunnel being dug beneath the camp. He's not as loose as he would be later on; and struggles a bit with the more comedic scenes. Whoever came up with the idea of him marching through the camp playing a fife probably was drinking too much potato vodka. But his confrontations with von Lugar, scrunching his face into a cocky grin, give the film much of the lift it has when he's not on that motorcycle.Messemer may have the film's most interesting role; a sympathetic Luftwaffe officer who pushes back when the Gestapo and SS tell him to take a firmer hand. He's a good man, even if he knows he's serving a bad cause, and his scenes with both McQueen and James Donald as the head British POW give you a sense of the emotional toll of war even when the combatants involved are decent.Many people like this film better than I do, and bless them. It's smart and entertaining; sometimes both at once. You can't help but be moved by the story behind the film, real as it was. Too bad the question of 'was it worth it' is never satisfactorily presented, let alone answered.",6,7,13,29 March 2009
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Should have been the start of something bigger...
","After establishing themselves as the Beatles of Comedy on their five-year UK television run, the six-member comedy troupe better known as Monty Python made their move to film with this clever, genre-bending spoof of Arthurian legend. In a better world, it would have kicked off a long series of similar Python films, of satires and broad comedies at a pace of one every two or three years, some better, some worse, but all beloved in the same vein as this.I feel in an odd spot here, saying 'Holy Grail' is not that great on the one hand and I wish there had been more on the other. But there's a logic stream here. I think the Pythons were on to something, a formula they could have enriched over time. The movie was clearly the work of novices; accomplished comedic actors and hilarious writers yes, but stark newbies on the big screen. The film's texture is as muddy as a Super 8 home movie in places, the action is choppy, and the plot line sags when it should grow taut. I get the feeling the film draws away deliberately from letting us like the individual characters because it disrupts the aesthetic (or as Lancelot would say, the idiom) in which Python works, but this morbid and depressing style grates over time. And then there's that wicked stupid ending, as bad a one as any good film ever had.These are flaws lesser than the film's virtues, which are some brilliant comedy sequences, an eye for period detail and squalor, and a terrific musical score. The no-horse joke is dragged on past the point of obviousness and idiocy to a place by the end that's almost sublime, and it's as much a testament to the comic courage of the Pythons than any of their later icon-bashing. What's bad here are minor by contrast, and the sort of things more accomplished filmmakers would improve upon with subsequent efforts, talky bits, jumpy segues, and the like. Indeed, Python did just that when they made their next film, 'Life Of Brian,' which actually works as a story in a way 'Holy Grail' doesn't, though minus the same broad humor, but then the Pythons went to seed in the 80s, traipsing off into solo projects and one lame sketch-comedy knockoff, 'Meaning Of Life,' before we lost Graham Chapman to AIDS and that was that.MPATHG works very well for the first 20 minutes or so, setting the scene of Britain circa 932 AD, then loses altitude like a coconut-laden swallow as it takes on the Grail quest legends, before screeching to a silly halt with a ending that deserves a spoiler if any film ever did. Episodic bits work well in isolation, often very well, but don't gel the way they should. There's some great episodes, the duel with the Black Knight, the faceoffs with Knights who say Ni, the quests of Galahad and Lancelot, and the finale at the Bridge of Death ('oh, great'). The part I enjoy most is Robin's relationship with his minstrels, perhaps the worst spin doctors a leader could have (though he certainly deserves them.)Picking out the individual members for applause seems an exercise in perversity, but Michael Palin shines as Galahad, the lead Ni Knight, and especially the father of Prince Herbert ('This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let's not bicker and argue over who killed who.') Also, Chapman is solid in the lead role, and one almost wishes we were really allowed to root for the guy. (Hard to believe Chapman was reportedly soused for much of the filming. He seems rock-steady.)The great thing about this movie is you don't have to be a Python fan to enjoy it. You can actually have a happy family life, normal adult friends, and no special aptitude for Jeopardy or Trivial Pursuit. Holy Grail doesn't deserve the biggest cult following this side of Sun Yung Moon, but it's merry and more than adequate for what it tries to be. I can't help feeling it could just have been the beginning of so much more.",7,2,4,2 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Who's Your Daddy?
","After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the 'Star Wars' trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous 'Star Wars.' People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but 'Empire' is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.'Empire Strikes Back' is thus a richer film than 'Star Wars' emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in 'Star Wars,' sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after 'Blazing Saddles.'What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable 'Imperial March' theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in 'Star Wars,' gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the 'cave' that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes 'Empire Strikes Back' so beloved today is understandable. It turned 'Star Wars' from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality 'Star Wars' has, needing both that earlier film and the later 'Return Of The Jedi' to make it as great as it is.",8,6,10,23 August 2005
Saboteur," Hitchcock's B-Movie
","Cheap sets, stiff actors, meandering plot - say, what kind of Alfred Hitchcock film is this?Not his best, truth be told. Made just as Hollywood geared up for World War II, 'Saboteur' is so dated you expect a lady selling war bonds to walk into your living room when the DVD's over. But there are enough hints of classic Hitchcock to be found in such things as the offbeat pacing and villain characterizations to keep you watching through to a satisfying if not strong ending.Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is a California aircraft factory worker fingered for torching his workplace and killing his best friend. Only Kane knows the truth, that the culprit is a Vladimir Putin lookalike called Fry (Norman Lloyd) whom he traces to a desert ranch. Turns out Fry is working for a group of evil capitalists bent on selling out Uncle Sam to the Axis. Will Kane catch them before they make a battleship in Brooklyn their next trophy?This was the first of three pictures Hitchcock would make in consecutive years with celebrated American writers, as Dorothy Parker lent a hand to this script. Unfortunately, Parker's clumsy injection of New Yorker left-wing ideology puts us in a movie that asks us to believe American capitalists are conspiring to overthrow their free-market society for a chance to make a few bucks off of slave labor. How this film slipped past McCarthy & Co. is a mystery.'They bomb cities, sink ships, torture and murder so you and your friends can eat off of gold plate,' says Kane to handsome head baddie Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), who smirks a lot as he ridicules Kane's idealism.Hitchcock doesn't seem to be at his best either, cribbing off his English works from the 1930s like a madman to lesser effect. Even more original scenes come with awkward exposition, like when Kane is befriended by a troupe of circus freaks, or a windy old blind man who sends Barry off with his niece, professional model Pat (Priscilla Lane).'Go ahead, Barry, and do the things I wish I could do,' says the old man. Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but I was creeped out.But when the scenes work, they bear the Master's unmistakable stamp. Neither Lane nor Cummings are fresh on screen, but both have their moments, like when he discovers his friend's grieving mother blames him for the murder, or she tries to sucker Fry into hanging out with her on top of the Statue of Liberty.The Statue of Liberty is the site of 'Saboteur's' signature finale, but Hitchcock scores in small ways, too, like with Tobin's unfailing graciousness and his grandfatherly affection for a small tyke. Right next to the house where the grieving mother is sitting is another house from where 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy' plays.In the end, 'Saboteur' leaves too much on the table for it to be rated among Hitchcock's better films. But it is an early all-American example of Hitchcock's ability to ride a wooly plot line for maximum entertainment value. Even if it is one for the cheap seats, it's not without some pleasure to be had.",6,0,3,8 January 2008
Gangs of New York," John Jakes On Acid
","'Gangs Of New York' feels as much of a labor to watch as it was to make, and considering the fact we are being paid considerably less for our part than director Martin Scorsese was for his, that's a problem.There's the potential for something good here, a fictional take on life in the hard streets of Manhattan during the Civil War, but the film never delivers. Instead, it serves up bloody chunks of exposition and characters with lines that are meant to sound profound but come off clumsy. 'The blood stays on the blade,' a young boy's father explains in the opening moments, after he cuts himself shaving and the boy starts to wipe the razor clean. Why? Is he so sentimental about shaving cuts? Does he not know a bloody razor will rust much faster and become useless, even dangerous, for shaving over time?When the boy grows into a man, he becomes Leonardo DiCaprio, who seems to have undergone a physical metamorphosis from the sallow-cheeked lad of 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' to bloated rodent-man of Arch Hall Jr. proportions. I never understood the mania for DiCaprio, either pro or con. He's a serviceable actor who gets a lot of big parts though the consensus seems to agree he was better when younger. Here, his post-pubescent woodenness is evident as his Amsterdam Vallon character is forced to double as clunky narrator ('New York loved William Tweed... and hated him, but for those of us trying to be thieves, we couldn't help but admire him.') and put through his paces too quickly for air.What air there is is sucked up by Daniel Day-Lewis's overripe performance as Bill Cutting, the greasy-haired nativist butcher with the Snidely Whiplash 'stache. Day-Lewis definitely gives off a lot of energy, but he's also all over the place, the most out-of-control performer in a Scorsese film including Richard Manuel in 'The Last Waltz.' One minute he's denouncing the Irish with a zealous scorn, the next he's taking young Amsterdam into his embrace. For a guy who hates the Irish so much, Bill sure spends a lot of time with them.Cameron Diaz fights with DiCaprio in delivering the least convincing Irish accent, really lost at sea though I blame Scorsese and the screenwriters more than her. Too many other minor characters are used too obviously as plot devices, explaining how things are as a way of moving a bloated story along. The film bites off way more than it can or should chew, wanting to show not only the nasty environs of Five Points but the machinations of Tammany Hall and assorted figures of the day. Boss Tweed is wedged into the storyline very roughly, as is Horace Greeley and P.T. Barnum.I was reminded in the end of John Jakes and the historical fiction he was popular for when I was growing up. Young man arriving in a strange American city, meeting famous people from history books while making friends and enemies of uncommon intensity. Simpler fare for a simpler time, yes, but there was something entertaining in the way it was done. Here, one gets a lot of blood and violence, some sex, sketchy attempts at humor, much emoting, and absolutely zero fun.",2,14,27,17 December 2005
Gladiator," Do You Like Movies About Gladiators?
","Once upon a time, Hollywood made lots of movies like this, with 'Quo Vadis?' 'Ben Hur', and 'Sparticus' springing most quickly to mind. Then the space age arrived, and sword & sandal epics became as passé as the western.Fortunately, Ridley Scott and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man. Frankly, the story of Maximus, a toppled Roman general who reclaims his political clout in the ring of gladiatorial combat, is a little thin when you think about it. But it's delivered with a lot of panache and visual flair.Russell Crowe isn't too multi-dimensional, but he's more than adequate in the role of Maximus, tender at times but more a gloomy muscleman. He's interesting, even brilliant in flashes, like when he finds the dead bodies of his wife and son, but he doesn't engage you enough to fret overmuch over his fate. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance as the mad Roman emperor Commodus, 'vexed' as he is by Maximus's reappearance but trying in his own sad way to be noble and loving. At times Phoenix seems to be channeling Malcolm McDowell, though not the time McDowell actually played an emperor in the nasty 'Caligula.'Speaking of British film stars of the 1960s/1970s, there are three of them in this film, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, and David Hemmings, all of whom are now dead just four years after the picture's release. This amounts to something of a swan song for all of them, a fitting one as it turns out. Reed especially has his moments. Connie Nielsen presents us with both regal sexiness and hurt-stained eyes as Commodus's sister Lucilla, Maximus's former lover who clearly carries a torch still.We wait for Maximus and Lucilla to take up again where they left off, now that Maximus is single again, but the film reminds us time and again that Maximus's loyalty to his family extends beyond death, that he believes he will see them again in the afterlife. This spiritual dimension, unexpected from a film set in pagan times, lifts the film in my mind to the point where it really clicked with a lot of audiences. It also sets up Crowe's best bits of dialogue in the second half of the movie.Of course, there are some amazing fight scenes as well, in the Colisseum and other gladiator venues as well as Germania, where we are introduced to Maximus putting down a barbarian rebellion. The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.But Maximus's followers are never adequately developed as people worth caring about. Also half-baked is some intrigue involving Lucilla and some Roman senators, including Derek Jacobi, who needs to be wearing a toga like Clint Eastwood does a cowboy hat. The crowd reactions to Maximus, especially when they suddenly recognize him en masse as the lost general who had never visited Rome and chant his name to spare him from Commodus's fury, cries out as obvious plot convenience. These aren't major flaws, but they do stick out on repeat viewings. 'Gladiator,' like many spectacles ancient and modern, never quite satisfies as well as it does the first time you see it.All in all, I have a hard time accepting this as the 2000 Best Picture Oscar winner, especially over 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' which is a more amazing feast for the senses and a better story besides. But 'Gladiator' is a good film, something more than your average blockbuster, and worthy watching.",7,0,1,15 June 2004
Goodfellas," The Meaning Of The Mob
","The more time passes, the better 'GoodFellas' looks.A decades-long examination of the Mafia lifestyle as seen through the eyes of minor Brooklyn hoodlum Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), whose secret to survival involves keeping quiet, 'GoodFellas' puts you in the back seat watching with Henry as his pals steal, rob, burn, and kill each other off. One thing about living the good life is that it's never good enough. As Henry and wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) partake more in the money, they also become more exposed to the danger.That's really the core of the story, though it's probable if you haven't seen 'GoodFellas' you think more of it as the one where Henry's temperamental friend Tommy (Joe Pesci) wants to know why you find him so amusing.'GoodFellas' is an amusing film, very much so at times, yet like with Tommy there's always a barb that comes with the laughter, and makes for a deeper overall experience. Director Martin Scorsese and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the source book 'Wiseguy,' capture not only the violence but the lifestyle that undergirds and enables the violence, often in finely detailed and witty ways, like when Karen meets the other Mob wives and discovers their penchant for double-knits and beating their sons with broom handles.Other organized-crime films either excuse the lifestyle in a relativistic way ('Godfather') or pump up the volume to an absurd degree (1983's 'Scarface') in order to sensationalize and glamorize the experience. 'GoodFellas,' despite its bad-boy reputation, is really on the side of the angels, out to expose the vileness of Mafia living, people who kill each other over nothing and betray each other over nickles and dimes. It's hard to see Scorsese's claims of detesting violence in some of his other films, like 'Gangs Of New York' and 'Casino,' because he goes to it so often there, but here you meet the people before you see what happens to them, reducing the pleasure of their demise, while the killings are quick and dirty, not exploited for cheap effect.That and it's so damn entertaining. Scorsese puts on a clinic, one that is still ongoing, with his use of music, tracking shots, and slam-the-door editing, like when we still hear Karen crying from one scene while Henry and his pals walk through a door to start the next. Even when you watch this film again (and you sort of have to, there's so much to take in) you aren't bored because there's always some new thing to attract your attention.The character of Jimmy the Gent (Robert De Niro) is a little confusing in the film, especially when he helps crazy Tommy whack a guy he should know better about. The book explains this better, but 'GoodFellas' is one Scorsese-De Niro collaboration in which De Niro is often not the most important person on screen when he is on screen. He's good, but Liotta is classic in the central role, a performance for the ages in fact, while Pesci made for a deserved Oscar recipient with the way he inhabits Tommy the walking Id and delivers 'GoodFellas' message of how the good life isn't all that good, that there's always something rotten beneath the surface that will reach up and grab you at the wrong time.",9,0,0,7 March 2007
The Birds," A victory lap for Hitch
","Alfred Hitchcock was on the run of his life by the early 1960s. His last three films, `Vertigo,' `North By Northwest,' and `Psycho,' were not uniformly successful in their day, but all would eventually become recognized as among an elite grouping of truly great films. In December, 2003, IMDB's own ranking system has all three in its Top 30, pretty incredible anyway you slice it. But what was really incredible was how Hitchcock came off that creative peak. Other directors might have made a vanity picture, or an overblown epic of some kind. Hitchcock made `The Birds,' an entirely different kind of film from anything he or anyone else had made before, one that would carve out its own genre for decades to come. And a pretty fine movie to boot.There was never a movie as utterly out-of-the-blue as `The Birds.' Even `Psycho' had some precedent going for it. Before `Psycho,' people had killed other people for no better reason than it seemed like something worth doing at the time. But concerted offensives directed from the animal kingdom? A film that starts off as a romantic comedy i.e. `When Harry Met Sally' and ends up like `Jurassic Park' with feathers in place of scales? What people must have thought in 1963!Tippi Hendren stars as Melanie Daniels, a sort of Paris Hilton character who lives the life of a carefree trust-fund princess until a chance encounter with disapproving lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) sends her on a whimsical trip to his family home in Bodega Bay, and into the hands, or claws, of destiny. Hendren plays her very well, charming and a trifle too easygoing. Taylor offers an interesting parallel, as a smug, scarf-wearing playboy you somehow find yourself liking for (or despite) his assured charm. Whether the two will find each other or not is the principal source of interest through the first half of the film. After, of course, it's whether they get turned into bird chow.Whatever sets the birds of Bodega Bay off is a mystery. Maybe it is the presence of Melanie Daniels, as one resident blurts out, though there is evidence the attack is much wider-spread. Maybe it is the environmental damage being done to the planet by humankind, just gaining expression during this period in works like `Silent Spring.' Maybe it's one too many Thanksgivings. The wherefores aren't as important as the hows, how the birds start their attacks, with slow-gathering momentum that gains in ferocity until the town of Bodega Bay is literally aflame.`The Birds' doesn't get the same kind of respect as does so-called classic Hitchcock of previous decades, which is just stupid snobbery. His powers as the proclaimed `Master of Suspense' were never as much on view; not since his British period before World War II, anyway. `Vertigo' and `Suspicion' and others are good in their way, but they don't reward repeat viewings the same way `The Birds' does. Every person Melanie meets in Bodega Bay has his or her own involving personality that welcomes interest at the same time she or her serves to speed the plot along. The lunch crowd at the Tides Restaurant alone would be worth an hour of anyone else's movie. And then there's Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette, as two characters who make quite a tandem as they seem to resent Melanie's attentions on Mitch. Is their jealousy somehow at the cause of all this?Editing is a chief virtue of `The Birds.' It papers over the defects in the special effects exposed by advancing technology and galvanizes attention to where Hitchcock wants it. Watch the scene where Jessica Tandy checks on the farmer with the grain problem. The three successive close-up shots of the farmer crumpled on the floor get deserved attention, but what about the way Hitchcock lets Tandy's Mrs. Brenner out of the house, with a series of basic shots, all filmed at angles to suggest how tilted her world has become, with no words or music to accompany her?There's much psychology and characterization driving `The Birds,' but ultimately what makes the film worth watching are the bird attacks. Hitchcock makes you wait, but when they come, they come fast and hard, without warning or expected respite. You really gotta love the chimney scene, and the way a children's song heightens the suspense during the famous schoolyard sequence.Just wish they had let the film go on an hour longer. So many more species still to hear from! How about a nice penguin assault, or an ostrich attack? Hitchcock could have put an entirely new construction to the term `duck hunt!'",9,2,3,4 December 2003
Jurassic Park," Roller Coaster With Teeth
","You expect certain things from Steven Spielberg when he sets out to make a popcorn thriller: Convincing action, scary moments, welcome dollops of humor, and a fluid logic stream that gives reason for all the cinematic craziness on offer. 'Jurassic Park' not only lives up to those expectations but exceeds them. The result: Pure entertainment.The premise of 'Jurassic Park' is one thing Spielberg can't take credit for, as it is based on a best-selling novel by today's answer to Jules Verne, Michael Crichton. The idea, in some ways better executed in the novel than the movie, is that a genetics entrepreneur harvests dinosaur blood inside prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber so he can clone and grow the beasts on his island hideaway and make a theme park out of it. Problems ensue during a visit by scientists, as supposedly foolproof systems fail and some of the more ferocious dinosaurs escape.When the entrepreneur, played in the film by Sir Richard Attenborough, insists there's nothing unusual about problems of this kind, that it happened when they opened Disneyland, one of the scientists, a chaos theorist played by Jeff Goldblum, deadpans: 'Yeah, but if 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists.' Goldblum is a real joy in this movie, kind of the color guy like Richard Shaw was in 'Jaws,' albeit in a completely different way. I love reading the quotes on this page. So many are from Goldblum's character, Ian Malcolm, and happily preserve the 'ums' and 'ahs' of Goldblum's trademark delivery. Elsewhere it can be annoying, but this is a perfect film for his snarky, knowing, ingratiating manner.He also presents the central argument of the film, the notion of genetics run amok, which not only is pertinent to us today but also feeds the sense of dread that powers the thrills of this movie. As Malcolm so neatly puts it: 'God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs...'All this talk about technology getting ahead of man's ability to constructively channel the results would have been cruelly ironic in this, a landmark in cinematic technology with its first-time extensive use of computer graphics imagery, or CGI, had the result been less well thought out, or more jarringly intrusive. Yet Spielberg shows terrific control of the new medium, using the dinosaurs sparingly at the outset and only letting them rip for maximum thrills. There's two sequences that deserve special mention, one where the T. Rex first appears and another where two children are cornered in a kitchen by a pair of hungry Velociraptors, which are first-rate from beginning to end. Throughout the film, in fact, Spielberg finds ways of delivering thrills, and having fun with audience expectations, in a way that feels like a ride on a very satisfying, though scary, roller-coaster.Unlike 'Jaws,' this isn't much of a film for characters. Goldblum's more of one than any, while nominal stars Sam Neill and Laura Dern are effective as dino-ologists, especially Neill who gives his character a welcome note of sadism. But the kids and Attenborough's John Hammond are annoying, not a fault of the actors so much as a script and director that coddle them. Hammond's theme park springs more than a leak, yet the fellow is treated more as a beautiful dreamer than a negligent businessman with blood on his hands. The film is a bit too long, with some padding at the beginning that should have been trimmed.Spielberg's political correctness is also annoying: It's a relief to see Samuel L. Jackson in his extended cameo playing a decent guy who is smoking a cigarette. Otherwise, the nods to feminism and gun control are stifling and predictable, though not nearly as much as in the awful sequel, 'Jurassic Park: Lost World.'So much is good here, though. 'Jurassic Park' is a smart film that delivers thrills is always worth celebrating, and the special effects lift this up to near-classic status. This is not Spielberg's best effort, but it is a worthy, accessible demonstration of his greatness.",8,1,2,21 June 2005
The Simpsons Movie," As Good As Turning On Your TV?
","Early in the long-awaited, much-debated 'The Simpsons Movie', legendary TV doofus Dad Homer Simpson makes a good point.'I can't believe we're paying to see something we get on TV for free!' he tells a theater full of patrons watching the new Itchy & Scratchy movie.Does 'The Simpsons Movie' justify its long wait, not to mention the money you might have spent for cinema tickets or a DVD rental? Since I borrowed my copy from the library, I'm still wrestling with this one. I was amused and entertained, enjoying the depth of visual information that came with the feature-film budget. But I can tick off a dozen episodes from the TV show's first eight seasons that were better, tighter stories and funnier besides.It's a bad day in Springfield when Homer decides to ignore environmental warnings and dumps a silo full of pig leavings into the local lake. The EPA seals off Springfield with a giant dome, and the Simpsons become fugitives from both the government and their frenzied fellow Springfieldians. Can Homer save the town, or will he lose his family?Director David Silverman and the movie producers try to create a stand-alone feature film while at the same time rallying the Simpsons' deep and loyal fan base. I think they lean too hard in the latter direction. A lot of the film's gags require audience familiarity with secondary and tertiary characters from the TV show, a.k.a. the Comic Book Guy thanking Marge Simpson for letting him wear her pregnancy pants. ('I've never known comfort like this!') Who would have guessed Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel would have more lines than Mr. Burns?The joke of Homer's stupidity is beaten to the ground like Joe Pesci in 'Casino'. But I laughed because it's still funny all these years on. Like Homer's trick of catching fish by dropping a bug zapper into a pond. Or his reason for choosing to move to Alaska: 'Where you can't be too fat or too drunk!'Most of the jokes are single-shot affairs, like what you get these days watching 'The Simpsons' or its pale imitator, 'Family Guy'. The opportunity to do something appropriately novel with the old formula is largely ignored. The pollution story is neither new nor interesting. The biggest sustained laugh involves Bart skateboarding naked for its numerous hidden-weiner gags. 'Listen kid, no one likes wearing clothes in public,' an arresting officer tells him. 'But it's the law.'The writers behind 'The Simpsons' are clever enough to throw a line like that at you every few minutes, and the characters are enjoyable company that don't wear out their welcome. But I never felt I was watching anything here other than bits and pieces that would have wound up on the TV series in some form at some later time.Given that it's 'The Simpsons', and a national treasure, it's still fun to sit through 'The Simpsons Movie'. But like 'Mt. Rushmore: The Board Game', I was left wondering about its necessity.",6,2,2,1 January 2010
Evil Dead II," Bloody Good Time
","'Evil Dead II' is a gory horror movie for people who don't like gory horror movies. That's not entirely true, as some splatter-film aficionados love it, too, though others protest the Three Stooges-style comedy that predominates after the ten-minute mark. For me, it's a marvel of story-telling economy, suspense, and sustained momentum that manages to be really funny, funny enough that you don't know whether to laugh or scream when director Sam Raimi uncorks his next surprise. Which is a large part of the fun.Amorous Ash (Bruce Campbell) takes his girlfriend to a cabin deep in the woods. Unfortunately, the cabin was occupied previously by a professor studying the Necronomicon, a book of ancient and dangerous lore. Soon all sorts of terrors are forcing their way into Ash's world, chanting 'Things that were shall be again!' and turning the cabin into a blood soaked shambles. Ash works single-handed, first figuratively, then literally, to stop the ghoulish invasion.Blending comedy and horror was old hat when Boris Karloff was introduced to Elsa Lanchester in 'Bride Of Frankenstein.' But the two genres were never commingled so directly until 'Evil Dead 2.' Nor, before ED2, did you get much comedy in gore sequences. 'Evil Dead II' would seem an unlikely place to introduce this concept, as it is the ostensible sequel to a movie that was grimly serious about much of the same situation.Is 'Evil Dead II' a true sequel? Technically, yes, though tonally it plays very different. The key to that is Campbell, who reprises Ash from the prior film but plays him here with an array of silly faces and mouth-agape stunts that would have impressed Buster Keaton. His firm jaw and big teeth are played for magnificently kooky effect whenever there's an opportunity for blood splattering, grinning insanely as he takes a chainsaw to his lover's head or his own wrist.'That's right...who's laughing now!'Well, you are, most of the time. The violence is often shocking, but never in an ugly way, things always progressing in cartoon-like fashion. Raimi keeps the camera in motion for episodes of thrilling humor, like one sequence early on when the lens chases Ash through every room of the cabin, with doors whipping and crashing so fast you never see the joins necessary to make it play on screen. 'Evil Dead II' was made on the cheap, it even looks cheap at times, but it never plays cheap. The film does have weaknesses. There are substandard performances by the supporting cast or a woolly ending that leaves things up in the air (for a sequel that would wind up being a mild disappointment). None of that diminishes the energy rush one gets watching a film that is as unrelentingly clever as 'Evil Dead II', so clever it actually gets funnier, if not scarier, with multiple viewings. It's a wonderfully twisted example of the magic of cinema.",8,0,1,1 November 2012
High Fidelity," Funniest relationship movie of the new millennium
","Okay, I know more about movies than I do relationships, but if the latter are anywhere near as good as cracked up to be, 'High Fidelity' would be a killer representation of the highs and lows of commitment, love, and tenderness circa the turn of the century. And it is. So there.This movie could have been a trap so easily. Self-absorbed Gen X losers whine about losing their perfectly toned girlfriends because they can't focus on how good they have it as they lounge on their Ikea sofas wired to their Bang & Olafson stereos smoking unfiltered Camels. Boo-hoo. But the central character rivets you in, sad-eyed and begging for your sympathy. John Cusack shows himself to have evolved into quite a professional actor, moving beyond the pleasing if callow roles of his youth with a performance that makes great use of his expressive eyes and his spot-on phrasing. The way he answers the phone the first time Laura calls his character Rob at Championship Vinyl, with the start, the stop, the door close, the pause for a puff of his cigarette, and then his matter-of-fact hello, without seeming to miss a beat. Very surface, yes, but in a practiced, disarming way that makes you feel left in, not out. He shines like that throughout; never too showy, just there when you notice it.As he explains his situation to the viewer in a series of personal narrations, he makes matter-of-fact lines breathe with the understatement of a Robert Benchley bon mot. More important, he reels the viewer in with the same sense of emphathetic desperation that Michael Caine employed in the similarly single-callow-guy-confessional-themed 'Alfie.' At times, you even think of Olivier in some of his juicier, more sinister confidences in 'Richard III.' You find yourself not liking Rob much of the time, but even at his lowest (whining about Laura's inevitable resolution with Ian after Rob just sampled the pleasures of Marie DeSalle) his confessonary character pushes such quibbles away.Cusack is the central performance, and I love Jack Black's star-making second-banana role as well as the many great cameos, from Tim Robbins to Sara Gilbert, but without even looking at all the people who wrote before me, I'm rashly predicting nearly all ignored Iben Hjejle. I don't know how to pronounce that either, except if we were in Copenhagen it would roll off our tongue like Julia Roberts. (The female lead, despite her excellent English, is from Denmark, and apparently went back there after just this one great role. We did manage to get rid of Brigit Neilsen after 'Cobra,' too, but it still seems like the Danes got the best of the bargain.) Hjejle makes such an impression as Laura. From reading the screenplay, you might think of her as a bitch just given how she leaves poor Rob flat, but no. Instead, because of her careful line readings, the humble shafts of vulnerable humor she uses to (almost absently) puncture his bleak half-catatonia, and that glorious half-moon smile she shoots while simultaneously defensive and sincere, you really root for her and Rob to come together again, and because you do, the whole rest of the picture works. Hjejle puts over a delicate balancing act. Just imagine Shannon Doherty in the role instead. It's what I mean about the film avoiding the callow trap. You care too much about the people involved, and your caring invests the picture with the sort of meaning that elevates it to real art.Reading the book, one is impressed by how well the screenwriters did by not veering too far from the veddy British Nick Hornby's story. The four screen scribes (including Cusack) take nearly every cue Hornby gives them, starting with the Top Five list of women/girls who dumped the hero, capturing the record store in much of its written form (even with most of the same pop music references, as we've been on much the same page musically with the Mother Country since the Beatles went on Ed Sullivan). There's not much missing from the book, but since the book's such a fine tight read, and Hornby keeps the plot zipping along, that's a good thing. Still, if you enjoyed the movie, you won't be disappointed. The book fleshes out some things and amplifies others.Finally, the dialogue is so crisp and effective, funnier and snarkier than a season's worth of 'Saturday Night Live,' and I love SNL. My favorite line this week is Dick describing Marie DeSalle: 'She's a little Sheryl Crowish, crossed with a post-Partridge Family, pre-L.A. Law Susan Dey kind of thing, except, you know, black.'Where can I find a good Beta Band CD, anyway?",9,1,3,3 November 2003
From Here to Eternity," Eternity In One Quick Installment
","That James Jones' novel had the word 'Eternity' in its title seems no accident. It runs over 800 pages, features multiple story arcs, and more or less continued through two subsequent books, one of which became a celebrated film in its own right: 'The Thin Red Line'.That film lasts nearly three hours. This one clocks in at under two. I give scripter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann credit for that. The story is tightly focused, but with room to breathe. The characters stick out, but as people, not caricatures. There's a lot of good performances and some nice lines.So why don't I like it more? Maybe because I expected a movie that is set around the U.S. military in Oahu in late 1941 to be more about the stuff that interests me, particularly the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that December. By focusing on the romances of two military men, including a dangerous affair with a commanding officer's wife, 'Eternity' serves up a lot more 'Kings Row' than Battleship Row.The best thing in the movie for me, by far, is Montgomery Clift's performance as the central character, Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt. Clift creates in Prewitt a solitary, edgy character who just happens to really love being in the Army even as he is pushed by his commander to perform various hard duties in order to make him box. 'A man loves a thing don't mean it's got to love him back,' he tells his unbelieving girlfriend.There's distinctive support work, particularly from Burt Lancaster as Prewitt's virile, understanding 'topkick' master sergeant, Warden; and Frank Sinatra as Prewitt's wisecracking pal Maggio. All three were nominated for Oscars, and Sinatra won his in part because he didn't have to compete with the other two. (Lancaster and Clift were both nominated for Best Actor; Sinatra for Supporting Actor). Ernest Borgnine lends such menace to his first big role as prison sergeant 'Fatso' Judson it's hard to believe he didn't go on to fame strictly as a cinematic heavy.Are the romances of Prewitt and Warden really so involving, or are they more like dead-end relationships that tie down the film for long stretches into exercises in alcoholic navel-gazing? Prewitt's core conflict with the military is compellingly introduced but never adequately resolved. Both Prewitt and Maggio are set up as victims of circumstance, but seem more in the end like prisoners of their own stupidity.There are a number of good scenes in 'Eternity', and a couple of great ones. In one, Prewitt takes on Judson in a back alley in a scene that is played not for excitement but sordidness; I felt like I needed a bath just watching it. The other is the last scene, where lead actresses Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr meet for the only time. Reed's final speech was a head-scratcher to me for a while, but it sticks with you precisely because it's so off-kilter - like war's aftermath itself.But 'Eternity' also has one scene that is overrated: Kerr and Lancaster getting wet together on a beach. It set pulses racing in 1953 but doesn't do so much now except remind me of 'Airplane!' Overall, 'Eternity' offers a master class in the art of boiling down something big into something that's cinematically digestible. The result is decent enough but doesn't leave you wanting more.",7,4,5,21 July 2009
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Opryland Odyssey
","Mississippi Gov. Pappy O'Daniel is consulting with his campaign staff about a tough election opponent:'He's pulling' our pants down.' 'Gonna paddle a little behind.''Ain't gonna paddle it - gonna kick it, real hard.''No, I believe he's gonna paddle it.''I don't believe that's a proper characterization.'Such a discussion can mean only two things: Either we are witnessing one of the most inept campaigns in the history of democracy, or we are watching another marvelously quotable Coen Brothers comedy.'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is something more than that, though, a fun story that resonates with the spirit of the bygone American South and cadges elements of Homer's 'Odyssey' to create a sturdy central story featuring three runaway jailbirds who encounter a number of detours (including O'Daniel's re-election campaign) while seeking treasure.George Clooney shines as the leader of the three, the loquacious, philosophic Ulysses Everett McGill ('It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart,' he says when pressed to explain why he stole a watch.) Clooney rises to the challenge of playing a period character with nice touches of slapstick enhancing his characteristically slick delivery.Clooney is ably aided and abetted by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, who play hayseeds 'dumber than a bag of hammers' who accompany Ulysses on his quest. Turturro, who made his name playing more modern urban characters, does particularly well as the most ornery member of the group.The characters may not be that deep, but then they never are in Coen Brothers' films. They exist only to serve the film, and in this case, they serve quite well. The Coens are not taking things too seriously this time around, as if incorporating the highbrow structure of re-doing Homer freed them to concentrate on entertainment and audience immersion instead of arty flourishes.You really feel like you are back in 1937, with the attention to detail in look and sound. When Ulysses curses about his favorite hair pomade not being available in a general store, the proprietor admonishes him this is 'a public place' and he won't stand for such talk. The 'old-timey' musical score put the film on the map, and you get a rich gumbo of bluegrass and Jimmie Rodgers-era country music, with some blues and gospel thrown in. It's such a throwback, it comes across as exotic. Then again, you could say the same of the whole film.Some of the bits work better than others. John Goodman, great in the otherwise erratic Coen Brothers film 'The Big Lebowski,' is a weak link as the film's version of Homer's menacing Cyclops, and Holly Hunter is a bit one-note as Ulysses' adamantine wife.But any weaknesses are easy to overlook when you get such wonderful bits as the campaign of Gov. O'Daniel (Charles Durning, never better), a bank-heist spree with George 'don't call him Babyface' Nelson and Stephen Root's deliciously goofy turn as a bug-eyed music promoter who re-directs Ulysses' fortunes. The music is very cleverly integrated throughout the film; even the Ku Klux Klan gets to perform a pretty cool number.Watching 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' you'll wonder where the time went, and want to see it again for all the clever bits of Coen business you missed the first time. And if that last image of the film isn't forever burned in some corner of your mind, there is something serious wrong with your soul.",8,0,0,15 May 2006
The Godfather," An Offer You Don't Want To Refuse
","'The Godfather's' greatness extends beyond my ability to sing its praises, so there's not much insight I can offer. Except this: If you haven't seen the movie, and think like I did that you'll be disappointed doing so, see it anyway.I did. And I was disappointed, at least the first time I saw it. It was good, I thought, but not that good. Like this character gets killed off too quickly, or the movie spends too much time away from the main story following one character in Sicily, or that famous lilting melody I grew up with doesn't come up for over an hour. I thought it was good, but overrated.But then I saw it again. Wow, what a difference. Three hours flew so quickly, and I found myself totally immersed in the many different stories going on simultaneously, as well as the way director Francis Ford Coppola weaves them so effectively. 'The Godfather' has this ability to hit you a completely different way when you see it again, because there's so much depth to what you see on screen at any given moment. But at the same time, unlike a lot of 'deep-thought' pictures, it's wonderfully accessible, at least to a multiple-time viewer like me.The story at the heart of things is simple. A mafia family, the Corleones, are going through a rough patch. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) appears to be slipping as rival crime families vie to get into the narcotics market, which Don Vito has always eschewed. After one particularly rough gangster named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) makes a move on the Don, its up to Vito's previously clean son Michael (Al Pacino) to involve himself in family affairs and help Pop out.That the Corleones are the underdogs in this movie is part of its brilliant perversity. The movie gets you rooting for them, to the point where your journey becomes similar to Michael's. The corruption he embraces in pursuit of his father's salvation becomes something you root for, until at the end, when it culminates in an orgy of violence, you might like me get as pumped about it as you would be watching your favorite sports team pull out a come-from-behind win.Great dialogue, too, fantastically delivered. Everyone is so excellent in this movie, yet at the same time so understated. From the direction to the cinematography to the music, there's a quietness to the movie that's almost eerie, and does a lot to pull you in. Pacino, Brando, and Lettieri could all be big actors, but they all keep it contained here, especially Brando whose opening scene as the Don sets the bar very high. James Caan is the closest this movie has to an outsized performance, as Michael's hot-tempered older brother Sonny, but even he only boils up once in a while. The phrase 'It's not personal, it's business,' comes up a few times in this movie, and the scary thing is it really is for them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And if you have already, and didn't think it was that great, see it again. You may wind up as amazed as me at what a difference a second viewing can make.",10,5,7,20 March 2013
