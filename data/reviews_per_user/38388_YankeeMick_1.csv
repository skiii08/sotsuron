Scarface," The greatest...
","Scarface is the greatest movie of all time! Well, that might be pushing it, but it is definately one of the greatest movies in the past 20 years. I can't believe ranked Lord of the Rings higher than this. I'm so sick of hearing about Star Wars & Lord of the Rings. If you wanna waste your time with that crap, then go right ahead. But if you wanna see one of the best pieces of acting in history, then sit down & enjoy watching Al Pacino play Tony Montana! The world is yours!",10,6,12,29 September 2003
