Requiem for a Dream," Powerful, depressing, moving, a memorable experience
","After seeing 'Requiem for a dream' by mastermind Darren Aronofsky, it only sickens me more over the academy's choice to crown Julia Roberts with best actress at the oscars this year.  Not only was Julia's role a sterotypical one (one woman against 'the world') it also couldn't hold a candle to Ellen Burstyn's role as a diet pill addicted woman in Requiem.  Really, the only drug movie that has ever really disturbed me emotionally and scared me (and I saw the rated version).  However, the elements of fright are used well to weave a tale of four separate people dealing with their own drug problems. Much better than the overpolished, cliched 'Traffic', 'Requiem for a Dream' seems more realistic and really shows almost the worst case scenario among people using drugs for recreational use. A good movie for high schoolers and up to see who are contemplating using drugs because this shows what it can do to any person's life.  Hopefully Aronofsky's upcoming take on Batman, Batman:Year One, will be even half as good as this movie is.  10/10 Superb.",10,1,2,11 July 2001
Fight Club," Amazingly original film...
","When first released, Fight Club was panned by most critics probably just because it was the safe thing to do.  Fight Club brings up many dangerous thoughts that might actually be true.  The film Fight Club is not only about the title club, it's also about a man's (Edward Norton) plunge into near insanity due to insomnia and can't seem to find a solution.  This was until he met the rebellious Tyler Durden.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is a man who is against everything that's materialistic and artificial.  This includes big business and models among other things.  Both men decide to come up with a club all men can work out their aggressions bearing the name Fight Club. Director David Fincher paints a dark and gritty film depicting a man's life spiraling out of control and the man who brings his life back into perspective (or so it seems).  The ending cannot be matched in sheer surprise.  Even 'The Sixth Sense' cannot compare.  This movie requires repeat viewings and IMO is second to only 'The Matrix' for the year 1999 . 9/10",9,1,3,6 August 2001
Memento," This film is a true testimony of how rigged the oscars are...
","Memento, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a visual trip.  This film is one true example, along with Requiem for a Dream and Crouching Tiger, that the oscars aren't a good meter of how good a film truly is.  Memento totally blows Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring out of the water.  The story possesses a great concept; how would you exact revenge on your wife's killer if you could only remember in 15 minute lapses?  Guy Pearce handles the part well by taking the role seriously and convincingly.  Definitely a film that requires repeated viewings, Memento is THE film noir of the new decade.Rating: 10/10",9,0,1,2 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very good film, if a bit overrated....
","Lord of the Rings' first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring, is an enchanting film to behold.  Well directed by Peter Jackson, some of the set pieces and fight scenes are simply breathtaking.  They have to be seen to be believed.  However, it does have its share of flaws too.  Overlength is its main problem, it never seems to end.  As you can see with the average rating this film has, Fellowship of the Ring is quite overrated too.  How this film can rank above such action classics as The Road Warrior, Mad Max, and Jaws is beyond me.  Although not the best film of the year (my pick for best of the year is Memento), this film definitely holds its own in terms of book to screen adaptations. Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,9 February 2002
The Thing," Modern sci-fi/horror classic.
","'The Thing', directed by John Carpenter, is actually a remake of a previous film titled 'The Thing from Another World' that both terrifies and excites many times during the movie.  With bravura special effects by Rob Bottin (The Howling, Fight Club, etc.), 'The Thing' centers around a group of scientists in Antarctica who come across something much worse that anyone could have expected.  Carpenter's other films he directed after this still can't touch this film as it remains potent to this day.  Besides 'Halloween', this is Carpenter's best attempt at horror.  The ending does leave it open for a sequel, but unfortunately, the low box office for this film didn't merit one.  It's a shame because this is a modern sci-fi classic that everyone should attempt to see.  9/10",9,0,1,23 July 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," Hilarious, must see movie from vets of Saturday Night Live.
","Definitely IMO one of the best comedies of all time, 'This is Spinal Tap' is a hilarious and often scathingly true satire documenting the many pitfalls 'Britain's Loudest Band' encounters while with famed commercial director Marti DiBergi (Rob Reiner).  I won't spoil any of the great gags, but I will say it involves close attention and repeat viewings to get many of the jokes before they happen.  Derek Smalls, Nigel Tufnel, and David St. Hubbins are Spinal Tap (along with drummer Mick Shrimpton and clueless keyboarder Viv Savage) and play many ludicrously titled 'hits' during the film with hilarious results.  Highly recommended, 10/10.",10,0,1,11 July 2001
Platoon," Best portrayal of Vietnam War ever made.
","'Apocalypse Now' and 'The Deer Hunter' come close, but 'Platoon' is the best Vietnam war movie made bar none.  Oliver Stone's supposedly autobiographical account of two sergeants, Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger), who fight over seemingly everything, is moving and has many memorable scenes throughout the movie.  Charlie Sheen is a man who foolishly offers to join the army without being drafted and pays dearly for his mistake.  Sheen, Dafoe, Berenger, and many others give great performances that give the movie a horrific feel.  If you look closely, you can actually see Oliver Stone make a cameo near the end of the film as a general that gets blown up by a kamikaze Vietcong Soldier with a bomb on his back.  Very good film - 10/10.",10,0,1,24 July 2001
The Deer Hunter," Accurate and sad depiction of life during and after the Vietnam War.
","The Deer Hunter concerns a group of deer-hunting friends in Pittsburgh, PA who work in a steel mill.  Their lives rapidly change, however, when they're all drafted for the Vietnam War.  Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken (who won an academy award for his work in this film) are two of the main buddies in the War taking place before them.  This film won the Best Picture Oscar in 1979 and rightfully so.  One of the most memorable parts of the movie is the Russian Roulette scenes which create some of the most tension ever for a drama.  After 'The Deer Hunter', director Michael Cimino unfortunately struck out with his bomb effort 'Heaven's Gate' which lost tons of money and was panned by critics. 10/10",10,0,0,24 July 2001
The Truman Show," Jim Carrey+breakthrough performance=great movie
","This movie is one of the very few ever made that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. A work of pure genius, The Truman Show showcases Jim Carrey's enormous talents as an unaware man called Truman Burbank who has been taped his entire life without knowing it.However, he starts noticing things and becomes quite suspicious of his surroundings. What goes from there is pure moviemaking magic. It's a shame that Carrey didn't even get nominated for his role at the academy awards because he more than deserved it. My rating:4 out of 4 stars",8,0,0,19 May 1999
The Matrix," Best Film of 1999....
","The Matrix is a  comic book like film that should've won 1999's best picture award at the Oscars.  If you haven't seen the film, see it!  This film has probably the best imagery ever seen in an American film ever!  Keanu Reeves' wooden acting doesn't even hamper the movie!  It actually gives it a type of comic feel.  The special effects are awesome and the actors look cool doing it.  Every time there's a fight scene, it seems fresh and original.  This was the first time I'd seen wire work period.  Wire work is also utilized well in the foreign film 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' which was also robbed of the Best Picture Oscar. This is the one action/sci-fi film no movie library should be without.  10/10",10,0,0,6 August 2001
