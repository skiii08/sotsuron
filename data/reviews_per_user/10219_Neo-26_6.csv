Alien 3," The Best of the Series
","I've never had any idea why everyone hated this movie and I never will. 'Alien 3' is the best of the series by far.  It's an artistic movie that is well directed by David Fincher and the acting is Oscar worthy.  The script may have had its flaws, but so did 'Aliens'.  'Aliens' had one of the lamest scripts  I have ever seen and the acting was even worse.  My grades for the 'Alien' films:Alien......A- Aliens.....B Alien 3....A+ Alien Resurrection....B+",9,0,4,13 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A true epic masterpiece!!!
",I know I have reviewed this film before just a week ago but I have just seen it for the second time and my verdict is:  'Star Wars: Episode One-The Phantom Menace' is the greatest movie I have ever seen.  I was able to understand it better the second time and I was able to take a lot more of it in. This film may have its flaws (Name one film that doesn't) but it has taken its place atop my 'All Time Greatest' list.  My love for this grand film cannot really be expressed through words.  'The Phantom Menace' easily outclasses the first 3 movies in almost every way.  My grade: A+++,10,0,0,26 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It may not be the best 'Star Wars' movie but it is a breathtaking joyride from beginning to end!!!
","'Star Wars: Episode One-The Phantom Menace' has everything in it that you would expect from a 'Star Wars' movie: Spectacular special effects, tons of action, great characters, and kid-friendly humor.  I walked into the theater with my expectations down because of the so so reviews it had gotten from the critics, but I walked out of the theater with a glimmer in my eyes and a big, silly grin on my face.  I absolutely loved this movie.  And no matter what everyone says, Jar Jar Binks is not annoying.  Well, okay, he started to get on my nerves a couple of times but I still loved him.  He made me laugh a a few times, too.  All of the actors in this film were great, especially Liam Neeson.  He may not win any Oscars for this movie but his performance in this movie blows away the performances by all of the actors in the original trilogy.  Jake Lloyd is a lot better than everyone would lead you to believe him to be.  I was quite surprised that a 9 year old boy could act that good.  He was terrific.  The script of the movie is on par with the best 'Star Wars' film, 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  But this movie is more like 'Return of the Jedi' that the other movies.  The movie could have been a little more serious than it was.  Not that I am complaining, though.  'Return of the Jedi' was an outstanding movie, even though it was somewhat childish.  Same here with 'The Phantom Menace'.  But isn't that what 'Star Wars' is all about?  The movies are made to appeal to the likes of kids.   But I seriously doubt that the kids who this film will fully understand the adult-like plot.  I myself found it a little confusing at times.  But you really don't have to understand EVERYTHING to enjoy this movie.  Just sit back and relax and prepared to blown away.  I give 'Star Wars: Episode One' an A+.",10,0,1,15 May 1999

The Matrix," The greatest motion picture ever made!
","'The Matrix' is, without a doubt, the greatest movie ever made. Everything about this film is remarkable: the script, the acting, and, of course, the special effects.  This movie has the most mind blowing visuals that you have to see to believe.  They are simply breath taking.  The plot of this film is unlike no other.  It's the most original movie ever made, and also, the most thought provoking.  You will leave the theater wondering if something like this could ever happen.  Or is already happening.... Do not wait for this movie on video.  See it at the theater while you can!!!",10,0,0,12 April 1999
Gladiator," Brilliant
","'Gladiator' is the first true epic masterpiece since 1995's 'Braveheart'; a film that is considered one of the best films of the decade.  'Gladiator' supasses that film in almost everyway.  Filled with wonderful perfomances by all of its stars, brutal and beautifully filmed battle scenes, and truly amazing visuals of Rome, this is one film that has to be seen to be believed. Truly awesome!!!  I give it an A+!!!",10,0,0,7 May 2000
