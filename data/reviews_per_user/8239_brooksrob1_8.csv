Ali," Rumble in the Jungle; Indeed!
","This movie has been out for nearly 15 years and I just now, in 2016, just finished it. I am truly stunned by how amazingly well the movie captures that era and it pulls no punches with its portrayal of those characters in the background of the champ. As well, the mechanization's of the US gov in coordination of the media, sports and the nation of Islam and their social engineering...This movie is more than about Ali, It's filled with many layers. I am lucky to have been a teen when the Rumble in the Jungle happened. Of course, our media did what they do...Carried the water, besmirched an 'enemy of the state'... There are so many instances of the collusions between these powerful self interest...But...If you haven't seen this movie yet, Like I hadn't...You will be as surprised as I as to how great it is! Special mention to Jon Voight...I saw Cosell his whole career...His portrayal of him was so spot on...He did him perfectly! A new angle on the 60's and 70's... race relations, government malfeasance, mob influence, Islam ...Brilliantly done.",10,1,4,5 December 2016
Deepwater Horizon," A journey into areas we don't often see...
","I read the reviews before I watched it, Generally, an over 7 is usually a decent movie and you won't be disappointed.I like the technology and the Rig speak, which for guys that work with their hands, just sounds right to the ear.These guys did a good job of portraying a Gulf of Mexico type Roughneck...Having spent 6 months in Biloxi, you meet the type...A quiet dignity and hellraisers when they're off...You have to respect the intricacies of the work these men do to keep us moving...I really liked Malkovich's role, he put some meat on that bone; :)...Of course Wahlberg is good in his role too...Nice to see Kurt keeping up too...If you're looking for subtlety and nuance, this is NOT the type of movie you should watch...If you enjoy watching men risk their lives to serve the nation's energy requirements and the sacrifices and sometimes the ultimate sacrifices, all in the name of the job; you'll be glad you saw it... Respect to all whose job can kill you...Stay safe.",8,11,15,12 November 2016
Justice League," A deserved 10 for if for anything my gal, Gal..
","I've been around since comics were a dime... So, these Super Heroes have been around most of my life. I think this group is more interesting than the Hulk, Spiderman, Iron man group - I forget what they're called. I liked that they tied the bow on Superman in this one, I didn't appreciate them murphing him in that last one...I didn't know how they'd bring him back...This is a great 'I have two hours to kill, I'm just going to veg out and let 'er play' movie...I had to give the Ten for Wonder Woman, I hate the PC stuff but, Gal is a great Wonder Woman... She's like a ten times more beautiful Linda Carter, and she was a beauty too! ...I like Affleck's batman too. I think he's the best one ever.Just watch it; if just for some of the Gal shots...;)",10,0,2,5 June 2020
Yesterday," The White Album
","I made the title to reflect how great this movie is. It's not a comparative between them. It's homage to how great the White Album ( a personal favorite of theirs) is. I just finished watching it and it helps if you LOVE the Beatles...Not a casual listener but; someone that spent thousands of hours enjoying their music...If you love the Beatles; you will love this movie, you will also most likely sob because it's a beautiful premise...:)...Enjoy!",10,1,2,1 March 2020
The Red Violin," Passion exemplified
","I choke back tears of passion as the last notes are played...I find it hard to hold them back as I read the reviews and comments of others who were touched by the story. I saw this in 98 when it was first released on VHS, At the time I enjoyed Samuel Jackson's other works, so I figured I'd give it a try. If you love music, especially Classical or music that has a violin base, and you can discern the sound of what a beautiful violin sounds like; you'll be swept up in this epic tale. The story is profound in its beauty IMDb wasn't around when I watched it the first time. After just completing watching it I just wanted to add my two cents...:) Music is life!",9,0,0,3 March 2017
"McFarland, USA"," Inspirational and educational --the perfect movie!
","You think; 'cross country?' ~smirk~ But, eventually you get around to watching this great movie because, it has Costner in it...Wow what a great movie! It makes me chuckle a bit to think I would EVER say that about anything to do with cross country running...Of course, these types of movies are formulaic, in that normal pathway of 'feel good movies'...But, the formula works. No matter how jaded I am after a half century of life. You can't but help to feel good about those who rise above their station and persevere through hardships and challenge the paradigm...This story embodies all that makes this country great. It shows that hard work most often pays off...It also shows that no matter what you come up against, dig in, grit your teeth and maybe you'll get a little stronger...Watch the movie if you haven't already, you'll have a big grin when it's over and you'll be inspired and educated just a bit more...Those are always good attributes of any endeavor...Respect to all and one love!",10,1,1,10 September 2016
Steve Jobs," It's just a movie BASED on truth...
","As such, 'BASED on truth' , It is an awesome movie. Everyone knows the Jobs story and have a general idea as to his idiosyncrasies but that's what makes the topic interesting...I watched the documentary on Waz It could have been done in a Youtube short-- and I love what a techie he is but, He's just an engineer (BORING)...:)...Jobs was larger than life. Having the burden of wearing the crown, he marches to a different tune than most...These glimpses of what it's like to be the guy who is synonymous with a major worldwide product is a peculiar position for any human being to be encased in. Sorkin does an exemplary job of being in the head of someone like Jobs...Just when you begin to dislike Jobs for who he is, He surprises you with a brilliant concept. You will enjoy the movie or not...Most likely, if you don't...You have a poster of Gates over your bed...:)...",10,0,0,28 September 2016
Sully," Sully, a GENUINE BONA FIDE AIRCRAFT COWBOY and a Great movie!
","It not often that I get a racing heart and emotionally attached to actors in a movie...I remember the hoopla of the incident but didn't give it much thought...As a USAF vet and a former avionics tech at SFO and OAK for a while, I have been around Aircraft for decades. I understand the cool demeanor these men exude...You hear often about the crashes but, you rarely hear about the near misses the limping planes back to airports or emergency landings where there is no crash... If you've listen to ATC or recordings of cockpit crosstalk you would understand it's one of the more complex human endeavors...We're using physics and defying it at the same time...That's a razor's edge! :)...If you haven't seen it yet, youtube jimmy kimmel with sully and tom hanks...:)...Sully is hilarious...Clint and Hanks are icons and this movie is a long due and fitting homage to Sully and to the many great pilots who take millions of people safely to and fro...",10,0,1,13 May 2017
