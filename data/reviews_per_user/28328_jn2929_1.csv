Iron Man 3," A Great Start for the Post-Avengers Marvel Films!
","I personally loved this film. I can understand why some are outright calling this a disappointment and a failure. Big Iron Man fans will most likely hate the film for what it did to the Mandarin. I won't spoil what they did for anyone reading this who has not yet seen the film but just know that they do something with the Mandarin that will leave many Iron Man fans enraged. I get it and I'm not saying calm down. If they did something like that to Joker in 'The Dark Knight' I would hate that film. Though I did roll with the twist and still enjoyed the film immensely and in my opinion it only got better as the film continued. Iron Man 3 started off the summer movie season in the right way, just like 'The Avengers' did the year prior. I loved the first 'Iron Man' film and while I don't hate it, I thought 'Iron Man 2' was disappointing and unnecessary. As far as Iron Man himself goes he's not in the movie much except a few times in the beginning and the huge climax at the end. This film focuses more on developing Tony Stark and showing that in essence he is Iron Man, not the suit. The suit and him are one and I love that the film addresses that so thoroughly. I love that the film goes in a different direction than the other films, which is expected since Shane Black has now replaced Jon Favreau at the helm as the director. Iron Man 3 is the darkest of the Iron Man films while also have the most humor out of all of them. There was one scene with this kid that had me dying and marveling at how Tony actually said something like that. Like the first Iron Man film, Tony Stark is placed in a position where he doesn't have all his gadgets and he has to win using his intellect. Which demonstrates that the suit is not his greatest weapon, his mind is. Once again Robert Downey Junior is in the lead role and kills it as Tony Stark and I cannot imagine anyone else playing him at this point.Though some characters did not get as much development as they should have gotten, but Iron Man 3 did what it set out to do and it did it very well. Also I don't know get what some fans are saying by calling the story a mess. How is it a mess? Sure, a lot of things happen but everything plays out very well and comes to a fine conclusion, albeit the ending is rushed.I stand by that Iron Man 3 was a greatly enjoyable installment into the Post-Avengers Marvel Universe and left me very happy and satisfied. Though, my only fear is what Joss Whedon will do with 'Avengers 2' now which he himself has stated as well. Again I won't spoil what happens but know that it has to do with Tony Stark and if you've watched the film I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.",7,2,5,16 May 2013
