The Blair Witch Project," Could have been brilliant...
","This is going to be a very inchoerent text, i´m sure, because to tell you the truth i still don´t know what to make of this movie. I don´t know, and as probably i never will, i decided to write this, and decide on the spot what i think about THE BLAIR WITCH...hemm...thing.First of all, i can´t understand how many people were fooled into thinking, this was real life footage. There´s a particulary scene where two of the characters are having a discussion and the third one is filming everything, then one of the characters who were fighting changes place with the guy holding the camera, and goes in front of camera continuing the discussion, while the other now keeps filming the whole thing. Now... Wouldn´t it be more natural, when a discussion broke out, that the guy holding the camera, would put it aside or droped it on the floor so he could break the fight apart ?... Why keep filming the whole thing and then trade places with one of the persons figihting ?It´s clear that they wanted the figth on camera, so that would create the 'classic' tense moment between friends when lost. Just this scene would be enough for me to get realy suspicious.So, apart from this...is this a good movie ? Well...where´s the movie ?...It´s a cool scam, a very good idea, with a great marketing campain.As for the movie, if the idea of random shots of trees and people walking around in the same place for about an hour is appealing to you, then go right ahead. I mean, there are 'empty' films where aparently nothing much is going on but are very profound sideways like David Lynch´s ' A Straight Story', and then there are films where nothing is going on at all like BLAIR WITCH, wich as far as i know doesn´t have any deep meaning or philosophy behind... I´m not totaly against this, because at least i think it´s a very original experience particulary nowadays where all the films have a very stylized look, but it´s no great movie.If you want an horror movie, with a crude raw look, then go rent THE EVIL DEAD instead. Or Peter Jackson´s BAD TASTE.  Now this is how you make a very low no-budget production with imagination. And i´m not talking about special effects. The problem with BLAIR WITCH is its emptiness where nothing happens, where not even the location changes. It´s not scary. It´s just boring. If the idea was to create some suspance, well it works at the begining, but then what ? The scene in the tent is brilliant and very well acomplished.  I only wished the whole movie was as creepy as this segment. The ending is abrupt and inconclusive, but of course it had to be, so this could pass for a real misterious crime footage found somewhere. Many people complain about the ending, i don´t, i think it´s perfect for this story and fits perfectly in the idea of reality.I only saw this movie at the theater, but i´m sure this one is perfect for tv, where you don´t have to ear people eating pocorns next to you, and talking about last night´s football game while nothing happened in the movie. After this kind of theater experience with BLAIR WITCH, now i give even more valour to a music soundtrack. :-)By the end, i don´t know what to think of this movie. I enjoyed it, but it could have been brilliant, instead of just original. Overall it´s a missed oportunity. Even the fake Blair Witch documentary responsible to give credibility to this story is a million times better and scary than the actual movie, wich only has two good bits, the scene in the tent with the voices of little children, and the final moments. It´s a nice peculiar movie, but it sure didn´t deserved all its sucess. On the other hand, it´s good to see someone in american movies, trying to inovate. Just for this Blair Witch should be praised. But not to much...",Null,0,1,28 July 2000
Requiem for a Dream," I´m speechless !
","Contrary to my usual comments here at Imdb, this is going to be very short, and i´m just going to say three things. This movie is a true masterpiece and ranks among the best movies ever made since the cinema was invented. This movie should get a UNIVERSAL rating, as it´s a scandal if any young person is restricted from seing this powerful movie just because it supposedly isn´t for their age. In fact all kids in every school should be locked in a room and not be allowed to leave until the movie was over as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is the best anti drugs campain you could ever get to show to a young person ! I´m not even going to say anything else, for i agree with all the positive comments ever said in this site. Miss this and you´ll be missing a movie that is everything cinema should be. A masterpiece !",Null,2,4,19 March 2001
Child 44," There's only one reason I don't give 10 to this movie...
","IT'S NOT THE BOOK people !! It's not the book ?!!I won't put any spoilers here folks, but I just have one thing to say. Read the book first.The movie is excellent, very enjoyable overall with incredible performances BUT IT'S NOT THE BOOk ! And by this I mean I still cannot believe they took out the greatest thing about the story ! The bit in the book that was like a punch in the stomach when we find the truth about the child 44 killer ! The best twist in the story is totally absent from this screenplay and this means that the psychopath in the movie version has no motive at all to do what he does. His reasons are presented in such a generic manner at the end that it almost destroys the entire movie and makes the killer character feel totally like a character that does not belong to this story after all. After the spectators spend two hours glued to all that is happening in the story at the end , the killer bit is totally irrelevant to the story !!Contrary to what happens in the book, where the killer is very well rooted in all the plot which connects the characters in unique ways. Not on the movie ! What ?! Why ?! Who thought that taking out the best twist in the book which is actually what gives meaning to the original story, a good idea ?!Why bother buying the rights to a book with such a great story and then remove all that was supposed to be the central twist of the mystery out of the screenplay ?! Somebody explain this to me because I'm absolutely puzzled here !So yet again people. READ THE BOOk FIRST ! Trust me , it won't ruin the movie for you because the writers in the movie took out the most important bits which are fundamental to the plot in the original story. The book also goes much in-depth into the characters past, even the secondary characters have a life of their own and everything feels like a thriller version of The Shadow of the Wind , if you know and loved the type of characters in that book, you'll find the same feel when you read the original Child 44 novel which is brilliant.The book is not the novel in so many aspects that it hurts. I got suspicious right at the start when I noticed that the structure didn't seemed to follow the most important bits in the novel and that really made me wonder what would happen after that regarding the characters. For example in the movie Vassilli is almost a cardboard villain, while in the novel the reader even has some empathy with him at many points of the story. And the killer is even a much deeper character than we see it in the movie. I need to shut up so I wont spoil a great book. Read the book first. The book has lots of parallel stories that are totally absent from the movie and which there's no reason for them not to be included.The movie , on its own is actually very good, some of the best scenes from the more dramatic bits in the novel are there, but even on this the movie downplays and simplifies everything. Nervetheless it's a very entertaining movie, with a great cast and brilliant acting and lots of atmosphere. It feels a bit fragmented sometimes but that is because of what gave some of the characters a soul was mysteriously removed from the screenplay.Perhaps the greatest mystery in the Child 44 movie version is why they did almost everything right except leaving out the great twist on the book regarding the killer mystery.But i need to give it a 8 out of 10 nevertheless because it's a great drama set on Russia and even from an historical point of view deserves to be seen.Just...read the book first. Please.",8,2,8,24 July 2015
Casablanca," ' I came to Casablanca for the waters. '
","This is one of the best movies ever. And strangely enough i don´t think it´s because of the story. To me its because of the incredible atmosphere in it. In this movie it seems that all was in the right place at the right time.One thing that people don´t talk much about, is that Casablanca is filled of special effects, and the best thing about it is that nobody notices them, which in my book is the best thing anyone can say about such a good work. From the fake Casablanca town, to the fake airport scenes (which were filmed indoors) this movie is a true special effects masterpiece. They were used not to impress the audience, but to create a believable world instead. Many modern movies could have learned a lot from Casablanca.And then there is that out of this world photography in black and white, which created some of the most beautiful lit closeups i ever saw in a movie so far, and made Bergman into one of the most beautiful women that ever appeared in a movie screen. Another masterpiece.All this combined with a magnificent screenplay filled with memorable lines, a perfect soundtrack to each scene and a great cast. This movie will never go out of date, because of the magnificent atmosphere it has. And the characters are great, everyone in this story has some human weakness, something that we don´t see much this days. It´s this imperfections that end up creating the suspanse in the movie, because when we see it for the first time we know that anything can happen.This is a fantastic movie for every reason, but at the same time for no reason at all.Maybe it´s because no matter how many times we see it, this film still makes us feel something diferent.This really is a masterpiece, and the best part is that it wasn´t intented to be. It was just another 40´s popcorn movie.So watch it, and watch it again, watch it forever because 100 years from now people will still be talking about it. Just stay away from that awful computer colored version ! That almost destroyed all the excelent photographic work.If you don´t like Black and White, make an effort and watch it anyway, because i bet in the end you´ll end up loving B&W. It worked for me. Do yourselves a favor and forget about the color version. It just isn´t the real Casablanca.",Null,0,0,17 August 1999
Dawn of the Dead," The best action/adventure movie since Aliens.
","I don't have much of positive to say about this movie that hasn't been said here before by other persons, but i truly loved this movie. Unfortunely i haven't seen in in the theaters, but i just saw the new DVD with th directors cut, and i was truly surprised by what he achieved with this pic. It was more like an un-official sequel to 28 Days Later but that was one of the reasons i really enjoyed this movie now. It gave me more of what i wanted to see in 28 Days Later, and it was perfectly successful in creating an atmosphere of pure end of the world in a bigger scale. And it was as much scary as it was thrilling to watch. Very good characters we cared about and excellent action scenes which didn't compromised the atmosphere just to flash off some effects. A very well balanced film with also a fantastic beginning.I loved all the old versions of Romero and much of all the zombie stuff, but this remake now kept me on the edge of my sofa the entire time. I bought the DVD two days ago, (along with Star Wars), and Star Wars is still inside the box, while i've seen Dawn of the Dead twice now. By the way great audio commentary also on the DVD.This movie brought me back the thrills i had when i first saw Aliens. The character of JC even reminded me of Hicks in some way and so in an age where most of the blockbusters who come out of Hollywood are nothing but a bunch of boring junk-food for the eyes, it was great to find an action movie who totally delivered what it promised. Scary and exciting. One of the best adventure movies in a veeeery long time also. 10, out of 10Please make another !",10,2,4,27 September 2004
12 Monkeys," Good cinema science fiction isn´t dead after all !
","The main reason i realy like this movie, it´s because somehow it doesn´t feel like a regular sci-fi overproduced hollywood product. Just because it has a great story. Each time i see this, it seems like i´ve just read a very good sci-fi novel, instead of simply watching a movie.12 MONKEYS, has probably the best time travel story i´ve seen in a movie so far. It´s less complex than it seems at first, but it manages to keep us interested right up untill the final moments. Altough the ending is very easy to guess, right at the begining of the movie. But this is only if you are someone who has read many science fiction through out the years. If you did, your mind will start thinking on possibilities and time-travel clichés the moment this movie starts. And there is a great possibility you´ll guess everything right away. But that´s another way of watching this story, i guess, because it´s great to think about it while we are watching it, an dtry to form our own conclusions. And this story is filled with small details.So if you are just a regular 'hollywoodian' movie goer, and don´t like to think much at the movies, stay away from 12 MONKEYS, because chances are you´ll probably won´t like it. But if you like sience fiction, go right ahead, because this one of the best sci-fi in the 90´s.Visualy it´s fantastic, with a very original production design, wich make everything look like as if it was taken from an european graphic novel, or BD or comics, whatever you want to call it. The scenes set in the future are just excelent, with a very claustrophobic feel, even when they are set on open spaces sometimes. We realy can feel that the world has come to an end, and this adds a great atmosphere to the scenes set in the present, because we have already seen how the future looks like.Bruce Willis and Brad Pit do an incredible job in this movie, an dwe can never choose wich one we admire the most, altough Brad Pit playing a schizofrenic mad man, is totaly convincing and he´s one of the main reasons to watch 12 MONKEYS even if you don´t like sci-fi.I don´t know what else to say, without revealing the plot, so i won´t say nothing more, except you have to see this movie. Just watch it alone or with someone who has  also never seen it. Try to watch it without knowing to much about it and you´ll love it much more. Part of the fun in it is to watch things being revealed.",Null,0,0,9 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The most delightful funny movie i ever seen in my life !
","And incredibly cute also !I must start by saying that i knew the characters, but i never had seen a single episode of the series before. We don´t have the series here in Portugal, and so the movie wasn´t even released here. But i knew the characters by fame, and i was always very curious to see this movie. I bought the DVD a couple of days ago, and it just totaly blows me away each time i watch it.I´ve already seen it 5 times ! And i can´t stop watching, sometimes i just listen to it, because of the songs. This movie has such a positive feel, that it always cheers me up. Every time i punch play, i just can´t take the dvd out no more untill it has ended. This is totaly adictive, because it´s so wild and crazy, not to say brilliantly acted. We can see the actors were having lots of fun, and that totaly transmists to the viewer. It´s impossible not be in a good humor watching this.And the songs are trully brilliant. Great açid lyrics and crazy tunes, pontuated with brilliant small almost tender classic musical moments that always end with a punch line. Or shoul i say a punch in our stomach. :-)The only fact that i think works against it, is that this movie is so anti-politicaly correct, that becomes almost armless.I tell you, i don´t have any problem with letting young kids watching this.In fact i think everyone should watch this, because it´s such a perfect depiction of the moral hypocrisy that exists in the world today, that the fact that this movie is rated R is just the confirmation of that same way of thinking, wich should always be fought. And nothing like good humor, and very well writen one to fight the false moralities.This is a very happy movie. In fact one of the most beautifull movies i´ve seen lately. Nothing like an honesty of a kid to show us how the world realy is and what can we do about it.Brilliant movie. Great fun, great songs, great acting and  great humor and a very inteligent movie. What more can we ask ? In fact this movie is F#$%&# GREAT !!! (i would love to have writen the actual f-word here, but i bet i´m not allowed.)But hey, that´s what SOUTH PARK: BIGGER,LONGER AND UNCUTT is. I´m a fan.",Null,0,0,19 May 2000
Léon: The Professional," I can´t believe some people accuse this movie of supporting pedophilia !! This is an amazing film !
","I think the people who accuse this movie of promoting pedophilia are totally missing the point here. But i don´t agree with the ones who defend it as being nothing more than a big friendship story either.This is a Love story all right.Once again LUC BESSON has managed to create and film another truly original and impossible adult love story in wich love is presented first of all as an emotion.Like in ' BIG BLUE/LE GRAND BLEU ', BESSON is much more interested in presenting Love as a pure human feeling than as something that is conditioned by the actual modern society.In other movies love is always depending on external factors and almost controls the story and the characters. When LUC BESSON films it, love is always present but in a pure and subtle way, that apparently doesn´t interfere directly in the main story, but ends up being the cause of it.He films it only as an emotion that isn´t depending in gender, race,sex, or in this case age. That´s why he never uses this emotion to create the usual subplots for his movies. Because it´s too pure and simple and it would be very dificult to invent some conflicts for the story and at the same time keep it like that.Maybe i´m sounding too intellectual, but i can´t find another way to explain what i think. That´s what i like about Luc Besson. He first makes us feel, then he makes us think.So this is why i think there is nothing dirty about this movie. Pedophilia here is on the minds of the people who wish to see it. There is a love story between Leon and Mathilda, but it´s just that. Love.True love, if you like. Everybody can imagine they have sex if they want to, but don´t go blame the movie for it.The only dirty shamefull scenes in LEON are in the minds of the people who wished they were there in the first place. Of course everyone thinks about the possibility of sex between Leon and Mathilda, but that´s not because of what´s in the movie. It´s because we are conditioned to think this way.There is nothing wrong with this movie. It´s original, it has a fabulous story, very human characters, excellent action scenes and amazing actors. And it has style ! JEAN RENO is an amazing actor as he had already proved in ' THE BIG BLUE ', and it´s great to see him in a role where he can show is worth for a change. Unfortunately in Hollywood no one seems to have noticed this because his later characters in american productions have all been nothing more than cardboard clichés. But that´s Hollywood.The rest of the cast couldn´t have been better. The girl Natalie Portman, is already a magnificent actress and G.Oldman and Danny Aielo are perfect for their characters.This is a fantastic movie. See it without any pre-conceived ideas and you´ll love it. A true love story.",10,0,2,18 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Too long ?! What do you mean ?! If it had an hour more it could have been perfect !!
","I really can´t understand why some people dislike the movie because they think it´s too long. What do you mean too long ?! Have you people read the novel at least ?! Perhaps if you did, you should have noticed the huuuuuuuge amount of extraordinary content that was left out from the first volume alone ! Because as an adaptation i agree with the persons who say it´s not that great. It´s not. But for it to be as good as this adaptation deserved to be, this first movie would have to have at least one hour more. Actually, a couple of hours more, such is the details that were left out from the original novel.But books and movies are two different media which will never mix no matter how good movie-adaptations are, so to my knowledge and opinion, this movie adaptation of LOTR is as good as it could have been done. It´s 'perfect', it couldn´t have been done beter ! Peter Jackson has all my respects and congratulations because considering the task he had ahead he performed almost a miracle. He didn´t ruin the books.He simply made a movie called Lord of the Rings, wich is based on a great book who couldn´t ever be well adapted to moving pictures. I can bet , that if all the details from the novel were in the movie, everybody would say that the movie sucked because it wouldn´t have had that action-adventure feeling it now has, and it would have had a more literary story telling pace. Not that it would bothered me much, as i would love to have seen all the richness of Tolkien´s text in the screen, but if that was like that, this movie would have been a comercial flop. Someone would even call it an Art House movie, i can bet.So the way it was done, i think it´s 'perfect'. Ok the characters are shallow, but if you´re a fan of the novel you already know their background and you´ll fill in the blacks in your mind, (it happend to me at least). For those who never read the novel, (or any other book in their life), i´m sure they couldn´t care less about character development and they just want to see some action, battles and special effects. And so they have. OK, it was the most commercial route for Jackson to go, but really, what have you done instead ? The action bits are very well integrated, the plot might seem shallow (to those who read the books), but i don´t see any other way of adapting a novel such as this. Because if you forget about the books for a second, you´ll notice that this movie has much more story in it than the usual Pseudo-Fantasy (for kids) Hollywood plastic unimaginative crap we get throwned at our faces normaly,(see Willow or Dungeons&Dragons. People seem to forget that this is a movie, not a book.In fact i think this movie with all its flaws has even a great thing going for it. Besides the fact that it doesn´t ruins the book it even makes people who never read before want to pick up the novels and read them. I know of people who never read anything other than sports papers in their lives who are now devouring everything that Tolkien wrote. And i never saw any movie do that before !!!Visually i personally think its a work of art, with incredible adaptations of the work of Alan Lee and John Howe on the screen as i never thought possible. Actualy LOTR might not be a good adaptation of the original text, but i don´t believe anyone really thinks it´s a bad adaptation of the geographical settings that Tolkien described, as to me personaly, i never before had seen a movie in wich the images resembled so much what i had imagined when reading the novel that originated them ,(with the exception maybe of The Name of the Rose and Dune, perhaps). So enjoy this movie and read the books, because this is one of those rare cases where seeing a movie doesn´t spoil at all the story and you can read the novel afterwards to grasp and be amazed at what was deleted in the movies. Chances are that you´ll end up loving both of them.Oh by the way, if you loved LOTR, book and movie, don´t miss the BBC RADIO VERSION ,audio dramatization of the novels, because you won´t believe your ears as it´s a fantastic adaptation of the novel, and of course much more detailed than the movie. Lots of actors, great sound effects and a fantastic soundtrack that it´s everything the one from the movie should have been ,(as to me the movie soundtrack is the only 'weak' thing in Peter Jackson´s adaptation). If you think listening to a radio drama is boring, then you never heard this BBC radio version ! 14 CDs of pure high fantasy. Buy it at Amazon or at the BBC site and you won´t be disappointed. Just make sure you buy the one with Ian Holm wich plays Bilbo Baggins in the movie, because in the radio version he played Frodo magnificently. Be careful not to buy the american radio version wich is an inferior product, buy the BBC one. Besides it´s great to listen while you wait for the release of the movie in DVD.If you haven´t seen the movie, forgget about bad reviews, this is a great fantasy movie. After this one, Fantasy has achieved a new status, and i doubt that will it be connected by Hollywood as a childrens product from now on ,as it has been done right up untill now. LOTR is for Fantasy what STAR WARS was to Space Opera back in the seventies. A great movie.",Null,0,0,20 March 2002
Pitch Black," Everything Alien 3 and 4 should have been.
","Now, this is how you do an Alien movie !Altough i find it a bit unffair to compare this to the Alien series, because in a way this is nothing more than a classic 50´s flick , (where Alien got its idea also),  where a bunch of astronauts get marooned on a strange planet and they get attacked by creepy alien life forms. Replace the giant crabs, snakes and spiders with three heads by some great modern looking aliens and we got PITCH BLACK. With a diference...in this movie the human characters are interesting, have personality and we end up caring for them, much more than we expected, after seeing dozens of alien monster movies through the years.In fact the characters was the thing in the movie that surprised me more, after all i already was expecting good special effects. In fact i wasn´t even counting to get much more out of this movie than just some good action sequences. I was surprised to find such well writen parts for such diferent characters, in a movie that didn´t asked for it to make money in the box-office.And i loved the fact that there were no Hollywood superstars in it. Just this fact made this story much more credible, and right untill the end we are never to sure about who´s going to survive. This movie has achieved something that rarely we see in a movie. That is, inside a story that almost doesn´t exist, there are some excelent characters wich realy keep us interested and fill the usual 'empty' bad-aliens-eat-good-dudes story with small details and characteristics. The details in this movie are another good thing, and i particulary liked the idea of using Arab characters stranded in a desert planet.There is not much to say about this excelent movie, the characters are excelent particulary the prisioner Riddick, the special effects are excelent, there are some good scares, it´s a great space adventure movie like it wasn´t seen in ages, nice little twists during the plot, fantastic sound particulary during the crash scene, it has plenty of little details everywhere on sets and script, and the visual style is magnificent. In fact i don´t care much for this type of MTV edditing style, ( i didn´t liked it in Matrix for example altough it´s a good movie), but in this case i think it works wonders for PITCH BLACK because it doesn´t exagerates, trying to give style, instead of being used just to tell a story.In fact the direction gives a nice personal feel to this movie, and we can see the director trully likes sci-fi. I never heard of this guy David N Twohy before, but he sure is on my favorites list  for sci-fi, and i can´t wait to see his next film. An excelent little movie, that i recommend to everybody who preffers substance over style. Particulary in an apparent empty plot.PITCH BLACK is a real good surprise, and to me one of the best three movies i´ve seen this year along with MAGNOLIA and the SIXTH SENSE, altough they have nothing in common.More please.",9,0,0,16 June 2000
Hugo," If you like Carlos Ruiz Zafon , 'The Shadow of the Wind' novel, you'll love this movie !
","If you're reading my review, either you know of Carlos Zafon's books and you are compelled by my reference or you haven't got a clue of what am i talking about and so you're curious to see why i posted a title like that.If you know of Carlos Zafon's books and you're still here reading this, chances are that you absolutely loved his novels such as 'The Shadow of the Wind'','Angel's Game' and 'Marina', at the most.So...if just by me mentioning Zafon's 'The Shadow of the Wind' is enough for you to recall that haunted, poetic and beautiful atmosphere from his books, well strangely enough it's all here exactly like that in this Scorcese movie !  Because...Watching Hugo is like reading the Carlos Ruiz Zafon book he never wrote but could have written and this is very hard to explain to people who haven't experienced this film knowing about novels like 'The Shadow of the Wind'. The way the plot feels almost non existent if you're expecting it to be like a typical Hollywood movie where everything has to be explained , defined and mixed with action scenes every ten minutes. The way it creates a magical world based on real places as Scorcese does with Paris in the movie what Zafon does it with Barcelona in his novels. The way characters are all weaved into the atmosphere of the place and although their stories don't need to touch they are all part of the same magical universe, which has magic without the need to have traditional fairytale or fantasy stuff in. Christopher Lee in this movie plays exactly the same character you can find in Zafons novel , The Shadow of the Wind as the secret library book keeper!! So what does this all mean if you're just a casual movie goer, don't like to read and you're expecting Hugo to be like a typical action packed fantasy movie for kids ?... Well , it isn't, you've been fooled by the trailer and Hugo is not the new Harry Potter. Deal with it ! By saying this i really cannot believe that so many people attack Hugo here in IMDb, mostly because they though the trailer mislead them. You're fooled, so what ? Why throw your anger at the movie because some wise guy at the marketing department sold it as something that is not ? Why cant these angry reviewers just try to enjoy this movie for what it is ?! A fantastic but most of all - a different (!!) Hollywood movie coming out of studios that usually just throw another brainless Transformer (or clone) at you every other weekend.There's nothing wrong with the plot in Hugo. It's simple but its incredibly well done and contrary to what some bad reviews said, it was a joy to follow the (obvious) mystery, because the magic in this movie was not in th mystery or in he suspense scenes (much less in the action scenes) , but in the general ensemble final atmosphere that every little piece of the visual puzzle created. Sets, characters, world and love for the cinema. Also, i didn't think this is a movie for kids, or at least its not a kids movie for sure. Its just a movie with kids in it ! And probably one of the best and most beautiful looking movies i ever seen. If you like illustration or you're an illustrator you'll love this film to death. Its a visual steam-punk masterpiece.Contrary to what some other reviewers felt, personally, i cannot compare it to Cinema Paradiso because for me the real footage from Meliés movies didn't affected me at all with the same dramatic punch Tornatore's movie did at the end and so to me if there was something missing from Hugo was a bit of emotion and also character development because in some parts of the movie i wanted to see more of the many characters and little stories but they're never fully developed.  But i liked the little touches, i was captivated by the small glimpses of love-stories and really liked Sacha Baron Choen character which to me is really the heart of the movie in a strange kind of way that maybe shouldn't have been like that.Overall i think this is a fantastic and unique movie and one of the best American love letters to cinema I've ever seen. I wished it could be as emotional as Cinema Paradiso but it isn't and that is the only reason i don't give it ten stars. Otherwise its brilliant, poetic and beautiful in more than one way. Although i agree a little bit with people who said the documentary style stuff stalls the plot and makes some parts of Hugo seem like they belong in a different movie. I agree that was not a good choice by Scorcese and to me th repetition of those bits in the second half of the story really toned down the dramatic effect and shouldn't have been done like that at all.   The way the real footage was inserted felt too intrusive and split the movie in pieces for too many seconds several times when it needed to create more empathy with the audience and the characters. Anyway... If you don't go into it expecting the usual Hollywood crap blockbuster you'll enjoy the way the story is weaved. Above all if you like books and have a passion for cinema you wont forget Hugo so soon.",9,3,5,9 July 2012
The Patriot," The best COMEDY since South Park !
","Hilarious !This might sound like a strange beginning to comment on this movie, but i can´t help it. And this comments might include some *Spoilers* ,but i can´t help that either.And i say this because you can´t imagine how weird and funny was to be inside an almost sold out  movie theater , listening to comments all around. Normally this is a very annoying thing, but this time i have to admit that it was almost impossible not to joke while watching this movie, such was the amount of BULL@#%& present in the screenplay.Everybody was laughing through out the movie, and i just want to point out some of the great comedy moments in this film that caused that reaction, (not by a particular order)... The patriotic scenes were hilarious ! That scene in the church when Mel Gibson´s son comes to recruit people for the militia and he delivers that ridiculous speech about country and honor must be one of the most funny moments in the entire movie, only surpassed by those moments with the american flag right at the end. That one when Mel Gibson downbeated finds the flag on the saddle and then decides to go and kick the cr@p out of everybody created some of the most funny comments on the audience i ever heard ! And then when he grabs the flag at the end and by himself turns the outcome of the battle around must be one of the worst and most funny moments, since the speech of the american president in INDEPENDENCE DAY. Curiousily by the same director...What´s  wrong with this guy ?! Isn´t he supposed to be German ?! He must be one of the most americanized foreigners in the states since Arnie Swarzenneger !! Never since the ROCKY and RAMBO series, america had released such amount of funny ultra nationalistic crap. With THE PATRIOT , it looks like we´re back at the Ronald Reagan days, the president who loved Rambo !And now all this wave of ultra nationalistic stuff is coming out of the work of a German guy ? And worst of all, this time all this propaganda comes out disguised under a poltically correct cover of more human heroes. Hey, at least Rambo and Rocky claimed immediately that america was the best country in the world. Rolland Emerich movies don´t even have the guts to do that, which makes them even more funny.Anyway, another great comedy moment was the one, when the racist gets saved by the black man. Wow, nobody expected that ! :-) After that some people next to me, comment that if the movie wasn´t such a comedy, they would have gone ! Ok, Roland Emerich is the most cliché guy ever to set foot on Hollywood, but, come on, there are limits !!  And i thought ID4 was bad ! At least ID4 didn´t tryied to be nothing more than just a great popcorn nationalistic movie. THE PATRIOT has such pretentions of being an Historical fresco that it gets exactly the opposite effect. THE PATRIOT has such an amount of clichés, that sometimes it get almost unbearable to keep following this movie. Such amount of clichés that we would need another text like this just to make fun of them.And i´m not even complaining about the English depiction in this movie. It´s of course totally historically unfair, because there are bad and good people everywhere. Altough the english can´t complain much about the cruelty depicted on this movie, because it´s not that farfetched compared to what they did during their British Empire days. It´s not because of this THE PARIOT is a bad movie. It´s because the way the elements are balanced. We never know ,if this is an adventure movie, an Historical, an Epic drama, a propaganda film, or just an action movie. That and the amount of stupid clichés is what sinks it.If it wasn´t for Mel Gibson and a few other secondary actors, this movie would be totaly unberable. They and the technical stuff  saves THE PATRIOT.  Great design, photography and cute special effects.Once again Rolland Emerich delivers another great 'Turkey'. Fun, but totaly empty and ridiculous. Rolland Emerich, has confirmed himself, as some kind of king of 'B' and 'Z' movies, but within the 'A' league. Pretty weird....Anyway, go and see it, and have a few or a lot of laughs, which if you don´t live in America , i can guarantee that you will find this movie extremely funny. And there are still people who believe this is a very realistic historical movie...man... :-)",Null,0,1,7 August 2000
Dark City," Everything that Matrix should have been.
","If there was a thing i truly hated in Matrix, was that everything really important from the plot was revealed in the presentation movie trailer. We even got more than a clue that 'our' reality was an illusion and the true reality was somewhere in a future world. So what was left to discover after that ? Not much, except for more details on what we have guessed from the trailer. Then, all that was left in Matrix, were chases, fights, predictable treasons, more chases and more fights. It seemed like someone in Hollywood was afraid that the american audiences might not understood what was the plot and decided to give away the whole idea in the trailer. Someone in Hollywood was probably scared of having another DARK CITY and then people wouldn´t come to watch another 'very complicated' story.It might sound strange, for me to begin my review of DARK CITY, reviewing Matrix, but this is just to say, how good DARK CITY is. In here we have to keep thinking through out the movie, altough the story is not at all that complicated, in fact by the end it´s very simple. But this movie manages to create a fantastic mistery atmosphere untill everything is revealed. Instead of chases and fighting scenes all the time, this movie gives us small clues, and we spend the whole movie guessing what might happen next and thinking in all the possibilities, contrary to Matrix in all that we are presented with is just more action.Slow, ok, this is a slow movie, wich for a special effects film is something very peculiar and diferent. The effects are here to serve the story and not just to impress the audience. Something very rare in a Hollywood production these days.Visualy DARK CITY is beautiful. Almost as beautiful as the french masterpiece CITY OF THE LOST CHILDREN. I bet Alex Proyas did see this french movie and got inspiration from it to make DARK CITY. Wich isn´t a bad thing at all, because he did create a very unique film on its own. And the idea of that 40´s look is just great. I guess there is nothing bad i can say about DARK CITY. Probably the only minor thing is one of the last battles, wich look like they have come out of some MARVEL COMICS, but that´s ok. In one of the comments posted in IMDB, someone said that this movie was not good because it had no good villains. I guess this is a good example of how the general public is nowadays almost brainwashed by the fast-food Hollywood references and has a very dificult time to accept new ideas.There is nothing wrong with DARK CITY. I even wished it was a bigger movie. I would love to see some director´s cut of this. And it has Jeniffer Conely in it. It seems that she knows how to choose her movies, because she´s great in this one. All the cast is, in fact. And i thought it was great to cast an unknown (at least to me) actor for the leading role, instead of a star. But i bet if Tom Cruise was in this instead of him, this would be a certain hit movie. Then again...People are afraid of thinking so i can´t be sure.Watch DARK CITY with an open mind and be surprised. One of the Best and most original american sci-fi fantasy movies EVER.",Null,0,1,24 August 1999
Independence Day," It couldn´t be much worst than this. A complete piece of junk.
","There´s to ways of  looking at this movie. If  you look at it ,as a film, it´s a complete crap, but as a popcorn movie, this must be a masterpiece. A true blockbuster Hollywood politically correct movie that even braindead people could understand. A producers dream come true.Never since RAMBO 2, such a waste of  celulloid was released throughout the world.But it´s a fun movie nevertheless. To this day i still don´t know if i like this. Sometimes i do, others i hate it. Sometimes i hate myself for having fun watching this piece of #@$& ! And this is what is annoying about this movie.Here in Europe many reviewers wrote that this was a terrible movie that everybody should see just to be able to believe how BAD it is !This is the perfect movie to go see with a bunch of friends and joke about it all the time, because this is truly a bad movie where the most entertaining thing we get from it ,is the moments where we trash it down. And if you don´t live in the United States multiply this fun twice.The story couldn´t have been cheesier and idiotic. This is the bottom of the pit in creativity. The worst ' War of the Worlds ' rip-off ever ! This couldn´t have been worst written or imagined ! H.G.Wells must be turning in his grave till this day. Instead of developing the great potential ideas that could have been done with a story like this, they choose to focus on the patriotic stuff ( !!!!??? ).  Man, what a puke !The fun thing about it, was that this movie gave a bigger contribute to create a bad image of America abroad than the whole RAMBO series put together instead !And talk about predictiblity ! This story is so predictable it is boring to watch despite the magnnificent  aerial batlle scenes in it.Not to speak of the way the aliens were defeated ! I won´t even comment on that ! Pure hollywood at his worst !Nevertheless it´s a fun cinematic junk. If you don´t mind acting like a brainded for two hours, this is fun to watch. If you love Cinema and you´re a masochist, you´re going to love this, because it will make you suffer with pleasure.See it and speak bad about it later. Absolute cinematic garbage.",1,18,34,19 May 1999
The Princess Bride," A forgotten MASTERPIECE of High Fantasy !
","This is simply a beautiful MASTERPIECE of fantasy. This is THE perfect fantasy movie. Excellent story, brilliant and original casting, great humor, perfect set design, amazing figthing choreography, enchanting soundtrack, excellent special effects (because we don´t notice them) and a great direction from Rob Reiner setting the perfect pace for a story like this. I really liked the departure from the normal Dungeons and Dragons formula of fantasy to a more fairy tale aproach. Very original and a very brave thing to try, in a time where the movie audiences seem to think fantasy have to be something with big muscled man holding big swords and slashing people, Conan the Barbarian style.It really bothers me when i read people saying this fairy tale type of movie is just for kids. I bet this are the same people who think a movie with lots of guns, shootings and cardboard villains are a very adult thing. Oh boy... I´m 29 and i love this movie. I can´t even believe this is a Hollywood production !How come no more movies like this were ever made ?! Then again, in a place where things like ID4 are huge a success i can see why there is only one PRINCESS BRIDE.PRINCESS BRIDE is a magnificent movie. Watch it along with, LADY HAWKE, LEGEND, NEVERENDING STORY and even KRULL, and you´ll be watching the best in fantasy ever made.",Null,0,0,25 August 1999
Event Horizon," One of the BEST sci-fi movies in ten years ! They don´t make them like this anymore.
","This movie steals ideas from so many movies, that everybody involved in it should be in jail ! But is this a bad thing ? Not at all !It would be bad if all this amount of rip-offs were badly used, but they´re not. They´re very well blended giving the movie a strange unique atmosphere, that we know doesn´t belong to it. But it works great !The only thing i didn´t like about ' Event Horizon ', was that i would like to see more at the end. It ended too fast for my taste while it promissed much exploration.But that´s fine because the end, although totaly cliché, works just fine for this movie. I wasn´t expecting it to be any different, when the movie was such a mix of stolen bits from others. Anyone who expected otherwise is more of an idiot, than this movie has been called by the american critics.Here in Europe, this movie was considered in many reviews, the best american sci-fi movie in 10 years, along with ' Contact '. And i couldn´t agree more.Nowadays it seems that there are no more good scifi movies produced in Hollywood. No more ' Dune ', ' 2010 ', ' Alien ', ' Blade Runner ', ' Aliens ' , ' The Abyss ' and the same goes for horror movies.They just don´t scare people anymore. They´re always just about a bunch of teenagers being butchered even when the movie starts by promissing some good ideas. Today they just make us jump on our seats, repeating the same scenes over and over. They don´t frighten us anymore.I can´t remember when i felt afraid watching an american horror movie. Sin ce ' Friday the 13th ', they all became a joke. Probably the last scary one was the first ' Poltergeist ' back in 83. ( in part because i was 13 ) Since then everything has been a laugh.Until ' Event Horizon ' came along. I don´t care what they say about it in the states. This is a very good horror movie. The best in years, and an excelent scifi adventure with very solid and believable special effects.The atmosphere is perfect and it makes us feel really uncomfortable sometimes. It´s that what frighten us, not the usual scares. You´ll choke, eating popcorns and watching this !The gothic production design is magnificent although We can see were the designers got inspiration from, but its an excellent work. The soundtrack is excellent with very creepy moments and great use of silence. The sound is perfect too.The actors should be proud of their work, because all have very believable characters, even when they have small parts.I´ve seen an interview with Lawrence Fishburn, in a program about the worst movies of the year. The reporter jokes about how crap ' Event Horizon ' was and i couldn´t believe what i was seeing, because Laurence F. almost apologises and asks for pardon for being in this movie !! The only thing i can say is that the Hollywood system really sucks. The reporter made it sound like if, the actor did another film like this, his career could be in danger. And i only could think, WHY ?!! There is nothing wrong with this movie people !I even think this is a great achievement, the way their creators stole from every place, but they managed to make a fantastic supernatural traditional ghost movie. Replace the starship with an old house, and we get the same effect. An excellent horror movie.' Event Horizon ' should be praised for this, not put down, like it was done in the states.I bet if the makers of this movie, had replaced the adult cast, with a bunch of cool teenagers and called it ' SCREAM in Space ! ', this would have been a major hit and we would already be watching part 2 right now. Because that seems to be the actual trend in Hollywood this days. I don´t have nothing against a good popcorn movie. The ' SCREAM ' movies are great and very fun to watch, but why thrash another good movie just because it tries to do something diferent for a change ?Space is an excellent place to haunt. Let´s have some more ghosts in there please. Forget the aliens.This is the way to make a good product out of stolen ideas. Producers, take note.",10,1,3,8 May 1999
The Big Blue," The best special effect of ' Big Blue ' is its freedom.
","This is the movie of my life !I never before saw a film that i could identify myself so much with. I´m lucky enough to live in a place near the sea very similar and as beautiful as those in the movie and the opening scenes always remind me of my teenage years and the waters i explored like young Jaqques Mayol does in the beginning of the movie. Things that i still do. So i immediatley related to the character and its love for the ocean.I guess that´s the beauty of this movie. It makes us feel that we could be any of its characters, because they´re so real. We almost can´t believe that they don´t exist outside of the movie. This is an amazing ,beautifuly well written ,acted, photographed and directed movie ! It carries us into an extraordinary world, and it´s our world !! (mine at least to some point) Not some hollywood depiction of reality !But what it´s about it ? This is the worst thing anyone can ask about this movie.I would hate to be the guy who had to publicize this in USA. And i can see why it failed there.But what can i say about it?... That it´s the story of two friends who compete to find out who´s best ?...It´s more than that ! That it´s a love story ? It goes beyond every love story ! That it´s an adventure ? You bet it is ! But it has no action, no chases,no dangerous cliffangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn´t even has bad guys ! Or good guys in fact. That it´s a travel or a road movie ? Probably. This movie has better locations than any James Bond movie will ever get and they´re all real !But they don´t matter much compared to the characters in the film. The characters then... There´s a hero right ?... Well there´s two of them. Two men. But they´re not heroes.Probably the hero is a woman who sacrifices her happiness for love. So, there´s a woman and two men. There´s got to be a love triangle there to cause all those love story rivalary subplots, right ? Well, there´s a love triangle, but there aren´t subplots attached to it. In fact the love triangle has more than three people. All characters are a part of it realy. Including dolphins ! Even the ocean.Aha ! So this is some sort of a kinky erotic and exotic movie thing ? Wrong ! There´s sex in it, but not in that way at all.It´s a comedy then... You´ll laugh, but you´ll cry too. It´s a drama ... Not in the conventional cliché way. Not at all. A dramatic comedy... Nope !It´s a sci-fi film !... Well there´s scientists in it, and deep underwater, and even under ice diving scenes, but it´s not a scifi film, although the American 'version' Movie Trailler presented it like if it were some new esotheric adventure underwater sci-fi horror movie, when in fact it is not.So what is this movie about ?!!It´s about what you want it to be. About what you´re feeling. It´s that open. You just have to feel it.As Luc Besson said in an interview, at some point in the movie he was stuck, because he didn´t know how to carry the audience inside.Then the real Jaqques Mayol, who worked in the film as a diving and story consultant took Besson diving with him one day and made him experience the sea in his way. Then Besson understood that he didn´t had to explain anything to the audience. He just had to make people feel what it was like !And boy, did he make it ! The atmosphere in this movie goes beyond words. It has to be felt ! Also the soundtrack is out of this world and trully magical.To me this film is about love, but in a much deeper meaning than the usual. Beyond race, beyond gender, beyond sex, beyond nationality. Love as an emotion. And about freedom !So get a wide screen TV and a full blast surround. This movie is the reason to buy one if you don´t have it! Believe me ! And watch it in the dark.Try to get the european full version of the movie. The american is not that terrible, the feeling is there, but it´s diferent from the original.This movie is a masterpiece ! ( in any version )",10,147,190,6 May 1999
Mission: Impossible II," And i thought THE PATRIOT was bad !!! ...
","Warning ! This might contain a spoiler or two... Warning ! Stay away from this movie, it´s real bad !I never thought a big action blockbuster, coming out of  Hollywood, could be like this. This movie is BORING ! It was the worst action movie i ever saw. I wasn´t expecting much out of it, but i sure wasn´t expecting it to be BORING ! What´s wrong with this movie ?!It´s totaly uninteresting. The plot was already done a million times, and it seemed more like a rejected draft script from a James Bond movie than actualy a finished work. And the latest 007, was also a boring empty shell, but not as much as MI-2 is. This is almost unbelievable ! It begun pretty bad, with the usual 'classical' car duel, between the hero and the movie babe. Everything was in place as usual, including the hanging above the abyss, race outcome, seen a million times in all the 007. And the initial seduction scenes, oh well... The villains are nothing more than a collection of clichés from James Bond, only this time, without any charisma or interest whatsoever, ruing all the threat. The bad guys are just there to loose, and that´s clear right from the begining. Even if it wasn´t, Tom Cruise´s character is so undestructible, that ruins any chance of suspence. There´s never a moment in this movie, where we feel Ethan Hunt is in danger. We already know that he´s going to make it out alive ,in a very cool and spectacular way. The audience just waits for the next spectacular scene to happen. And i loved the way, the bad guys waited for him to put his shades on, before they start shooting, after all, after MATRIX, what the public wants is to see coolness. New action heroes don´t even have to be brave, just be cool. And by the way, how come this movie looks like a fashion-world commercial most of the time ?! In some scenes i was even expecting to see a shampoo Logo right across the screen. It´s hilarious !The suspence scenes had no suspence. That one in the race track was already done everywhere else. The shooting action scenes were empty and impersonal, with lots of bullets flying through the air, with bad guys shooting security guards and Tom Cruise shooting anywhere. And all this filmed in such a politically correct way that it made everything look phoney. All this amount of action, which was only spectacular and nothing else, reminded me of a big budget episode of The A-TEAM. Lots of shooting but no blood , or realistic killing scenes. While at the same time it pretends to be a very serious spy thriller. . This is the type of movie that gives children the idea that shooting people doesn´t hurt. And this gets even more dangerous because this movie was trimmed to be so politicaly correct, to aim at that particular audience. The only audiences that are going to take something out of it, are the young audiences of millions of early teens or more physically mature but braindead popcorn eaters,  who are going to think this is a great movie because of the cars, the bikes, and because it looks cool.This movie gets so boring, that it even repeats the same scene with Tom Cruise hanging from cables like in the first episode. We can see this is going to be a trade mark, and i can´t wait to see where they are going to do it next time. The scenes where there is no action are boring, because the characters are just made of plastic. That so-called love story, gets ridiculous, because it´s just there as a set up for something we know it´s going to happen later, and it´s never credible. Anyway all this gets totally redundant, because despite the outcome of the love story, we can already guess, that the girl is going to get killed right at the beginning of MI-3, because Tom Cruise is going to need another Bond Gir..., sorry girlfriend next time. So who cares !The secondary good guy characters do nothing on this movie, and are there just to make Tom Cruise look good, wich is a shame because they could have been great characters, if this MI had kept the team spirit of the original series, instead of becoming a new super hero movie. By the way, if you liked Thandie Newton, who plays the girl, check the movie BELOVED, where you can really see what a fantastic actress she is. There is nothing wrong with the actors on MI-2, the only problem is that they are all limited by this screenplay for children. But Tom Cruise must have had plenty of fun.And if you want to go see this movie, because you´re a John Woo fan, forget it. This isn´t a John Woo movie. It´s just a movie he was hired to do. What´s left here is a strange mix between something that sometimes wants to be a John Woo film, but never allowed and some shampoo commercial.A terrible, terrible movie. The only thing good about it, are the masks. Which i´m sure John Woo must be wearing one right now, hoping his fans won´t hit him to much for creating such a Hollywood product.If you want to see a great american John Woo, see FACE OFF instead. That´s everything MI-2 should have been.",Null,0,0,8 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001 is not the Graal ! Stop looking at this as if it is Sacred !
","This might sound strange for me to begin this review with the same words i´ve used to comment on 2010, but i can´t help it because no matter what the purists might say i still think both are excelelnt movies despite their obvious diferences. Both were movies of its time.Somehow it seems that for some people 2001 has become a religion, a thing so sacred that it´s almost a blasphemy just even mention anything about it. This seem to be the same persons who attack 2010. Normally not even for the movie, but just because it almost seems a crime for someone even to think of touch the magnificence of 2001, like if Man wanted to be compared with God.2001 is just a movie people! Nothing more! A piece of imprinted celuloid ! Stop treating it as a religious artifact ! It´s a fantastic movie no doubt and probably one of the most inovative films since CITIZEN KANE, but it´s just that. One great movie. And i bet that most of the people who worship 2001 now, probably hated it the first time they saw it. Didn´t even understood it i bet ! Only this days it´s very fashionable and shows a sign of great intelligence to like this movie, so everybody must 'like' 2001, or be looked upon as an idiot.Some complain that 2010 is a movie for idiots, because it explains all the mysteries from 2001, one by one in detail, leaving no margin for the religious aspect of the original. But people tend to forget that the original story writen by A.C.CLARKE, was just a very scientific tale totaly deprived of emotions as he intended to write it specifically as scientific and technologic exercize, as he said in many interviews.It was the audiences who 'created' that religious aspect, because they started to look at the aliens as almost divine creatures, because they couldn´t understand such an advanced scientifc concept for an advanced race. Arthur C. must be very pleased with this until this day, because it only proved true his famous phrase about an advanced technical creation being understood and perceived as magic, by some less technical advanced cultures. This was exactly how the audiences started to look at the aliens from this story.Anyway this is a great movie. A festival of special effects a million times better than Star Wars-Episode 1. In 2001, the effects are used to create an enviroment and aren´t throwned at our faces every minute. Star wars is fun, but 2001 is as pleasant to watch as any George Lucas saga. You just have to have to like good science fiction and not be afraid of thinking during a movie. In fact part of the fun in this movie is thinking about it.A movie way ahead of its time. In the 60´s and in our days for sure.Don´t miss it.",Null,1,4,25 August 1999
The Legend of 1900," TITANIC has just sunk even deeper. This is how it should have been done.
","I cannot believe i didn´t went to see this movie at the theaters ! THE LEGEND OF 1900, is one of the most beautiful and poetic movies in a very long time, (with the exception of Magnolia wich is also fantastic, but in a different style). But this one has one of the most unexpected and original stories i ever saw in a  movie. But what is realy difficult to describe is the feeling which this movie conveys. It has an atmosphere of an haunted fairy tale but in a very poetic way, turning even the most normal events into some kind of enchanted moment. The movie is directed by Giusepe Tornatore the Italian director who created one of the most beautiful movies of all time, Cinema Paradiso. Strangely enough this was one of the reasons i didn´t went to see The Legend of 1900 at the theaters. I thought that after Cinema Paradiso, there was no way, the same director would be able to create another movie like that. Man, was i wrong !I loved The Legend of 1900 so much, that i don´t know what i like best anymore. I think i only seen a story as poetic as this before and that was in Cinema Paradiso.I´m not going to talk about the plot of 1900 because you can read it in all the other reviews. What i just want to say is that this movie has just sunk Titanic even deeper, for it has all the emotion and strengh that  James Cameron never did achieve in his movie and being similar movies in atmosphere i think it´s fair to make a comparison and it´s also fair to say that THE LEGEND OF 1900, is far emotionaly superior to TITANIC in every aspect and every detail of its story. This movie is everything i was expecting to find in TITANIC and it was´t there.I wish i could do justiçe in describing how beautiful The Legend of 1900 is, but this is one of those things you have to see for yourself to really appreciate, because i guess there are no words to describe, the poetry of so many of the scenes in this movie. The moment when 1900 falls in love is truly undiscribable. The way in which music is used in this story is simply a work of genius. And this soundtrack wipes the floor with all the comercial c**p that appears nowadays in the Hollywood movies.The Legend of 1900 is to Music what Cinema Paradiso was to Cinema. Tornatore has done it again ! And as love stories go, this is one of the best i ever seen. Giuseppe Tornatore seems to have this gift to realy create extraordinary beautiful love stories without making them into  Hollywood soaps and this is very rare this days.And it´s not only the story that makes this such a good film to watch. Visualy its also trully impressive and glamorous. The production design and photography in this movie creates incredible visuals. Some scenes even look like classic paintings coming to life. And the cast is fantastic. I won´t name anyone in particular because all deliver a truly fantastic ensemble performance. Giuseppe Tornatore has created another unforgettable classic, that i can bet will be truly recognized as the mastepiece it is in years to come.Unfortunately, because it isn´t an Hollywood product, the movie didn´t had the publicity or distribution, it deserved, and so i guess not many people got the chance to see it at theaters, but hey, it´s now out on DVD and in an incredible high technical quality edition (at least in region2) so please go and rent this movie. Buy it , in fact because you won´t regret it. And if you have a widescreen tv and a surround sound, you´ll go nuts with this film.It´s movies like this that prove how fake the Oscars are. THE LEGEND OF 1900 is a masterpiece.",Null,0,0,21 November 2000
Jaws," One of the best sea movies ever !
","It´s hilarious how the age classication in movies has changed over the years.I remember when JAWS first came out, it received the most restricted age classification, (here in Portugal, and i´m sure everywhere). I was about 6 or 7 years at the time, and i remember that you only could get in to see this movie, if you were older than 18, (like in ALIEN). Anyone younger than 19 wasn´t allowed in the theater, ( i remember watching people with their ID cards, buying tickets). Each time i looked at that JAWS poster i got extremely curious, but i knew that i would be real afraid of watching it.How things change. Now we look at JAWS and i´m sure now that it´s re-released in DVD for it´s 25th aniversary, with a 15 certificate, only because it´s the politicaly correct classification, because if it wasn´t for that i bet it would get a PG certificate at the most, such is the lightness of those now famous gore scenes that seemed too creepy so many adult people back in the 70´s.I don´t know if there is anyone on this movie-planet that hasn´t seen JAWS yet, but i´m speaking for those very few of you, who are still afraid. JAWS it´s NOT an horror movie, it´s an ADVENTURE movie set at sea !JAWS has less gore than any INDIANA JONES !In fact, i remember how disappointed i got ,when i saw it for the first time. After all those horror expectations from when i was a kid, JAWS turned out to be a very regular light adventure movie instead. I even thought i watched a cutted version of the movie, because i was expecting to see people getting eaten to pieces on screen and it was nothing like that. Instead of a gore movie, i got an adventure with great, positive and funny characters. Hey, i could have watched this movie when i was a kid and not get much frightened ! :-)After my inital 'disappointment', i watched JAWS plenty of other times, and each time it grew on me a little more. Perhaps because i love the sea and this remains one of the best sea movies of all time. Right now what i find trully amazing in JAWS is the way in which fools the viewer into thinking he has seen more violence and gore than what actualy shows. To me this is the great achievment in this picture. I read somewhere that Spielberg´s initial intention was to show lots more of the shark, but he had no budget and the rubber shark looked fake, so he decided to create suspanse instead of visuals.Thank all gods that this movie was made in the 70´s, because if it was today, i´m sure it would only become another hollywood blockbuster filled with special effects, and a big pretty computer generated shark chewing on everybody. In fact i guess Spielberg did this modern 'JAWS', it´s called ' JURASSIC PARK' and 'LOST WORLD', which are a pretty good example of how lots of special effects can make a boring and empty movie, specialy if you see it more than once. I can bet, no one will release a 25th anniversary edition of JURASSIC PARK years from now.So once again it´s proved that lack of money equals imagination. JAWS looks so great because of it. If you haven´t seen it yet, you don´t know what you´re missing. Go see it, rent it, or buy the new incredible DVD 25th anniversary edition which has lots of extra stuff, including a 50 minute making off.And watch it with your kids, so they can see how chicken their parents were, for being affraid of going to see a movie that nowadays could be screened in a kids matineé. Actually,  it should be.  :-)",Null,0,1,27 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Finaly a real horror movie ! I thought they were extinct !
","I went to see this, not expecting to much, and although i stayed away from all the reviews, magazine articles and all that stuff because i knew this movie had a real surprise ending, i still wasn´t totally convinced that THE SIXTH SENSE would be more than just a few scares. When i left the theater, i was totaly marvelled by what i had just seen. This movie had restored my faith in american horror movies once again, something i thought it wouldn´t happen in a million years, after having to put up with endless Freddy Krugger, Jason and countless horror teen movies. I was totally convinced that Hollywood had just abandoned adult scary horror forever.  For years i wished i could watch another, THE CHANGELING, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, THE HAUNTING (the original), even the first POLTERGEIST. Finally after seeing there were no horror movies anymore, just, teen-make-you-jump-on-the-chair-with-loud-music-flics, i wasn´t totally convinced THE SIXTH SENSE was going to be as good as it promised. I was wrong.Of course i guess everybody has already seen it by now, so those of you who also love the movie, know what i´m talking about. So what can i say, that hasn´t been said ?...That the story is fantastic, the atmosphere is perfect and the actors are great ? Well this doesn´t begin to describe how good this movie is. And for those people who still insist that the plot has holes, i suggest you go see it again, because i´m sure you must have seen it only once, or you didn´t paid enough atention the second time. There are no holes in this plot. This is a brilliant and detailled screenplay with the precision of a swiss clock. It´s funny how most of the people who complain about the plot holes in this movie are the same who claim that the middle of the movie is empty and too much slow paced. Maybe if those persons,  had paid atention to the details instead of waiting for an action scene they would noticed how crammed with plot clues and attention to eventual plot holes this movie is, particulary in the 'empty' scenes. There are no plot holes in THE SIXTH SENSE, and even just for this this movie deserved to be praised. By the way, check the DVD for more on this if you still think the plot is wrong, maybe this will convince you.Anyway, what more can i say ? This movie is a modern masterpiece, and one of the greatest real horror movies of all time. And it doesn´t have special effects, buckets of blood, gore or action scenes in it. Just a good story and a creepy atmosphere through out. This is how you do an horror movie.I hope somebody in Hollywood is taking notes, because i would love to see more like this. I want to see more like this. This is what horror movies are all about.",Null,0,0,10 August 2000
Final Destination," WE´RE ALL GONNA DIE !!!!
","Yes, there are plenty of plot holes in this movie, yes it´s another teen slasher, yes the ending has to much special effects and no decent plot. But... Despite all this... The idea is excellent and not so badly developed as it looks, the usual 'teen-clichés' never get over the  story just to fill screen time, there are no f@#%-up dudes slashing teens with knifes, the deaths are original although by the end they got totally predictable (this is a Hollywood teen flic after all), the movie sometimes can get very uncomfortable because it has a brilliant dark creepy atmosphere, and despite all the shallow action and plot dumbness FINAL DESTINATION, still can put people talking about its theme. Death and destiny. Because in the middle of all that sometimes Hollywood mess, this story still raises interesting questions. And creepy ones also, it was great to listen to the unconfortable silence people were making in the theater sometimes where some questions were being pointed out in the movie. SCREAM didn´t do that at all, because couldn´t care less about the plot, we just wanted to see the next babe getting slashed. So in my opinion FINAL DESTINATION, is the best teen-movie around, altohugh i think it´s unfair to classify it like that, because despite all the flaws this still is a more intelligent movie than all the rest. After all, if it hadn´t a teen cast, nobody would think to compare it, with all the teen movies around. In fact i would love to see a more 'mature' version of  this with an all adult cast, altough it might got ruined if it had Big Hollywood names on it, because a great thing in this teen cast is that there are no Hollywood big stars in it. Just recognizable faces, and this gives much more credibility, to the story, if you let yourself get carried away by the atmosphere, and forget about the 'little things' for a minute. Nobody was complaining in the SCREAM movies ,right ? So why attack FINAL DESTINATION, because of that ?This is a very good comercial movie. The best teen movie in years. It has a good idea, good atmosphere, it can make you wonder about your own destiny, and it´s fun to watch. Ok, i know the ending sucks, but well...maybe next time.Overall, i don´t think this movie is a bad one. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 and THE PATRIOT. Now here´s to awful and empty movies. But i don´t see many people complaining about those. Go watch FINAL DESTINATION instead. Good movie.But after this i´ll never get near an airplane, or a car, or a computer, or a house, or a...my god we´re trapped ! We´re all gonna die !!! Brrrrrr :-)",Null,0,1,10 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It was great...a long, long time ago.
","I first saw STAR WARS, way back in 1977. I was 7 at the time and of course i was totally blown away by the experience. Needless to say that i watched it again during the years everytime i got the chance. Then video appeared. By now i must have watched this at least 50 or 60 times. I still love it, but of course i just don´t get to feel the magic the same way anymore. And i realy miss that.One of the things that contributed to my disappointment with STAR WARS, was when i read a series of 'forggoten' books writen by an american sci-fi writer called E.E.DOC.SMITH. This guy for those of you who don´t know, was the man who invented the whole concept of the genre, in wich STAR WARS is included, an area of sci-fi, known as Space-Opera. Giant space battle cruisers, lazers, light swords, young heroes, space mercenaries, robots ,evil cyborg villains and space battles the way we know them. ALL these were invented by E.E.DOC.SMITH way back in the early 30´s up untill late 40´s, when he created a series called 'LENSMAN', that you might even heard of because there is a Manga movie made out of them. Anyway this guy, was the TOLKIEN of sci-fi, Space-Opera. Every cliché we now know, because of the STAR WARS movies, was invented by E.E.DOC.SMITH in the 1930´s. He created everything !Among his books writen in the 30´s, there is a particular serie called 'LORD TEDRIC'. This was one of his 'forgotten' works, because at the time of writing, it was no more than pulp fiction and nobody took it seriously because nobody except kids read science fiction these days. And so it got forgotten during the years. What is so amazing about 'LORD TEDRIC' books, is that, we find, a young farm boy who becomes a hero, a space mercenary who becomes his friend, an alien cantina, two robots, a giant battlestation the size of a planet which is a sphere and blasts planets with a giant ray gun, an old mystic master, a frisky courageous princess, a villain which rules the sphere and he´s half man half machine, dresses in black and wears a mask and a cape, called FRA-VILLION (two names. ring a bell ?) and most impressive of all a strange FORCE wich is the basis of the story, (only this one is artificial and scientific). Anyway, there is much more but i guess everybody gets the point by now. Read the 'LORD TEDRIC-THE BLACK KNIGHT' by E.E.DOC.SMITH for example if anybody is doubting this.This was what disappoints me in STAR WARS this days. Are all these things in 'LORD TEDRIC' books just an incredible coincidence ?! Even the trading politics from the new Star Wars movie is present in those books.And George Lucas sued BATTLESTAR GALACTICA for imitating STAR WARS ?!!!I still love STAR WARS, and im glad they keep doing some more movies, but i just don´t think much about the imagination of George Lucas anymore. My first disappointment was with WILLOW, which followed exactly the same formula of STAR WARS, then i read 'LORD TEDRIC' and i couldn´t believe what i was reading. Anyway, i still think STAR WARS is a very good movie, which everybody should see at least once. And despite all this years it still isn´t dated. Only the good movies are like that. So i don´t think it´s that terrible as some people think.But i would love for someone to ask George Lucas, about DOC SMITH´s books.Coincidence or not, but im very curious.",Null,0,0,24 August 1999
Princess Mononoke," Everything a movie should be. This is true cinema.
","After the recent invasion of Dragon Balls and Pokemons, somehow i had in my mind the idea that this was going to be another commercial crappy manga for kids. Despite that i decided to go see it and check for myself why the movie reviewers where praising this movie so much, rating it FIVE stars out of five.Unfortunately, in my country, (Portugal), this movie is playing only once a day in the early afternoons. As usual in Portugal, animation is treated all equal. Animated movies >little kids, and so this movie plays here in the few theaters that bought it (4 ), right about after lunch in little children time slot. What is realy amazing, is that i´m sure the Portuguese distributors of PRINCESS MONONOKE even saw the movie, because if they did, they would notice, (or perhaps not), that this is not a movie for little children. First because there are some very explicit gore scenes, where arms and heads are chopped off occasionally  along the whole movie, there´s violence (and i don´t mean just action violence), reference to more adult themes, (plenty of the female characters are ex-prostitutes) and a few more details like this.I don´t have any problem in taking any kid to see a story like this, but i´m sure there are a bunch of conservative parents out there, that by this time have just forbidden their kids of watching Pokemon, thinking that somehow Mangas are all the same.But PRINCESS MONONOKE isn´t a kids movie just because of this. Above all ,it´s because of its plot and storyline wich gets to complex for little kids to follow. One thing that amused me a lot, was watching some kids in the front row, totally confused because they couldn´t figure out who were the bad guys ! Others were totally bored and only paid real atention to the movie in the action scenes complaining all the time the movie was boring and not very easy to understand.In fact, actually, this movie has probably the best screenplay currently displayed in any movie right now. I wish i could find a non-animated movie out there at this moment with a screenplay capable of touching this one in quality and complexity. Not Mission Impossible for sure. ( And then it´s the animation films who are considered ,stuff for kids ! :-) )I won´t get in the story of PRINCESS MONONOKE because part of pleasure of watching this movie, is going to see it without any clue whatsoever. I´m just going to say, it´s a very ecological movie, set in medieval china (i guess), and where spirits and anything magical, is treated like just another thing made by Mother Nature and not like some supernatural characters that we usualy find everywhere. There are no real heroes in here, and no real bad guy in sight. It´s a slow paced movie, with a brilliant animation, a very intimist plot, a little bit of crude violence (but depicted in a very 'natural' way, not just there to show off), excelent characters, fantastic landscapes and a pretty good soundtrack that goes almost unoticed. And this movie is BIG. It´s not your regular 75/80 minutes for kids. PRINCESS MONONOKE plays for about 130 minutes.If you like Manga, (and i don´t mean Dragon Ball), real Manga like AKIRA, or WINGS OF HONEAMISE, you can´t miss this movie, because it´s actualy a brilliant movie. Definetely one of the best this year. If you are a fan ,of an old Manga movie called WARRIORS OF THE WIND, then PRINCESS MONONOKE is from the same director, and the style is more or less the same. I read this director is not going to make any more manga movies , (WHY?!!), and that this was his goodbye to animation features. :-(Well let me tell you, this is what we can call, going out in style ! Brilliant movie, (just not for every audiences).Don´t miss it.",Null,1,2,27 July 2000
